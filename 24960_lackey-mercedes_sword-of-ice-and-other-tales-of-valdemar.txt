introduction my very first published story in was a piece for marion zimmer bradleys friends of darkover anthology free amazons of darkover at the time although i was working on what would become the first of a series of fifteen novels with no end in sight i never thought that i would be in the position to do as marion had done and open up my world for other professionals to tinker with and yet ten years later here it is the friends of valdemar anthology some of the stories here are by names you will recognize some by authors you will not but the one thing that unites them all is that somewhere along the line they actually enjoyed my work enough to want to add their own touches to the world that i created several of the authors in this book are proteges of mine and have cowritten other things with me some are proteges of mine and have had work published that i had no hand in which is to any teacher a source of great pleasure you always hope that the student goes beyond what you can teach and finds his or her own way own voice and own creations that you have no direct part in and it is entirely possible that one or more of the authors in this volume will one day find him or herself playing host and editor to a book of stories set in a world he or she has created and when that happens i hope that they think of me and ask me to come play too sunlancer by philip m austin and mercedes lackey philip austin writes misty lackey is the one who made this story come alive she deserves the majority of the credit and all my thanks she has been a good friend and mentor shes been helpful in so many ways through her good offers ive been able to dream of a future a creative future that dream is worth more than any monetary reward mercedes lackey was born in chicago and has worked as a lab assistant security guard and computer programmer before turning to fiction writing her first bookarrows of the queenthe first hi the valdemar series was published in she won the lambda award formagics priceand science fiction book club book of the year for thethe elvenbanecoauthored with andre norton along with her husband larry dixon she is a federally licensed bird rehabilitator specializing in birds of prey she shares her home with a menagerie of parrots cats and a schutzhund trained german shepherd clarrin mulpar knelt below his open window and raised his face to the rising sun he closed his eyes and felt the warmth of its rays against his cheeks watched the inside of his eyelids turn as red as the robes of vkandis priests the sun was a pressure against his skin as real as the pressure against his heart vkandis sunlord he prayed hear me and guide me in what i must do redpriestess beakasi tells us we do your will and biddingshould i believe her she tells m that it is your will that we take the young ones that your miracles show her the ones to test for your service must i believe her sunlord all life comes by your gift to live in your light is the old teaching passed from generation to generation but is this what you meant vkandis sunlord what must i do give me a sign he lowered his outstretched arms letting the rays of the sun bathe him but although they warmed his body they did not touch the cold in his heart nor did they ease his worry and confusion for the first time in his life he doubted no he told himself firmly no i do not doubt the sunlord i doubt those who speak in his name i doubt that what they call upon me to do is truly his will and he knew exactly where to place the blame for that doubtif blame was precisely the right thing to call it squarely in the lap of that scholarscribe with the terrible eyes the guest of his grandfather and as such sacrosanct the man had been there when he arrived last night they seemed to be old friends and grandfather had introduced him as such clarrin found the man to be a fascinating storyteller and the three of them had conversed long into the night in the garden pavilion wherenow that he thought about itno one could creep up upon them to listen without being seen and it was the scholars questions that had made him doubt captain clarrin mulpar is a wise man i have no doubt the scribe said in accentless flowing karaite that even a priest would envy as well as a man trusted in the temples service i value wisdom and i seek answers answers to questions a man such as the captain may be able to give me as he sat there completely at ease in the low couch boots crossed at the ankles and elbows resting on knees his eyes never left the face of the captain of the temple lancers clarrin wondered what in heaven or earth he was reading there he never had learned to completely school his expression but he had tried not to betray his uneasiness what are your questions good sir he replied forcing himself to return the scribes direct gaze although you grant me more wisdom than i would claim i will do my best to answer you my first question is thisand pray do not take offense for i am a foreigner and i mean none the scholar said with a smile that looked honest leaning forward a little to speak are the miracles performed by your priests and priestesses true miracles or are they actually magic clarrin licked his lips and answered carefully vkandis forbids the practice of magic he replied sternly it was by his will that magic was driven out of the land his miracles ensure that we of karse need no magic and aid his holy ones to keep magic from our borders the scribe did not seem particularly disturbed by the implied rebuke he sipped at the pleasant fruity wine with appreciation examined the crystal goblet that contained it for a moment then looked up through the latticework of the pavilions roof at the stars only then did he look back at clarrin spoken as a true warrior of the temple he said with another of those enigmatic smiles yeti have been in other lands rethwellan hardorn even valdemar i have seen those who claim to be practitioners of magic perform feats precisely the same as those that vkandis priests perform does the sunlord grant these people the power to work miracles as well clarrin carefully set his goblet down on the low table they all shared heated words rising in him i have not seen these marvels that you claim to have seen scribe he replied his anger giving his voice a distinct edge so i may make no judgment but his grandfather frowned sharp words he chided grandson you come close to dishonoring my granted guestright with your sharp tongue clarrin flushed this time with embarrassment he might be thirty summers old but this was the man who had raised him and the brighteyed old fellow did right to remind him of the courtesies owed a guest of the house i am well rebuked old owl he replied with a bow of apology to the scribe and a smile of affection for the wizened old man you remind me of the proper way to answer our guest he turned to the scribe i apologize for my discourteous reply sir and to answer your question with strict truth i do not know i have no knowledge of magic and have never seen any who practice it we are taught that it is all trickery in any case that the miracles of vkandis alone are no deceit the priests would tell you that this magic you have seen is nothing more than cleverness and misdirection the scribe smiled giving clarrin the slight bow of scholartoscholar wordlessly telling clarrin that he had shown wisdom by admitting his ignorance clarrin flushed again this time feeling pleased and flattered now this the scribe said lightly this is a moment of true mens pleasure to sip good wine hi a beautiful garden on a clear summers night discussing the mysteries of the world among men who can face truth and enter debate with open minds no apologies are needed for all three of us are men who can acknowledge that we can speak the truth only as we see it and the truth is a crystal with many facets a night bird began a liquid plaintive song just as the scribe finished speaking the scribe halfclosed his eyes to listen and out of courtesy all of them remained quiet until it had finished and flew away the ovan has other pleasures in mind tirens mulpar damns grandfather said wryly he calls a mate clarrin and the scribe both chuckled ah the scribe replied and have you never heard the tale of the scholars mate both indicated ignorance and he told them a roguish story of a priestly scholar who so loved to read hi bed that he filled half of his bed with books and heavy scrolls every night leaving an impression on the mattress that looked as if someone had been asleep there this continued until his superior spied upon him to catch him in the act of bringing in a prohibited female and caught him only with a mistress made of paper with the atmosphere lightened the scribe leaned forward once more and clarrin told himself to keep his temper in check anticipating another unpleasantly direct question he was not wrong another question comes to my mind the scholar said the faithful are granted healing of ills and new injuries in the temple and it is true healing for i have seen the results of it this is said to be another miracle of the sunlord is this not true clarrin nodded warily yes i have received the sunlords gift myself as a young lancer i was arrowstruck during our foray into menmellith to relieve the true believers trapped there he tapped his left leg to indicate the site of the old wound one of the priests laid hands upon the wound and drew out the arrow and there was neither blood nor wound after only a scar as if the injury had occurred weeks hi the past i am glad that you were healed that you may still serve the scribe replied yetforgive me but in other lands there are healers as well in fact in every land i have ever been or even read of there are healers of the flesh in valdemar they are even gathered together at an early age and taught at a great school called a collegium we gather those granted the healers touch by the sunlord and teach them in the temple clarrin began but stopped when the scribe held up a finger true enough but the healers in valdemar are not taught in a temple for there are many beliefs in their land not one the scribe said earnestly when these healers are proficient in their work they are given green clothing to wear so that they may be recognized and heeded they go where they are needed and all may come to them for aid even the lowest and the poorest so here again i must ask youif there are true healers elsewhere does the sunlord grant them this miracle of healing as well as he does here clarrin sighed your question marches with the one before he replied in truth i cannot answer he picked up the pitcher hoping to stave off more questions he poured his grandfather another goblet offered wine to the scholar and was politely refused and filled his own glass and in truth he felt the need of it this scribe had a way of demanding answers to questions he had rather not think about i only have one more question captain the scribe said chuckling when he saw damns expression of resigned dismay though it could be seen as more than one a puzzle then or a riddle clarrin hoped so he and his grandfather had often traded riddles long into the night perhaps yes the scribe agreed a puzzle of questions clarrin waited while the breeze stirred scent up from the nightblooming flowers around them and made the windchimes play gently your puzzle then he prompted only this why are the young ones chosen by the priesthood taken from their homes at night why are they tested cleansed of all ties of kinship and never seen again by their kin except at a distance why are those that cannot be cleansed of kinties in your temple or those who fail the testing cleansed instead by burning in the fire of vkandis why does the sunlord the giver of all life require the death of children is it the cleansing and sacrifice of kinties that give the priests and priestesses the power to perform the sunlords miracles or could they perform them if they never set foot in the temple or donned robes clarrin shifted uncomfortably in his seat but the scribe was not yet done with him is it possible he continued leaning forward so that his terrible knowing eyes bored into clarrins that the ones who are firecleansed are destroyed because their powers are too strong too strong to permit their minds and hearts to be cleansed of the love of their kinfolk and that if they lived they could rival the priests and priestesses without ever having to wear a robe his eyes seemed to penetrate right into clarrins mind as if he were daring clarrin to find the true answers to this puzzle of his and there was something lurking in the depths of his gaze a hint of pain of loneliness of halfmadness that made clarrin finally shiver and turn away ihave no answers for you at all sir scribe he replied rising to his feet quickly i am only a poor lancer with no head for such an elevated discourse i will have to leave these things to men of wisdom such as you and my grandfather now if you will forgive me he ended hastily already backing away i have duties early in the morning very early and with that he beat a hasty retreat tirens mulpar also faced the sun this morning but not to pray his prayer had been answered last night and that in itself was proof enough of the sunlords powerand that his power like the light of the sun granted blessings and prayers in every land and not just in karse instead he watched as his servants secretly readied all the horses in his stable for a long journey and his thoughts too returned to the previous evenings conversation clarrin beat a hasty but tactically sound retreat from the garden he did notquiterun but it was plain enough from his posture that he wished he could it was too bad for his peace of mind that he would never be able to run fast enough or far enough to escape those questions the scribe had placed in his thoughts tirens watched him go and hid a smile this was not the first time that he had entertained the scholar who called himself brekkan of hawks rest but it was the first time he had been utterly certain of what this brekkan really was i fear i may have upset your grandson tirens mulpar the scribe said softly it was not my intention the old man snorted it was always your intention valdemaran he said and watched with interest as the scribes hand twitched a little interesting a sleevedagger you heralds of valdemar do not care to see folk become too complacent do you he saw the mans eyes widen just a trifle and smiled i think you are mistaken the socalled scribe began tirens held up a finger cautioning him to silence if i am mistaken it is only in thinking that a herald would not resort to a hidden dagger up a sleeve his smile broadened as the herald twitched again but i did not make any mistakes in giving you my hospitality nor in bringing my grandson here for you to disturb with your questions he is old enough and wellplaced enough to make a difference in this sad land again the herald moved as to protest and again he silenced the man with a single finger your questions deserve answers not platitudes or religious cant but he must decide for himself what is right i cannot give him answers nor can you he shrugged expressively i do not know what his answers will be nor can i say what he will do once he finds them that will come as vkandis wills the herald watched him with narrowed eyes gray eyes which marched well with his straight brown hair the color of old leaves you would never notice him in a crowd so long as he was not wearing the expression he bore now which tirens supposed was the point how did you know the herald asked his voice low and potent with threat that you are a herald the old man grinned i did not know it until this visit when i had need to know i have the sight at need at those times i can sense things that are not apparent his guest was not in the least mollified why did you grant me guestright tirens mulpar if you knew what i am he demanded harshly tirens sipped his wine i have a granddaughter he said a little above damns age she has a daughter a lovely child in my eyes who laughs at the stories of her greatgrandsire and who loves him as much as he loves her she is only nine years old a dangerous age in karse the herald relaxed just a trifle they test children in the temple at their tenth birthdays exactly so he allowed his smile to fade she tells me stories as well of dreams in the night at times those dreams come to pass the light of understanding blossomed in the heralds eyes dreams can be dangerousin karse the old man nodded curtly i wish her and her mother to be taken someplace where dreams are not so dangerous before we have visitors in the night the herald tilted his head to one side her father may have something to say about that he ventured tirens waved his hand hi dismissal only if he chooses to return from the hosts at vkandis right hand where the priests pledge me he has gone he replied the herald chuckled at that and relaxed further his hand made an interesting little movement that told tirens the dagger had returned to its home when he asked only tomorrow the old man said firmly i have already made the arrangements my granddaughter is privy to them and just as anxious as i for her daughters safety they will not inconvenience you in fact he allowed a twinkle to creep into his eyes a prosperous scholar with a karsite wife and child returning from visiting relatives is not likely to be questioned by anyone so long as be is careful to stay within law and custom which his karsite wife will be sure to impart to him the herald coughed gently i canahsee that tirens still had not heard the promise he wanted please he said resorting to beggary please take them to safety you will have no cause to regret this but the herald had not been reluctant after all of course i will he said a little embarrassed i was just thinking for a moment rearranging my trip to account for a new wife and child but at tirens chuckle his gaze sharpened but what of you old owl he asked using the name clarrin had used hi affection the old man leaned back in his seat on the couch and sipped his wine oh i shall enjoy my garden until i die he said casually life has been interesting but i do not fear to leave it and before his visitor could ask anything more he leaned forward with an eagerness that was completely genuine and now herald of valdemar since your other tales have been so fascinatingtell me of the land that my dear ones will live in clarrin put aside his doubts long enough to bid farewell to his family it would be many more months before he had another chance to visit them and without a doubt by then his niece liksani would be almost a woman already she had the look of his sister aldenwin about her and he could not help but remember all the times when it had been aldenwin who clung to his stirrup and begged him to stay just one more day but when he told liksani with a playful shake of his head that there were no more days left in the visit she let go and let him mount uncle clarrin she said her pretty darkeyed face solemn i almost forgot i dreamed a tale for you this morning in the womens garden after sunrise prayers he bent down to ruffle her hair and what did you dream little dreamer he asked lightly thinking it would be a request for a doll or some such thing i dreamed that a man in armor so bright i could not look at him told me to tell you something she laughed up at him clarrin went cold inside but managed to keep smiling and what thing was that he said to tell you that she screwed her face up in concentration that the light is the life and the breath the flame is the blessing and not lifesending she faltered for a moment then smiled and that children should live and laugh and play then he told me to go and play in northern flowers she finished giggling a weirding chill raised the hackles on his neck but somehow clarrin managed to lean down from his saddle to hug her firmly lifting her right off her feet as she put her arms around his neck be happy liksani he ordered gently live and laugh and play like the shining man told you im always happy uncle clarrin you know that she giggled as he set her back down on the ground sunlord keep her happy he prayed silently turning his horse to the gate and leading his seven guards back toward his duty sunlord keep her always happy tirens watched as his grandson rode off down the road to the south and two candlemarks later he watched as his granddaughter liksani and six of his seven servants rode off down the road to the north and west with them rode the herald whose true name tirens still did not know he knew that the herald was a man of honor that was all he needed to know the sun was directly overhead the birds singing all about his favorite pavilion as his one remaining servant served him his finest wine from a fragile crystal goblet he sipped it with appreciation as he turned the crystal to admire the way it sparkled in the sunlight this had been one of a set of two from which he and dear sareni had drunk their marriagewine the shards of the other lay with sareni in her grave sareni would have approved he thought as he drank the last of the wine and slipped his frail old hand into the bowl of figs where a tiny rainbowstriped snake was curled he stirred the figs until he felt a slight sting on his hand then a sudden lethargy the goblet fell from his nerveless fingers and shattered on the pavilion floor he lay back in his couch watched the snake slip away under the rosebushes and wondered if vkandis liked gardens clarrin stirred his noodles with his fork and stared at nothing at all captain his corporalorderly said sharply making him jump yes esda he replied wondering if he looked as guilty as he felt evidently not esda pouted at him hands on sidecocked hips a petulant expression on his face captain he complained youve hardly touched your meal and i worked very hard making it what is bothering you clarrin grinned in spite of himself at the burly corporals burlesque of a spoiled girl esda you lie you never work hard at anything not in the ten years youve served me anyway esda grinned back too true captain thats why picked you for my officer clarrin shook his head at his orderlys unrepentant grin here he said shoving the plate of noodles across the table toward esda sit down finish my meal for me and let me use your common sense he made it less of an order and more of an invitation esdas grin faded immediately and the grizzled veterans expression was replaced by one of concern you are troubled captain he observed taking the seat but ignoring the food his eyes fixed on damns clarrin shrugged i have some questions to repeat to youand a dream to tell you about he said slowly a dream esda lost every trace of mockery dreams are nothing to disregard captain esda had served the temple for longer than clarrin had been alivehe had seen three sons of the sun come and go and he was both a skeptic and a believer if anyone knew where temple politics began and true religion ended it would be esda yes well see what you think when i am done for the next candlemark esda sat and listened without interruption as clarrin recounted the discussion in the garden and little liksanis dream you know we serve at the cleansing he finished aye and i know you mislike the assignment esda replied gruffly butis it vkandis you blame for no clarrin exclaimed cutting him off with a slam of his open palm on the wooden table never i cannot believe that the lord of all life would ever countenance taking life that is all it is the priests and their minions that i mistrust and fear i believe they serve themselves not vkandis and i fear that they use magic and call it miracle to order to puff up their own importance well then bugger them all captain esda grinned like the sun coming out from behind a cloud whatever you decide to do just remember that poor overworked old unappreciated esda will be there to pick up your soiled linen the roar of laughter that followed made the rest of his personal guards turn their heads wondering what outrageous thing esda had said to him this time esda moved quietly among the guards speaking with them one at a time over the next two days while clarrin pretended that he did not notice and over the next two days every one of his men approached him quietly one at a time to offer their personal fealty to him clarrin was touched and humbled by their trust but he still did not know what he was going to da in ten days clarrin was back in command of his troop of temple lancers in fifteen days they paraded for the ceremony of cleansing conducted by redpriestess beakasi the temple square was crowded with worshipers and spectators at two sides behind the lines of the temple guards clarrins lancers dosed the third side of the square the low sun altar flanked by priests and priestesses in order of rank filled most of the fourth side at damns signal the lancers knelt as one at their horses heads lances grounded with the shafts held stiffly erect the red pennons at the crossbars moved lazily in the warm afternoon air redpriestess beakasi flanked by her torchbearers mounted the altarplatform and turned to face the crowd and the setting sun behind them her arms stretched out toward the sun and her red robes matched the red clouds of sunset at that signal lesser priests brought the two who were to be cleansed to the steps a boy who looked to be hi his early teens and a girl somewhat younger darkhaired with a pretty gentle face damns breath caught in his throat she could be liksani he thought in anguish the words of his nieces dream kept repealing over and over in his head the flame is the blessing and not lifes ending children should live and laugh and play the boy was shoved forward onto the platform he stood there looking frightened and confused vkandis sunlord beakasi sang grant your miracle cleanse this tainted one with your holy fire she brought her hands together over her head closing them on the iron shaft of a torch held there by a blackrobed priest he let it go and she held it high above her head flame flickering witness the sunlords miracle she sang tremble at his power the torch flame flared and grew suddenly to manheight then bent toward the boy he started to scream but remained where he was frozen with fear another redrobed priest pointed and the boys scream was cut off he remained where he was a wideeyed openmouthed living statue flames flowed from the torch to the boy arching overhead like water from a fountain in a long liquid stream they touched him then engulfed him turning him into a column of searing whitegreen fire that grew to three times the boys height a vaguely humanshaped form turned slowly in the upper half of the column of fire as if bathing in it clarrins heart spasmed and his gorge rose slowly the flames diminished and flowed back into the torch until it burned normally once again the boy was gone and there was only a small pile of ashes to mark where he had stood the priestess waited until the original bearer had his hands on the torch before she removed hers spreading her arms wide looking somewhere above the heads of the onlookers she called out into the silence hail vkandis sunlord hail vkandis sunlord the crowd roared in response beakasi signaled for the girl to be brought forward the flame is the blessing and not lifeending clarrin murmured his eyes bright with tears children should live and laugh and play he was standing now moving to his saddle in slow sluggish motion warring within himself the flame is the blessing and not lifeending he reached for the saddlebow and swung up into place feeling as if he were trapped in a feverdream children should live and laugh and play his hand was on his lance his horse jerked its head up m astonishment at the tightening of his legs then stepped forward he kicked it startling it into a gallop the flame is the blessing and not lifeending he screamed the words torn from his throat in torment his lance swung down into the attack position children should live and laugh and play redpriestess beakasi swung around in surprise her face mirrored that stunned surprise for a few moments then suddenly began chanting in a high frightened voice words clarrin could not understand her hands moved in intricate patterns tracing figures in the air damns superblytrained mount the veteran of many encounters plunged up the stairs at the gallop never missing a step the flame is the blessing and not life ending clarrin roared as a warcry children should live and laugh and play the priestess held up her hands as if she could ward off the lance with a gesture the long leafshaped blade impaled one of those outstretched hands nailing it to her chest as it struck her heart she shrieked in anger shock and pain the crossbar behind the blade slammed into her hand and chest clarrin took the impact in his arm lifting her up off her feet for a moment as he signaled his horse to halt he dropped the point of the lance and the priestess body slid off the blade to lie across the altar clarrin leaned down as he wheeled his horse and started back down the stairs sweeping the young girl into his arms without slowing the horse plunged down the steps at the back of the altar and they were away the child clinging desperately to him clarrin held her protectively to his chest and urged his mount to greater speed so far they had escaped but their luck could not last for much longer he heard horses behind him close too close he looked back his lips twisting in a feral snarl ready to fight for the childs life as well as his own the snarl turned to a gape and the gape to a grin that held both elation and awe his own personal guard and fifty of his lancers those that had served with him the longest were following esda in the lead many had blood on their blades clarrin slowed just enough for the rest to catch up with him esda waved an ironbanded torchjust like the ones carried by the priests as they galloped past a rainswollen ditch esda tossed the torch into the water greenyellow smoke and steam billowed up hi a hissing roar as they passed the place and a vaguely manshaped form twisted and jerked in the heart of the smoke as if it were on fire clarrin and esda spat and rode on letting the evening breeze carry the smoke away in their wake the pursuit when it finally came in the wake of blamecasting and namecalling was vicious clarrin felt extremely lucky that they crossed into rethwellan with twentysix still alive or rather twentyseven twentysix men and one special little girl who could now live and laugh and play in the warm morning sun without fear and without threat fifteen days later clarrin crossed back into karse his men with him all disguised as scholars they quickly dispersed each with provisions and a horse and a series of uncomfortable questions there were more young ones to save and after all at the right time and place a question was more deadly than any sword the demons den by tanya huff bom in the maritimes tanya huff now lives and writes in rural ontario on her way there she spent three years in the canadian naval reserve and got a degree in radio and television arts which the cat threw up on although no members of her family are miners the demons den is the third story shes written about those who go underground and mines have been mentioned in a number of her books she has no idea where its coming from but decided not to fight it her last book out was noquarterdaw march the direct sequel tofifthquarter daw august and her next book will beblood debtdaw april a fifth vickihenrycelluci novel the mine had obviously been abandoned for years not even dusk hid the broken timbers and the scree of rock that spilled out of the gaping black hole jors squinted into the wind trying and failing to see past the shadows are you sure it went in there of course im sure i con smell the blood trail maybe its not hurt as badly as we thought maybe itll be fine until morning his companion gave a little buck jors clutched at the saddle and sighed all right all right im going no one at the farmstead had known why the mountain cat had come down out of the heightsperhaps the deer it normally hunted had grown scarce perhaps a more aggressive cat had driven it from its territory perhaps it had grown lazy and decided sheep were less work no one at the farmstead cared theyd tried to drive it off it had retaliated by mauling a shepherd and three dogs now they wanted it killed just my luck to be riding circuit up here in the great white north jors swung out of the saddle and pulled his gloves off with his teeth how am i supposed to shoot it when i wont be able to see it he asked unstrapping his bow gevris turned his head to peer back at his chosen with one sapphire eye its hurt i know the wind sucked the heat out of his hands and he swore under his breath as one of the laces of his small pack knotted tight you wounded it i know damn it i know sighing he rested his head on the companions warm flank im sorry its just been a long day and i should never have missed that shot no one makes every shot chosen the warm understanding in the mindtouch helped the cat had been easy to track by late afternoon theyd known they were close at sunset they spotted it outlined against a gray and glowering sky jors had carefully aimed carefully let fly and watched in horror as the arrow thudded deep into a golden haunch the cat had screamed and fled theyd had no choice but to follow the most direct route up to the mine was a treacherous path of loose shale jors slipped slammed one knee into the ground and somehow managed to catch himself before he slid all the way back to the bottom chosen are you hurt behind him he could hear hooves scrabbling at the stone and he had to grin im fine worrywart get back on solid ground before you do yourself some damage here i go into whoknowswhat to face a wounded mountain cat and hes worried that ive skinned my knee shaking his head he struggled the rest of the way to the mine entrance and then turned and waved down at the glimmering white shape below im here im fine then he frowned and peered down at the ground the cart tracks coming out of the mine bumped down a series of jagged ledges disappeared completely then reappeared down where his companion was standing i dont like this if he squinted he could easily make out gevris sidestepping nervously back and forth a glimmer of white amidst the evening shadows hey i dont like this either but something is going to happen jors chewed on his lip hed never heard his usually phlegmatic companion sound so unsettled a gust of wind blew cold rain in his face and he shivered its just a storm go back under the trees so you dont get soaked no come down we can come back here in the morning storm probably has him a bit spooked and he doesnt want to admit it the herald sighed and wished he could go along with his companions sudden change of mind cant do that as much as he didnt want to go into that hole he knew he had to wounded it i cant let it die slowly in pain im responsible for its death he felt reluctant agreement from below and half wishing gevris had continued to argue turned to face the darkness setting his bow to one side he pulled a small torch out of his pack unwrapped the oilskin cover and in spite of wind and stiff fingers got it lit the flame helped a little but not much how am i supposed to hold a torch and aim a bow this is ridiculous but hed missed his shot and he couldnt let an animal any animal die in pain because of something hed done the tunnel slopped gently back into the hillside the shadows becoming more impenetrable the farther from the entrance he went he stepped over a fallen beam and a pile of rock worked his way around a crazily angled corner saw a smear of blood glistening in the torchlight and went on his heart beat so loudly he doubted hed be able to hear the cat if it should turn and attack a low shadow caught his eye and against his better judgment he bent to study it an earlier rockfall had exposed what looked to be the upper corner of a cave in the dim flickering light he couldnt tell how far down it went but a tossed rock seemed to fall forever the wind howled he jumped stumbled and laughed shakily at himself it was just the storm rushing past the entrance he hadnt gone so far in that he wouldnt be able to hear it then his torch blew out chosen no its okay im all right his startled shout still echoed bouncing back and forth inside the tunnels im in the dark but im okay again he set his bow aside and pulled his tinderbox from his belt pouch with trembling fingers get a grip jors he told himself firmly youre a herald heralds are not afraid of the dark and then the tunnel twisted flung to his knees and then his side jors wrapped his head in his arms and tried to present as small a target as possible to the falling rock the earth heaved as though a giant creature deep below struggled to get free with a deafening roar a section of the tunnel collapsed lifted and slammed against a pile of rock jors lost track of up and down the world became noise and terror and certain death then half his body was suspended over nothing at all he had a full heartbeat to realize what was happening before he fell a large amount of loose rock falling with him it seemed to go on forever turning tumbling sometunes sliding knowing that no one could survive the eventual landing but he did although it took him a moment to realize it chosen jors chosen gevris the near panic in his companions mindtouch pulled him up out of a grayandred blanket of pain the need to reassure the young stallion delaying his own hysteria im alive calm down im alive he spit out a mouthful of blood and tried to move most of the rock that had fallen with him seemed to have landed on his legs teeth clenched he flexed his toes inside his boots and almost cried in relief at the response although muscles from thigh to ankle spasmed everything worked dont think im even hurt very badly which was true enough as far as it went he had no way of telling what kind of injuries lurked under the masking pressure of the rock im coming no youre not hed landed on his stomach facing up a slope of about thirty degrees he could lift his torso about a handspan he could move his left arm freely his right was pined by his side breathing heavily he rested his cheek against the damp rock and closed his eyes it made no difference to the darkness but it made him feel better gevris youre going to have to go for help i cant free myself and you cant even get to me he tried to envision his map tried to trace the route theyd taken tracking the cat tried to work out distances theres a mining settlement closer than the farmstead just follow the old mine trail and it should take you right to it but you im hot going anywhere until you get back im not going anywhere he repeated to the darkness as he felt the presence of his companion move rapidly away im not going anywhere unfortunately as the mountain pressed in on him and all he could hear was his own terror filling the silence that was exactly what he was afraid of it was hard to hear anything over the storm that howled around the chimneys and shutters but aris ears were her only contact with the world and shed learned to sift sound for value head cocked tangled hair falling over the ruin of her eyes she listened rider coming galloping hard she smiled smug and silent not much went on that she didnt know about first something mustve gone wrong somewhere only reason to be riding so hard in this kind of weather the storm had been no surprise not with her stumps aching so for the past two days she rubbed at them hacking and spitting into the fire mama auntie ari did it again hush robin leave her alone thats right leave me alone she spat once more just because she knew the child would still be watching then lifted herself on her palms and handwalked toward her bench in the corner ari can i get you something sometimes she thought theyd never learn grunting a negative because ignoring them only brought renewed and more irritating offers she swung herself easily up onto the low bench just as the pounding began sounds like they didnt even dismount i cant wait who can it be at this hour her cousin dyril answer it and find out idiot stone me its a horse the sound of hooves against the threshold was unmistakable she could hear the creak of leather harness the snorting and blowing of an animal ridden hard could even smell the hot scent of it from all the way across the roombut somehow it didnt add up to horse and while the noises it was making were certainly horselike from the excited babble at the door ari managed to separate two bits of relevant information the horse was riderless and it was nearly frantic about something what color is it it took a moment for ari to recognize the rough and unfamiliar voice as her own a stunned silence fell and she felt the eyes of her extended family turned on her her chin rose and her lips thinned well she demanded refusing to let them see she was as startled as they were what color is it hes not an it auntie ari hes a he and hes white and his eyes are blue and horses dont got blue eyes young robin was obviously smarter than shed suspected of course they dont its not a horse you rockheaded morons cant you recognize a companion when you see one the companion made a sound that could only be agreement as the babble of voices broke out again ari snorted and shook her head in disbelief a companion without a herald is it searching what happened to the herald ari heard the companion spin and gallop away return and gallop away again i think it wants us to follow it maybe its herald is hurt and its come here for help and did you figure that out all on your own ari rubbed at her stumps as various members of the family scrambled for jackets and boots and some of the children were sent to rouse the rest of the settlement when with a great thunder of hooves the rescue party galloped off she beat her head lightly against the wall trying not to remember auntie ari robin made brave no doubt by her breaking silence well she wouldnt do it again auntie ari tell me about companions he had a highpitched imperious little voice tell me tell him about companions tell bun about the time spent at the collegium wishing her blues were gray tell him how the skills of mind and hand that had earned her a place seemed so suddenly unimportant next to the glorious honor of being chosen tell him of watching them gallop across companions field impossibly beautiful impossibly gracefulinfinitely far from her mechanical world of stresses and supports and levers and gears tell him how shed made certain she was never hi the village when the heralds came through riding circuit because it hurt so much to see such beauty and know she could never be a part of it tell him how after the accident shed stuffed her fingers in her ears at the first sound of bridle bells tell him any or all of that you saw them didnt you auntie ari you saw them up close when you were in the city yes and then she regretted shed said so much chosen ive brought hands to dig you out jots released a long shuddering breath that warmed the rock under his cheek and tried very very hard not to cry chosen the distress in his companions mindtouch helped him pull himself together im okay as okay as i was anway i just i just missed you gevris presence settled gently into his mind and he clung to it more afraid of dying alone in the dark than of just dying do not think of dying he hadnt realized hed been thinking of it in such a way as to be heard sorry guess im not behaving much like a herald am i a very equine snort made him smile you are a herald therefore this is how heralds behave trapped in a mine the companions tone suggested he not argue the point so he changed the subject how did you manage to communicate with the villagers when they recognized what i was they followed me once they saw where you were they understood some have returned to the village for tools he paused and jors had the feeling he was deciding whether or not to pass on one last bit of information they call this place the demons den oh swell there are no real demons in it that makes me feel so much better it should gevris pointed out helpfully heralds down in the demons den the storm swirled the voice hi through the open door stirring the room up into a frenzy of activity all the ablebodied who hadnt followed the companion ran for jackets and boots the rest buzzed like a nest of hornets poked with a stick ari sat in her corner behind the tangled tent of her hair and tried not to remember there was a rumble deep in the bowels of the hillside a warning of worse to come but they kept working because ari had braced the tunnels so cleverly that the earth could move as it liked and the mine would move with it flexing instead of shattering but this time the earth moved in a way she hadnt anticipated timbers cracked rock began to fall someone screamed jors jerked his head up and hissed through his teeth in pain chosen i can hear them i can hear them digging the distant sound of metal against stone was unmistakable then it stopped gevris whats wrong whats happening their lanterns keep blowing out this hillside is so filled with natural passageways that when the winds are strong they cant keep anything lit and its in an unstable area jors sighed and rested his forehead against the back of his left wrist what kind of an idiot would put a mine in a place like this the ore deposits were very good how do you know their familiar banter was all that was keeping him from despair these people talk a great deal and you listen he clicked his tongue knowing his companion would pick up the intent if not the actual noise shame on you eavesdroppers never hear good of themselves only the chime of a pebble dislodged from somewhere up above answered gevris there was an accident was anyone hurt i dont no not badly theyre coming out he felt a rising tide of anger before he heard his companions next words theyre not going back in i cant make them go back in they say its too dangerous they say they need the light i cant make them go back in in his mind jors could see the young stallion rearing and kicking and trying to block the miners who were leaving him there to die he knew it was his imagination for their bond had never been strong enough for that kind of contact he also knew his imagination couldnt be far wrong when the only answer to his call was an overwhelming feeling of angry betrayal the damp cold had crept through his leathers and begun to seep into his bones hed fallen just before full dark and although time was hard to track buried in the hillside it had to still be hours until midnight nights were long at this time of the year and it would grow much much colder before sunrise ari knew when dyril and the others returned that they didnt have the herald with them knew it even before the excuses began that little shake we had earlier was worse up there whats left of the tunnels could go at any minute we barely got neegan out when one of the last supports collapsed you couldnt get to him it wasnt a question not really if theyd been able to get to him theyd have brought him back him her we couldnt even keep the lanterns lit someone tossed their gear to the floor you know what its like up there during a storm the wind howling through all those cracks and crevasses ari heard dyril sigh heard wood creak as he dropped onto a bench well go back in the morning maybe when we can see memories were thick in the silence if its as bad as all that the heralds probably dead anyway hes alive ari shouted over the murmur of agreement oh sure theyd feel better if they thought the herald was dead if they could convince themselves they hadnt left him there to die but she wasnt going to let them off so easily you dont know that the companion knows it she bludgeoned them with her voice because it was all she had he came to you for help and we did what we could the queenll understand the dens taken too many lives already for us to throw more into it do you think i dont know that she could hear the storm throwing itself against the outside of the house but nothing from within it almost seemed as though she were suddenly alone in the room then she heard a bench pushed back footsteps approaching who else do you want that mine to kill dyril asked quietly we lost three getting you out wasnt that enough it was three too many she wanted to say if you think im grateful think again but the words wouldnt come she swung down off her bench and handwalked along the wall to the ladder in the corner stairs were difficult but with only half a body to lift she could easily pull herself hand over hand from rung to rungher arms and shoulders were probably stronger now than theyd ever been adults couldnt stand in the loft so no one bothered her there we did all we could she heard dyril repeat wearily more to himself than to her she supposed she believed him he was a good man they were all good people they wouldnt leave anyone to die if they had any hope of getting them out she was trapped with four others deep underground they could hear someone screaming the sound carried on the winds that howled through the caves and passages around the mine by the time they could hear rescuers frantically digging with picks and shovels there were only three of them still alive ari hadnt been able to feel her legs for some time so when they pried enough rubble dear to get a rope through she forced her companions out first the demons den had been her mine and they were used to following her orders then the earth moved again and the passage dosed she lay there alone listening to still more death carried on the winds and wishing shed had the courage to tell them to leave her to get out while they still could papa what happened to the companion hes still out there brandon tried to bring him into the stable and got a nasty bite for his trouble ari moved across the loft to the narrow dormer and listened although the wind shrieked and whistled around the roof she could hear the frenzied cries of the companion as he pounded through the settlement desperately searching for someone who could help who else do you want that mine to kill she dug through the mess on the floor for a leather strap and tied her hair back off her face her jacket lay crumpled in a damp pile where shed left it but that didnt matter itd be damper still before she was done down below the common room emptied as the family headed for their beds voices rising and falling some needing comfort and absolution some giving it ari didnt bother to listen it didnt concern her later in the quiet she swarmed down the ladder and handwalked to where shed heard the equipment dropped and sorted out a hundredfoot coil of rope draping it across her chest she continued to the door the latch was her design her fingers remembered it the ground felt cold and wet under the heavy calluses on her palms and she was pretty sure she felt wet snow in the rain that slapped into her face she moved out away from the house and waited hooves thundered past her around her and stopped no one she said knows the den better than i do im the only chance your herald has left youve probably called for othersother heralds other companionsbut they cant be close enough to help or you wouldnt still be hanging around here the temperatures dropping and time means everything now the companion snorted a great gust of warm sweetlyscented breath replacing the storm for a moment she hadnt realized hed stopped so close and she fought to keep from trembling i know what youre thinking but i wont need eyes in the darkness and you dont dig with legs and feet if you can get me there shining one i can get your herald out the companion reared and screamed a challenge ari held up her hands i know you understand me she said i know youre more than you appear youve got to believe me i will get your herald out if you lie down i can grab the saddle horn and the cantle and hold myself on between them on a horse it would never work even if she could lift herself on shed never stay in the saddle once it started to move her stumps were too short for balance but then she wouldnt be having this conversation with a horse a single whicker and a rush of displaced air as a large body went to the ground a whiskers distance from her ari reached out touched one silken shoulder and worked her way back you must be desperate to be going along with this she thought bitterly never mind youll see mounting was easy staying in the saddle as the companion rose to his feet was another thing entirely somehow she managed it all right a deep breath and she balanced her weight as evenly as she could stumps spread go he leaped forward so suddenly he nearly threw her off heart in her throat she clung to the saddle as his pace settled to an almost gentle rocking motion completely at odds with the speed she knew he had to be traveling she could feel the night whipping by her rain and snow stinging her face in spite of everything she smiled she was on a companion riding a companion it was over too soon jors chosen the herald coughed and lifted his head hed been having the worst dream about being trapped in a cavein thats what i get for eating my own cooking and then he tried to move his legs and realized he wasnt dreaming gevris you went away im sorry heartbrother please forgive me but when they wouldnt stay the thought trailed off lost in an incoherent mix of anger and shame its all right jors carefully pushed his own terror back in order to reassure the companion youre back now thats all that matters brought someone to get you out but i thought the mine was unstable still collapsing she says she can free you youre talking to her as far as jors knew that never happened even some heralds were unable to mindtouch clearly shes talking to me i believe she can do what she says jors swallowed and took a deep breath no its too dangerous theres already been one accident i dont want anyone dying because of me chosen the companions mindtouch held a tone jors had never heard before i dont think shes doing it for you when they stopped an took a moment to work some feeling back into each hand in turn heralds probably going to have my finger marks permanently denting his gear below her the companion stood perfectly still waiting were going to have to do this together shining one because if i do it alone ill be too damned slow go past the mine about fifty feet and look up five maybe six feet off the ground there should be a good solid shelf of rock if you can get us onto it we can follow it right to the mouth of the mine and avoid all that shale shit the companion whickered once and started walking when she felt him turn ari scooted back as far as she could in the saddle and flopped forward trapping the coil of rope under her chest stretching her arms down and around the sleek curve of his barrel she pushed the useless stirrups out of her way and clutched the girth go she grunted he backed up a few steps lunged forward and the world tilted at a crazy angle ari held her uncomfortable position until he stopped on the level ground at the mouth of the mine remind me she coughed rubbing the spot where the saddle horn had slammed into her throat not to do that again all right shining one ill have to get off the same way i got on his movement took her by surprise she grabbed for the saddle her cold fingers slipped on the wet leather and she dismounted a lot farther from the ground than shed intended a warm muzzle pushed into her face as she lay there for a moment trying to get her breath back im okay she muttered just a little winded teeth gritted against the pain in her stumps she pushed herself up soft lips nuzzled at her hair dont worry shining one tentatively she reached out and stroked the companions velvet nose ill get your herald out theres enough of me left for that she tossed her head and turned toward the mine not needing eyes to find the gaping hole in the hillside icy winds dragged across her cheeks and she knew by their touch that theyd danced through the demons den before they came to her now then she was pleased to hear that her voice remained steady we need to work out a way to communicate at the risk of sounding like a bad bardic tale how about one whicker for yes and two for no there was a single soft whicker just above her head good first of all we have to find out how badly he a pause your herald is a he at the companions affirmative she went on how badly hes hurt ask him if he has any broken bones i dont know i cant move enough to tell ari frowned at the answer yes and no is he buried only half of me chosen i have no way to tell her that then yeah i guess im buried shit there could be broken bones under the rock the pressure keeping the herald from feeling the pain well shed just have to deal with that when she got to it is he buried in the actual mine or in a natural cave she seems to think its good youre in a natural cave jots traced the rock that curved away from him with his free hand his fingers were so numb he could barely feel it why i cant ask her that chosen she wants to know if you turned left around a corner about thirty feet in from the entrance to the mine left he tried to remember but the cold had seeped into his brain and thoughts moved sluggishly through it ii guess so okay ari tied one end of the rope around her waist as she spoke ask him if the quake happened within say twenty feet of that corner dont know i dont remember gevris im tired just stay with me while i rest no meanbrother do not go to steep think please were you close to the comer he remembered seeing the blood then stopping and looking into the hole in the side of the tunnel yes i think no more than twenty feet good were in luck theres only one place on this level where the cave system butts up against the mine i know approximately where he is hes close she reached forward and sifted a handful of rubble i just have to get to him a hundred feet of rope would reach the place where the quake threw him out of the mine but after that she could only hope he hadnt slid too deep into the catacombs turning to where she could feel the bulk of the companion aris memory showed her a graceful white stallion outlined against the night once i get the rope around him youll have to pull him free he whickered once and nudged her and she surrendered to the urge to bury face and fingers in his mane when she finally let go she had to bite her lip to keep from crying thanks im okay now using both arms at once then swinging her body forward between them ari made her way into the mine breathing in the wet oily scent of the rock the lingering odors of the lanterns dyril and the others had used and the stink of fear old and new at the first rockfall she paused traced the broken pieces and found the passage the earlier rescue party had dug her shoulder brushed a timber support and she hurried past the memories a biting gust of wind whistled through a crack up ahead flinging grit up into her face nice try she muttered but you threw me into darkness five summers ago and ive learned my way around then she raised her voice shining one can you still hear me the companions whicker echoed eerily you dont need to worry about him running out of air this place is like a sieve so remind your herald to keep moving tell him to keep flexing his muscles if thats all he can do hes got to keep the blood going out to the extremities what extremities jors heard himself giggle and wondered what there was to laugh about chosen listen to me you know what the cold can do you have to move i know that everyone knew that it wasnt like he hadnt been paying attention when theyd been teaching winter survival skills it was just well it was just so much effort wiggle your toes gevris somehow managed to sound exactly like the weaponsmaster and jors found himself responding instinctively to his surprise his toes still wiggled and it still hurt the pain burned some of the frost out of his brain and left him gasping for breath but he was thinking more clearly than he had been in some time with his companions encouragement he began to systematically work each muscle that still responded the biggest problem with digging out the demons den had always been that the rock shattered into pieces so small it was like burrowing through beads in a box the slightest jar would sent the whole crashing to the ground her eyes in her fingertips ari inched toward the buried herald not digging but building a passageway each stone placed exactly to hold the weight of the next slowly with exquisite care she moved up and over the rockfall that had nearly killed neegan she lightly touched the splintered end of the shattered support then went on she had no time to mourn the past years of destruction couldnt erase her knowledge of the mine shed been trapped in it for too long herald can you hear me jors turned his face toward the sudden breeze yes gevris shes here good although he sounded relieved jors realized the companion didnt sound the least bit surprised you knew shed make it again the strange tone the herald didnt recognize believed her when she said shed get you out cover your head with your hands herald startled he curved his left arm up and around his head just in time to prevent a small shower of stones from ringing off his skull im on my way down a moment later he felt the space around him fill and a rough jacket pressed hard against his cheek sorry just let me get turned turned teeth chattering from the cold he strained back as far as he could but knew it would make little difference there wasnt room for a cat to turn let alone a person to his astonishment his rescuer seemed to double back on herself ow not a lot of head room down here from the sound of her voice and the touch of her hands she had to be sitting tight up against his side her upper body bent across his back he tried to force his halffrozen mind to work your legs are well out of the way herald trust me ari danced her fingers over the pile of rubble that pinned him can you still move your toes it took him a moment to remember how yes good youre at the bottom of a roughly wedgeshaped crevasse fortunately youre pointing the right way as soon as i get enough of you clear im going to tie this rope around you and your companion on the other end is going to inch you up the slope as i uncover your legs that means if anythings broken its going to drag but if we dont do it that way there wont be room down here for me you and the rock do you understand yes good one piece at a time she began to free his right side gevris she doesnt have any legs i know how did she get here brought her thats impossible the companion snorted obviously not shes blind too what his incredulous exclamation echoed through the demons den ari snorted and jammed a rock into the crack between two others it wasnt difficult to guess what had caused that reaction not when she knew the silence had to be filled with dialogue she couldnt hear she waited for him to say something heraldlike and nauseating about overcoming handicaps as though they were all she was to her surprise he said only whats your name it took her a moment to find her voice ari jors she nodded even though she knew he couldnt see the gesture herald jors are you one of the miners why was he talking to her when he had his companion to keep him company not exactly so far tonight shed said more than shed said in the five summers since the accident her throat ached gevris says hes never seen anyone do what you did to get in here he says you didnt dig through the rubble you built a tunnel around you using nothing but your hands gevris my companion hes very impressed he believes you can get me out ari swallowed hard his companion believed in her it was almost funny in a way you can move your arm now actually he gasped trying not to writhe no i cant he felt her reach across him tuck her hand under his chest and grab his wrist he could barely feel her touch against his skin on three she pulled immediately before he could tense that wasnt very nice he grunted when he could speak again she ignored his feeble attempt to tug his arm out of her hands and continued rubbing life back into the chilled flesh theres nothing wrong with it its just numb because youve been lying on it in the cold oh are you a healer then he sounded so indignant that she smiled and actually answered the question no i was a mining engineer i designed this mine oh hed wondered what kind of idiot would put a mine in a place like this now he knew ari heard most of the thought and gritted her teeth keep flexing the muscles untying the end of the rope from around her own waist she relied it just under the heralds arms it felt strange to touch a young mans body again after so long strange and uncomfortable she twisted and began to free his legs jors listened to her breathing and thought of being alone in darkness forever im here chosen i know but i wasnt thinking of me i was thinking about ari ari were you at the collegium i was you redesigned the hoists from the kitchen so theyd stop jamming and you fixed that pump in bardic that kept flooding the place and you made the practice dummy that that was a long time ago not so long jors protested trying to ignore the sudden pain as she lifted a weight off his hips you left the blues the summer i was chosen did i they were all talking about you they said there wasnt anything you couldnt build what happened her hands paused i came home be quiet i have to listen it wasnt exactly a lie working as fast as she could ari learned the shape of the stone imprisoning the herald its strengths its weaknesses it was all so very familiar the tunnel shed built behind her ended here she finished it in her head and nodded once as the final piece slid into place herald jors when i give you the word have your companion pull gently but firmly on the rope until i tell you to stop i cant move the rest of this off of you so im going to have to move you out from under it jors nodded realized how stupid that was and said i understand ari pushed her thumbs under the edge of a rock and took a deep breath now the rock shifted but so did the herald stop she changed her grip now a stone fell she blocked it with her shoulder stop inch by inch teeth clenched against the pain of returning circulation jors moved up the slope clinging desperately to the rope stop im out i know now listen carefully because this is important on my way in i tried to lay the rope so it wouldnt snag but your companion will have to drag you clear without stoppingone long smooth motion no matter what no matter what jors repeated twisting to peer over his shoulder the instinctive desire to see her face winning out over the reality the loose slope he was lying on shifted hold still ari snapped do you want to bury yourself again jors froze whats going to happen ari behind him in the darkness he heard her sigh do you know what a keystone is herald its the stone that takes the weight of the other stones and holds up the arch essentially the rock that fell on your legs fell in such a way as to make it the keystone for this cavern were in but you didnt move the rock no but i did move your legs and they were part of it then whats supporting the keystone he knew before she answered i am no no what herald no i wont let you sacrifice your life for mine yet heralds are often called upon to give then lives for others thats different why her voice cracked out of the darkness like a whip youre allowed to be noble but the rest of us arent youre so good and pure and perfect and chosen and the rest of us dont even have lives worth throwing away dont you see how stupid that is your life is worth infinitely more than mine she stopped and caught her breath on the edge of a sob there should never have been a mine here do you know why i dug it to prove i was as good as all those others who were chosen when i wasnt i was smarter i wanted it as much why not me and do you know what my pride did herald it killed seventeen people when the mine collapsed and then my cowardice killed my brother and an uncle and a woman barely out of girlhood because i was afraid to die my life wasnt worth all those lives let my death be worth your life at least he braced himself against her pain i cant let you die for me and yet if our positions were reversed youd expect me to let you die for me she ground the words out through the shards of broken bones of broken dreams heralds die for what they believe in all the time why cant i youve got it wrong ari he told her quietly heralds die i wont deny that and we all know we may have to sacrifice ourselves someday for the greater good but we dont die for what we believe in we live for it ari couldnt stop shaking but it wasnt from the cold or even from the throbbing pain in her stumps who else do you want that mine to kill this all this is my responsibility i wont let it kill anyone else because he couldnt reach her with his hands jors put his heart in his voice and wrapped it around her neither will i what will happen if you grab my legs and gevris pulls us both free he heard her swallow the tunnel will collapse all at once no itll begin here and follow us yes but not even a companion could pull us out that quickly gevris jors sketched the situation do you think you can beat the collapse yes but do you think you can survive the trip youll be dragged on your stomach through a rock tunnel well im not going to survive much longer down here thats for certainim numb from my neck to my knees im in leathers i should be okay what about your head good point ari youre wearing a heavy sheepskin coat can you work part of it up over your head yes but do it and watch for falling rock im going to do the same what about your pack hed forgotten all about it letting the loop of rope under his armpits hold his weight he managed to secure it like a kind of crude helmet grab hold of my ankles ari ari i cant force you to live i can only ask you not to die he felt a tentative touch and then a firmer hold go gevris they stayed at the settlement for nearly a week although the healer assured him that the hours spent trapped in the cold and the damp had done no permanent damage jors wore a stitched cut along his jaw as a remembrance of the passage out of the demons den ari was learning to live again she still carried the weight of the lives lost to her pride but shed found the strength to bear the load dont expect sweetness and light though she cautioned the herald as he and gevris prepared to leave i was irritating and opinionated before the accident her mouth crooked slightly and she added with just a hint of the old bitterness i expect thats why i was never chosen jors grinned as gevris pushed his head into her shoulder he says you were chosen for something else he said that ari lifted her hand and lightly stroked the companions face she smiled the expression feeling strange and new then i guess id better get on with it as they were riding out of the settlement to take up their interrupted circuit again jors turned back to wave and saw ari sketching something wondrous in the air prodded by the piping questions of young robin i guess she wont be alone in the dark anymore gevris tossed his head she never had to be sometimes its hard for people to realize that they rode in silence for a moment then jors sighed watching his breath plume in the frosty air im glad they found the body of that catid hate to have to go back into the den to look for it their route would take them nowhere near the demons den that was as close to the havens as i want to come for a while and then he realized gevris you knew ari wanted to die down there yes then why did you let her go into that mine because i believed she could free you but and the companion continued i believed you could free her ironrose by larry dixon and mel white larry dixon is the husband of mercedes lackey and a

writer whose work also appears inwitch fantasticandaladdin master of the lamp the tiny forges flames comforted ironrose its presence was a constant in his life not always a focus of his attention but there its fingers were of flame which didnt caress him as a lover or massage him but still provided comfort to him the spring which fed water to its mechanical bellows was another constant shaped by adept magic to a simple water funnel that split off for quenching and tempering tempering was another constant in ironroses life he had always tempered himself reciting oaths silently when upset bringing his spirits up with songs when saddened sadness though had come to perch on his forge like a wingbroken vulture of late his hard work was valued by the clan and his skills were ranked well above the average for artificers he was also wellthoughtof among his hawkbrother brethrenwhen he was thought of at all and that was why sadness was making his temper brittle ironrose ive brought your game he turned from the forge and laid down his tools it was sunrunner the lithe strong hunter only twothirds his height half his weight and utterly unattainable she set down an overstuffed game bag on a chipped worktable and a sack of greens and wild herbs a moment later she looked at him expectantly ah sunrunner ah thank you he stammered how foolish he must look the largest of his clan all callused fingers and strong arms intimidated by this young hunter and surely she knew it how could she not his sweating certainly wasnt from the forges heat he caught himself staring at her as she stood in a shaft of the late afternoon sunlight with dust motes dancing all around her a sudden fire burned in the pit of his stomach and he wiped his sweaty palms on his thick apron trying to calm the sudden thunder of his heart it was all too embarrassing and he tried to cover it by searching for the arrowheads and bow fittings hed made for her theyd been put somewhere sunrunner stood looking quietly at him where was tullin when he was needed tullin was in fact behind the forge polishing an iron ring with a small file absorbed in his task he hadnt noticed the hunters entry but he did notice when ironroses hammer blows stilled that meant a visitor someone to pick up an order or barter for the smiths services the small hertasi cocked his head and flicked his tongue to taste the air the scent identified the late afternoon visitor as the hunter sunrunner lately ironrose had reacted like a spooked rabbit every time she visited the forge building ghosting up behind the smith he tasted the air again to catch the nuances of ironroses scent no doubt about itcourting pheremones he bunked his large gold eyes in delight as he studied the scene the lonely human had finally selected a mate the hunter that his own mate served tullin ironrose turned and found the small hertasi standing beside him silently holding half a dozen arrowheads and the bowfittings toward him the smith accepted them with a growl and turned back to sunrunner as tullin collected the game bag and herbs he identified the contentsrabbit a tiny marshbuck and tubers from the southern marshmore than enough to feed the smith for two days the hunter kept her bargain well tullin watched sunrunner trace a careful finger over the sharp edges of an arrowhead she was a good provider a quiet woman who appreciated wellcrafted things according to his mate coulsie sunrunner was also very even tempered emotionally she was well suited to live with the shy metalsmith critically tullin eyed her figure her legs were strong her hips deep and wide adequate for large babiesperhaps a bit too large for hertasi standards but necessary for a woman of the hawkbrothers tullin picked up the two bags of food and ghosted toward the rear door of the smithy you and she will be a very good match he observed casually as he headed toward the kitchen when will you offer her a love token tullin ironrose wheeled gaping after him in outraged indignation sunrunner stood frozen in surprise but all they saw of the hertasi was the mischievous flick of a silveryscaled tail as tullin vanished through the doorway tullins mate coulsie was tall and stocky with an air of quiet competence about her she bobbed her head affectionately in greeting as he trotted in he nuzzled her snout tasting her warm enticing scent you take care of the hunter sunrunner dont you he asked as he set down the bag with the rabbits she nodded handing him a sharp knife for skinning before selecting a knife for herself my ironrose is most interested in her i think he needs to take her as his mate she slid her eyes toward him her nostrils flared with surprise she is one who walks alone she does not need a mate nonsense have you tasted their body scents when they are near each other i have they have a hunger for each otherand we both know how lonely they are the only thing that keeps them from courting others is their own belief that no one would want such as they for a mate this sorrow over their inner selves is only an old path that they tread mated they will overcome these things she gave a quick head jerk hi protest but he nuzzled the point of her jaw and whispered softly besides what finer service can we offer than to bring the hawkbrothers that which they most desire sunrunners day had been as bad as the previous ten her hunting had been dismal but she stayed by her barter with the ironcrafter and gave him the best shed taken the weather had been cold and damp the seasonal dance was tonight and she was one of the few hunters and scouts who wouldnt be going she cloaked herself in bravado among her peers taking this night on watch so they could enjoy themselves but the truth of the matter was that when it came to celebrations she was a gray sparrow as exciting as tree bark so it had always been it didnt make sense she repeated in her mind as she had hundreds of times before it didnt make sense she was attractive enough a hard worker and responsible yet where were her suitors some of the scouts were like the rabbits they hunted yet she was never offered a trysting feather it was a vicious trapthey didnt pursue her so she stayed away from where they might she left scout meetings early avoided celebrations and gatherings and became part of the forest at the slightest indication of direct attention from a potential lover besides just any lover wasnt really what she wanted in her heart it didnt make sense she thought for yet another time but what could be done there was no doubt in tullins mind what needed to come next the next step of course was to work on ironrose who was as stubborn as the mountains and as open to subtle hints as the rocks themselves it would take a direct line tullin decided as he reentered the forge room the smith was hammering away furiously on an arrowhead he was putting too much force into the blows is that your love token for her usually they like something a little less practical he observed his tailtip twitching with amusement the smith turned scowling i am in no mood for hertasi jokes he thundered tullin raised his chin baring his throat in a submissive gesture i had no intent to offend he said gently only you were in a bad mood today and so was she and i thought that it might do you both good to go to the dance together tonight but you would not ask so i thought id prod you into action i dont need your help true but you do need a bath i will have a hot soak ready for you in a hawks stoop tullin said before ironrose could muster a decent protest i can see tension in your neck and shoulders and that makes for poor work and its irritating your bird in response ironroses bondbird a very old tufted owl opened one eye for almost an entire minute i dont do poor work tullin and i dont need a soak right now ive got bowfittings to design for tallbush folding bow springs and runners white to red and untempered i have his drawings right here nonsense you are tense your muscles are like ropes and the air tastes of your weariness there is no one at the pools right now you can soak for a fingers width of the moons path and come back to work after that it will give me time to restock the forge and to bring you the dinner that coulsie has fixed when youve eaten and rested your hammer will ring truer ironrose hesitated and tullin offered his clinching argument besides a certain hertasi has prepared the third pool to your liking and has sent for a mug of wanned truespice tea and towels by way of an apology to you it would be a shame to have them go to waste you know ironrose stared at him for a long moment and then outsmarted began removing his apron sunrunner tallied her aches and bruises as she slogged down the path to the bathing pools shed almost gotten caught by a damned wyrsa while she was out today and had scrapes and scratches that stung even after being bandaged and salved shed also lost three of her new arrowheads somehow before they were even fletched onto shafts now shed have to barter with the ironcrafter again if she wasnt so sure that hertasi were infallibly trustworthy shed almost think coulsie had taken them coulsie had only clucked when asked about them though and shooed sunrunner off to the hot spring promising to bring the hunter her evening meal while she rested and bathed she sniffed the humid air of the bathing pools appreciatively surely things were going to get better she sat on a pad of moss beside a steaming pool and wearily removed her stained and sweaty clothes ironrose yawned sleepily the heat and the wine had relaxed him and he was reluctant to go back to work in the forge there was a slight rustle of leaves from the far edge of the pool tullin was announcing his presence he thought with a grin usually the hertasi moved silently as the night but tullin seemed to be more aware of human needs and occasionally made small noises to alert ironrose to his presence he opened his eyes and met the gaze of sunrunner she entered the water unselfconsciously then paused when her eyes met ironroses i hope you dont mind she faltered coulsie said this bath would be unoccupied tonight i guess she didnt speak to your hertasi err no i didnt mean to stay so long he fumbled fell asleep in the water ironrose reached nervously for his clothes but found them missing tullin he hissed is something wrong sunrunner asked splashing water over her sunbrowned arms he sighed only that the hertasi are being entirely too efficient tonight it seems tullin thought that my taking a bath would be the perfect chance to take my clothes to be washed and mended i can pick another pool she said with a smile im afraid its too late he said wryly you mean ironrose nodded efficient hertasi i just saw your clothes vanish nothing to do for it but wait till they decide to bring them back she glowered at the bushes then slipped farther into the water oh well im glad enough to find you here ive lost some of my arrowheads and need to barter for more of them dont know what i did with them i didnt lose that many arrows hunting he scrubbed at his arms with a small pumice stone ive got some extras at the shop you could come by in the morning to pick them up he offered ill need three of them she said im down to six good arrows now and thats not enough for anything more than small game i promised winterstar a marshbuck in exchange for a winter blanket im surprised to find anyone here she added i thought everyone would be at the dance he lowered his eyes to his forgestained fingers thick from years of hammering metal great clumsy thing like me at a dance he said wryly id terrorize the dancers and fall on the musicians you never saw someone so awkward and untalented in your life thats hard to believe sunrunner said as she palmed warm water onto her face you create some of the most beautiful metalwork i remember that metal buckle in the shape of a lizard that you made for starhawk he groped for conversation finding that he enjoyed talking to her desperate for an excuse to prolong the meeting a soft rattle at his elbow alerted him that tullin had returned and he turned to speak to the hertasi but tullin had vanished leaving behind a platter of steaming rabbit and herbsand two plates he filled one plate and shyly pushed it toward sunrunner please wont you join me theres more than enough and tullin brought an extra plate she reached for it smiling her thanks from his vantage point in the bushes tullin blinked his eyes in amusement things were going splendidly move over coulsie hissed sliding into place beside tullin tsamar and shonu eeled through the bushes behind her anything happening shonu whispered though whispers were not necessary the hertasi language sounded like a series of hisses and snorts to the untrained human ear and blended in with the rustle of the leaves in the wind theyre sharing food tullin said with satisfaction and theyre talking too about things other than hunting and metalsmithing its going splendidly shonu snorted softly splendidly he misses her signals completely look there how she hoods her eyes and how her hand signals come closer each time she says something to him he sits there nostrils dilated ready for her frozen like a statue afraid to move this isnt splendid tullin perhaps we should a long clawed hand reached out and wrapped itself around shonus snout i remember the last time you had a good idea tullin said with ironic humor we spent three weeks trying to explain the situation to the hawkbrothers and getting them all settled down again bluethorn didnt speak to me for five days i dont think we need any suggestions about ironrose and sunrunner but but just look at them at that pace our childrens children will be having children before those two do more than say good morning those two need help i remember how well icefalcon and eventree fared with your help shonu closed his mouth with a snap tullin blinked his amusement and turned back to watch the two in the pool but it all grew back shonu protested in vain tullin entered the smithy blinking contentedly in the early morning sunlight ironrose was already there stoking the fires of the forge he tasted the air out of habit noting that the smith was in a good mood this morning gliding over to the worktable he examined the sketches that ironrose had left today theyd begin on the new bow fittings for tallbush he eyed the design critically theyd need a fairly flexible blend one that could take a lot of stress probably one of the eastern blend eight ingots as he turned back toward the ingot storeroom a scrap of parchment on the floor caught his eye he bent and picked it up it was a drawing of a rose caught at the earliest flush of bloom a graceful spiral of stem and petals reaching upward like a promise he studied it speculatively for a long moment then tucked it into his tool pouch he hefted an ingot of blend eight and then on a sudden impulse added a quarteringot of blend two to his load where are the drawings ironrose frowned pawing through the nominally organized litter on his worktable tullin blinked innocently i set them down there on the corner of your worktable next to the other project its still there perhaps you picked it up and put it somewhere else ironrose moved aside the metal bar of blend eight not under them i promised him the fittings would be finished in the next two days he fretted i cant imagine what ive done with them why dont you work on your love token for sunrunner while i look for them tullin suggested love token tullin pointed to the scrap of paper with the rose lying pinned by the quarter ingot of blend two a fitting symbol a gift more enduring than the feather a thing of inner grace and beauty with a strong outer form like yourself or like the hunter ironrose stared in astonishment really shes not he began interested in you your eyes fail to see what hertasi eyes seehow the hunter laughs with you as she does with no other how her eyes follow you sadly when you leave human eyes may not note but the hertasi do offer the token it will not be refused he leaned back resting his weight on his tail a casual pose belied by the interest in his wide eyes ironrose hesitated if you think i am wrong make the rose anyway if she refuses it as a love token say that it was only made as a gift you have nothing to lose he added closing in for the verbal kill if nothing else shell probably give you a return gift of a marshbuck quarter ironrose weighed the ingot in his large hand tullin blinked mildly and picked up a lightweight hammer from the workbench silently offering it to the smith ironrose scowled and took the hammer and turned back to the forge grumbling the design for the rose in his hand as soon as the smiths head bent over the design tullin darted for the back door coulsie flicked her tailtip in satisfaction as she took the days kill from sunrunner tullin slithered in the doorway behind sunrunner carrying two arrowheads for the hunters bow he nodded and touched muzzles with his mate then handed the arrowheads to sunrunner i see youve had good hunting he said here are the three arrowheads you asked forand two more as a gift sunrunner took them bewildered but pleased for me a gift tullin nodded knowingly i think ironrose is very interested in you he would like to offer you a courtship token i think but he is too afraid you will reject him as the others have so i bring these to you for him though i know he would rather send his heart he is afraid of love but would welcome your friendship coulsie hissed at him shocked at his boldness tullin blinked one eye at her his claws flexing with repressed mischief ironrose surprises me coulsie murmured in the hertasi tongue it is a good move but one i thought he was too shy to make i didnt say he sent the two extra arrowheads now did i tullin said straightfaced nor did i say that he made them i said that they were a giftand so they are i made them for her myself coulsie flicked her tongue over her muzzle thoughtfully the hawkbrothers relied on the truthfulness of the hertasi folk and while tullin hadnt lied he hadnt told the full truth either tullin she murmured trust me tullin whispered i have a plan move over coulsie i cant see tullin prodded youre blocking the view she looked at him speculatively is ironrose coming he nodded wiggling to a comfortable position next to her and he finished the token it took me a long tune to talk him into bringing it with him i came ahead to check on things here and make sure that everything was prepared shonus got dinner for two set up hshama and huli have the kitchen relay ready and tsamar is cooling the ashdown tea over in the stream good good tullin said with satisfaction theres ironrose now hes slow tonight coulsie looked sympathetically at the tall form of the smith more awkward than usual and stiffer in his movementsif thats possible she noted as the smith began undressing look how carefully he folds his clothes taking his time this was a hard decision for him he looks scared tullin wiggled rubbing shoulders with her no more scared than i was when i danced my courting dance for you but i had tasted your scent and knew what the answer would be poor tasteblind hawkbrother only has what his eyes and his heart tell him the eyes and the heart are notorious liars not like the tongue you cannot lie to the tongue he slithered down from his perch i dont see the love token he made tullin sniffed critically the rose coulsie said yes its not in his clothes either tullin said rocking back on his heels he must have been afraid to bring it after all ill have to fix the oversight start the food and drinks ill be back in a moment he whispered as he slid through the leafy undergrowth the hunter toyed with the lacings of the smiths apron she had bartered a moons hunting for tallbush had managed to keep it a secret he was certain ironrose would like it very much she was not so sure considering the circumstances her heart told her it should be given in well if he didnt seem receptive to a courting gesture then it wasnt really one at all just a gift to a skilled artisan to thank him for his work nothing more easy to explain away sunrunner smoothed down the outfit coulsie had prepared for her it seemed entirely too soft and it fit the contours of her upper body perfectly below that it draped like a hawks tail when she walked at least it wasnt in some shocking color like a festival costume it was a comfortable warm gray speckled and smoothseamed the most confounding thing about it shed realized after it was on was that it had lacings oh the back that she couldnt reach herself how odd ironrose cursed himself for his ineptitude if only he was more romantic like his brethren he wouldnt feel like he was stumbling naked into a thornbush hed made the rose thinking of her the whole time crafting the petals with his most beloved tools he had cooled it with his own breath felt its heat radiating to his lips and imagined sunrunners kiss when he had polished it hed imagined sunrunners body smoothed under his hands and he had imagined her smile but now he was as nervous as he had ever been in his life he had mustered enough bravery to come here and meet her but he didnt have the courage to go any further than that then she appeared he looked longingly at her drowning in her hint of a smile wishing that he could say or do something sunrunner good evening please join me she looked for all the world like a gray falcon flying along the ground as she came closer when she slowed her walk her clothing billowed around her legs like a falcon spreading its tail to land she was grace itself in his eyes she gingerly laid down a pack and pulled back a few strands of hair from her eyes i wanted to thank you for the arrowheads and for everything i hope you like this a gift for me her face flushed red she nodded then looked away oh stars above she how could i have missed this opportunity ill look like a fool and she wont know that i a small taloned hand reached out and gently touched the smiths elbow he turned on a towel by the pool lay the iron rose gleaming softly in the starlight babysitter by josepha sherman josephs sherman is a fantasy writer and folklorist whose latest novels are the historical fantasiesthe shattered oathandforging the runesher latest folklore book is entitledtrickster tales thunder shook the earth and lightning seemed to shred the sky apart and leryn crammed into this barely dry little cave in the middle of the godsonlyknewwhere thought wryly of course why should my luck change now the whole expedition had been a farce from the start he acknowledged that now with flawless hindsight he was a city man curse it a settled gem merchant with a settled business what in the name of all the powers had possessed him to up and leave it to start over as a wandering merchant elenya lost elenyano bad enough to go traveling among the moreorless civilized peoples but why had he ever been mad enough to come up here to this cold rocky godsforsaken wilderness north of lake evendim elenya his mind insisted his dear one and the panicky flight from a grief that would not let him restno he would not think of that had he actually expected to start a profitable enough trade with the scattered little hunting parties their furs for his pretty gems furs ha what did he know of furs of course hed failed the locals had as the saying went seen him coming and no one had thought to warn him about the bandits who called the wilderness home leryn shivered of his troop only he remained alive and that only because hed been lucky enough to outrun those bandits lucky he was alive yesbut thoroughly lost in the wilderness with nothing more than his belt knife and the clothes on his back yes and with a storm like the end of the world raging all about him and did you want to live a voice deep within his mind wondered wouldnt it have been better to die at once and rejoin elenya no leryn said aloud then laughed without humor what difference did it make hed probably wind up dead anyhow more slowly of starvation or cold at least the horrendous storm seemed finally to be wearing itself out a few more rumbles one last flash of light a final burst of rain then silence almost too stiff to move leryn uncurled out of his cramped shelter stretching complaining muscles and for all the burden of chill fear within him he stood looking about for a moment almost in wonder gods it was beautiful out here even in the middle of all his trouble he had to admit that rocks and sturdy northern forest all cleanwashed and glittering in the first rays of sunlight breaking through the dissipating clouds the air was so clear and cold it made him cough eh well all this nature worship was fine but it wasnt helping his plight a bit he had a goodly way till sundown judging from what he could see of the sun and leryn shrugged in wry bravado if he headed due south he must eventually come out on the shores of lake evendim and from there eventually if he followed the lake along eastward maybe some friendly settlement and if he didnt well at least moving was better than standing around waiting to die but leryn hadnt gotten very far before he let out a startled yelp and dove in the prickly shelter of a thicket what was that something large tawnygold a gryphon had he actually seen a gryphon leryn freely admitted he knew next to nothing about the magical intelligent beings other than what probably fantastic stories the locals had told him all he could remember right now was that gryphons were definitely carnivorous but the gryphon ahead of him wasnt moving in the slightest and after a wary moment leryn struggled out of hiding and much to his surprise he heard himself gasp aloud in pity what a beautiful creature this was all lovely graceful sleeknessor rather what a beautiful creature it had been the poor beast must have been caught in the storm either the lightning struck it or the winds dashed it to the ground but why would such an experienced flyer judging from its enormous wings have taken such risks leryn saw the carcass of a deer still clutched in the gryphons claws and realized with a shock that itshe the gryphon was slender enough to be a sheshe then could only have been bringing food to her offspring but where was her mate didnt gryphons mate for life ah well there wasnt anything he could do even if he could by some wild chance find where shed hidden her young there wasnt any way he could help them leryn shook his head his own loss his elenya and the child who had died with herno and turned brusquely away but then he turned again and hesitantly approached the dead gryphon i hate to rob you but i need this more than you his belt knife wasnt the best tool for the job but at last wincing at the messiness of the whole process remembering days at home when servants bought and butchered and served his meat to him leryn managed to cut off a good hunk of venison what could he wrap it in leaves yes nice broad leaves like these there it made a squishy package slung over his back like this but at least he wasnt going to starve right away feeling a bit foolish leryn saluted the gryphon thank you youve given me life he headed on picking his careful way through a tangle of rocks but then something wriggled away from him some thing screamed in alarm a jong shrill skree of fright that shot right through leryns head what in the name of the terrified screaming broke off abruptly at the sound of his voice a brighteyed curvedbeaked little head poking up out of the rocks a gryphon a gryphon cub rather or pup oror whatever the babies were called you belonged to that poor creature didnt you leryn murmured and the baby stared poor little one you cant possibly understand that shes dead the baby trilled softly such a quick inquisitive little sound that leryn smiled in spite of himself youve never seen a human before have you no youre probably far too young for that probably never even left the nest beforebefore this the gryphon trilled again impatiently this time im hungry i the sound seemed to say im hungry and lonely and what are you going to do about it what indeed you shouldnt feed it leryn warned himself youll only be postponing the inevitable but the baby trilled yet again wriggling out of the rocks leryn froze enchanted what a funny chubby furry little thing it was about the size of a hunting houndthough no hound ever bore those silly little downy wings or that spotted striped yellowbrowntan baby fuzz the gryphon must be very young indeed because it was still just a touch unsteady on its toobigforitsbody paws damn cant just walk away uh well i do have some meat leryn told the baby i only hope you can eat solid food gryphons didnt nurse their young did they no not when even the babies sported those sharp curved beaks leryn unwrapped the slice of venison and the baby let out its earsplitting scream hey stop that im moving as fast as i can using his belt knife leryn cut off a tiny sliver of meat wondering aloud i hope you dont need your food regurgitated the way birds feed their chicks there are limits judging from the way the little gryphon practically tore the sliver of meat from his hand that wasnt going to be a problem it paused only long enough to gulp down the fragment then started to scream again hey hey i told you im cutting it up as fast as i can that didnt stop the earsplitting complaint leryn tapped the baby gently on the beak with the tip of his knife and the astonished gryphon fell silent staring at him in innocent wonder the man winced oh dont look at me like that ill give you a good meal but thats it after this youre on your own the baby continued to stare stop that dont you understand i cant stay here to take care of you and i cant take you with me youd never be able to keep up ha you can barely walk steadily as it is but the gryphon continued to watch him even as it gulped down meaty sliver after sliver at last it seemed to be full its little belly gently rounded with a satisfied little churr the baby collapsed on leryns feet staring adoringly up at him wonderful just wonderful now what am i going to do with you he reached a tentative hand down to the spotted baby down wondering if the little beast would let him touch it when it didnt even flinch he stroked the gryphon gently enjoying the fuzzy feel of it the baby smelled faintly of spicescinnamon was itand of that delicate newness that all young things seem to have in common and for a moment leryns hand paused in its stroking as he remembered another baby and elenya not i will notno ah gods leryn murmured to the gryphon i cant leave you here to die the baby churred again almost as though it understood and leryn sighed maybe this would work the little thing was about dogsized after all and he doubted it weighed much more a creature meant for flight couldnt be too heavy leryn sighed again knowing hed already come to a decision all right baby we travel together at least till i can find an adult gryphon to take care of you assuming the creature doesnt try to rend me apart first as a babythief ah well one problem at a time the gryphon had curled up on his feet sound asleep leryn continued to stroke the warm fuzzy fur and after a tune he realized much to his astonishment that he was smiling he stopped smiling about midway through the next day the gryphon had tagged along after him nicely enough for a while but it was a baby with a babys limited attention span and lack of sense first leryn had to rescue it from a pond into which the little thing had fallen while chasing a butterfly then he had to pry it out from between two rocks which were just a bit too close together to allow the gryphon to pass in between the baby would plop itself down with a babys suddenness instantly sound asleep or complaining with earsplitting pathos that it was hungry leryn glanced at the rapidly diminishing chunk of venison and winced it wasnt going to stay fresh much longer or for that matter judging from the gryphons appetite last much longer and what do i do when its gone im no hunter im not even carrying a decent knife gods i dont even have any way of starting a fire at least now that that spectacular deadly storm was past the weather remained dry but the air was cold and it grew colder as night fell leryn tried to sleep curled up in as tight a ball as he could manage struggling to ignore his aching hungry body but the earth was as chill as the air and for all his weariness he couldnt get comfortable enough to sleep but then a fuzzy little body warm as a furnace pushed itself against him the gryphon whimpering softly leryn drew the baby to him glad of its warmth and the two lonely beings at last slept leryn sank wearily to a rock head down the gryphon pushed against him trilling anxiously but the man ignored it too worn to care how many days had it been of endless walking of hunger and aching muscles and skin chafed raw from the clothes he couldnt change how many nights of broken sleep and cold neverending cold the last scraps of the bynowbarelyedible meat had been devoured by the baby a day ago and though the gryphon had managed to snap up enough bugs along the way to feed itor at least keep it from that earsplitting complainingthere hadnt been anything for a human to eat leryn had tried to fill his complaining stomach with spring water but the water had been so cold it chilled him to the bone you knew it was going to come to this sooner or later you knew you didnt have a chance of surviving i just didnt know it was going to take so long the gryphon cut into his bitterness pushing anxiously against him trilling and trilling in panic till at last leryn roused himself from thoughts of death he stared at the small frantic baby and slowly it came to him that he couldnt die not yet not while this small soveryalive creature was depending on him leryn reached out a weary hand to ruffle the gryphons fur then staggered to his feet come on baby well see how much farther we can get the gryphon shrilled in sudden alarm leryn stumbled back staring blankly at the men whod come out of hiding and into whose arms hed almost walked for a moment leryns mind simply refused to function noting only that these strangers were warmly clad and looked wellfed but the gryphon continued its shrill screaming stubby wings fluttering trying its baby best to defend him against bandits leryn realized through the haze of weariness maybe even the same who attacked me the first time what difference did it make he certainly didnt have anything on him of value and if they just waited a bit hed probably die of hunger or exhaustion and save them the trouble ofit was the gryphon they wanted they were going to kill his little friend for its fur or carry it off to captivity like hell you are leryn roared or at least thought he roared and charged the first bandit was so astonished by this rush of strength from such a wornout creature he didnt defend himself in time leryn tore the club from his hands and laid about with it with halfhysterical fury the gryphon baby shrilling a childish battle scream fought with himsmall sharp beak nipping small sharp talons scratching but of course they hadnt a chance of winning not one weary man and one little gryphon at least thisll be faster than dying of hunger leryn thought wryly thunder deafened him wild wind buffeted him for a dazed moment swathed in sudden shadow leryn could only wonder how a storm could have struck so swiftly but the storm was moving shrieking and all at once he realized that what was looming overhead was a gryphon two gryphons and he forgot all about the bandits as he stared in wonder at the living golden wonders soaring down at him the bandits didnt waste time in staring they scattered in all directions racing off into the underbrush like so many terrified rabbits and leryn could have sworn he heard one of the gryphons hiss in soft fierce laughter they landed in a wild swirling of wind and dust the baby gryphon let out one startled little yelp and ducked behind leryn then took a wary step out from hiding gaping every line of its small body rigid with astonishment for a long moment leryn stood frozen as well staring too weary for fright at the savage splendid vibrant size of them at the wise keen alien eyes watching him at the beaks wickedly elegant as curved swords that could snap him in two at the gleaming talons that could rend him apart as easily as he might tear wornout fabric he should be afraid leryn thought he really should but the last of his desperate strength was ebbing from him leryn felt his exhausted body crumple to its knees and then he knew nothing at all he woke slowly languorously to warmth wonderful spicyscented warmth meat was being pushed at his lips and if that meat was raw at least it was fresh and full of the promise of life and he chewed and swallowed without protest feeling the dawn of strength returning to him then leryn came to himself enough to realize he was cradled like a baby against a gryphons side a golden wing sheltering him and it was a deadly beak so gently offering him food the beings must have known he was halfdead for want of food and warmth ah warmth yes it was so good to be warm again warm and fed and cozy cozy as hed been with elenya his own sweet wife cuddled beside him in their bed and the promise of new life growing inside her the promise that had gone so terribly wrong the memories hit him without warning hit him so hard that leryn still too weak to control his will broke as he had not during all the long empty dryeyed days of mourning broke and wept against the warm tawny side sheltered under the soft golden wing while the gryphon churred ever so softly stroking his hair with a gentle beak as though he were her child her he had no doubt of his protectors gender and leryn heard or felt or sensed he couldnt have said how the gryphons own grief she who had died in the storm had been this ones sister long lost from the nest too proud too sure of herself heeding no ones advice taking an aging mate one whod died and left her and her young one alone race species were forgotten in their mingled grief and out of mingled grief came at least the seeds of healing eleyna eleyna i still miss you and shall miss you all my life but i am alive and i must go on being alive he could almost have sworn that somewhere far beyond space and time shed heard somewhere shed smiled leryn sat bolt upright the gryphon raised her wing to free him and he found himself staring into the wise amused eyes of her mate ssso you live you speak leryn reddened ii mean of course you speak its justi didnt expecti dont know what i expected the gryphon chuckled we hardly expected you to ssspeak our tongue uh no i uh im not familiar with your kind leryn glanced about seeing a neatwalled cave no not a cave a ruin of some sort humanbuilt but plainly now the gryphon pairs nest but the baby he suddenly remembered the little gryphon where is a small thunderbolt sent him staggering back into the side of the female gryphon the baby leaping at him churring with delight wriggling like a happy puppy until a quiet word in the gryphon tongue made it reluctantly settle to the floor youve brought my sssisssters child to me the female gryphon murmured for that we thank you you kept the little one alive said the male and that he added with a chuckle as the wriggling baby eyed then pounced on his tufted tail could have been no easssy thing for that we thank you too i could hardly have let aa child die a little shiver ran through leryn at the memory of his own son whod never known the touch of life but he continued resolutely besides the child kept me alive it was true enough without this little ball of fur i would have given up a long time ago yesss but now the quessstion isss what do we do with you ah what indeed no funds no weapons not even a change of clothes i dont know in my home town im a merchant of gems but gemsss the pretty ssstonesss you humansss like then thessse mussst belong to you my gem pouches where did you the male gryphon licked his talons with a lazy tongue i chasssed the banditsss he murmured eyes glinting dangerously it wasss good sssport and asss they fled they dropped everything they bore leryn stared at the fortune glittering in his hands his gems returned to him ah gods now he could start over and not waste the life hed been given suddenly it was all too ridiculous leryn burst into laughter gasping iive come a long way just to find thethe path back to myself and i could have managed without the hardships thank you but he added bending to stroke the babys furry head i think everyones happy with how things worked out everyone sssave the banditsss the gryphons murmured and gave

recesses of the tiring house of the azure swan theater painted actors frantically changing costume squirmed past me glaring at the intruder obstructing the way their ill will didnt bother me half as much as the flowery rhetoric being declaimed on stage that nights play was the bride and the battlesteed a tragedy that blends mawkish sentimentality with a flawless ignorance of life on the dhorisha plains suffering through a particularly lachrymose soliloquy i wished that the theater would catch fire just to terminate the performance try not to think things like that one never knows what gods are listening an instant later i heard a boom some of the audience cried out and the fortyyearold ingenue ranting on stage faltered in midlament something began to hiss and crackle i scrambled to the nearest of the rear stage entrances looked out and saw that a patch of thatch on the roof of the lefthand gallery was burning then the straw above the royal familys empty box exploded into flame the two fires raced along the roof like lovers rushing to embrace at the same time they oozed down the columns into the topmost of the three tiers of seats i peered about but could see no sign of the enemy id been hired to stop shrieking people shoved along the galleries toward the stairs others climbed over the railings and dropped into the cobbled courtyard where they joined the stampede of groundlings driving toward the exit at the rear of the enclosure in half a minute the passage was jammed it was plain that not everyone would make it out that way there was a stage door in the back of the tiring house but none of the audience had come in that way nor was it visible from any of their vantage points so none of them thought to use it abandoning my efforts to spot the incendiary i ran forward past two wooden columns painted to resemble marble to the foot of the stage though the blaze had yet to descend past the highest gallery i could already feel the heat this way i shouted theres another exit nobody paid the least attention perhaps between the roar of the fire and the panicky cries no one heard i jumped off the platform grabbed a strapping towheaded youth with bloodstained sleevesa butchers apprentice i imagineand tried to turn him around come with me i said he snarled and threw a roundhouse punch at my head i ducked and hit him in the belly he doubled over i manhandled him toward the stage im trying to help you i said theres another way out go behind the stage the door will be on your right do you understand evidently he did because when i let him go he clambered onto the proscenium i induced several other people to head backstage eventually others noticed them going and followed which soon threatened to create a second crush at the rear stage doors i sprang onto the platform and dashed back there to manage the flow of traffic as best i could with pleas when possible and my hands when necessary by now the air was gray with smoke i kept coughing the heavensthe machine room above me the underside of which was painted to resemble the skystarted burning sparks and scraps of flaming debris rained down at last the stage was clear my handkerchief pressed to my face i scurried toward the exit the ceiling burst a windlass used to lower the actors portraying gods and their regalia plummeted through the breach and struck where id just been standing the impact shattered the floorboards when i escaped the playhouse i trotted some distance away not only to make sure that i was out of danger but to better survey the overall situation turning i noticed something strange fortunately the azure swan stood on a spit of land that stuck out into the river it wasnt close to any other structure for a while the flames enveloping the building swayed this way and that as if groping for some other edifice they could spread to at times they appeared to move against the breeze two candlemarks later those of us who had sought to defend the theater regrouped in a private room in a nearby tavern this council of war included several blades of the blue political faction which vied with the reds yellows blacks and most bitterly with the greens for control of mornedealth an equal number of their retainers draydech the sorcerer and myself and a singed grimy malodorous and surly lot we were too also present was lady elthea widow of a middling prominent blue leader owner of the three businesses that had thus far burned and my employer though elderly and infirm shed insisted on venturing forth from her mansion to view the site of the latest disaster all right i said we searched the swan beforehand without finding any incendiary devices did anyone see a figure on the roof or any flaming missiles the other men shook their heads then its magic kindling these fires lady elthea thats the only logical explanation i looked at draydech do you concur the warlock was a short fellow in his late thirties younger than i though with his wobbling paunch graying goatee and the broken veins in his bulbous nose he looked older hed served his apprenticeship living rough with the nomadic whispering oak wizards of the deep forests afterward hed embraced the amenities of civilization with a vengeance id never seen him eat a raw piece of fruit or vegetable drink water or go out in inclement weather nevertheless hed lost none of the skills hed mastered in the wilderness he was particularly adept at sniffing out mystical energies and despite his exorbitant fees and extortionate habits i retained him whenever that kind of witchy bloodhound work seemed likely to be in order now however raising his eyes from the chunk of amber hed been staring into while the rest of us glumly guzzled our wine he said certainly its magic judging from the appearance of the conflagration someones conjured a salamander a being from the elemental plane of fire to do the job but i cant find it i scowled old friend this is not the time to angle for more gold lady elthea extended her trembling hand her skin was like parchment her knuckles swollen with arthritis sorcerer i beseech you some of our fellow citizens died tonight more could perish tomorrow if you can help prevent this dont hold back jarnac one of the blue blades rose from the trestle table ill take care of it lady elthea he said he was a lanky sandyhaired youth dressed lavishly but not tastefully in a sapphire and rubystudded particolored doublet with intricately carved ivory buttons at his side hung the latest rage one of the new smallswords this one sporting a golden hilt smallswords looked elegant and were adequate for fighting another gentleman similarly equipped but they were apt to prove too flimsy against a heavier weapon or an armored foe which was why i was still lugging my broadsword around as might have been inferred from jarnacs ostentation he was new money with a parvenus eagerness to parade his wealth and sense of style unlike most of his cronies in the room he couldnt claim kinship with one of the fifty noble houses not that that mattered to me my birth was considerably humbler than his he dropped a fat purse on the table coin clinked take it magician he urged and rest assured theres plenty more where that came from draydech gazed longingly at the money i fancy he came close to licking his lips but at last he shook his head and said i cant take it sir because im not sure i can earn it despite master seldens slander he shot me a reproachful glance which given our shared history failed to inspire any remorse i wasnt trying to inflate my price rather i was attempting to explain that something odd has happened we all should have seen the salamander theyre not invisible quite the contrary even if its summoner veiled it in a glamour should still have spotted it but i didnt whats more ive been sitting here scrying and i cant pick up its trail apparently someones developed a cunning new type of cloaking spell sensing that he was telling the truth i said and until you work out how to pierce the charm you cant banish the spook or guide us to its master either is that about the gist of it im afraid so i sighed what more can you tell us about salamanders a sorcerer enlists the aid of an elemental by opening a gate to its home plane then bartering for its services it was probably fairly easy to recruit a salamander to start fires they love to do it anyway the trick will be to keep it under control to make sure it only burns what the summoner wants it to fire is a threat to any town in mornedealth built all of wood the menace was all the greater remembering how the theater blaze had flowed against the wind the beginnings of a headache tightening my brow i wondered how our problem could get any worse the answer was immediately forthcoming pivor lady eltheas grandnephew and closest living kin sprang up from his bench he did belong to the fifty and no mistaking it he had the kind of exquisite features and supercilious carriage that only generations of controlled inbreeding can produce enough of this prattle he said the mage has already admitted he cant aid us so well have to help ourselves we know who to blame for our troubles the greens the company murmured agreement theyd all seen the unsigned threat written in emerald ink that someone had tacked to lady eltheas door the night before the first fire so i say we strike back at them at once no lady elthea said i dont want pivor ignored her a lot of them drink at the honeycomb we can lie in wait in the alley that runs thats a bad idea i said my gut tells me that not all the greens are involved in this we need to identify the ones who are indiscriminate slaughter would only compound our difficulties if we kill enough of them the ones who remain will be afraid to send the spirit out again no they wont i said theyll merely seek to butcher you in turn pivors lip curled i heard that when you founded your fencing academy you swore your days as a hiresword were over you heard correctly i said twentyfive years of soldiering was enough unfortunately i have a penchant for losing horses and needy friends when the combination depletes my coffers i accept commissions of a certain sort pray tell why are we discussing this i was just conjecturing that you gave up the mercenary life because youve turned coward for truly you seem afraid to fight no doubt he said it to shame me into supporting his strategy but of course there was only one proper response to such an insult and that wasnt it simply because jarnac was near me i turned to him sir would you do me the honor of acting as my second one of pivors friends said that figures one baseborn fellow looks to the other jarnac colored it would be better if you asked someone else master selden because i agree with pivor not in his assessment of your character he added hastily but about whats best to do we shouldnt waste time trying to ferret out one man from the mass of our foes we should wage war on them all balm one of my more promising students said ill stand for you master selden thank you i said i gave pivor my best killers glare then perhaps we can arrange this straightaway ill give him credit i couldnt stare bun down but he grew pale no doubt in belated remembrance of my reputation verrano will you act for me he stammered stop this lady elthea said didnt you all come here for the same purpose to succor a poor old woman who needs your help desperately then i beg you please dont fight among yourselves this time pivor chose to heed her youre right of course moreover this is your affair and if you think this man should be in charge so be it he bowed to me master selden for my grandaunts sake i apologize i bowed back and for her sake i accept if we arent going to massacre the greens what are we going to do draydech asked the gentlemen of the blues will keep guarding my ladys properties i said perhaps one of them will spot our human foe lurking about the scene youll try to devise a magic that will locate the salamander ill nose around and see what i can uncover through more mundane channels and by working together well put an end to this outrage i wished i were as confident as i was trying to sound i contrived to approach the house from the rear then hid behind the stable after a while a maid trudged out the back door and started tossing feed to the chickens the birds were plump and lively she thin and lethargic their feathers shone white in the morning sunlight while her gown was drab and threadbare in short they looked better cared for than she was which was more or less what id expected her employer was famous for the sumptuous banquets he gave for his fellow greens but provided one talked to the poor as well as the prosperous equally notorious for his miserly treatment of his servants i checked the windows of the fourstory dwelling making sure no one was peering out then stepped from concealment hello i said the girl jumped who are you a friend i showed her the tradesilver in my hand with a proposition she looked yearningly at the money reminding me fleetingly of draydech but then she scowled and said im not that kind you mistake me i said i just want to ask you some questions about things you may have noticed or overheard though i must admit theres a chance that something you say could embarrass your master so ill understand if you decline she glanced over her shoulder at the house then snatched the coin what do you want to know the racket in the honeycomb was deafening the tavern was packed most of the patrons were roaring drunk and two lunatics were playing bagpipes we lads at the corner table had to bellow with the rest to make ourselves heard and that was that said one of my companions a burly hiresword with a forked beard a broken nose and a green favor pinned to the sheepskin collar of his jacket when they saw that armed only with a soup ladle id killed eight of their band in half as many seconds the rest of the bastards turned tail amazing i said i was trying to sound admiring and truly i was impressed by his powers of invention i stroked my false whiskers the way i always do when i wear them to make sure they arent failing off of course if what we hear in valdemar is true its no wonder you men of mornedealth are master warriors folk say you keep in constant practice fighting one another for instance you greens are at odds with the silvers isnt that so the blues someone corrected pardon me the blues whats that all about anyway and whos winning smiling slyly the fellow with the broken nose said im afraid thats a very long story and my throats already parched taking the hint i waved for the barkeep to bring another jug lithe and lightningquick marissa flowed through the gloomy practice hall a dagger flashing in either hand and her short black hair flying about her head when she finished the exercise i said your high guard is a hair too high says you she replied if shed kept to her usual schedule shed been practicing hard for a candlemark but she wasnt even slightly winded good evening selden stop by to sign up for some lessons who could afford your rates i said sauntering from the doorway into the hall well perhaps i could if i could stay away from the hippodrome but thats by the by i need information about the greens a childs adventures by janni lee simner janni lee simner grew up in new york and has been making her way west ever since she spent nearly a decade in the midwest where the recent floods formed some of the background for this story currently she lives hi the much drier arizona desert shes sold stories to nearly two dozen anthologies and magazines includingrealms of fantasy and sisters in fantasy her first three booksghost horse the haunted trailandghost visionhave been published by scholastic when the companion first appeared in the marketplace inya hoped it had come for one of the grandchildren such a thing wasnt unheard of even in a village as small as rivers bend companions were said not to care about rank or about where people were born the people milling around the square froze at the sound of those bridle bells at the sight of the graceful white creature too perfect to be a horse trailing silver and skyblue trappings the companion had no rider and everyone knew what that meant she had come searching maybe for one of them lara fidgeted at inyas side and inya squeezed the girls hand mariel stood beside them largeeyed and still lara was too young but mariel just sliding into the awkward lankiness between childhood and adulthood was not companions came for children mariels age all the time anyone who spent an evening listening to a tavern minstrel knew that the companion tossed her head mane falling down her back like soft winter snow sapphire eyes scanning the crowd then she started forward bells jingling steps light and quick inya heard mariel catch her breath after all shed heard the minstrels too but maybe just this once the stories would turn true the companion stepped toward them until inya saw her breath frosty in the late autumn air another step and she would be within reach another step a wet silky muzzle nudged inyas chest she looked down startled the companion looked back at her through eyes bright and very deep inya felt herself falling drowning in that endless blue at the bottom waited friendship and welcoming and a life without loneliness the world tilted crazily around her but for a long moment she didnt care the moment ended inya pulled herself away flinging the companions reins to the ground she hadnt even realized she was holding them the ground steadied beneath her the world came back into focus the companion kept staring at her something brushed inyas mind soft as a feather ichoose you a voice whispered after all my searching i choose you as a child inya had dreamed about hearing that voice but that was a long time ago she didnt have tune now for a childs adventures she had a farm to keep up she had grandchildren to raise and someone had to look after the girls father too the companion had made a mistake inya couldnt run off not now go away inya whispered she twisted a gray strand of hair between her fingers im too old youre too late go away the companion shook her head you take one of the children theyre who youre looking for not me the companion snorted a surprisingly horselike sound she knelt beside inya inviting her to mount no inya turned from the companions sapphire eyes her foot slipped on a loose stone and pain shot through her knee so sharp she caught her breath she stood still for several minutes waiting for the pain to fade even if she could leave her home and her family she couldnt follow the companion who ever heard of a herald with bad knees with joints that ached whenever it rained she felt warm breath on her neck the muscles down her back tensed go away youve made a mistake i wish mistakes like that would happen to me inya turned to see mariel standing beside her the bag with their purchases swinging from one shoulder the girls face had a twisted angry look you should have come for mariel inya thought again she sighed taking mariels hand she had to get home to start on dinner to clean the house whatever dreams shed had as a child she didnt have time now to argue with companions lara came up at inyas other side and inya took her hand too people lingered in the square staring inya ignored them she started past the jumble of stalls and vendors toward home lara twisted around and looked over her shoulder shes following us the girl giggled as if the idea were terribly funny mariel dropped inyas hand turning to look for herself you have to stop she said you cant just leave her there mariels voice was fierce you cant its not your place to tell me what i can or cant do inya said sharply now come along she kept walking mariel followed but she wouldnt take inyas hand again all the way home inya didnt turn around even though she heard the companions steps light as snowfall behind her by the time they got home an icy rain was falling turning the dirt road to mud inya shivered dropping laras hand to pull her cloak close around her shoulders over the steady patter of the rain inya no longer heard the companions hoofs maybe she had finally gone away lara started to run and inya unable to keep up let her mariel followed her sister the two of them racing for the house inya skirted the edge of the fields where the girls father was working jory nodded as she walked past he was splattered with mud brown curls plastered to his face beside him a dappled brown horse was hooked to the plow deep in mud itself beyond their land through the trees inya saw the dark band of the river even from where she stood she could tell the water was rising tongues of water lapped at the trees inya kept walking past a battered barn and on to the house she started a fire in the kitchen hearth and made the girls change into dry clothes mariel avoided inyas eyes she wouldnt talk to her and she ran back outside as soon as shed changed muttering something about helping her father inya sighed she started on dinner lara by her side trying to help but mostly just getting flour in her face and short curls the fire quickly took the chill from the room and the smell of simmering soup made the cold outside feel even farther away inya kneaded the smooth hard dough beneath her fingers trying to forget the companions bottomless eyes trying to forget the silky whisper in her head jory and mariel came in just after dark they ate in silence jory wolfed down his food face tired and tight mariel didnt eat at all just stared at inya with an unreadable expression outside the wind picked up whistling through the gaps around the door one of the hinges was wearing loose inya needed to fix it before winter jory looked up i spoke to old caron today jorys tangled curls fell into his face lara looked a lot like him mariel was the one who looked like their mother inyas daughter she couldnt believe anara had been gone almost a year inya fixed her gaze on jory whatd caron say he offered me half again what hed offered beforemore than this farms ever going to make on its own jory buttered a thick slice of bread i said id think about it inya stiffened its not your decision to make the farm had been in her family for generations since before rivers bend was more than a few scattered houses before the village even had a name well maybe you should think about it too jory said theyd had this discussion before caron had first approached jory nearly two years ago the farm once a candlemarks walk from the next nearest house was now close to the village the merchant wanted to build a tavern there and maybe a couple of shops at first jory had refused just as inya expected him to then anara had died giving birth to a child who died a few hours after her after that jory took caron more seriously my heart isnt in this place anymore hed told inya once jorys family had moved to rivers bend when he was a child he didnt know what it was like to be in a place for hundreds of years to stay with it through good times and bad we could move up to haven jory had finished the bread and reached for the ale pitcher with what carons willing to pay we could start all over again this is our home anywhere can be home jorys voice rose unless youre too foolish to let it be jory inya kept her own voice low she wouldnt yell in front of the children what would you do in the city youre a farmer my grandfather worked leather its a trade i could learn if i set my mind to it we belong here you always say that suddenly jory was standing yelling across the table we belong where we can make a living mariel silently left the kitchen lara followed her into the bedroom inya let them go it was bad enough theyd lost their mother they shouldnt have to worry about losing their home too youre a fool jory said but he didnt say anything more somehow with the childrens leaving the argument had ended for now inya sighed and started clearing the table shed just finished the dishes when the door flew open and mariel staggered in her clothes were soaked through water streamed from her hair she shivered thunder rumbled outside inya hurried her to the hearth she hadnt seen mariel leave the girl must have climbed out one of the bedrooms shuttered windows inya winced had the argument with jory upset her so much that she didnt want to go through the kitchen again mariel stared at the flames her face had a strange look eyes very large and dark inya hoped she hadnt caught a chill she put water on for tea what do you think youre doing running around in the rain like that youll make yourself sick i had to feed the animals mariels teeth chattered your father would have done that i had to do it the tea boiled inya poured mariel a steaming mug of it then added a spoonful of honey mariel took the cup eagerly inya poured herself a cup as well just listening to the wind made her shiver her joints were stiffening with dampness she knew she wouldnt sleep well she sipped the hot tea staring at mariel over the cups rim mariels clothes and hair were drying shed stopped shivering too she looked a lot like her mother had at that age from the dark eyes to the long stringy hair for a moment inya thought she saw anara sitting there not a married woman but a girl halfway between childhood and adulthood staring at her through serious eyes grandma are you all right mariels voice brought inya back to the present inya brushed a hand across her face im fine are you warmer now mariel nodded why dont you go on to bed then come with me mariel sounded suddenly young ill be along in a moment inya watched as mariel left the room then she stood wincing at the weight on her knees she walked slowly to the door examining the wornout hinge she felt a tingling at the base of her skull some instinct made her undo the latch she opened the door staring out into the cold wet night the wind had died the moon shone through the dark clouds lighting the field and something stood beneath that moon too perfect to be a horse its white hide shone brighter than any moon inya slammed the door shut again the hinge creaked in protest she realized she was crying cant follow you dont you understand the companion didnt answer and inya didnt open the door again she banked the fire and stumbled into bed that night she dreamed of halfgrown childrenmariel anara even herself as a girl only all the girls had blue eyes bright as sapphire inya knew that wasnt right though in the dream she couldnt think why inya woke in the dark not sure what had stirred her rain crashed against the roof thunder rumbled she crawled out of bed the dirt floor was cold and damp beneath her feet even through heavy socks her knees and ankles ached she walked slowly toward the kitchen jory stood by the door holding a lantern the yellow light cast shadows on his face his shoulders were tight hunched together he looked tired inya tensed whats wrong it rained harder than i thought last night the rivers rising fast if it doesnt crest by the end of the week the farmll flood out sooner if the rain keeps up inya bit her lip shed known the water was high but shed thought they had more time there hadnt been a flood since she was a girl people had come from the village then helping her parents build floodwalls of mud and wood together theyd held the water back jory ran a hand through his hair soon as the suns up im going to start digging inya nodded suddenly wide awake ill send the children into town with word that we need help jory nodded he opened the door again the sky was dark still more black than gray rain fell in icy sheets there was no moon no companion standing in the field perhaps she had given up and gone away jory stepped back out closing the door behind him inya went to wake the children mariel was already up lara poked out from under the blankets yawning and rubbing her eyes inya explained as quickly and calmly as she could while the sun rose and thin light crept around the shuttered windows will we have to swim lara sounded so worried that inya didnt know whether to laugh or cry of course not inya spoke as gently as she could were going to sit down and have breakfast same as always then im going to send you into town with a message for the mayor as a child inya had taken a similar message to the mayors grandfather rivers bend hadnt had a mayor back then but there had been a village council and hed been on it while the girls munched on reheated soup and cold bread inya wrote the message then she bundled lara and mariel into warm clothes and followed them outside the rain had let up and pale yellow light filtered through the clouds the warm rays felt good on inyas face she didnt have time to stand around though the dishes needed washing and the door needed mending she had to check for new leaks in the roof too and with jory and the girls out all morning she needed to make something warm for lunch she went back inside closing the door behind her the rain started again soon after the girls left no thunder this time and not much wind just a steady drizzle that stole all the warmth from the air inya found herself shivering even inside she worked slowly knees and ankles complaining as she did lara didnt return until well past noon she pulled off her boots sat down by the hearth and stretched out her feet to warm them wheres mariel shes lara hesitated shes outside helping dad inya nodded she put water on for tea then sat down beside lara they made me wait a long time lara said they wouldnt let me see the mayor but they took the note to him and came back with an answer its in my pocket lara pulled out a sheet of wet crumpled paper the ink ran but inya could still make out the writing she read the letter slowly then she read it again unable to believe the words much of it was formal meaningless prose thanking her for writing and expressing concern for her family but two lines told her what the message really meant while we share concern for your property and safety the village has not gone unaffected by this rain and our own affairs occupy most of our time i can make no promises though we will send what help we can when we can anger blurred inyas sight what help we can when we can that meant thered be no help at all and our own affairs that meant the farms affairs were not the villages affairs not their concern at all things had been different when inya was a girl the farm and village had worked together in her grandmothers day the farm had even been the larger of the two thered been no question then about whether the villagers would help hold the water back they had helped just like inyas family had helped the villagers during hard winters supplying food and charging only what they could afford inya wondered when things had changed she wondered why she hadnt noticed shed been busyraising children raising grandchildren working on the farm but how could she have missed what was happening around her she threw the message into the fire the wet paper hissed then burst into flames turning to ash as she watched she found jory by the river ankledeep in mud leaning on his shovel and staring at the water a wall of dirt and wood began upstream beyond the house and extended to where he stood the current swirled swiftly by carrying tree branches loose reeds clumps of grass something that looked like a broken chair floated past inya shuddered jory shook his head splattering water around him i can save the house he said his voice was hoarse but not the barn and the rest of the land not without help there wont be any help inya told him about the mayors note jory brushed a hand across his dirtstreaked face doesnt surprise me thats how people are you know watch out for themselves first and for everyone else if they have any time left over but people werent like that inya thought not everywhere they hadnt been in rivers bend not when she was a girl she stared at jory not sure what to say if he assumed people only cared about themselves no wonder he wanted to move one place was the same as another if you saw the world like that an awful thought crossed inyas mind if the people in rivers bend didnt care did that mean it was time to leave to find a place where they did ill finish securing the house tonight jory said and see what i can do about the fields in the morning inya nodded at least youve had mariel helping you mariel jory squinted i havent seen her all day what do you mean ice trickled down inyas spine lara said she was with you jory shook his head ill go look for her you talk to lara inya hurried toward the house boots squishing in the mud she slowed down when her legs began to ache sweat trickled down her face in spite of the cold she threw the door open and went inside lara still sat by the fire wheres your sister lara started i promised not to tell lara shes in the barn the girls words tumbled over one another its not my fault she made me promise relief washed over inya of course mariel was all right shed been silly to think otherwise the girl had probably run off to be alone anara had done the same at mariels age how long has she been there all day well inya would have to talk to mariel about that the girl had no right to send lara into town alone dont tell her i told lara begged inya didnt answer she gulped down a mouthful of warm tea and went back outside she found jory in the barn staring at the ground mariel was nowhere in sight look at this jorys voice was strained cold dread settled in inyas stomach she followed his gaze the muddy barn floor was covered with mariels boot prints but there was a second set of prints too and those werent human hoof prints inya knelt to have a closer look the prints were large larger than any horse inya had owned she examined a print more carefully short white hairs were scattered in the mud they were bright and fine and even hi the mud hadnt gathered any dirt inya caught her breath the companion had leftand had taken mariel with her inya smiled though she felt a tinge of sadness too you see anything down there yes she told jory about the companion leaving out her own role in the tale it was mariels story now after all as it should be jory didnt smile in a thin voice he asked do you think shes all right mariel was chosen inya thought of course she was all right but she realized she didnt really know what happened after someone was chosen the companion would head to haven and the collegium but that was more than a week away what would mariel eat did she have warm clothes why had she left without saying goodbye inya examined the prints again they led out of the barn toward the river mariel never mounted just continued alongside the companion didnt heralds always ride probably everything was all right probably inya was just a crazy old woman worrying too much but probably wasnt enough we have to find her bring her some food make sure shes all right jory nodded but then he looked back toward the river and inya knew what he was thinking if he went after mariel they might lose the farm ill go inya said thats crazy jory brushed his hands against his breeches no it isnt inya spoke fast afraid she might believe him if she didnt on horse i can make decent time even with my knees what i cant do is keep the farm from flooding out you can itll be dark soon ill bring a lantern i can carry it and walk once the sun goes down inya didnt know how long she could manage on foot but shed worry about that later she stared at jory hoping hed see that she was right i dont like it jory looked at inya through tired eyes he needed to rest much more than inya did hed been building walls all day after all ill take another look around the farm he said maybe she hasnt gone all that far ill start packing inya told him by the time she was ready to leave the sun was low casting gold light through the drifting clouds jory hadnt found marielboth her boot prints and the companions hooves followed the river disappearing upstream jory didnt argue any further he saddled the dappled horse and helped inya mount her knees ached unused to being twisted out for riding but she gritted her teeth and ignored the pain her hips complained too at the way they stretched across the saddle inya reminded lara to listen to her father reminded jory that there was some reheated soup on the fire then she left following the tracks past the edge of the farm the sun soon dipped below the horizon but the light stayed with her for a while the moon rose above pink and orange clouds inyas breath came out in frosty puffs the scattered trees grew thicker beyond their land until inya rode at the edge of a forest the mud deepened and she had to slow down inya stopped just as the last light faded she didnt want to dismount but she needed to rest and get something to eat better to go slow than to wear herself out she eased herself out of the saddle her legs wobbled as she hit the ground she hadnt realized that getting off would hurt more than getting on she ate by yellow lamplight munching on some bread while the horse grazed nearby by the time she was ready to move on the moon had slipped behind a cloud taking the horses reins in one hand and the lamp in the other she started walking inya tired much more quickly on foot every candlemark it seemed she had to stop rest and eat something small swirls of water appeared in the mud and the swirls turned into puddles mud coated her boots water soaked through her socks cold air numbed her face and fingers she pulled out the scarf and gloves shed packed the next time she stopped shed change her socks as well she was glad shed packed extra clothes when she was younger she probably wouldnt have bothered but back then she could have managed in spite of her foolishness she didnt have that luxury now the puddles widened until inya had to veer into the woods to get around them she lost track of how long she walked then she saw that the sky had turned from black to dark gray it was almost morning the very thought made her tired she stopped to rest wondering how much farther mariel had gone the gray sky lightened a thin band of color appeared along the horizon birds chirped across the treetops there was another animal too farther away but inya couldnt hear it as well it made a low sound more like a cry than anything else a childs cry fear tingled down inyas spine mariel she took off upstream at a run her legs protested but she ignored the pain shut it away to deal with later in the growing light she saw that the ground had turned uneven in spots the water surrounded small islands of land she found mariel on one of those islands the girl stared at the water eyes wide her clothes were rumpled and muddy as if shed slept on the damp ground the water wasnt very wide but it was still and therefore deep grandma mariel looked up redeyed i fell asleep there wasnt any water when i fell asleep inya wanted to reach out and hug her instead she just called out im here mariel as calmly as she could a distant corner of her mind wondered where the companion had gone shed worry about that later after she got mariel off the island youll have to swim you can throw your shoes across to me first thatll make it easier i cant mariel choked on a sob of course you can ill be right here waiting for you no mariel began to cry i cant swim i dont know how for a moment inya didnt believe her she was sure shed taught mariel to swim herself but no anara was the child shed taught shed assumed anara had taught her children in turn inya might be able swim to the island herself but she couldnt make it back not while carrying someone and the damp logs on the ground were too soft and slippery to walk across in the distance the dappled horse let out a nervous nicker if the horse could swim it could carry them both across but the mare had a terror of water that no one had broken grandma mariel shivered drawing her arms around herself inya felt cold toofrozen unable to move unable to think what to do next her skull tingled there was a sudden flash of sapphire bright and deep gone before inya was certain she saw it the sky was gray with pale streaks where the light filtered through somehow that flash of blue unfroze her allowed her to think again she couldnt use the dappled mare but maybe she could call someone else someone who had no right to have left mariel in the first place but shed worry about that later thea inya didnt know where the name came from but she knew it was right thea call you for a moment the air was still the birds in the treetops silent then inya heard a soundlike a nicker only higher lighter more graceful hoofs hit the dirt lightly with only the faintest whisper of noise and the companion stood before her mud splattered her saddle but the white coat was bright beneath the overcast sky the creature seemed to glow and her eyes no inya wouldnt look into her eyes she wanted to be able to let her go when she was through the companion snorted pawing one foot against the ground she almost seemed impatient all right then thea youre the one who left mariel stranded now youre going to help get her out i did not leave her she ran away on her own i only followed because i was worried about her safety but thea knelt inviting inya to mount the companion was larger than the dappled horse and wider inyas hips stretched painfully across the saddle yet thea moved more smoothly than any horse when she stepped forward inya barely felt the motion she almost didnt notice when thea stepped into the water not until the water came up to her feet and soaked through her breeches water sloshed over the saddle and the companion used her strong legs to swim inya clutched the wet mane drew her legs more tightly around the saddle then the water turned shallow again thea stepped up onto dry land and inya shivered as the air hit her wet clothes grandma inya eased her way out of the saddle and took mariel in her arms she wouldnt take me mariel sobbed she buried her face in inyas shoulder she was in the barn and you didnt want her anyway but she wouldnt take me inya whirled to face the companion glaring how dare you get a childs hopes up like that how dare you follow her this far and not choose her you lied to her thats what you did no i never claimed to choose her though she begged me to i did not know my presence on the farm would bother her so i did not know she would run away i went after her but i could not persuade her to return so choose her now its not too late no i choose you damn you inya turned away facing mariel again shes still youngyoung enough for a childs adventures she has an entire life in front of her there is no right or wrong age for such things inya laughed a bitter sound you dont know much about the responsibilities that come with adulthood then or about the ailments that come with old age thea snorted know that youve had the strength to keep your family together through death and hard times youve had the strength too to travel through the night steadily and in spite of pain to rescue a child these are not small virtues they are virtues that would serve a herald well thats not enough inya said the companion stamped a foot it squished against the mud know also that youre more sensible than a child would be you packed extra supplies made sure you stopped to rest before you collapsed from exhaustion you would never die for the stupid reasons young people die your age makes you more likely to be taken seriously too in negotiations and other diplomatic matters there are a thousand reasons need i list them all inya felt anger again not for mariels sake but for her own she brushed hot tears aside with one hand why in all the havens didnt you come sooner why didnt you come when i could still leave thea came up behind inya leaning a silky muzzle against her neck inya turned to look at the companion and made the mistake of meeting her eyes she felt herself falling drowning in a field of endless sapphire blue choose you dont you understand now neither of us will ever be alone need to take care of jory and the children i cant just follow you away she knew though that jory would welcome the chance to move to the city and the villagers would hardly notice they were gone couldnt come sooner i was not yet in this world and then i was too young ive come now will you have me inya took a deep breath her next words surprised her i dont know dont know what grandma inya looked down to see mariel staring at her she hadnt realized shed spoken aloud can wait while you decide there was the farm to take care of the water to hold back and the land had been in her family for so long no matter how hard the villagers turned their backs inya wouldnt walk away without thinking a good long time how long are you willing to wait as long as you need thea met inyas eyes again but this time inya didnt drown in them instead something rose up from the companion a warmth that surrounded her made her understand what it truly meant to never be alone she was crying again but this time she didnt even wipe the tears away she knew then what her answer to the companion would be shed wait a while to give it but she knew grandma are you okay your grandmother is fine grandma mariels face lit up she spoke to me did you hear she wouldnt choose me but at least she spoke thats something isnt it yes thats something you should have taken mariel she thought again but she didnt know whether she meant it something brushed her mind featherlight inya smiled she reached out and hugged mariel thea did not speak again not then and not for a long time afterward the companion knelt down letting inya and mariel mount the three of them crossed the river and together began the long journey home blood ties by stephanie d shaver stephanie shaver is a twentysomething writer living in missouri in her spare time she works on the obligatory novel and short stories but most of her time is taken up attending school where shes majoring in computer science and writing code for an online games company she has worked atmarion zimmer bradleys fantasy magazineand considers it one of the great experiences of her life of this story she says i wrote this story for the anthology a long time ago back when i was still in my angry young woman phase misty has always been a strong force in my life beginning at the age of thirteen i can only thank her for introducing me to a world of magic and wonder a feeling i hope to someday breathe into my own works dedication to mr brian devaneyrespected teacher good friendand one of the few true heralds in this world rivin from where he sat at the table the boy looked up at his father he had been rubbing his fingersnear to blistering from chopping wood all daytrying to get the ache out of them holding so hard to the ax handle i forgot how to let go he thought reminding himself of a quote his older sister sattar was fond of rivin looked around to see sattar clearing the wooden trenchers for washing danavanhis younger sistersmiling her sweet undefiled smile and vanishing after sattar and nastasea squalling as she tried to catch up with her two older siblings in his concentration on his pain he had forgotten that dinner was over issomething wrong sir for a small man delanon morningsong had an enormous presence about him strict and solemn dedicated to purist beliefs he was a refugee of the famine that had caused his family to flee from their native land of karse rivin had not been part of the flight that had carried his father mother and their extended families to valdemar but he had heard enough stories about it to be happy to no longer live in karse while he had been pelted with his fathers beliefs since before he could speak his daydreaming and slightly absentminded attitude had mostly helped him to escape the rigid mindframe of most of his fathers teachingsand had also caused him great bodily harm in the area of thrashings and penance you chopped that wood aye sir rivin smiled not wincing as he ran a hand through his short black hair his eyes were gray like his mothers all of it yes sir the dark brown eyes of his father flickered good he grunted at last i have another task for you rivin groaned inwardly he had estimated one week until he began planting in the fieldsusually that week was a lazy vacationlike existence where he performed menial tasks and occasional chores a break before the longest season but delanon had been piling jobs on him since weather had permitted and rivin feared his father might be trying to put the yoke of responsible manhood upon him well i am nearly thirteen i suppose hell be thinking about marriage too soon outwardly rivins face remained neutral neither smiling idiotically nor showing contempt toward further work one would have been considered mockery the other insubordination but the words delanon had to say were hardly what his son expected and it was all the boy could do to keep the shock and joy from showing on his face i want you to go into town and buy some things sacks candles sattar says she needs a new spindle as well his serpentine eyes turned thoughtful as he appraised his son rivin blinked in surprise this was no chore he was going into town away from the farm away from work freedom and fresh air in addition to that sattar and i have decided that we can no longer support having nastasea and danavan i talked to my sister and she said shed be more than happy to take themshe being no longer capable of having littles and all surprise again and relief as well rivin and sattar had been conspiring long and hard to get nastasea and danavan out of the house if only to avoid having to endure a life of poverty and their fathers harsh rules now it seemed their plans would come true after all theyd only be a dowry fee and a nuisance he added casually and we dont have the money your aunt does probably because aunt has the sense to let some of her fields lie fallow while you plant more than you could ever hope to harvest rivin had heard his fathers excuses and complaints many times and had long ago stopped believing them delanon raised a glass filled with water to his lips and drank his father had long ago forsworn spirits and beer sticking to clean water and berry juice or cows and goats milk any questions the older man asked wiping his mouth rivin shook his head and then said no sir then get to bed youll be leaving in the morning rivin bowed his head thank you sir the soft pad of his feet as he left the house for the stables was all the sound rivin could make to express his joy though clouds had built up the night before the promise of rain had not come through rivin awoke in the barn surprised to find the hay he was lying in with a scrap of cloth thrown over to take away the itch was not damp with early moisture indeed the day was clear and the sky blue as the morningsong excursion began nastasea and danavan behind and rivin leading in a steady walk in a way he was grateful for the clear weather it meant that the trek would be easier but dry weather wouldnt make planting less difficult and he hoped that it would cloud over after he dropped off nastasea and danavan with aunt rianao dont care if i get drenched but the girls are still too delicate theyd probably die of pneumonia and gods know what hells id go through trying to forgive myself as well as the suffering fatherd put me through not like hed need to do anything id probably kill myself if i let one of them die time whittled away as they moved rivins feet taking well to the walk he glanced back only once when they got to the top of the hilly slope that overlooked the farm he thought he saw sattar standing in the doorway hands tucked into her apron the wind stirring her hair lightly she was a mirror of their fatherdark and sharpexcept that her eyes were not solemn they were sorrowful ever since their mother had died a month after nastaseas birth she had taken on the tasks of housewife and sister moving like a steady ghost through the house and tending to their needs he felt a stab of sadness as he disappeared over the ridge as if he were leaving her forever but ill be back before the moon turns full why do i feel this way sunzenith rose over the windy farmlands and rivin took the time to rest and feed his sisters on bread and cheese and cool water he himself fasted knowing that in three candlemarks there would be a good meal waiting at rianaos besides he would need to keep a tight watch on his rations if he were to make it to kettlesmith and back by a candlemark and a half he was carrying nastasea who had begun complainingfeetto mean that her feet hurt though nearly five years old she still talked like one of the littlest littles sattar said that they had all been like that and that this would pass aye just like the fears of monsters in the well and colddrakes in the dark and mewith my fear of the barn still get kind of nervy when i go in there at night to sleep ah well time will cure a thread of wind tickled his face and nastasea giggled a little playing with a digit of his hair rivin nodded to himself time always has before rivin rubbed his shoulderweary from holding the burden of his younger sistertrying to massage the pain out of it his back leaned against the woodbuilt wall of his aunts foreroom his left side toward the cheery fire that was burning steadily in the hearth he took a long drink from his milkfilled tin cup grateful for the cool liquid and smiled when rianao walked by his aunts establishment was larger than his home being the dwelling of numerous children called rianaos brood as well as a crew of work hands seven large wolfhounds and five cats on the other side of the room was an enigma seated in a highbacked armless wooden chair and dressed in white tunic and sidesplit white leather riding skirt was lisabet morningsong the heraldmage of the family and distant cousin to rianao she didnt look much like a magewith needlework on her lap and her face lost in concentration as she pulled up a knotbut there was a slight aura about her that spoke of control restrained power and authority she looked up at him upon noticing his eyes on her and smiled slightly inclining her head at him just a little before reaching into the basket at her side and hunting for a new color of thread shes here on vacation he heard a voice say and looked up at the looming form of rianaos fifteenyearold son tileir who had met the morningsong pack as they arrived at rianaos farm some vacationhaw the older boy shook his head as he slid down on the floor next to rivin shes just bout as old as ma an looks like she was mas daughter they say his voice grew to an undertone that its the magic tha doest i never heard of magic doing that rivin murmured back neiter i until mcousin kentith told me and what does kentith know rivin had only met kentith once or twice but had from first encounter disliked the boy for some strange reason tileir gave a braying laugh why boy didnt ya hear kentiths been chosen too rivin went silent with shock kentith kentith ravenblack our cousin why are ye so surprised if lisabet why then whynt another rivin shrugged doknow its just he trailed off shook his head never mind he could see tileir was going to push the subject so he said where am i sleeping tonight tileir considered for a moment his caravan of thought rerouted with this new line of questioning whymost probbly wi me rivin winced feeling a strange panic build inside panic not so much of having to sleep with tileir but of what tileir might do to him why am i thinking like this he rationalized to himself in bewilderment tileir wouldnt do anything to me ladyi think im going mad across the room lisabets head lifted and she cocked her head to one side as if trying to hear something she couldnt quite catch she swept the room with baffled eyes pausing only momentarily to look at him before going on it was then that rivin heard the thin wail coming from outside no no no no wont wont wont dont want bath rivin ran outside stopping when he saw rianao standing over nastasea the child was snarling up at her aunt her little face streaked with tears and broken with anger wont wont wont now stasea rianao said soothingly moving forward no the child shrieked hands curled into whiteknuckled fists at her sides eyes squeezed shut aunthere let me he moved forward past the round horsefaced body of his aunt and knelt hi front of nastasea stasea he said touching her fists no his ears rang as her scream echoed around him in a soft voice he gentled her watching as her shortlived tantrum drained away her expression remolding again except now it was confused and tearfilled want mamma she whimpered using her word for sattar mammas not here anymore stasea rianaos going to be your new mamma no the shriek went up again yes he said firmly pulling her into his arms yes he stroked her hair lovingly as she sobbed against his shoulder stuttering out mamma every third word he could feel rianaos curious gaze on him as he spoke to his sister he kept his own eyes fixed on the steaming tub in front of him let ria give you a bath he asked at last patting her back with a note of finality she sniffed and nodded her eyes downcast good he turned to his aunt all yours she looked a bit shocked as he handed her his sister i thank ye she said blinking owlishly at him as he stood twas nothing he said as he walked away from them going back into the house masking his face with false cheer but between his brows was a headache between his shoulders tight muscles and his arm once more hurt from holding on too hard to his sister night he woke with a start his breath heavy as his eyes strained to adapt to the absence of light next to him tileir dreamed on his heavy snoring sending discordant ripples into the pearly predawn silence of the room rivin wiped his hands over his brow surprised to find it dry he had been flushed a moment ago he was sure of it the room must have been stifling hot but it wasnt the window was open letting the cool air in letting the hot air out slowly so as not to wake tileir rivin stood he picked up his belongings cast one last unnecessary fearinspired glance back and then exited rianaos home was silent save for the sound of the sleepers the chairs were empty the sewing set aside and rivin found himself thinking guess mages sleep too he purloined a loaf of the oldest bread he could find then moved outdoors and filled his leather skin with water from the well his aunt wouldnt mind he knew but she would probably be disappointed when she found him gone before she woke so would nastasea and danavan rivin had to remind himself that they were only half a days ride from his fathers and that it would be easy to come and visit just as soon as he finished planting and harvesting and trading and planning for winter but then they would be snowbound for all the winter and then rivin realized with a sinking heart that it would be a very long time before he saw his sisters again silent with guilt he loped down the road two days later he was ruing his wish for a storm while the precious items he had bought in town were securely wrapped in layer upon layer of lavishly waxed skins he had no such protection and was drenched to the core when finally he reached home letting himself into the barn to change and then go via the adjoining dry overhang into the house proper rivin he heard low and soft from his right and he spunpanic catching him off guardonly to see sattar sitting in a golden pile of hay with her knees drawn to her chest and her arms wrapped around her legs she looked up at him and he noticed the dark rings around her eyes somewhere inside him despite her appearance he felt a deep weight lifted and relief flooded every pore shes alive he found his mind sighing sattar he swallowed you scared me she nodded and he noticed a haunted look in her eyes whats wrong he asked kneeling next to her concern tinged his voice she flinched as he touched her her muscles clenching spasmodically and then the emotion smoothed away as she took rigid control of her body she smiled at him her lips tight if not pained one hand sought his hair and the other went around his shoulder in a gesture that reminded him keenly of his mother sa sa sa she murmured how was your trip rivin he shrugged wrapping his arms around her and placing his cheek against her shoulder how did you convince da about the girls twas nothing da is very easy to talk to if you catch him in the right mood he heard loss and something he knew but could not name lace her words but he ignored it instead closing his eyes and being content to listen to her heartbeat you know i wouldve rather stayed he started sa sa she interrupted we all must have our freedoms fledgling i would not limit you yours he sat up shaking droplets from his hair look im soaked how about i put on some of my dry things and you take the packs inside she nodded smiling ill get to stoking the firefather can complain if he wants but the rain is a good omen and youre cold the wood is worth it with brisk efficiency she took the packs and went inside it took him a while to realize that she had never told him what was wrong and he cursed himself for not recognizing the same tactics he had used on his cousin rivin watched the scythe slide over the grain listening to the whisper of the wheat as it cut he blinked rapidly exhaustion blurring his vision he had been working sun up to sun up for the past two days with one more day to go harvest week was crucial to the prosperity of the cropif they didnt reap it in tune the wheat would spoil along with their profits while he was used to this sort of work he wasnt so sure of his sister she was some hundred yards away working her section of the field cutting with slow even strokes in the past months since the planting season had started she had grown more and more anxiousworried almostwith lines of fatigue growing around her eyes rivin had no idea why she felt this waythe crop was growing well and they should be able to harvest enough to make a large profit but still the state of desperationalmost depressionshe had fallen into made him wonder and agitated him no small amount he did not know what made him stop and look up he thought that he heard a soft voice call his name like a lost spirit on the breeze but he was never sure one moment he was biting his lip to keep himself awake the next his head had snapped up and trained on sattar who had fallen motionless in the field sattar he called dropping his scythe and running over rivin knelt when he came to the body of his sister and was shocked to see blood staining the heavy layers of her skirts a claw of pure fear gripped his heart and he glanced toward the scythe she had been using fearing that she had fallen on it but no the blade shone like a clean moon the silver edge dulled perhaps by the work it had been doing but not bright red with fresh gutblood than what move away boy delanon roared coming out of nowhere and rivin was pushed back by surprisingly strong hands sattar he heard his father say panic in his voice the man shook her rolling her over and staring into her pale face even from where he lay in the ripe crop rivin could see the sweat on her clammy skin could almost feel the chill coming off her cool body should ishould i get the healer yes now his father roared picking her up and cradling her tenderly like a lover his jaw was clenched tight his eyes downcast and rivin could clearly hear him say dont die girl papa loves you dont die now not yet and then the boy was runningnot for his life but his sisters let me see said the healer his face blank as he bent over the unconscious form of sattar rivin was still breathing heavily as he leaned against the doorway to his sisters room the healer lived a full hour down the road but it had seemed to rivin to be a thousand miles he traveled before he finally arrived at the old mans house banging on the door and screaming at the top of his lungs as if the hounds of hell were on his heels it had taken another thousand years to saddle the healers horse and then a thousand leagues to ride back with rivin gasping the whole way now safe at home he watched in anxious concern as the healer drew back the covers and examined his sister after a moment he looked up giving rivin and delanon a severe look and saying please leave the room the two men filed out rivin panting now from increased fear as well as exertion the door shut with an ominous thud rivin waited shifting nervously from foot to foot after a moment he felt an iron hand on his shoulder and turned to look into delanons dead eyes go he said pointing out the door toward the fields rivins jaw dropped and it took all his will not to scream youve got to be joking now delanon said leaving no question of authority rivin submissively lowered his head and walked out the door in the field he picked up his fallen scythe looking at the onlyhalfharvested crop blind to the fact that the profits this year would be slim the silent whisper of the scythe was the only sound he heard gasping like the laboring deathrattle of a dying person hoboy rivin stopped his work dumbly turning toward the healer who was standing in the stubble of wheattrail that rivin had made we must speak mute still and shivering from sweatchills and weakness rivin leaned on his scythe waiting how is she he asked bluntly the healer shook his head there is a sore deep inside her that my gifts and knowledge cant seem to reach i am going to try and summon help but i fear i may not be quick enough rivin scrubbed his face pretending that the dampness this action left on his hand was sweat and not tears why has this happened the healer frowned a line of worry between his brows did not you know boy she has miscarried the babe could not survive the strain of the work she was doing some can but she was too frail a note of disapproval entered the mans voice rivin blinked the chill in his body suddenly concentrating and finding a focus in his breastbone do you know the father the healer went on rivin stared at the man feeling a numb balm wash him in that moment he felt separatefrom his body from the situation from the questions the old healer asked he was above it allall laws and vows all beliefs and blood ties that had bound him to his family and his father the chill in his heart began to radiate outward and he felt it enter his gaze the healer must have seen it for his own blue eyes widened and he stepped back slowly first one step then another i the old man began and then broke into a run waddling flatfooted toward his horse mounting and galloping off into the night in his bellyeven apartrivin felt a colddrake uncoil stirring go the rivin that walked apart from rivin thought summon your healers they may be able to help my sister but there is none who can save my father carefully rivin felt himself lay the scythe down he would not need its edge he turned to the farm and took one step the movement was like a trigger he felt the tremble of inner blocks crack fracture and start to collapse revulsion that sense of broken trust panicthe source of all those emotions had overflowed its dam the walls disintegrated and he remembered so long ago as a childa baby the warm trust and love he had once held for the man who loomed above him who he called da he remembered the day he had been playing in the barn and his mother had been down at rianaos on an errand with sattar heavy with danavan he remembered looking up and seeing delanon he remembered pain and screaming he remembered the ripping sound of his clothes as they were torn from him and he remembered begging pleading nono please da no he remembered being beaten and then told that if he told anyone anyone his father would kill himor kill sattar and it would all be rivins fault if that happened and he had made himself forget to keep that from happening he had built up walls drowned the memory weighted it with stones and thrown it down a well but now he knew now he was soaked with memory all the groundless fears had a base his vision was clear the denial was gone now he knew his father had raped him the door to the farm did not open it exploded he felt himself reaching for the chill fire that had now spread to his palms and he felt it buoy his spirit higher he felt the hunger for revengecleansing at last sweep him as he opened the door to sattars room and stared down at his father who was sitting in a stool holding his daughters hand bent double there was no pity no remorse at that moment there was no doubt as to who was the father of sattars baby he had heard the unknown element in sattars voice that rainy night he had returned from his excursion to the city and now he knew a name for it shame delanon stood a frown on his brow his eyes dark with a sweep of his hand rivin felt raw power roar through his body and pick his father up slamming the older man against a wall there was a crack and a scream as delanons rib cage broke and his pelvis shattered and rivin felt a rivulet of sheer exhilaration trickle into him retribution he thought and reached for more no the disembodied boy heard he saw realization in his fathers eyes a desperate pleahorrorfear goodstop pleaseohgodsim sorry rivin did not waste the breath to tell his father that there was no way he could excuse what he had done nor words enough to apologize there wasnt even the time for words only the time for destruction only the solution fire exploded from the boy smoking through his body and out of his hands in a burst of light and energy he felt the agony as his father screamed writhing and twisting the fire sloughed off flesh burned away blood burrowed into marrow and bone rivin screamed his hatredhis burden of shameinto the winds he had summoned feeling his mind snap and crackle beneath the new burden of magic and then it was over leaving behind only a charblack greasy smear on the wall and ashes on the floor rivin swayed staring down at his hands amazement in his eyes with a popping sound akin to that of a dislocated joint being reset he came back to himself what have i done he sank to his knees sanity returning the cold banished weakness and a strange inner emptiness making him tremble the air was stifling he felt flushed when he ran his hand over his forehead he pulled sweat away from his face what have i done slowly he stood turning his eyes from the glassyslick mark on the far wall turning to the shutters of the window fumbling to open them to let this foul foul air outto purifydeep clean breathsclean cleansing air his body was racked with sobs when he finally pushed the shutters open and nearly collapsed against the windowframe he was a murderera killer of menhe was foulslimycaked in dirtstained in bloodblackened by ash he was just like his father like father like son no the voice was assertive female he trembled fear consuming him again making a fist around his belly he shook his head against the voice choosing to disbelieve killer defiler damned what have i become no the voice again and he screamed in the silence of his soul dont you see what i just did dont you know what i have done dont you understand see i know and i understand he looked up for a moment blinded by a light akin to the sun though it was an hour until dawn and then he saw herthe graceful line of her white neck the glancing bluestream brilliance of her eyeslike fire but kinder shock gathered him up in its prickly folds and then plunged him into an endless field of blue that was as textured and soft as a satin robe and as allencompassing as the closing surface of water but he had no fear of drowning nor did he want to all he feltwasher and her name was derdre and he was her chosen lisabet gently pulled the covers over the bed that had held the corpse of the girl tucking everything into neat order the undertaker had carried the body of sattar morningsong off two days ago and buried it yesterday they had had to wait that long just to let rivin rest from the exhausted state he had fallen into the man that the regional healer had brought from maidenflower stared at the bed and then turned away he had stayed around in case any otheraccidents had occurred it didnt have to end like this he murmured glancing out the window toward the boy leaning against his companion head buried in her slender neck it didnt have to start either lisabet replied grimly glancing at the mark on the wall that no amount of washing had removed gods damn iti should have known the healer a man by the name of yiro put a hand on her shoulder and shook his head stop it now herald sometimes its almost impossible to tell even delanons sister said that she thought he was a tad harsh but never well those kids carried that secret well or else they thought it was normal to be treated that way they stood in silence for a time then why would someone do that to their own children she whispered ive asked myself that same question before the best answer i have is that they like the power the pleasure of a helpless victim the dependence they get a feeling of control some even think theyre doing the child a favor if nothing else they try to justify their actions quiet outside the herald could hear derdre take fidgety steps the tall grass whispering softly then and the other two she asked ive already called in one of the best mindhealers in this district shell check them out live with them for a while theyre young with luck shell be able to heal them after a moment yiro clasped her in a quick hug cheer up sister thingsll get better the boy will most likely heal if not today then tomorrow if not tomorrow then the next day it will take a lot of time but hopefully itll happen hell realize and then maybe hell even forgive but not forget no he already forgot once from what we got out of him he must have blocked that incident for years ive heard of it but the healers words were fading away as lisabet moved out of the room and toward the figure in the fields gently she placed a hand on his shoulder remembering what she had seen from her view out the window of her cousins home when nastaseas bathtime had come up a child comforting a child and now i am doing the same arent we all just children at heart she enclosed him in her arms petting his hair holding him as he began to cry sattar he whispered weeping into her shoulder shes gone lisabet replied want sattar he said echoing nastaseas words sattars gone now its time to let go rivin the boy neither agreed nor rejected her words instead he turned and mounted his companion his face a castgranite mask of sorrow lisabet checked the shields around him looking for leaks and holes no use letting that powerful a newborn magegift get out of hand satisfied she called raal over and pulled herself into her own saddle with one trembling hand on her companions neck she led the way down the road toward haven godsmagepower coming to life like that scares me the boy didnt even know what he was doingdidnt even realize it was magicuntil it was too late it was only luck that this was my circuit and that i was close by when he first reached i dont think that i would have wanted a stranger taking care of him she shivered there was so much anger in him thus the nature of madness raal said his voice heavy and dusky in her mind illnever figure it out some things we were never meant to figure out like companions lisabet asked slyly she heard a dry chuckle like companions a wind chuckled by catching her hair she saw rivins head jerk up as if he had heard something and then he shook himself falling back into his mournful brooding it was thenwhen he lifted his headthat she noticed the worryline now chiseled between his brow she noticed his taut neck muscles the lines around his eyes but most of all she noticed the way he held his arm and rubbed his shoulder as if it ached with the pain of a hard grip that had for a long while forgotten how to let go another successful experiment by lawrence schimel lawrence schimel is the coeditor

the first clue that mischief was afoot and that another of chavis infamous experiments would soon be unveiled therefore as efrem wandered down the hallway and noticed the door ajar he could not resist the temptation to peek inside hoping for a glimpse of the latest invention finding it empty not only of marvels but of the mischief maker himself he went in search of him knowing it would be worth his while in laughter if nothing else whether it was simply a lucky guess or the fervent hope that chavi was not foolish enough to premiere one of his experiments indoors again his search led him after a brief stop in the kitchensto companions field where chavi and his companion tecla waited for his yearmates to arrive the first person to show up was not however one of chavis yearmates a tall lanky man in the redbrown of a bardic trainee came by and leaned against a tree facing chavi and tecla chavi was of a mind to ask him to move along then decided it might be good to have a bard on hand to immortalize his success he was sure it would be a success too and did not even consider that the experiment might fail the second arrival however gave chavi pause efrem was a fellow gray who had been chosen two years before him while chavi did not at all dislike the herald he doubted it was even possible for a herald to actively dislike another herald his presence made chavi nervous had he been wandering by and noticed them chavi wondered or had he known to come to companions field now if one of his yearmates had let slip that they would unveil his latest experiment just then gildi arrived with her companion fedele with them came an older woman in healers green her hair just turning to frost i knew it chavi admonished even as he hugged his yearmate in greeting i told you not to tell anyone he glanced meaningfully from the healer to efrem and the bard ive been part of your experiments before chavi and felt having a healer on hand was a precaution worth taking but didnt tell anyone someone must have he said glaring at the pair of bystanders oh dont sulk chavi what harm is there in having spectators to revel in your latest crowning glory he grinned at her well when you put it that way tecla warned him that he was in for a surprise when he turned around nervously chavi looked behind him his yearmates some and grav had arrived with their companions thats not it tecla told him chavi looked again and this time saw what tecla had meant a group of three full heralds coming toward them aaaarrgggh why me why all i ask for is a little peace and quiet in my life gildi could not stop laughing at that last comment until the three heralds had reached them their companions had come in from the field to greet them that must be how tecla had known they were coming chavi realized so who told you chavi asked with a small grin by way of greeting to the three heralds all three of them laughed im afraid you cant keep a secret that involves six companions one said chavi looked sternly at tecla about to ask her if she had told but then decided he really didnt want to know he was sure she had read his thoughts and knew what he had meant to ask but she kept silent aside from her usual comforting presence at the back of his mind chavi sighed while he was interrogating he might as well do them all and how did you find out he asked the bardic trainee one of the servants told me one of the servants chavi thought and how did they know did he have no privacy whatsoever around here or what chavi turned to efrem you he was getting very tired of this question very quickly no one no one we all knew you were making something in your room since you could hear the noise even from the cellar practically when i noticed your door was open again at last but the room empty i knew there was a sight to be seen somewhere if only i could find it one worth risking meros wrath by skipping out on preparation efrem smiled but i found a way around that oh chavi asked very curious as to any new techniques he might learn for getting out of chores pray tell how was that before efrem had a chance to explain the answer walked into sight mero carried a basket stuffed with food in each hand the three grays in tow carried chairs and a table they would work outside and therefore all get the chance to watch the spectacle this is ridiculous chavi exclaimed as they began setting up the table and chairs youd think i had invented entertainment for the first time kem and fiz chose that moment to show up with their companions are we charging admission or something fiz asked then neither of you told chavi really kem struck a melodramatic pose that you could even doubt us chavi turned to gildi now you see why i didnt want spectators put him in front of a crowd and hes incorrigible youre just jealous of my charm and good looks kem replied in answer chavi picked up one of his inventions and held it aloft advancing on kem he said i can take care of those looks but once his actions had gotten enough laughter chavi lowered the creation again and turned serious he turned to face the crowd ill bet youre wondering why ive brought you all here he began earning boos and catcalls from his yearmates chavi looked down his nose at them even though he was shorter than all save grav now where was i oh yes todays demonstration you are very privileged to witness here today the birth of a new sport a game of skill that will enchant spectators and also chavi turned toward the three heralds help train the participants in equitation and combat you dont intend to spar with those things while riding companions one of the heralds asked hear me out chavi turned to his yearmates and began passing out his creations one to each the rules are simple mount your companions and i shall explain as they climbed into their saddles chavi whispered to his yearmates now i have no idea if this is going to work gildi and kem exchanged knowing glances for chavi never made disclaimers like that unless he was sure of success but lets at least put on a good show eh switching back into a performers voice chavi continued explaining the rules im sure you are all familiar with the games of stickball and football played by children what we are about to play is a mix of both from one of teclas saddlebags he brought forth a small wooden ball wrapped in leather and tossed it to the ground that is the object of our pursuit to manipulate it we use these chavi held aloft his creation in demonstration and swinging down gave the ball a solid crack which sent it rolling off through the grass there was a burst of applause from the audience in response to which chavi stood in his stirrups and bowed to them before continuing the game is played by two teams of three players each why this number because more companions and heralds than that on the field of play at once would be disaster he smiled there are also that number among my yearmates and myself and since i am inventing this game that is what i decided besides it takes forever to make the mallets some kem and gildi are one team your goal is those two trees over there marked with yellow ribbons grav fiz and myself guard the goal on the other side of the field marked by blue ribbons points are scored by knocking the ball through the opposing teams goal chavi paused to let all this information sink in and smiled out at the assembled crowd they were listening raptly for his every word and chavi exulted in the sensation while his yearmates made practice swings with their mallets testing the distance between themselves and the ground are there no precautionary rules the healer nervously asked at last breaking the silence chavi smiled kindly at her wondering what gildi had told her of his earlier experiments indeed there are while our companions are quite capable at taking care of themselves and us we shall not put them at unnecessary risk no hitting companions or riders with your mallets or fists although i would hazard to say that leaning heavily against someone as you rode them off would be fair so long as your hands stayed over your own saddle no sticking your mallet under or between the legs of a companion even for the sake of hitting the ball furthermore no lifting the mallet head higher than your shoulder so you dont endanger those of us topside and finally the rider who has control of the ball with his mallettouching the ball at any time with your hands will result in a penalty the rider who has the ball also has the right of way to follow after it for a second swing this means you cannot ride in front of him in a perpendicular path and stop there the object of the game is not to get injured nor to wind up with all our companions smacked into each other now is everyone set on these rules his yearmates nodded and the healer looked content then lets play ball chaos quickly descended upon the field and had it not been for the precautionary rules which the companions remembered reminding their riders whenever they forgot all six players would have wound up in the house of healing after the first five minutes of practice never having the chance to move into full fledged play gravs first swing at the ball was so wild he fell from the saddle he turned as scarlet as a bards garb but climbed back on and tried again if you stand up in the stirrups like this chavi advised and lean from the waist you should find it easier to keep your seat chavi had of course taken all his tumbles days ago when no one was around to see them grav followed chavis instructions and gave the ball a nice solid whack knocking it over the bystanders heads careful there the bardic trainee shouted as he ducked the projectile grav apologized but he was feeling smug as he turned to fiz and said your turn fiz fared slightly better than grav in that he did not fall off his horse on his first swing however he did not hit the ball after his seventh missed swing the crowd was wild with laughter that far exceeded what gravs fall had earned the expression of frustration on fizs face each time he swung was enough to redouble their mirth as he was winding up for an eighth swing fedele brought gildi alongside of him and she blocked his mallets arc with her own i would have hit it that time fiz screamed sending the crowd of onlookers into hysterics gildi merely gave him a sarcastic look and tapped the ball out of fizs reach however when fedele walked up to it and she took a second swing she missed too grav lost no time in riding behind her standing up in his stirrups as chavi had told him and giving the ball another good solid crack it sailed into the audience once more thats twice the bardic trainee said as he ducked again just then efrem lost control of the potato he had been peeling and it slipped out of his hands with a mixture of shame and curiosity he watched its arc as it left his hands and knocked the trainee in the back of the head where he knelt in safety behind a bush herald thy days are numbered the bardic trainee thundered as he turned to face his assailantfrombehind thy lack of skill with a blade shall henceforth go down in the annals of history in the ballad of how efrem lost the battle of potato picnic let thy infamy precede thee wherever thou go he sat down with his back to a nearby tree and began composing verses as he watched the rest of the game you know hes right eladi told efrem after they had all laughed heartily she handed him some of her carrots to peel hoping he would have more luck with them i mean if alberich had seen you she shuddered the thought too unpleasant to contemplate what do you mean if a voice behind them asked eladi turned to find the weapons master standing behind them efrem did not need to look to know who it was the overwhelming feeling of impending doom was enough the game was as exhilarating as chavi imagined it would be once everyone had mastered the rudiments of play and the actual game was underway it moved at a remarkably fast clip the entire thrust shifting to the other side of the field as a backhand swing sent the ball arcing toward the other goal gildi served as a highly efficient captain for her team masterminding a myriad of strategies which chavi took careful note of she was less concerned with scoring the most points herself than in helping her team to the most points her favorite tactic was to ride up alongside someone as he was about to take a shot and block his mallet with her own then one of her team mates who had been instructed to follow her took the ball back toward the other goal through mindspeech team members were only a thought away as strategy decisions were relayed to them by their companions fiz proved to be an excellent backhand although he still had difficulties with his forward shot grav was the powerhouse hitter often sending the ball arcing out of bounds usually toward the audience kem and some were both adequate players but they never really excelled at anything in particular chavi kept worrying that they werent enjoying themselves youre daydreaming again tecla warned him keepyour eyes on the ball were going for the shot chavi relinquished his musings to the game he focused on the ball stood up in his stirrups and swung he connected and a moment later whooped with delight as the ball rolled into the unprotected yellow goal chavi held one of his creations aloft and decided that yes he was more than just pleased with them he was elated the game was seen as a general success by one and all the bardic trainee had begun a second ballad about the days events featuring chavi as its hero chavi was grateful that he had changed his mind before asking the man to move along as the game progressed and she was not called upon in her official function the healer let herself relax enough to enjoy the sport word had spread quickly once the game was underway and the audience had swelled to five times its original size even the queen herself showed up to watch aside from thinking it looked like fun heralds were interested in the game for the combat training and equitation skills it provided everyone wanted a mallet of their own chavi was beside himself with pleasure as his tired but happy yearmates dismounted and relinquished their mallets to other heralds who wished to try them chavi began congratulating himself yes yet another successful experiment brought to you by the one and only chavi the magnificent inventor of innumerable wondrous inventions including the gildi mindspoke to fedele who passed the message on to tecla who dumped chavi into the river all right all right chavi said as he dragged himself soaking wet onto the shore where his yearmates waited ready to toss him back in depending on his attitude so i had a little help from my friends choice by michelle west michelle west has written two novels for dawhunters oathandhunters deathand with any luck is finishing her thirdthe broken crownby now she likes the heralds but couldnt imagine being oneshes the only fantasy writer she knows whos never been up on the back of a horse for fear of breaking her arm in three places when she came off it not that she lets cowardice rule her life of course well not often when kelsey saw the white horse enter the pasture runs she stopped breathing for a moment and squinted into the distance then she saw the herald whites of the man who walked just beside it and with a pang of disappointment she continued across the green toward the inn shaking her head she grimaced just before she took a deep breath and walked through the wide serviceable doors kelsey youre late again how can you tell she pulled her dark hair back from her square face twisted it into a makeshift coil and wrapped it up with a small swathe of black silka parting gift from a friend whod left the town to join a merchant caravan it was the finest thing she owned and the fact that she used it in daytoday wear said a lot about her not of course that she had very many other places to wear it dont get smart with me torvan peterson snapped more for show than in anger he had very little hair left and professed a great resentment for anyone who managed to retain theirs he was obviously a man who liked food and ale a little overmuch and he owned the very practically named torvans tavern children made games with that name but not often in his presence not he added that i would disparage an improvement in your intellect he stared at her expectantly and she grimaced well out with it girl if youre going to be late you can at least amuse me with a colorful excuse she rolled her eyes donned her apron and picked up a bar rag weve got a herald as a guest chatting her up he and no hardly much of an excuse then all right the tables need cleaning the lunchtime crowd was rather messy she could see that quite clearly on normal days it wasnt so hard to come and work work was a routine that added necessary punctuation to her life she saw her friends herethe few that still remained within reach of the innand met strangers who traveled the trade routes with gossip tales of outland adventures and true news but when a herald rode through it made her whole life seem trivial and almost meaningless she worked quickly cleaning up crumbs and spills as she thought about her childhood dreams and the woman who had while she livedencouraged them you can be whatever you choose kelsey her grandmother was fond of saying youve only to put your mind and your shoulders to it and youll do us all proud kelsey snorted and blew a strand of hair out of her eyes i can be whatever i choose but ill never be chosen in her youth shed believed that to be chosen by one of the companions was a reward for merit shed done everything she could think of to be the perfect good little girl the perfect lady the little hero she had forsworn the usual childhood greed and the usual childhood rumbles for her studies with her grandmother she had learned in a fashion to wield a weapon and to think her way clear of troublesome situations without panicking much well except for the small stampede of the cattle back at phersons but anyone could be expected to be a little bit off their color in the midst of their first stampede she had done her best never to cheat or lieexcepting those lies that courtesy required she shared every bounty she was given in short she had struggled to lead an exemplary life and for her pains she had drifted into work at torvans tavern listening to her friends encouraging and supporting their dreams no matter how wild and watching them one by one drift out of her life either by marriage by childbirth or by jobs that had taken them out of the village she had her dream but it was a distant one now and it only stung her when she came face to face with the fact that someone elsesome other person through no work no effort no obvious virtue of their ownwas living the life that she had dreamed of and yearned for ever since she could remember still if the heraldsthey never traveled alonecame in for a meal and left their companions in the pasture runs she could sneak out for a few minutes and watch them and pretend because no matter how stupid it was she couldnt let go of her dream it was clear from the moment he walked into the tavern that something was wrong heralds were ablealthough how she wasnt certainto keep their whites white and in very good repair and this heralds whites were neither he was pale and the moment he stepped out of the glare of the doorway she saw why his arm was bound but bleeding and his face was scraped and bruised excuse me he said in a very quiet but very urgent voice i need help my companion is injured heralds seldom traveled alone kelsey tucked her rag into her apron pocket and made the distance between the table and the door before torvan had lifted the bars gate whatwhat happened he shook his head and it was obvious this close up that he was near collapse she put an arm under his armsshe was not a weak womanand halfwalked halfdragged him to a chair dont worry about me he said softly his face graying shes hurt and she needs help why dont i worry about both of you kelsey replied mimicking the stern tone of her grandmother in crisis torvansend raymon for the doctor and send karin for the vet the herald started to rise and she blocked him with her arm and where do you think youre going he opened his eyes at the tone of her voice and studied her face as if truly seeing her for the first time then he smiled wanly nowhere maam he replied it was then that she realized that he was probably twice her age with gray streaks through his long braid and two faded scars across his neck and cheek his features were fineboned unlike her own he looked like the son of a noble except it was obvious that he was used to doing his own work good what are you smiling at you you remind me of my grandmother the smile faded as he winced his expression grew distant again she knew that he was seeing not only the loss of the herald he traveled his circuit withfor she was certain that that herald must be deadbut also the fear of the loss of his companion she brought him an ale and made him drink he finished most of it before the doctorshuman and animalarrived if you make her travel on the leg you can probably get a few more miles down the road but youll lame her the vet said staring intently at the cleaned gash across the knee i dont know much about companionsbut i do know that if she were a horse she would never have made it this far that he didnt offer more and in the lecturing tone that he was wont to use showed his respect for the herald the heraldwho called himself carris although that was dearly not his full namenodded grimly and wiped the sweat absently from his forehead with a handkerchief his uniform was safely in the tub in kelseys room and he wore no obvious weapons although a sword and a bow were in easy reach how long will it be until she can travel safely hard to say the older man replied cams nodded again absorbing the words the doctor had been and gone and kelsey had been forced to rather harsh words with both doctor and herald before an uneasy truce had been reached between them you dont interfere with his majestys business shed snarled at dr lessar and youwhat did you think we called the doctor for hell bind and treat that armand those ribseven if you feel its necessary to go out and break them again is that clear the doctor laughed and youre telling me how to talk to a herald oddly enough the herald laughed as well and he did submit to the doctors care electing to more quietly ignore most of the doctors subsequent advice torvan accepted kelseys desertion with as much grace as he could muster during the season when the trade route was at its busiest and the tavern could be expected to have the most traffic she did what she could to lend a hand between the doctors visits with carris and his companion but it was clear that she felt them both to be her concern and clearer still that the herald was almost in bad enough shape to need it so he gruffly chased her out of the dining room and told her to finish off her business her business took her to the stables where in the dying light the orange flicker of lamps could be seen through the slats of the door thats odd she thought as she lifted her own lamp a little higher it wasnt completely dark by any meansbut the stables tended to need a little light regardless of the time of dayand she shone that light into the warm shadows cams was kneeling at the feet of a pinto mare gently probing her knees she nickered and nudged him and he nearly fell over as he spun quickly to face kelsey what are you doing here they said in unison then carris smiled you know lass he said although shed passed the age of lassdom five years back you should consider a career in his majestys army youve the makings of a fine regimental sergeant thanks she replied feeling that he meant to tease her but not seeing anything in his words that could be viewed as perjorative you havent answered my question he chuckled and it added wrinkles to his eyes and mouth that suggested he often laughed no lass i havent what do you think of her of she looked at the horse and then realized that it wasnt a horse thats your companion if she forgives me for the indignity and the desertion then yes she is whywhy have you done that she lowered her lamp as if to offer the companion a little more privacy her tone made it clear that she thought it almost sacrilegious dont you start as well carris said mock severely ive done it he added his voice suddenly much more serious because ive a message that must be deliveredand i cant take her with me but to leave her here as an obvious companion is to risk her life kelsey let the seconds tick back while she figured out exactly what he meant then she lifted the lamp again are you crazy she said at last you cant ride with your arm like that and your ribs brokenyoull pierce your lungs for certain the companion bobbed her lovely head up and down almost vigorously dont start carris said again weve already covered that ground and ive made my decision she knows its the right one he stood slowly but winced with pain just the same as if hed jumped up kelsey youve done as much as any girl can to help mebut ive one more favor to ask of you wwhat i want you to take care of her of her my companion yes he replied her name is arana he waited for her to answer and after five minutes had passed he said kelsey she couldnt even speak instead she walked past him holding the lamp as if it were a shield she approached the dyed companion met her eyes and held them for a long time finally she remembered that she wasnt alone and had the grace to blush i meant to tell you that dinners been laid out for you its probably cold but you should still get to it while you can kelsey ill have to think about it she replied not taking her eyes off of carris companion that night with the moon at halfmast it was dark enough that she stubbed her toes twice on the path to the stable the lamp that she held was turned down as low as possibleshe didnt want to attract attention from the field mice and the rats she wanted to look at arana again without carris intruding upon the privacy of her old dreams and her old desires could she watch the companion could she take care of her ha she opened the doors paused as the smells of the hay and the horse scent hit her nostrils and made her way in usually companions werent stabled like thisbut carris had insisted that arana be as horselike as possible does she like sugar carris had laughed as much as a real horse she hadnt snuck into stables since she was child but shed lost none of her old instincts she made her way unerringly to aranas stall she wasnt particularly surprised to find arana waiting for her hello she said softly the companion as expected didnt answer a pang of disappointment like a slightly offkey chord rippled through her and vanished im kelsey arana lifted her head and nodded i suppose youve met a lot of people like me ii always wanted to be a herald ive always prayed that one day a companion would choose me its never happened she added ruefully and i dont suppose youd be willing to tell me why arana put her head over the stalls door and let kelsey scratch her it was easier than scratching a normal horse the companion seemed to be more sensitive doesnt matter cards wants me to stay here with you while he does some fool thing on his own injured without anyone to look after his back what do you think of that arana said absolutely nothing but she became completely still kelsey shook her head and lowered the lamp thats what i thought as well here i brought you some sugar where do you think youre going carris dressed like a welltodo villager frowned as kelsey let her backpack slide off her shoulders to land on the ground with a thump talked it out with torvan she replied around her last mouthful of bread and cheese and he says its a go she swallowed wiped her hands on her pants rolled her hair into its familiar bun and shoved her coin bag into the inner reaches of her shirt whats a go carris asked suspicion giving him an aura of unease that made kelsey want to laugh out loud im going with you carris she checked her long dagger and then picked up her wooden bat made sure she had a hat and a scarf to keep it attached to her head thats preposterous he replied you are doing no such thing she shrugged whatever you say kelsey lookwhat did you think you were going to do dress like that but pick up a fast and fancy horse thatll take you to the capital he looked taken aback youll stand out like a scarecrow youre afraid that someone following you would recognize arana and if thats the case youll be recognized if you travel as youd planned trust me i wasnt aware that youd studied the arts of subterfuge you certainly havent mastered the art of subtlety ho ho ho she bent down and picked up her pack slung it over one shoulder and then bent down for his dont argue with me she said not even bothering to look up ill take the packs you take your arm and your ribs oh damn what i almost forgot what the hair it has to go carris was in a decidedly less cheerful mood when they finally departed the inn look kelsey he said tersely you may not believe this but that hair was my single vanity a man your age shouldnt be beholden to a single vanity she replied sweetly now come on youve come at a good timeive a friend who guards one of the caravan routes and theyre always looking for new hands as a caravan guard in this territory carris raised an eyebrow you do realize that with the upsurge in banditry lately hes just asking for trouble something about the way he said the word banditry caught her attention she pursued it like a cat does a mouse what do you know about the bandit problems he didnt reply this have something to do with the message you need to deliver he nodded but no matter how she pressed him he would say nothing else well its kings business not mine kelsey thought and probably better that i dont know she knew enough after all to know that as a herald he was trustworthy and that anyone who tried to kill him was as much the kings enemyand therefore her ownas a stranger could be still she felt a twinge of envy she knew that were she a herald theyd talk openly of their missionlike equals comrades as if he could read her thoughtsand it was rumored that some heralds couldhe said it isnt that i dont trust you kelsey dont bother with explanations i can come up with a dozen good ones on your behalf and you dont even have to open your mouth she paused and then stopped you can wield that thing cant you both of them yes he replied smiling good what did you intend as a weapon this she pulled her bat out of her pack and swung it in a wide circle i call it a club youre going to sign on as a caravan guard wielding a club youve never seen me wield a club before she assured him then she laughed you should see your face yes i intend to sign on but ill probably do it as cook or a handler if a persons willing and able to work there are always jobs on the trade routes especially now she started to say something else and then stopped are you in pain yes he said but the word was so soft it was a whisper she studied his pale face for a moment and then grimaced the death of his friend wasnt real for him yet but in bits and pieces it was becoming that way kelsey was almost glad that she wouldnt be with him when he finally completed his missionbecause she was certain that when he did hed collapse with grief and guilt shed seen enough hurt men and women come through torvans place to know the look of it thats the life of a herald dear her grandmother would tell her i know she told her grandmothers memory but i want it just the same david fruitman had the look of a barbarian to him his face was never closely shaven but never fullbearded his brown hair was wavyalmost scruffyand long and his carriage gave the impression not only of size but of the ability to use the strength that came with it to good advantage kelsey waved and shouted to catch his attention when he saw her he rolled his eyes what you again carris hung back a bit unsure of the larger mans reception but kelsey bounded in slapped him hard on the upper arm and then dropped the two packs she carried to give him a bear hug she called him something that was best left in the tavern among friends who had had far too much to drink and then swung him around carris get your backside up here david this is carris carris this is david hes what passes for a guard captain around here david looked at carris raised an eyebrow and then looked down at kelsey theres a problem kelse he said what his arms broken so its not his sword arm carris and david exchanged raised brows shall i explain or shall you carris said you do it im not getting enough danger pay as is very funny both of you davidcan i talk to you in private for a minute or two is this like last times privatewhere you shouted loudly enough that this half of the caravan lost most of their hearing for the next two weeks very funny she scowled grabbed his arm grabbed her packs and nodded frantic directions to carris it all came together somehow and they made their way to the wagon that david called home while he was recruiting well carris is a herald she said dispensing with pretense and blusteralthough the latter was hard to get rid of his partners dead his companions injured and hes got a message that hes got to get to the capital as fast as possible he cant ridedont argue with me carris you heard what the doctor saidand hes being hunted hunted by who he cant say i cant hire him then davidhes a herald that doesnt mean the same thing to me as it means to you david replied lookthe people who hunt the type of guards i hire are cutthroats that i know how to deal with the people who hunt a herald david she reached out grabbed the front of his surcoat bunched it into two fists and pulled even carris recoiled slightly at the intensity of her tone youaregoingtohireusboth he raised a brow not in the least put out or or i will tell sharra about the time that he lifted both of his hands in mock surrender and than his expression grew graver is it that important kelse more trust me we need you all right let go of my surcoat and pray that the entire encampment didnt just hear that ill take carris onbut weve got to strap a shield to that shoulder cant you just say he was injured in the line of duty sure but whos going to ask me most of the guards here are the same as i started with and theyll know hes a stranger if theyre asked weve hired five men here and hell just be another one of thosebut hes got to look the part even if hes not going to act it clear she said something extremely rude yes clear good captain carris said softly what thank you dont thank her i owe her and its about time she started calling in her debt i hope you appreciate this kelsey said to carris as they set up their tents her hands were stiff and chapped and she was busy nursing a blister caused by peeling carrots and potatoes for a small army when he didnt answer she looked across the fire whats wrong its arana he replied at last weighing his words you travel for this long with aa very dear friend and you really notice when shes gone you arent used to being separated no im used to being able to hear her no matter where i am he was quiet and she let the silence stretch between them wondering when he would break it fifteen minutes later she realized he wasnt going to is it everything they say it is pardon being a herald having a companion is it everything its cracked up to be he smiled its harder than i ever imagined he replied leaning back on his elbows and then wincing and shifting his weight rapidly and its the most rewarding thing i could ever dream of doing he laughed and the laugh was selfdeprecating it wasnt what id intended to do with my lifeand both of my parents are still rather upset about it since it significantly shifts the family hierarchy do you know why you were chosen me he laughed again no if i had to choose id be the last person id ask to defend the kingdom with his life he sobered suddenly rose kelsey i dont know how to thank you for everything youve done and i know that leaving you to the campfire alone isnt the way to start she waved him off everyone needs a little space for grief she told him firmly even a herald especially a herald but after he was gone she stared at the fire pensively by his own admission hed done nothing to be considered a worthy candidatewhy had he become a herald why had he been chosen dont start kelsey she told herself sternly or youll be up at it all night you look awful david said as he ducked a flying handful of potato rinds i didnt sleep very well she replied are you here to annoy me or should i just assume that you already have he laughed i wanted to see how you were faring the caravans got a few extra mouths this time round if i was going to choose kp i wouldnt have done it for this stretch of the route thanks for the warning she said and heaved another handful of rinds then she wiped her hands on her trousers set her knife aside and stood why is the caravan so bloody big this time its well guarded david replied lowering his voice well guarded weve done our buying for the season and were doing our damned best to protect our investment how bad has it been wed heard rumors that its been bad his face lost all traces of its normal good humor if you hadnt insisted kelse i wouldnt have taken your friend on theres a very good chance hell get to see action whether hes up to it or not oh she blew a strand of dark hair out of her eyes is there some sort of drill meaning what should the noncombatants do if the caravan is attacked she waited for a minute look stop staring at me as if ive grown an extra head and answer my question well he replied scratching his jaw if i were in that position id probably hide under the wagons great if id wanted an answer that unreal id have asked a bard she picked up her knife and went back to potatoes carrots and onions onions that was the other thing she was going to have to find a way around carris took to taking it easy about as well as a duck takes to fire he was grimfaced and impatient and he watched the road and the surrounding wooded hills like a starving hawk david had decided that the best watch for carris was the night watch under the cover of shadow and orange firelight he could pass for a reasonably whole guard he carried his sword and his bow although kelsey pointed out time and again that the bow was so useless it was just added encumbranceand wore a shield that had been strapped to his front as well as possible given the circumstances what he did not do well was blend in with the rest of the guards it was his language kelsey reflected as she listened to him speak he didnt have the right cadence for someone who had fallen into the life of a caravan guard never mind cadence she thought as she dove into the middle of a conversation and pulled him out wholehe didnt have the vocabulary the tone the posture he did having been on the road without being able to shave himself have the right look stop being so nervous she said catching his good arm in hers and wandering slightly away from the front of the caravan kelsey do you know what this caravan is carrying nope and i dont want to well i do were going to see action and i cant afford to see it and not escape it alive weve lost four heralds to this investigation not including lyris and well lose more if i dont get word back well get word back she said assuring him but she felt a twinge of unease when she finally left him dammit hes even got me spooked she went to her pack found her bat hooked it under her left arm and walked quickly back to her place among the cooks staff what is that a familiar voice said dont ask her that marrit the older woman who supervised the cooking looked a tad harried as she glared in davids general direction its a bat i know what it is then why did you ask dont be a smartass kelse why are you carrying it around its as much a weapon as anything else i own and you need a weapon on kitchen duty david laughed marrit i didnt realize that youd become such a danger over the past few days lookdont you have something to do im off duty ive got nothing to do but sit and visit he smiled broadly and took a seat he even managed to keep it for five minutes marrit didnt say one disparaging word about her cooks lax work habits when kelsey dropped her knife into the potato sack turned and pushed him backward over the log two days passed carris was edgy for every minute of them except when he spoke of lyris then his emotions wavered from guilt and grief to a fury that had roots so deep even kelsey was afraid to disturb them by asking intrusive questions that stirred up memories too sharp and therefore too dangerous this didnt stop her from listening of course she managed to infer that lyris was the herald who had traveled with carris and further that lyris was young attractive and impulsive she knew that he had come from the wrong side of town just as carris had come from too far into the right side as it were never anger a noble her grandmother used to say especially not a quiet one although it was a tad on the obvious side it was still good advice kelsey why must you take that club everywhere you go given that shed just managed to hit his rib with the nubbly end it was a reasonable enough questionor it would have been had she not heard it so often dont start i thought if there was one person in camp id be safe from itd be you why do you think im carrying it he shrugged i dont know everyone here seems to have their pet theory what do you mean everyone guards he said offering her the gleam of a rare smile have very little to talk about these days she blushed id better not catch them talking about me or ill damned well show them what im carrying it for carris actually laughed at that then he stopped i know im unshaven and unkempt but have i done something else to make you stare yes she replied without thinking you laughed she regretted her habit of speech without thought the moment the words left her lips the clouds returned to his face and with them the distance and theres not much to laugh about is there he said softly his right hand on his sword hilt kelsey was at the riverside washing more tin bowls than torvan owned when she heard the screaming start a silence fell over the men and woman who formed marrits kitchen patrol fingers turned white as hands young and old clenched the rims of tin and the rags that were being used to dry them no one spoke which was all the better kelsey could hear the sound of hooves tearing up the ground horses she thought as she numbly gained her feet the bandits have horses kelsey marrit hissed where are you going kelsey lifted her fingers to her lips and shook her head she motioned toward the circular body of wagons marrit paled and mouthed the order to stay by the riverside where many of the cooking staff were already seeking suitable places to hide it was the smartest course of action of course kelsey thought knees shaking thats why im not doing it she swung her bat up to her shoulder and began to run in the confusion and chaos panic was king and the merchant civilians his loyal subjects the wagons circled for camping between villages too small to maintain large enough inns and grounds provided all the cover there was against the attackers peoplesome kelsey recognized and some expressions so distorted by fear that their faces were no longer the faces she knewran back and forth across her path ducking for cover into the flapped canvas tents the wagons or the meager undergrowth the guards on watch had their hands full and the guards off duty were scrambling madly to get into their armor and join the formation that was slowlytoo slowlytaking shape she counted forty guardstheir were fortyeight in totalas she scanned the circular clearing searching desperately for some glimpse of cards no sign of him maybe hed finally shown some brains and was hiding somewhere under the wagons ha and maybe the horses she heard were a herd of companions all come to ask her to join them she took advantage of a scurry of panicked movement to take a look under a wagon she saw the horses then funny thing about these bandits they werent wearing livery and they werent wearing uniformsbut they looked an awful lot like a bardic description of cavalry the horses were no riding horses and no wagonhorses either she didnt like the look of them at all and she loved horses they sure make bandits a damned sight richer than they used to she thought clenching her teeth on the words that were choking her in a rush to get said and a damned sight more organized she had a very bad feeling about this particular raid and when the blood spray of a running civilian hit the grass two feet from her face she knew that if there were any survivors to the raid at all it was going to be a minor miracle a flare went up in front of the lead wagon firetipped arrows came raining from the trees and shadows detached themselves from the undergrowth gaining the color and height of men as they came into the fading daylight kelsey knew she should be cowering for cover somewhere but the tree that shed managed to climb was central enoughand leafy enoughthat it gave her both a terrific vantage point and a false sense of security she counted the mounted men there were ten she couldnt get as good a sense of the foot soldiersbandits she corrected herselfbut she thought there werent more than thirty so if one didnt count the cavalry as more than a single man each the caravan guards outnumbered them it made for a tough fight but the horses were too large to be easily maneuvered around the wagons and if the merchants and their staff were careful the caravan would pull out on top she smiled in relief and then the smile froze and cracked for on horsebacka sleek slender riding horse with plaited manes and the carriage of a welltrained thoroughbredunarmored and deceptively weaponless rode a man in a plain black tunic at his throat glowing like a miniature sun was a crystal that seemed to ebb light out of the very sky this was the threat that carris wouldnt speak openly of this was what he had to reach other heralds to warn them about this was the information that the king needed kelsey gripped both her bat and the tree convulsively as the mage on horseback drew closer to where she sat suddenly vulnerable among the cover of leaves his was a power she was afraid that dwarfed the power of all save a few heraldsand she was certain that carris was no heraldmage to take on such a formidable foe damn it she thought holding her breath lest a whisper rustle a leaf the wrong way carris was right i shouldnt have brought him along with the caravan then and hell probably die just like the rest of usthey wont know hes their herald and they wont care one of the mounted soldiers rode up to the mage that wagon he said pointing food supplies but nothing of more value good the mage gestured and fire leaped up from the wagons depths consuming it in a flash the circle was broken and the ten mounted horseman pikes readied charged into the encampment she heard the shouts and then the screams of the guards and the civilians they were to protect people fled the horses and the hooves that dug up the ground as if it were tilled soil they didnt get far kelsey saw clearly the beginning of a slaughtersickened she shrank back closing her eyes theres nothing you can do some part of her mind said hide here maybe they wont notice you captain waretheyve got a mage at the center of their formation it was carris voice booming across the panicked cries and painful screams of the newly dying in spite of her fear she gazed down to see him sword readied shield tossed aside and forgotten the blade caught the fire of the camplight and it glowed a deep orange you see another part of her taunted you wouldnt have made a decent herald after all she hid in the trees and carris broken arm and cracked ribs forgotten stood in the center of the coming fray his sword glowing dimly as it reflected the light of the fires no she took a deep breath watched the guards met the bandits but the bandits attacked like frenzied berserkers and it was the caravan guards that took casualties kelsey could not make out individual faces or fighting stylesand she was thankful for it what she could see was that somehow the blows that the caravan guards landed seemed to cause no harm it was almost as if the enemies were being protected by an invisible shield magic magic another horseman rode in and stopped three yards from the mage sir he said weve got a group of them hiding by the riverside possible one or two have managed to cross it the mage cursed get the archers out then he snarled we cant afford to have anyone escape cant you not if you want to be safe from steel and arrow tips he replied grimly go he gripped the crystal around his neck more tightly get down kelsey she shivered as she saw the mage close his eyes nows your chance get down but her legs wouldnt unlock her hands shook she watched the ground below as if the unfolding drama was on a stage that she couldnt quite reach carris came out of the wings she saw him close to the ground and nearly cried out a warning as the mounted soldier departed but she bit her lip on the noise he used the shadows carris did and he moved as if he had no injuries an inch at a time he made his way to the mage who sat on horseback concentrating the horse shied back and the mages eyes snapped open carris leaped up from the ground swinging his sword it whistled in a perfect arc the mage didnt have time to avoid it the sword hit him across the chest arid shimmered slightly that was all the man laughed out loud you fool he cried did you think to harm me with that carris swung again and again the mage did nothing to avoid the strike why i think i know youyoure the little herald that escaped us its probably best for youyou wouldnt have enjoyed the fate that you consigned your friend to suffer alone carris next swing was wild and it was his last three foot soldiers came up slowly at his back but the mage lifted a hand waving them off no this one is mine gentlemen unfinished business he smiled dont you have merchants to kill the soldiers nodded and stepped back almost uncertainly if kelsey had to guess the mage had probably killed one or two of them to keep them in line they werent comfortable with him that much was clear you cant think that youll get away with this carris said it was in all a pretty predictable thing to sayand not at all what kelsey would have chosen as her last words something snapped into place for kelsey as she thought that cant let him die with that for an exit line she told herself and very slowly watching her back as much as possible kelsey began to shinny down the tree i know we will the mage replied all confidence are you sure you dont want to continue your futile line of attack it amuses me immensely carris lowered his sword you could try the bowyou can wield it cant you it would also amuse me and perhaps if im amused youll die quickly i was embarrassed by your escape he added his voice a shade darker and have much to make up for to the baron carris said nothing come come why dont you join me we can watch the death of all of your compatriots before we start in on yours you see you have a larger number of guards but they arent like my men immune to the effects of sword and arrow its a lovely magic ive developed and its served me exceptionally well come he added and his voice was a command like a puppet carris was jerked forward watch it was almost impossible not to obey his commands kelsey looked upand what she saw made her freeze for a moment in helpless rage david was fighting a retreat of sortsbut he was backing up into another cluster of the enemy he seemed to understand that the swords that the caravan guards wielded were only good for defense for he parried but made no attempt to strike and extend himself to people who didnt have to worry about parrying anymore a guard went down at davids side kelsey bit her lip and then because she was her grandmothers daughterand more than that besidesshe swallowed took a deep breath and crawled as quickly as possible to where the mage sat enjoying the carnage she wanted to say something clever or witty or glib but words deserted her only the ability to act remained and she wasnt certain for how much longer she lifted the bat and closing her eyes swung it with all the force she could muster she had never heard a sound so lovely as the snapping of the mages neck she would remember it more clearly than almost any other detail of the attack almost he toppled from his horse as the horse reared she watched him crumple and fall watched his body hit the ground then she lifted the bat and began to strike him again and again and again carris shouted somethingshe couldnt make out the wordsas she began to try to shatter the crystal that hung at the mages neck then she felt a hand on her arm and swung the bat round kelsey its me carris face was about two inches away from hers there was a bit of blood on itbut she thought it wasnt his couldnt be certain you did it he said he tried to pry the bat out of her hands but her fingers locked tighter around it than a merchants around his money chest he let go of her hands and smiled the grin was wolfish weve got them kelsey thanks to you they dont know that they can die yetbut theyre about to find out the mage is gone his teeth flashed and theyve been walking onto our swords because theres no risk to them remind me she said faintly not to make you mad he looked down at the corpse at her feet laughed loudly and perhaps a little wildly youre telling me that an hour later it was all over people lay dead in pockets of blood across the width of the encampment the merchants buried and mourned their own but they left the bandits for carrion the mounted men had fared the best once they realized that they were vulnerable and three at least had fled the arrows and bolts that the guards used against them the rest joined their unmounted counterparts david injured was still alive kelsey was glad of it she watched his wounds being bound by the doctor the merchant tuavo always traveled with a good physician as part of his caravanand swung her bat up onto its familiar shoulderperch hey she said i know i know so we never make fun of strange barmaids who carry bats around the kitchen okay she smiled thats not what im here for its about my position as a caravan guard as a what look im a bit of a hero for the next hour and ill be damned if i dont use it to get out of peeling potatoes and onions for the next two months youre going to vouch for meis that clear he laughed as a bell hello kelsey said as she caught carris shadow looming over her shoulder arent you late for your shift the captain excused me ive been he added lifting his arm injured in action he grinned and kelsey laughed shed done a lot of that lately carris returned her laugh with a laugh of his own he seemed both taller and younger than he had when shed first laid eyes on him in torvans place a little more at peace with himself still there was something she wanted to say iive been meaning to apologize to you to me for what the mage she looked up and her eyes dark in the fading day met his carris shook his head almost sadly was it that obvious he took a deep breath and ran his fingers through his short peppered hair very quietly he gave her her due ive never wanted to kill a man so badly in my life i wouldve felt the same way you got to kill him he looked into the fire and she knew he was seeing lyris she reached up and caught his hand felt his fingers stiffen and then relax as she pulled him down to the log tell me she said in the softest voice he had yet heard her use tell me about lyris he did he talked for hours letting his tears fall freely at first and then returning to them again and again as an odd story or an old affectionate complaint brought the loss home he talked himself into silence as the fire lapped at the gravel then he did something surprising he turned to her in the darkness and said now tell me about kelsey she was so flustered she forgot how to speak for a momentand kelsey was not often at a loss for words well she thought as she stared at the crackling logs beyond her feet what do you have to say for yourself about yourself his chuckle was gentle should i start go ahead kelsey is a young woman who as a child very much wanted to be a herald it was dark so he couldnt see her blush hhow did you know that its a gift of mine and as a herald you get used to spotting people who hold the heralds in awe or rather he added wryly as he touched his short hair again hold the position in awe she shrugged you asked me if i knew why we were chosenbut what you really wanted to know was why you werent she couldnt answer because every word he spoke was true i dont know why he slid an arm around her shoulder and it surprised her so much she didnt even knock him over but having met you i can guess here it comes what what would you guess kelseyi told you that i was the son of a noble and as its not important i wont tell you which one but if arana hadnt come to me hadnt chosen me i would have become embroiled in the politics of the nobility and would have done very little of any good to the people of the kingdom as a whole i like to think i would have ruled my own people well but its not easy and lyris much as i love him hed have probably wound up as a secondrate thiefor a corpse not much good there either she was very quiet you dont have a companion yet if not for you the people of this caravan would have been slaughtered like sheep at the crown princess wedding he caught one of her hands in his good one ive got to get some sleep if i can so do you but think about it i will kelsey had spent many sleepless nights in the cold of a dying fire and this one was to be no exception what did it mean what did it really mean she looked at her hands seeing both the calluses and the dried blood of the injured that shed helped the doctor with they were good hands strong enough to do what was necessary im not a herald she thought as she stared at them and i never will be she turned it over in her mind and for the first time in her life she accepted it without sorrow never will be chosen she stood up as the embers faded but if i cant be one of the chosen i can be one who chooses and choose to do what i must when im needed heralds couldnt do everything for themselves she knew how to run an innmaybe if she proved worthy of it shed be allowed to run a school everyone needed to eatsurely the heralds would need a cook and that close to the thick of thingsthat close to heralds companions possibly the king himselfthere was certain to be a lot for kelsey to do she smiled the sun was on the fringe of the horizon carris if she expected him to be sleeping she was wrong he was awake and a strange little smile hovered around the corner of his lips yes im coming with you to the capital and i wont take no for an answer youre still injured you probably still need someone to watch your back and you and id love your company he didnt come to think of it look at all surprised made her suspicious but it also made her for the first time that she could remember completely happy she had done with waiting it was time to start the life that her grandmother had always promised her she could choose to live song of valdemar by kristin schwengel kristin schwengel is an avid fan of mercedes lackeys work and leaped at the opportunity to write about valdemar this story is her first published work she lives in green bay wisconsin with her fiance john heifers whose work also appears in this collection they have no cats yet but they do have a collection of wolf and wildcat paraphernalia which will have to do for now revyn eser called quietly i need some more of those bandages over here and a splint the young trainee trotted over to the master healer arms full of soft fabric fingertips barely clutching the smoothly carved pieces of the splint eser took the wood from his hands just before he dropped it smiling gently now lad i dont need you bringing so much that you lose it before you can do any good with it he teased a smile lighting his faintly lined face revyn smiled thinly back at him acknowledging the mild rebuke and watched with feigned disinterest as the healer carefully set the broken leg do you think you could do the same hmm eser asked when he had finished glancing up at his pupil revyn avoided esers eyes as he lifted his shoulders slightly carefully hiding the surge of affirmation that raced through him iim not sure it seems easy enough but i wouldnt want to cause more harm than is already done he spoke awkwardly trying to seem all nervousness and uncertainty esers lips thinned as he stood smoothly stretching his back to straighten out the knots that he got from hunching over the pallet he still moved with a fluidity and grace belying his forty years but every so often his body chose to remind him of his true age he studied revyns averted face carefully what was wrong with the young man was there more than he himself was aware of eser shrugged mentally knowing that answers would come eventually one way or another now they had more important things to take care of eser gestured to his apprentice to follow him and moved down the halls of the house of healing to the storeroom well revyn youre going to set a leg now teral wasnt the only one caught in that rockslide more bandages and another splint lad and follow me revyn nearly gasped aloud at esers words staring at the older mans parting back what if he finds out he thought frantically cant hide much longer but i cant keep refusing either taking a large breath to relax his nerves he scurried along the halls of the house of healing after his teacher nearly spilling the extra bandages again in his haste finally eser stopped and gestured for revyn to precede him into the sickroom revyn paused in the hallway to allow his heightened breathing to slow to a normal pace never enter a sickroom in a hurry or in obvious panic he heard esers voice in his head for that is the best way to hinder the healing you wish to encourage gently he laid his hand on the door and slowly pushed it open the welloiled hinges made barely a sound as the two of them slipped into the room and closed the door carefully behind them glancing at the blanketcovered figure on the low pallet revyn was barely able to contain a low gasp of shock and surprise it was just a boy a boy no older than his sister chylla the lad was clearly fevered for he tossed his head restlessly under the effects of the herbs that had taken away his pain and put him to sleep so that the healers could work on him looking uncertainly up at eser revyn received no encouragement other than a small nod taking a deep breath he knelt on the floor by the side of the pallet and lifted the blanket from the boys thin legs carefully revyn moved his hands gently over the skin of the broken leg exploring the shape of the bone and determining how much movement would be needed to line up the two edges so that the splint and bandages could do their work thankfully he had just to pull slightly on the boys foot to straighten the bone and the pieces moved easily into place seeming to straighten almost of their own accord silently eser crouched next to him and maintained the tension on the foot so that revyn could place the splint and swiftly bandage the leg tightly making sure the bone would heal as straight as before standing he met the master healers eyes and was surprised and intensely pleased by the approbation he saw there he will sleep easier now that his bones are in line and the healing herbs can take better effect well done eser said softly we are finished here but i would speak with you revyn was no stranger to the sudden sinking feeling in his stomach he had often felt this way before one of his older brother myndals chastising sessionsthose that had involved swift beatings and usually the destruction of at least one of his own precious treasures few though they were he had thought he had done well with the young boys legno he knew he had done well esers own words had told him that what could have gone wrong he followed the healer out of the house trying to control his concern eser slowly shut the door to his room and turned to face his student a swift touch to his temples easing the tension headache that was already building why revyn he asked we both know that you have a strong healing talent why do you resist it so revyn looked down at the floor shuffling his feet slightly how could he put it so that the healer would understand he didnt want to be a healer at least he hadnt wanted to until he broke off his thoughts and tried to answer ii dont know i just dont want to hurt anyone when i try to help them and i seem so clumsy sometimes that it seems that all i can do is just to make a mess of what i put my hands to and the hurried flow of his speech stopped as he ran out of words and he glanced uncertainly up at eser the older man had turned to look out the window at the autumn golds and reds in the garden just visible beneath the dusting of the second snow revyn youve been here at haven for almost a year now and most of that time you have spent with the healers you should be farther along in your studies than you are now your skill today handling that broken leg without even asking advice proves that you are not as clumsy as you say yes i know you nearly dropped the splint this afternoon eser laughed holding up a hand to stop his students protest but that was only because you took more than you could easily carry through no fault of your own the healer paused for a moment thinking then turned to look his student straight in the eye just because one dream wont come true for you doesnt mean that you should stop dreaming should stop thinking of the good you can do for yourself and others he would have continued but revyn choking as if the words he wanted to say were stuck in his throat had already turned and fled how can he know revyn thought furiously hes just a healer he ran to his room paused only to snatch his letters from his desk and stuff them inside his tunic and hurried out to the garden he only knows healing he wouldnt know who has the gift and who doesnt but bard keryn would a small voice in his head reminded him a voice that he crushed as he had so many times before keryn could be wrong he told himself sometimes gifts dont show until later like with the heralds some of them arent chosen until theyre older than i am theres still a chance that i could have a bardic gift he told himself refusing to listen to the voice that told him otherwise revyn settled himself in a private grotto in the garden the one farthest from the buildings and pulled the two letters each with the seal of hold elann from the front of his tunic even though he had been receiving these letters roughly every month since he had come to haven each time he opened them his heart raced in anticipation my dear son it is good to hear that you have learned so much in your time in haven perhaps soon you can return to us your brother myndal seems to have come to terms with your leaving as he allows us to write to you openly now if you come back to us surely he would respect your skills with your professional training your sister writes you as well so i will not speak to you of her save that she misses you greatly we are all well here in hold elann though we miss your music myndal begins to speak of finding a wife and raising children to carry on the mastery of elann he hopes for a daughter of one or another of the nearby landowners young aislynn whom you surely remember grows ever prettier if you were to return soon before someone else snatches her up i think the two of you could make a match of it the dogs are well though tygris is aging i fear she has raised her last batch of pups this summer for she will likely not survive the coming winter i run out of paper and so i close with best wishes for your continued health and hope that you return soon the bard i always knew you could be your loving mother revyn bit his lip wishing that there were some way he could tell his family what his situation truly was how could he say that he was no longer a bardic student that he was now in the healers collegium chylla would be so disappointed she had always wanted him to compose a song for her when he tried to reach master bard rank she wanted him to write a ballad about valdemar a song that put everything that was best about their homeland into words on his journey to haven he had begun a draft of it but ever since that interview with bard keryn he had tried to forget about it the sheets of paper covered with his brief notations buried in the back of his desk his mind flashed back to that day keryn had spoken with him only a few weeks after he had come to haven and been brought from an inn to the bardic collegium by keryn herself revyn youll make a superb minstrel better than most even here in haven youre one of the most talented students weve ever had but im afraid that you dont have the bardic gifts some of us think that you might be gifted in healing however and revyn im sorry keryn had said softly the hurt of hearing keryns words still tasted bitter in his mouth even months later she had tried to be kind tried to tell him about his healing talent but it had all added up to the same thing he could never be a bard those first few weeks of living and studying in the bardic collegium had easily been the happiest time of his life hearing keryn affirm his worst doubts and fears had torn his joy away from him leaving an aching empty spot where his longcherished dream of being a bard had been a spot he had thought could not be filled and then eser had come and taken him to the house of healing revyn brought his mind back to the present with a quick mental shake avoiding the thought of being a healer as he had tried to avoid it for the past year he broke the seal on the second letter with a smile thinking of his fairhaired sister and her laughter that sounded like summers golden sunshine would revy oh how i miss you still hold elann isnt the same without you you probably said that when minstrel des died didnt you well now i know how you feel did mother tell you myndal is letting us write you openly maybe that means you can come back soon speaking of myndal that oaf actually thinks he can find a girl stupid enough to marry him he tried for aislynn but she had too much sense for him besides she told me she wanted to wait for you to come back even though shes two years older than me she doesnt act like it and were still friends think myndal also wants to set up a marriage for me it being as im getting to be old enough think of it revy your chylla the matron of a householdat fourteen and a half sometimes i cant think of it for laughing i hope he goes to hold gellan edouard the younger son is unmarried and only a few years older than you are so hes not too old for me and hes handsome too your horse misses you the dogs miss you tygris has faded in health ever since you left mother misses you and i miss you most of all i hope you get to journeyman rank soon so you can come to see us love and hugs your own chylla revyn leaned back against the sunwarmed stone of the grotto closed his eyes and smiled laughing with his merry sister he could see her now just the way she had been on the day he told her he was leaving hold elann but what will mother and i do without you her lips were quivering and she bit them so hard he was sure she would cut them she looked at the ground then turning away from him so he wouldnt see her tears youll have to take care of mother for me chylla you know how hurt shell be when you tell her where ive gone he smiled and gently touched her thin shoulders she turned abruptly back to him taking a deep breath take me with you revy please i can cut my hair you can tell the traders im your little brother please dont leave me here not alone with myndal better that you stay with mother he had answered gravely mother will need you more than you will need me besides he said smiling cheerily ill come back for you little one you know i will and everything will be fine if only she could be here with him now everything would be fine she would understand about him being a healer if she just saw him if he could just talk to her and show her how he felt but he didnt know how he could write it to her it seemed to him that to tell his family would make everything just that much more final telling them that he wouldnt be a bard would mean that he would have to give up his dream and become a healer you know you want to be a healer too came the insistent voice in his head the second self that chose times like this to scold him this time however he didnt slap it away as he would a biting gnat you have talent you know it eser knows it the rest of the healers know it too youre just afraid revyn thought about that one for a while what would i be afraid of he asked himself youre afraid of losing your last hope of being a bard as long as you stay in the house of healing without making any progress in using your healing talent theres a chance that a bardic gift might show up if you become a full healer you might have to leave haven and you couldnt continue your musical studies like you have been like eser and keryn have indulgently allowed you to the voice was a sting of conscience sharply reminding him of how ungrateful he had been to those who were trying to help him and teach him he squirmed suddenly trying to avoid his selfrecrimination but the voice once unleashed refused to be fettered again you know its just your own pride keryn said you could be a good minstreland you already are one even if it is just around the circle of other healing students and a healer who can play music to soothe and calm the nerves is a rare thing youre just too stubborn to accept that you wont accept being anything less than the best anything less than what you decided you had to be without even knowing what you could and couldnt be you enough he shouted at the voice squelching it into silence youve made your point leave me alone for a while i just need to think to figure out what i want some weeks later revyn hurried down the hallway of the house of healing ahead of eser anxious to get to young seldis room for a few quick minutes of conversation in the course of the morning rounds the boys broken leg had been healing well and revyn expected that eser would soon allow the lad to return to his familys holding with his older brother who had arrived in haven this day to fetch him good morning seldi he said cheerfully as he entered the room smiling at the first patient he had ever treated on his own hi revyn the younger boy said grinning i hear my brothers come t pick me up s it true will i be goin home soon revyn glanced in mock warning at the door i wouldnt say that too loudly when you know healer eser is coming hes liable to keep you here just to dash your hopes eser smiled at the sound of the two boys laughter as he entered the sickroom well seldi how do you feel today im itchin t go home healer eser sir i hear mbrother has come t fetch me he has and hell be in to see you soon but it seems you might not be getting away from us for good after all revyn shot seldi a quick itoldyouso look then turned his attention to what the master healer was saying you my boy have a slight talent for healing not enough to make you a master healer so dont worry about being trapped in my job eser said smiling at his own expense but what you have if trained would be very useful back on the farm to help with the livestock and small injuries what me a healer seldi gaped at eser eyes wide with disbelief yes in certain things if you choose to come back when youre a little older for training you probably wouldnt be strong enough to save lives but you could save a good deal of the pain from small thingsthe little hurts that you get often enough on a farm and you could learn to set legs too in case anyone else is fool enough t go climbin the crag so soon after the first snow ymean seldi grinned something like that eser smiled would you like to be able to do that would i ma n da are allus sayin how much we need a healer down nearer t the villagewe cant allus be runnin t haven an if i could take care of what we need well thatd save us time and gold sure id come back eser smiled again at seldis infectious enthusiasm well then well just have a look at your leg and ill talk with your brother and well see if we can get you sent off home to finish knitting up that bone he turned and nodded at revyn who slipped quietly into his accustomed place beside the cot lifting the blankets and laying his hands gently over the bandages carefully he let his mind sink into the leg beneath the bandages and the splint until he could see the white of the bone buried deep within the flesh the joining of the two pieces was a complete though fragile network of bone and ligaments the break had healed straight and clean he withdrew his awareness and looked up at eser nodding slightly its clean he said quietly eser bent down and touched the leg briefly checking revyns sight against his own and nodded back at his student well seldi youre doing fine ill just have a word with your brother and we can send you home in good health mind you dont try walking too soon now or you might bend the bone thank you healer eser sir seldi murmured breathlessly ill be back before you knowt eser slipped out the door leaving revyn alone with the younger boy im t be a healer like eser an like you revyn can you believet revyn grinned at his friend sharing his delight whodve thought this would come of me breakin me leg tryin t get me mum the last of the ferril flowers was that what you were doing seldi you never said oh aye a stupid enough thing eh i allus promise t pick the last ferril flowers i can find for me mum and i hadnt gone and got em this year so after the first snow i decided to take a last look up the crag t see ifn i could find some when the snow started again teral came up to look for me an we both went down in that rockfall seldi became quiet and looked down at the blanket absently picking at its weave well you never can tell when goodll come to you right revyn asked cheerily standing and heading toward the door to join eser and continue the morning session nay sometimes good comes even when you dont get what you wantor when you dont even get what you promised yourself an somebody else too revyn turned suddenly staring at seldi in shock sometimes good comes even when you dont get what you want he repeated to himself havens i think i must be the fool here seldis climbing the crag to pick flowers for his mother is no stupider than what ive been doing here for the past year he smiled and said his farewells to the young boy without really paying attention to what he was doing his mind still repeating what the lad had said without even knowing it seldi had done more for him than a year of esers teachings passing into the hallway revyn nearly ran into the master healer who was just returning a tall strapping youth with a striking resemblance to seldi following in his wake ah revyn there you still are i will just take derem in to see his brother and we can finish visiting our patients i know youll be in a hurry now revyn gave his teacher a questioning glance and saw the smile crinkling the corners of esers eyes i have letters for you from elann he said opening the door to seldis room and gesturing for the other boy to enter then going in after him revyn stared at the closing door then turned and hastened down the hall to the next occupied sickroom not even bothering to wait for eser to finish talking to seldi revyn took the two letters from esers hand and hurried out to the garden ignoring the midwinter cold he always read letters from home in the privacy of what he had come to consider his grotto bad weather notwithstanding brushing the snow off of the small bench he sat down and studied the envelopes the first he recognized as his mothers handwriting and he expected the second to be from chylla revyn nearly dropped the second letter in surprise when he saw that the second letter was addressed in the awkward blocky script of his brother why hadnt chylla written him why would myndal of all people write to him he decided to read myndals letter first it would surely be the shorter and would probably only be a tirade against him anyway revyn your sister took sick a fortnight ago going outside in the snow like the fool she was she said she was going to find you but i think she was running away from the decent marriage i had arranged for her anyway she took sick real badly after we found her and brought her back she died last week at a candlemark before midnight i thought you ought to know but we dont expect you back soon so we buried her right away myndal hot tears flooded from revyns eyes as he read the last lines trying to force his mind to accept them chylla his beloved golden sistergone no it wasnt true it couldnt be true gods why chylla why couldnt it have beenhe stopped that thought before it completely formed no he couldnt wish death on anyone even myndal healers werent allowedagain he stopped his thoughts before he touched that which he feared and wanted so much he folded the page before his tears splotched the ink beyond legibility tucking it absently into his tunic hurt raged inside him as his mind cried her name in agony long minutes later he broke the seal of his mothers letter and slowly unfolded it my poor dear son weep as i write this weep for your poor sister and weep for your foolish brother ah if the gods only knew how i suffered i am sure myndal has told you what has happened but i doubt me that he told you all he had arranged a disagreeable marriage for poor chylla wanting to wed her to a rich man my own fathers age simply to combine our lands i could do nothing to stop his plans nor could your poor sister ah me how foolish i was i should have dissuaded her from her attempt to flee to you she left just before a great storm came up myndal was furious and set out with hounds and men after her they brought her back halffrozen and sick the fever set in and myndal refused to send for any healers saying chylla would be fine and that she deserved a little sickness for her disobedience i sent for the herbhealer but she was helpless finally myndal sent to hold gellan for they have a full healer but by then it was too late ah poor chylla my heart grieves for her my son as it does for you as soon as you are able come home to me for i fear i need you more than ever your everloving mother revyns tears began again but this time he felt awash in a feeling of guilt if only he hadnt stayed to be trained and to continue his bardic schooling if only hed gone home when he knew he couldnt be a bard chylla would still be alive he could have stopped myndal from marrying her off to an old weakling he could have helped her he should have brought her to haven with him he should have a sudden thought struck him and he turned back to the letter yes his mother had said that myndal had refused to get a healer until it was too late gods his fault again hed been resisting the healers holding back on his training trying to give any bardic gift at all as much chance to emerge as possible hoping against hope that he could still be a bard if he had taken the training as it had come maybe he could have been home and if chylla had gotten sick anyway he could have healed her he had a strong enough gift he now knew that instinctively now he accepted it now that it was too late for chylla twice and three times a fool twice and three times his fault he tucked his mothers letter next to the other inside his tunic folded his arms across his knees bent his head down and wept furiously shaking with sobs as he reviled himself for his stupidity he grieved for his sister and blamed himself for his grief the tears soaked the arms of his winter cloak chilling him as the snow seeped into his bones but he didnt care chylla was dead and it was all his doing nothing would ever matter again not without chylla there for him much later revyn was only vaguely aware of eser and some other healers running toward him with blan kets they snatched him up and brought him in warming him and giving him the healing teas that he had so often helped to brew thoughts of chylla raced through his fevered mind until finally he slept he was back at elann standing outside the gardens on a foggy spring day hazy clouds swirled around him and his head throbbed painfully somewhere he heard music then he heard the golden music of chyllas laughter a sharp pain stabbed deep into his heart when he heard the joyous sound chylla he cried im sorry he ran into the garden maze calling her name following the laughter that rang in his head chylla come back to me suddenly he rounded a corner and there she was rosy as ever her golden hair spilling over her shoulders her bare feet buried in the fresh green grass chylla he gasped im sorry so sorry its all my fault oh be quiet revy she said affectionately maybe myndal was right maybe we are both fools but if i could have been there i could have healed you if id accepted my training her laughter rang out again if youd been there it would have happened differently but dont you see it doesnt matter now the havens are so bright so wonderful they sent me back to wake you up its not your fault silly ill be fine but chylla she stepped forward and put a golden fingertip across his lips no more of that now tell mother i love her and that im happy she always worried about the ending of life tell her its just a new beginning she danced backward and began to head toward another of the maze pathways just before she disappeared she turned to face him and revy dont worry about that song you were going to write for me just keep healing its a different music but its all connected she slipped back into the maze and the shrubs began to disappear into the haze around him rooted to the spot he cried out her name trying to bring her back to him revyn wake up eser murmured again holding the students head in one hand and a mug of tea in the other eser revyn said wonderingly turning his head slightly to look at his teacher a smile lit the healers face as he raised the cup to revyns lips drink he said and rest your mother only needs to grieve for one child at a time revyn nodded and drank obediently then slipped back down under the quilts the dream of chylla was still so strong so clear in his mind and his heart eser smiled again and nodded to himself the lad would heal soon and then they could talk again about his resistance to the training he stood and slowly headed towards the door a weak voice stopped him eser how long before i can resume my training in the house of healing the healer tried unsuccessfully to hide the happiness in his voice as he turned to the bed again you wont be able to visit the sickrooms for at least another week until your strength is back we can still give you some lessons here in your room though would you like your lute you can begin to practice again in a few days no i dont think so revyn said drowsily chylla told me i was better off playing a different kind of music the school up the hill by elisabeth waters elisabeth waters sold her first short story to marion

she has appeared inla gioconda manon lescaut madame butterfly khovanschina das rheingold wertherandidomeneo the voices were particularly loud today all day the instructions unspoken and impersonal were dinned into her brain this is how to make it rain now you do it she spent the entire day resisting trying to block them out these voices werent so bad though at least they werent men wanting her to do things she had no desire to domen who saw her as a thing not a person with feelings then twilight came she had always hated twilight when her mothers customers started arriving she had never liked her mothers customers and had resolved at a young age that she was going to find some way to live without selling her body and that was before she started hearing what they were thinking some of the customers wanted her in addition to her motheror instead of her mother and when her mother started thinking that it was time she began earning her keep she ran away as far and as fast as possible until she found a place where she felt safe but still twilight made her uneasy and her resistance to the commands weakened myrta lay back in the tub in her room and relaxed maybe it was a bit selfindulgent but she really enjoyed a bath in the early evening before she had to busy herself with the rush of customers the inn got every evening particularly in the bar the town of bolthaven had been built around the winter quarters of a mercenary troop when the skybolts moved out their garrison had been taken over by a mageschool the largest white winds school in rethwellan now instead of drunken mercenaries the bar got student mages sometimes this created problems a mercenary could be asked to leave most of his weapons back at the barracks but a mages abilities were always with him and if the mage was young enough for practical jokes and or foolish enough to get too drunk well the school had a policy for that theyd send down a teacher to stop whatever was going on and the school would pay for any damage done myrta heard running footsteps in the hall and a quick tap on her door one of the barmaids dashed into the room before myrta had time to say enter excuse me mistress but its raining in the kitchen myrta surged out of the tub splashing a fair amount of water around the room as she halfdried herself threw on the nearest garment and ran for the kitchen it was indeed raining in the kitchen a thin layer of cloud had formed just below the ceiling and rain dripped steadily from it fortunately the brick floor in the kitchen sloped slightly to a drain in the center so that water was running out as fast as it fell and the stew for tonights dinner was cooking in the fireplace so the rain wasnt falling into it but the floor was getting rather wet and slippery and the biscuits the cook had been rolling on the center table were a total loss the tables surface was being rapidly covered with flourandwater paste and the cook was cursing steadily serena had been a skybolt until an injury left her with a permanent limp myrta counted herself very fortunate to have serena in the kitchen she was a wonderful cook and she wasnt frightened by the occasional magical mishap frequently angry but never frightened the new scullery maid on the other hand was cowering in the corner by the fireplace she looked wet miserable and terrified poor girl thought myrta shes not used to the hazards of bolthaven yet and she cant be more than thirteen years oldif that serena i think both you and leesa had best go get into dry clothes ill send up to the school and have them deal with this serena stalked out still grumbling leesa scuttled after her hugging the wall trying to stay as far as possible from everyone else myrta closed the door behind them sent the barmaid back to her regular duties and went out to the stables ruven yes mistress the stable boy a stocky lad of seventeen appeared from one of the stalls i need you to run up to the school present my compliments to master quenten and tell him its raining in our kitchen raining in the kitchen right ruven wasnt terribly bright about anything but horses and mules and thus he tended to accept everything however outrageous as normal he dashed off and myrta returned to the bar to wait for help to arrive elrodie one of the teachers at the school was there within half an hour in addition to being an earthwitch she was also an herbalist master quenten wasnt certain how much salvage would be required for tonights dinner she explained greeting myrta lets go see the damage the two women stood in the doorway it was still raining but the fire under the stew still burned and the stew did not seem to myrta to have scorched i think the stew will be all right elrodie said confirming myrtas opinion assuming i can get the rain stopped quickly she sighed that shouldnt be too difficult the apprentices have been practicing weather magic all week by now i think i could stop rain in my sleep thank you elrodie myrta said ill leave you to work in peace then ill be in the bar when youre ready for me elrodie nodded absently already rooting in her beltpouch for supplies the rain was stopped in short order the kitchen cleaned up and serena even managed to finish a new batch of biscuits in time for dinner myrta went to bed in the early hours of the next morning believing that life was back to normal this belief lasted until the next evening when she was interrupted just as she was about to get into the tub mistress what is it rose its not raining in the kitchen again is it no mistress the barmaid took a deep breath and said nervously this time its fog myrta put her gown back on and went down to the kitchen everything was normal in the other rooms but at the kitchen doorway the air turned misty gray the visibility in the kitchen was less than an arms length as myrta discovered when she stuck her arm into the fog and her hand vanished cursing from the center of the room informed her that serena was still managing after a fashion ill send for help she informed the cook elrodie arrived and surveyed the scene with a teachers eye yes this is todays apprentice lesson all right and someone has done a very nice job of it but why is it in my kitchen myrta asked elrodie sighed either its a practical joke or weve got an apprentice whose control needs more work ill clear this up for you and then ill have master quenten put a shield around your building for a few days so that no external magic can get in here that should give us time to sort through the new apprentices and find out whos doing this im truly sorry for the inconvenience mistress myrta myrta shrugged these things happen and it could be a lot worse just fix it so that the cook can see what shes doing a shield around this place should certainly take care of the problem she broke out of his grip and ran terrified into the first hiding place she could find what he wanted was only too clearhe wanted her to do what her mother had done but he wasnt even planning to pay her she remembered what her mother had said to her when she was a little girl the one time she had spoken of wanting to do something else when she grew up what else are you good for her mother had asked mother had been so angry that she had never mentioned the subject again but she had resolved that she would rather die than be a harlot but maybe she was one maybe if your mother was you didnt have any choice no matter how hard you tried after all why else would he treat her like that it must be her fault somehow the air around her was turning colder and darker now snow was starting to fall she huddled against the wall her face pressed into her knees and just let the snow cover her as the tears froze on her face myrta walked into the bar to find ruven complaining to rose and margaret i dont know what she made such a fuss about i barely touched the girl i wasnt going to hurt her what girl myrta wondered please dont let it be anyone with protective or influential parents ruven rose said patiently you scared her and you were going to hurt her what do you mean ruven asked i never hurt you two margaret sighed rose is eighteen and im nineteen leesa is twelve much smaller than you and a virgin you were going to hurt her if you continued with what you were doing myrtas relief that this problem was confined to her own household was cut short by a stream of curses coming from the kitchen she hurried there at once the kitchen looked normal enough but when she joined serena at the entrance to the pantry she saw a great cloud of white before her eyes for an instant she thought that someone had dropped a bag of flour but then she realized that all the white stuff was coming straight down from the ceiling and it was cold ruven she called go tell master quenten that it is snowing in my pantry and i would greatly appreciate it if he would give the matter his personal attention since this appears to have come through his shields ruven ran out immediately but it took a while for master quenten who was not a young man to come down the hill by the time he arrived everything in the pantry was covered with six inches of snow i apologize for the delay mistress myrta he said mildly i stopped to check my shields on the way here and they are intact its beginning to look as though whatever is causing this is here not at my school here myrta said incredulously do you think i hire mages to wait on my customers not knowingly im sure master quenten replied but tell me who was in the building when this started i was myrta said along with the two barmaids the cook and the scullery maidand i believe that ruven was indoors at the time as well ruven looked as if he would rather not have been anywhere near the house i didnt do anything to her honest to whom master quenten inquired raising his eyebrows ruven stared at him dumbly and rose answered for him the scullery maid it seems that ruven fancies her but she doesnt fancy him indeed master quenten turned his attention to rose how old is this girl and how long has she been here shes twelve rose said and shes been here about three weeks master quenten looked around the kitchen and where is she now margaret looked worried i thought she was in here she ran out of the bar crying when i came in and ruven let her go myrta silently resolved to pay a lot more attention to ruvens activities in the future serena frowned trying to remember she ran in here crying and i think she went into the pantry master quenten hurried into the pantry the snow stopped falling as soon as he crossed the threshold and the clouds just below the ceiling thinned and vanished the snow on the floor melted away from his feet as he walked the length of the room and reached down to grasp what appeared to be a sack of grain covered in snowuntil he pulled the girl to her feet and began gently brushing snow off her hair and shoulders i think weve found our mage he said calmly leesa looked even more incredulous than myrta had at the suggestion thats silly she said there arent any magesexcept in old ballads my mother said so indeed quenten asked where are you from child leesa looked at the floor haven she said softly valdemar master quenten said that explains a lot until recently there were no mages in valdemar it was certainly the most uncomfortable place for a mage to be he shuddered at the memory i was there once briefly and as soon as i crossed the border it was as if there was something watching me all the time i got out as soon as i could he looked leesa over carefully so if you were born in valdemar with a magegift which you werebelieve me anyone with magesight can see ityou would never know you had it as long as you stayed there but when you came to rethwellan whatever it is that inhibits magic in valdemar would stop affecting you if its so obvious that im a mage leesa said disbelievingly then why didnt that teacher who came here the last two days notice it that is a good question master quenten said approvingly elrodie has no magesight so she would not have noticedand i imagine you kept out of her way as much as possible didnt you yes leesa admitted being around mages makes me feel funnytheyre so noisy yelling about how to make it rain or how to make fog until i feel like my head is going to burst you heard the instructions on how to make rain two days ago and how to make fog yesterday right leesa nodded i dont like hearing voices all the time it was nice when they stopped so you didnt hear anything today leesa shook her head no not until ruven came in and grabbed me then i could hear him really loud she shuddered at least my mothers customers paid her to do stuff like that master quenten turned a measuring eye on ruven myrta glared at the boy cant you tell when a girl is not interested she asked or dont you care he doesnt care leesa said suddenly furious i told him to stop and i tried to get away from him but if margaret hadnt come in then you probably would have killed him master quenten finished calmly and quite possibly leveled the entire building while you were at it leesa looked at him uncomprehendingly im not a harlot she said id rather die than be one well that explains the snow master quenten said what do you mean myrta demanded she turned her perfectly justifiable anger at what was being done to her inward instead of outward part of her wanted to die and part of her put the weather lessons of the last two days together precipitation and a low enough temperature generally produce snow lessons serena said leesa quenten said fog occurs in nature when the ambient temperature approaches the dew point leesa finished the sentence automatically with the air of a student who had heard the lesson more times than she wanted to youre a quick study master quenten said approvingly leesa just shrugged compliments made her feel uneasy since her own mother had never seen anything to praise in her she figured that anyone who was nice to her wanted something in return but she couldnt read this man he didnt broadcast his thoughts the way most men she had encountered did what do you want she asked him suspiciously i want you to come up the hill to my school to live and study there so that you can learn how to use your abilities without hurting anyone i havent hurt anyone leesa protested youre hurting yourself master quenten pointed out you are standing here in dripping wet clothing and by my reckoning this is the third day youve managed to soak yourself to the skin keep this up and youll be sick do you have any dry clothes left well no leesa admitted after a moments thought everything i own is still damp come on upstairs margaret said and rose and i will find something to fit you we werent in the kitchen during any of the incidents so our spare clothes are dry good idea rose agreed she glanced at master quenten to see if he had any objections then took leesas hand the three girls went up the stairs to the large attic room they shared what you said about her leveling the building myrta said as soon as the girls were out of earshot you were exaggerating werent you no quenten said as serena shook her head she really could have done it its fortunate for all of us that the lessons the last few weeks have been basic weather magic rather than say how to summon a fire elemental he looked at ruven you young man have had a very narrow escape and i wasnt joking about her killing you if you hadnt let her go if she had felt truly cornered and desperate you would be dead by now think about that next time youre tempted to treat a girl worse than you would treat a horse but horses are different ruven protested serena snorted yes theyre bigger than you are and they kick harder go back to the stables ruven shouldnt he apologize to her myrta asked not if she can read thoughts serena said thats why i always say exactly what im thinkingi spent enough of my time in the skybolts around master quenten and his mages to learn that youre much safer around mages if your behavior matches your thoughts since ruven obviously doesnt understand what hes done wrong any apology he attempted to make would be perceived by leesa as an insultand hes insulted her more than enough already i see your point myrta said ruven you can go back to the stables now and i suggest that you stay there ruven still looking bewildered shrugged and went out meanwhile quenten was conferring with serena youve worked with her for several weeks whats your impression shes smart determined and a hard worker serena replied promptly ill be sorry to lose her its not often you get help that diligent but shes running scared from somethingprobably her mothers way of life im not a harlot myrta quoted softly id rather die than be one exactly serena said and if id rather die had been id rather kill wed have a real mess on our hands the sooner shes moved up to the school the better youre sending me away leesa stood in the doorway looking stricken the fact that she was wearing clothes too large for her made her look even more like a helpless and frightened child to myrtas astonishment for serena had never struck her as the motherly type serena limped over to leesa and held out her arms and leesa took the step that closed the small distance between them and clung to serena master quenten is an old friend of mine serena said quietly we were skybolts together and ive trusted him with my life many times almost as many as ive trusted you with mine master quenten pointed out serena ignored him hes good people and the school he runs is one of the best youll have a room of your own there with a lock on the door leesa looked sideways at master quenten who nodded and youll have people to teach you how to use your powers there are a lot of jobs that mages can do and i think that youre going to be a very good mage i think so too quenten said smiling at her whats the catch leesa asked still suspicious am i going to be a prisoner up there no you wont be a prisoner master quenten assured her students are not allowed to leave the school grounds without permission but permission is routinely granted when you have free time he chuckled how many of our students do you get in your bar here every night quite a few myrta said and even more on holidays and ill come up and visit you too serena said reassuringly youre not going to vanish into a dungeon once you reach journeyman status you can go out and get a job if youre tired of studying and by then you wont have to worry about anyones trying to rape youyoull be able to defend yourself from idiots like ruven leesa looked up at her truly serena nodded truly and you promise youll come visit me i promise leesa chewed on her lower lip then decided all right ill go excellent master quenten said you can share my horse on the ride uphill leesas eyes sparkled riding a horse was a real treat but promise me one thing leesa serena said even when youve learned how dont turn that idiot ruven into a frog its a waste of energy leesa laughed i promise chance by mark shepherd in mark shepherd began collaborating with mercedes lackey in

in he is not what i expected and everything i expected guardsman jonne thought as he made his way back to the camp what i didnt expect was that he would look so tired it had been a candlemark since making the acquaintance of heraldmage vanyel and already jonne was convinced that the gods had sent him to this place for a reason it certainly took haven long enough to send a mage here on the karsite border the battle had been raging for some time and until recently had been limited to the more conventional elements of warfares arrows swords knives these were the things jonne knew well levinbolts and magelightning these were better left to the magicians but vanyel he is no mere magician if the stones ive been hearing are true he could level the entire town of horn with a glance jonne walked with a lightness in his step and a gladness in his heart both of which were unfamiliar feelings in this wartorn land hed grown up in the area with karse just on the other side of the valley and hed be come accustomed to the karsites occasional war threat but jonne and his family comrades in arms and friends had never felt as vulnerable as they had this war jonnes family owned a good piece of the land bordering karse including a number of crystal mines that were relatively untouched so he had a personal interest in defending the border as well as a patriotic one lately the war had gone badly and this was most certainly one of the reasons why vanyel the heraldmage had been sent perhaps there was another reason which had nothing to do with the war the kingdom or even with vanyels magical abilities perhaps jonne thought we were simply meant to meet there were other stories about vanyels lovers one in particular they said he was shayachern that his loves were all young men jonne was in his thirtieth summer had never married but had also been drawn to the males of his village from an early age he knew what he was long before puberty breathed new life into his body while torturing it with growth but only recently hed had a name for it shayachern his experiences in youth and early adulthood were awkward brief and scarce and had never grown into anything other than fumbling adolescent experiments the last of a few years before with a young farmer having marital problems might have become more than a single night but the farmer had second thoughts guilty thoughts con nected to his religion and had pushed jonne out of his life and declared the whole affair a moment of weakness that he would not repeat jonne accepted the reaction and his fate resigned to a life of loneliness then he started hearing stories about others this heraldmage in particular and he began to wonder if perhaps he might meet someone like himself who would want more than a single night of physical pleasure when his captain asked for volunteers to be the heraldmages guide he raised his hand immediately given vanyels mysterious and frightening reputation for destroying armies at a glance no others offered their services which was just as well as jonne was the only one who knew the area having grown up in this very forest vanyel and other important valdemaran officers had made camp on a hillside jonne looked back at the camp now visible as a campfire in the forest when jonne had asked them why the camp was so far from the troops vanyel had replied that it was to draw any magical attack toward him the heraldmage and away from the troops who were ill equipped to deal with such an attack jonne thought this a great act of bravery or stupidity since he had little experience in magical warfare he withheld judgment after all he was a mere country lad trained as a soldier whereas vanyel was a full herald and a mage to boot educated at the collegium and it was rumored a close friend of the king himself vanyel has survived many battles magical and otherwise he must know what hes doing jonne reasoned or he would not be here filling in for five heraldmages after his brief introduction to vanyel the guardsman sensed something familiar behind the younger mans eyes it was a look a spark of recognition that jonne had seen maybe a dozen times in his life it was a lingering gaze normally brief between most men but between shayachern the gaze lasted a moment longer just long enough to let the other know that yes i know you too we are both different the guardsman also felt vanyels power behind the sexuality jonne had a slight gift for empathy and mindspeech but it was so unpredictable that he did not qualify for training occasionally the gift would surface when his emotions were charged as they were this evening jonne bid him good evening with promises to return the next day yes he knows he is he thought trying not to let his joy show to the others gathered there the next day they would properly scout the karse border and perhaps catch a glimpse of the enemy way off in the distance war seemed to be a distant prospect now as more pleasant thoughts occupied his mind as he made his way back to his company nearby was a system of caves he would show the heraldmage the path jonne had taken passed along a ridge below which was a sea of tents housing valdemars forces here and there was the occasional revelry as this was sovvan which some insisted on celebrating despite the circumstances the tents looked like shingles on a tiled roof reflecting pale light from a full harvest moon his own tent was down there somewhere and as he began the descent to the valley he even fantasized that some night very soon he may not be sleeping in it alone so long jonne thought so very long the guardsman didnt want assume too much after all jonne was no spring chicken anymore and he had no way of knowing if the mage would find an older man attractive even if he was only five years his senior many years of sword training and a dislike for wine left him leaner and younger than his years he made a point of staying in shape not only to maintain his strength and stamina but to keep himself physically appealing for that special man wherever and whenever he might happen along jonne wanted so much to believe that vanyel was that man the path led downward into a thicker part of the forest where the shadows darkened jonne hesitated before starting down it something felt wrong very wrong the hair on his neck stood up above the hill where vanyels group was camped a dark stormcloud blotted out the moon lightning raced from it striking the ground rippling through the sky there had been no sign of rain a mere hour before wind whipped up from the south racing up the valley and through the forest trees swayed around him and he felt a surge of magic evil magic coming from karse jonne saw the magic for what it was an attack from the south on this night of all nights when we would least expect it he thought in panic his first duty was with the company but the rest of the army was still some distance away and vanyels tent was much closer something called to him drawing him back the way he came from the thunderclouds came another streak of lightning followed by an enormous fireball which struck the hillside sending a cloud of sparks high in the air gods was that their camp jonne thought breaking into a run have they been destroyed he didnt want to consider the possibility that heraldmage vanyel was injured but when he reached the camp he knew someone had been hurt three of the tents were ablaze and other guardsmen were scurrying about trying to put out the fires the hair on the back of his neck raised again guardsman jonne dropped to the ground and covered his head the concussion hammered through the ground he lay against a wave of heat blazed over him scorching the back of his hands covering his head behind him someone was screaming another guardsman was on fire and others tried to wrestle him to the ground lord and lady what is attacking us someone shouted but in the chaos jonne didnt see who jonne started to get up but before he was fully on his feet a voice resounded in his head guardsman come help us came the distraught words in the shadows cast by the flickering flames jonne saw a shape which moved toward him what he first took for a large man in herald whites turned out to be a white horse no not a horse jonne thought that is a companion he knew enough about the heralds and their partners to know that this was no mere horse and was as intelligent as any man vanyel is injured the words sounded come help us now at the mention of the heralds name jonne stood straight up vanyel he called out where is he then he knew he was speaking to the companion this way the companion answered moments before the next explosion hit jonne heard nothing as a flash of light illuminated the entire area the light came from behind him as it cast his long shadow on the ground before him the explosion threw him forward into his own darkness something solid nudged him solidly in his ribs when he opened his eyes the companion was standing over him looking down you survived the companion mindspoke you and vanyel the others are dead again jonne got up the camp had been leveled by whatever struck them last all that remained of the tents were wisps of burning fabric a forest fire raged spanning outward burning away from them filling the air with thick smoke the companion appeared to be singed and smelled of burned hair but for the most part unhurt items of jonnes own clothing continued to smolder and the guardsman batted them out he moaned when he touched the back of his neck and hands the only parts of him that were burned the others jonne murmured then he saw them burned unmoving bodies lay about like discarded dolls then vanyel where is he this way the companion said and led jonne to a clearing just beyond the tents above lightning continued to flash casting brief moments of visibility on the area still no rain had fallen but threatened to at any moment vanyel lay in the center of the clearing and the companion went to him nudging with her nose hes alive the companion mindspoke but he is injured help him onto my back this is not a safe place anymore the guardsman sniffed the smoky air remembering that whatever sent that last blast was still out there somewhere and was probably getting ready for another attack jonne easily picked up the herald noting his slight weight as he propped him up on the beast vanyel muttered something unintelligible as he found his balance on the saddle he can ride the companion told mm take us to safety please guardsman lightning struck the campsite several paces behind him the blast spattered them with dirt and pebbles and in reflex jonne shielded his face with his arm time to go now there are caves nearby jonne offered will that take us to them the companion ordered while you still can jonne led the companion and her barely conscious rider to the mouth of one of the hidden caves in the distance he heard battle and felt an urge to go join it torn between his duty to his company and his new assignment to vanyel as his guide he had little trouble choosing his course of action this herald is injured and if i dont take him to safety we will lose him and all will be lost the rational part of jonnes mind told him but beyond his duty he felt a link to vanyel as if they were part of the same brotherhood the brotherhood of shayachern jonne had chosen this cave because it had a hot spring pool near the mouth and also because it had a few provisions they would need which hed stored down here in case of an emergency the guardsman led the companion a few paces into the cave where he paused to light a torch mounted on the cave wall the sudden light revealed a pair of straw mattresses lanterns candles and a cabinet which assuming it hadnt been disturbed had medicines and supplies he would need as he helped vanyel down he saw in the blazing torchlight the burns they were three lines slicing through his herald whites reaching from his neck down past his waist jonne gently cradled vanyel in his arms hoping he wasnt injuring him more by moving him lord and lady what did this to him he thought but deep inside he already knew magelightning what was he taking on out there in that clearing as he lowered him to the mattress vanyel opened eyes wide with alarm easy easy jonne said suddenly concerned for his own safety im guardsman jonne and im here to help you the brief words seemed to do the trick vanyel visibly relaxed and allowed the guardsman to ease him onto the mattresses vanyels whites practically fell apart as he lay him on the mattress the magelightning had sliced through his clothes jonne reached into the cabinet for some ointment he hoped was still in there it was and when he opened the ceramic jar jonne found vanyel eyeing him with a mixture of admiration and something else an emotion jonne couldnt readily identify we were under attack vanyel said the camp the campanion stepped forward nuzzled vanyel affectionately and the herald looked directly into her deep blue eyes all of them he asked sadly jonne realized they were communicating and the companion had just told him about the camp then i have no energy left yfandes a pause yes i will stay putouch vanyel had moved sideways on the mattress raking his arm across his burns he looked down at his ruined whites i guess this uniforms had it he said that makes the second this month vanyel sat up on an elbow regarding jonne thoughtfully wincing at the evident pain where is this he said looking around the cave this mine belongs to my family jonne said kneeljng down beside vanyel we are safe for the time being how do you feel vanyel shrugged leaned back on the mattress dreadful after that last round he said jonne waited for him to continue i wasnt ready for that attack we had no idea karse had mages that powerful those burns look nasty jonne said looking over vanyels mostly naked body magelightning the worst vanyel said but his tone had changed from that of a powerful man to a meek boy it got through my shields somehow just wasnt ready lean back jonne said ill put some of this on jonne smoothed the ointment on starting from his neck and working down to his ankles vanyel looked down at himself then gave an embarrassed laugh dont take offense vanyel said through obvious embarrassment jonne tried not to laugh and continued to ignore vanyels excitement im shayachern he said flustered sometimes i dont have any control over it dont worry about it jonne said suppressing a grin so am i vanyel sat up youre what im shayachern too jonne said but vanyel still looked stunned are you sure im thirty years old jonne said as he continued spreading the ointment i should think i would know by now wouldnt you vanyel looked too tired to discuss it further i would never have known the herald said distantly and neither would i if your reputation hadnt preceeded you but given your condition i doubt youre feeling very romantic jonne said reluctantly im not suggesting anything at the moment vanyel reached over and touched his wrist but am some time later they had submerged themselves in the hot springs near the mouth of the cave van took a little more time to get in wincing as the waters touched his wounds but in moments he had surrendered to the pools warmth and allowed jonne to wrap his arms around him the shallow pool was only waist deep but had a smooth rock surface beneath and a natural bench for them both to recline on steam rose from the surface of the water forming clouds around their heads my life ended right now i would consider it fullfilled jonne thought as he held vanyel closer to him avoiding the worst of the burns fortunately the injuries were bad only above the waist i should feel guilty about leaving the war right now but i dont vanyel said snuggling closer to jonne yfandes had politely excused herself before things had gotten too involved and vanyel said he was keeping in touch with her the companion had recently returned from a brief recon of the area and her news had been good all magical attacks had ceased and the regular army was on alert ready for any conventional invasion the karsite mages may think im dead vanyel said casually in which case i had better keep my head low and in this cave i suspect this place is shielding me from them he shook his head all those men dead why was i the only one to survive jonne didnt know how to answer him so he remained quiet something dark and sinister haunts this man and if i pry too much hes likely to shut me out completely jonne reasoned he will tell me when he is ready if that time ever comes you survived so you could be with me jonne teased and nibbled on his right ear otherwise who would i have had to sleep with my horse your horse vanyel said with a smirk would have had more meat on his bones than i not to mention well van turned and gave him a long slow kiss afterward he proceeded to wrap jonnes arms around him again holding them tightly how can you find me attractive van said after a long pause ive lost so much weight in the last year im practically a skeleton the question confounded jonne how can i find him attractive how can i not i havent felt this good bedding someone since i was twenty you are a most beautiful man vanyel jonne said i suspect that youre not very good to yourself the guardsman almost regretted saying that last this was getting into an area vanyel probably didnt want to explore but van said nothing at first savil would agree vanyel said at last tell me jonne have you ever had a lover what exactly does he mean by lover he wondered and since he didnt want to seem thick he didnt ask a one night fling or a yearlong relationship the farmer hed known was the closest thing to being a lover his marriage to a lady notwithstanding jonne told vanyel about him and the day or two theyd spent in each others intimate company it was not what i would have preferred jonne added but it was what was available he held van tighter as if to emphasize their present situation it was better that than nothing at all jonne hoped that he didnt sound cheap it was how he felt and he assumed honesty is what vanyel wanted then i suppose i must consider myself fortunate to have had tylendel as long as i did vanyel said with only a hint of sadness this is sowan the anniversary of his death that was his lifebonded jonne thought the one he lost the pain must have been he searched but could not find the words to describe what he though van might have felt it was a long time ago but it still feels like a part of me left when he did i dont expect to replace him but you dont have to be alone the rest of your life either jonne blurted uncertain where his words were coming from i dont know what the gods have in mind for me but i do believe we were meant to be together tonight and perhaps tomorrow night as well and after that jonne carefully turned vanyel around and looked directly into his eyes does anyone know afterward they slept and when they woke yfandes had returned well fed from another trip the enemy had left the area as near as she could tell but van was uncertain the brief time hed spent with jonne had helped him recover more energy than he said hed expected and he appeared to be ready to take on the entire karsite army as you are a mage there is something i must give you jonne said pulling on the last of his clothes they had made temporary repairs to vanyels whites but he would still have to replace them as soon as they got back to the camp but you must promise to tell no one about this place because this mine is a family secret and needs to remain that way if karse knew what was down here they would have invaded in force long ago mine vanyel said absently but jonne had already ducked back into one of the dark tunnels moments later he reappeared concealing something wrapped in cloth dont know if ill ever see him again jonne thought even though he doubted last night would be a one night stand the fates can be tricky sometimes vanyel opened the cloth revealing a massive perfectly formed rose quartz crystal the size of his fist the heraldmage stared at its perfection for a long time before saying anything this is the largest rose quartz crystal ive ever seen he said are you certain you want to part with it jonne beamed with pleasure im certain heraldmage just whenever you see it think of me would you vanyel looked like he was about to cry instead he took jonnes hand in his own then wrapped his arms around him in the tightest embrace yet i will never forget you guardsman the heraldmage whispered in his ear sword of ice by mercedes lackey and john yezeguielian hailing from the chicago area john yezeguielian began his writing career at when an article of his was published in a local paper since then hes written a music review column and various other pieces of journalism this short story marks his first published fiction previously he has worked in fast food owned and operated three businesses trained animals programmed computers and been a bodyguard to celebrities and princesses his hobbies include sailing scuba diving motorcycling aviation aikido and falconry yes hes a reallife hawkbrother prose and music however remain his highest passions he lives near tulsa with a cougar a bobcat two german shepherds and of course a mews full of hawks and falcons downwind the voice in savils head demanded and savil followed in the direction of the falcon as it changed trajectories the huge bird pulled its wings in tightly now an arrow slicing through the sky hurry the raptor pleaded and savil felt the urgency in the falcons mental message if only it could give me more than vague concepts savil mumbled imprecations under her breath as she scrambled over yet another boulder in this miserable craggy landscape all at once as if in answer to her unspoken wish savils mind flooded with images sensations of speed overwhelmed her as her vision was superseded by the birds point of view as it twisted and gyrated plummeting recklessly from the heavens vertigo swept savils footing from beneath her she scrambled blindly now her fingers clawing desperately at the granite face struggling for purchase as she slid down the side dangerously close to a ledge shut it down center she reminded herself this is novice stuff regain control in an instant savil was back in charge of her perceptions then she slowly let the birds sendings back in until they were vaguely superimposed on her true sight she couldnt see a man yet but from the birds eyes she could see what lay over the next rise rock scorched and molten trees burst their trunks still smoldering the scene was one of rampant havoc implying power turned loose to run wild in a way that sent atavistic chills up her spine and then the falcon swiveled around one last boulder kicking its feet out before its body the bird flared its long pointed wings and set down gently upon firm ground or what in her minds eye savil could see the falcon looking in what must be her direction the raptors sure steady gaze finding her amidst the mass of upthrown debris still quite some distance off but the birds vision was wavering rising and falling and then the falcon cast its gaze downward and savil saw the burned face of a man the rising and falling must mean shes perched atop his chest hes alive and breathing though the gods only know why her resolve hardened savil reached out with her special gifts locating the man and probing swiftly and delicately at his mind gently she pulled back a layer of unconsciousness moving deeper and pulled back as if stung this man this strange one somehow linked with a hawk was able to function while the full raw power of a major node of magical energy flowed in and through his body though still young savil was decidedly a master a full heraldmage and she could not do that for even an instant he must be like a sword of ice to channel such power and still be alive savil thought to herself still wondering what peculiar sort of being it was which she was being called to aid savil scrambled across the tops of the last few boulders and began climbing down into what used to be a mountain glade tayledras beloved savils companion spoke into her mind this is a hawkbrother until kellan had mindspoken savil had all but forgotten her companion amidst the excitement and shock of a birdseye view of flight as she was reminded savil realized kellans voice had been conspicuously absent during the usurpation was blocked kellan pouted feigning a sulk by your whirlwind rapport with that bondbird creature oh really and just how did that come about savil thought to question her companion further but the descent was over and she had other concerns now before her were the charred breathing remains of the only hawkbrother she had ever seen so badly wounded was he that savil was barely certain where to start something had ripped down the hawkbrothers side scorching and cauterizing flesh as it apparently continued from his shoulder to the ground it seemed to be a lightning strike but that was simply not possible no man could have survived even that one blow let alone the other tears and rips in this mans flesh and the agonizing burns across his skin as savils hands cleared his clothing from the wounds her mind sent him energyhealing energy essential to his survival though she was no healer the going was slow as she gingerly pulled the fabric from the hawkbrothers devastated form the power was still flowing through him somehow and savil knew better than to attempt to touch him or his fragile dangerous mind again without warning the bird let out a scream from deep within its throat startled savil pulled away and turned to look at the huge falcon when she looked back again the tayledras eyes were open breathtaking iceblue eyes surrounded by a mass of seared flesh which was healing changing right before her eyes the hawkbrothers gaze met hers for a brief moment then his eyes closed again through the aura of pain which she now realized shed been feeling from him the entire time she could have sworn shed felt the faintest of smiles a myriad of sendings from the bird confirmed what savil had begun to suspectthat the tayledras could heal himself better if shed just remain to protect him and continue to transfer energy to him well she said aloud looking down at him it looks as though you and i are going to be together for a while at least i was ahead of my schedule and there wont be anyone missing me for a couple of weeks then she waited for kellan to catch up with her picking his own way through the rocks and prepared for a long vigil throughout the rest of that day and the next she remained close to the stranger imparting as much healing energy as her own reserves would allow she left his side only to gather wood for the nighttime fires and to step behind a boulder to relieve herself she could see a gradual but marked improvement over that first day by the end of the second she sensed he had recovered enough for her to bathe him savils gentle hands lifted the hawkbrothers head and washed his neck and face with the meager supply from her waterskin even more carefully did she move his body from side to side to wash it removing his tattered garb and replacing it with a clean set of whites of her own at no time during those two days did the hawkbrother make movement or sound and his eyes remained shut as if he were locked in a very deep sleep early in the morning of the third day savils routine of preparing breakfast was interrupted once more by the falcons scream when she looked over at the tayledras he was struggling to rise to his elbows savil rushed to help him thank you but you have already done more than enough the tayledras said to her in clear and coherent mindspeech then though not entirely steady in his movements the hawkbrother rose carefully to his feet his bondbird began chittering pleasantly at him his eyes closed again for a moment and he nodded a warm smile upon his lips my friend has been telling me of your vigilance these past few days it would seem that i am in your debt it was a question phrased as a statement the tayledras were reclusive by nature even hostile toward strangers that she knew though little else even though savil had helped him and perhaps she had even saved his life he would probably be suspicious of her motivations by the customs of some of the strange people who dwelled in this wilderness the fate of one not of ones own tribe was usually left to the gods it was not for anyone else to interfere or concern themselves with what happened to strangers that might be the case with the hawkbrother it could be that while he was grateful for her assistance he would also wonder why she had done so and be suspicious of her motives savil noticed his wary mood and was quick to recognize the skepticism in his tone of voice you may start your repayment by telling me the name by which i am to call you she said smiling knowing that to some folk asking for a personal name was tantamount to asking for a weapon to use against them am called starwind he said with much dignity and the falcon you have been in rapport with is my bondbird you might refer to her as my familiar savil stole a quick glance in the direction of the bird and thought to herself that she wished shed had some bit of meat to offer the hawk as if it had heard her the bird launched itself from the stone it had been perched on taking to the sky with swift powerful beats of its wings soon it was circling high above them then all at once the bondbird dropped its head folded its wings and fell scorching straight downward from the sky toward the quarry its powerful vision had spied excited by the hunt the impressions the bird sent were intense once again savil was swept up in the birds aerial pursuit but not enough so that she was unaware of her companion starwind too appeared caught up in the bondbirds sendings his eyes narrowed a hint of fiery temper behind the hooded lids as he watched through the birds keen eyes when the falcon made impact with the prey starwinds fingers clenched just as the bondbirds talons closed on the ducks neck for another few moments savil knew that she and starwind were sharing in the bloodlust the falcon felt in the kill she found she was salivating along with the bird in anticipation of the rich red feast quivering beneath the falcons talons this was such a unique experience that savil allowed herself to remain caught up in it a little longer starwind was first to break from the trance and as she slowly disentangled herself she noted by his reaction that he had suddenly realized that savil had been linked with the bird during the kill as well as he at the same time his knees gave out and he sat down abruptly on the boulder beside him she made no move to help him as it was possible that such a movement could be misinterpreted he stood up again slowly clearly taking stock of himsetf then as though hed decided something of great importance starwind gathered himself and faced savil directly i may trouble you a bit more sister starwind said looking deeply into savils eyes fear i am yet too weak to return to my ekele without help thats hardly surprising savil said gently as she looked back awestruck by the strange beauty of this man im more than a little amazed that you are able to stand at all and id be happy to help you get to your my ekele my home starwind confirmed her guess your ekele then savil continued and you need not call me sister to convince me to do so she flushed a little wondering how he was reacting to her ln fact id rather that you not think of me as your sister though hardly innocent savil had never been so forward with any man before but there was something about this one something exotic and compelling about this starwind that had her heart beating fast her palms breaking a sweat she supposed shed seen it in him the first time he opened his eyes but shed been too busy tending to his wounds then to pay it any heed now though his face all but healed his elegant movements those iceblue eyes and that mane of snow white hair combined to make an irresistible package or perhaps it was just that she had been out on circuit for a very long time or perhaps starwind seemed very well aware of her reaction it is the fever of the bondbird sister he said gently but firmly and i would call you otherwise if i had your name she sighedbut made a little resolution that the game was not over yet am savil heraldmage of valdemar chosen by kellan and at your serviceover the next couple of days starwind and his bondbird savil and kellan wove their way carefully through the mountains back to starwinds home the place where his tayledras clan lived when they finally arrived they were met by a small group of tayledras starwinds people all similarly exotic most with the same white hair and iceblue eyes they greeted starwind with warmth and relieved enthusiasm obviously glad for his safe return but kept savil at a goodly distance starwind spoke with them in a light musical language at once similar and different to the few words of shinain she knew apparently explaining how hed come to be hurt and how savil had rescued him at one point in his telling of the tale he must have said something shocking because all of the welcoming party turned at once to look at her their eyes wide in disbelief the group then quickly disbanded leaving the four of them alone again on the way to starwinds home savil had explained the nature of the relationship between heralds and companions starwind had not seemed overly surprised explaining that his people had stories of valdemar and even kept some fluency in the tongues of other peoples accordingly starwind directed kellan toward a meadow rich with herbs and grasses for him to eat before accepting savils assistance in the monumental ascent to the hawkbrothers home that home it was lodged somewhere up in the branches of a tree so huge she could hardly believe her eyes and to reach it one had to clamber up a contrivance that was more ladder than staircase savils one real fear was of heights but somehow she managed to put on a brave front showing no signs of her fear in climbing up into the ekele after only one look out the window though she decided shed prefer to seek lodgings on firm ground the vertigo she experienced while in the lofty ekele was simply too much for her starwind chuckled quietly but unkindly you have the tayledras ability at rapport but not our love of the heights it is merely foreign to you remain here a few days and you will come to cherish the hereabove as we do the mere idea was appalling a few days if i remain here a few days ill be in worse shape than you were when we met savil was already quite dizzy from the climb and getting more nauseous by the moment she could not help it now that she was no longer moving she felt a jolt of fear each time the ekele moved with the wind starwind took pity on her probably because although she could conceal the more obvious signs of fright with jokes she could not conceal her increasing pallor as you wish then i would not care to dwell in a deep cave belowground either he said the hertasi keep some rooms herebelow and you are welcome to make your stay in one of them there are some matters i must attend toaffairs of my people with that starwind guided her back down from the ekele and to an oddly constructed building surrounding the trunk of the huge tree which somehow incorporated a warm spring and much green foliage as they walked starwind explained to her about the hertasi and how the sentient elusive lizardpeople tended to the tayledras needs in exchange for protection then he left her to er own devices promising to return within a couple of candlemarks savil used the time to rest and think to take in and shelve away all of the strange wonders shed discovered in the past few days she mindspoke with kellan about it all while he carried on a lively conversation with her savil made note that her companion didnt seem unduly surprised by any of this there are a great many things we know of my love which we are not at liberty to share with you before it is time to do so he said in that infuriatingly patronizing tone he very occasionally used with her it reminded her of her father and brotherand how they used to pat her on the head and tell her that she would be told about something when she was old enough and then of course having dismissed the mere female they would go on about their business and never tell her anything at all savil was about to send kellan a scorching retort when all of the exertions of the last few days caught up with her it seemed like far too much effort to go to and besides she wasnt in the mood for an argument so instead of retorting she ignored him even to the extent of partly blocking him out of her mind while she searched for a place to lie down it didnt take long to find a kind of couch built among all the leaves and foliage and she fell into it and then into a deep and sudden sleep the meeting of the tayledras clan had been going on for hours starwind had been severely chastised for having brought savil into the midst not only of ktrevas holdings but into the very heart of the vale outsiders were never brought this far at the most one allowed them a little way into the fringes of clan territory before dismissing them it had caused no small commotion when starwind had argued that hed done no such thing since savil was not an outsider but one who deserved the title of wingsister the elders had called it nonsense and accused starwind of making up such an outrageous claim to justify his actions claimed his desire for this herald was the true cause of his behavior while starwind did have strong feelings for savil it was not the lust the elders suspected although he himself could not have explained the insistent feeling that he must bring this stranger into the very center of ktreva he could only feel it and without facts to bolster the feelings could only rely on thin logic to convince the others i bring this woman he cried out defiantly because she is one of us have i not told you of her rapport with my bondbird what greater testimony can there be than this tell me when has such a thing happened before there began a quiet murmuring amongst the elders though relatively young starwind had proven himself and his worth on numerous occasions he could only hope that they would decide that it would be unfair to take his word lightly it is not that we do not believe you one elder finally confessed but that we have no precedent for such a thing we are an ordered people as well you know never has anyone who was not of our cousinclans the shinain ever been granted the title of wingsib this woman has not even a drop of shared blood with us he set his jaw do we share blood with hertasti with tervardi or kyree with dyheli yet all of these are welcome here the elder sighed starwind you are young and eager for a change that you see as a clear necessity but we are not comfortable when someone wishes to make things change so suddenly this makes us unwilling to accept that which brings changes and it frightens us to think of how different we may one day become the honest wisdom of the elder held them all in silence for some time starwinds mind was running the whole while he had seen inside of savil knew her good heart how could he convince them of this or even get them to depart from the strictness of their ways long enough to look at her objectively the silence was deafening starwind knew if he did not speak up convince them somehow that they would retreat back into the safety of their routines savil should beno iswingsister to ktreva she has proven her worth with her rapport with my bondbird and earned her place by the acts of charity she performed for this member of the clan i speak for her hi claiming that place and challenge you to examine her spirit and say why this should not be so how could he tell them the things he only felt but had no reason to feel that he knew without doubt that this stranger would be important to the future of ktreva and that ktreva would be instrumental in shaping not only her future but that of many many people outside of the hawkbrother lands people that starwind would never see and who would probably never even dream that tayledras were anything but a fable he had never shown any trace of foresight never been able to look into the future without the aid of one who did have that talent he knew he was taking a chance that all of his actions for many years to come would be regarded with suspicion and mistrust if he could not convince them but he knew what he was doing was right and trusted in the wisdom of the elders to overcome their fears how can we know that you are not simply seeing what you wish to see the first elder asked she sleeps and she is too weary to awaken if you do not alarm her starwind said she trusts us you may touch her mind now and from there see into her heart read what you see there see what it is she represents for her own great clan kvaldemar and then tell me if she is not indeed worthy to be named our wingsister even if we find it so another elder spoke what difference will it make tell me starwind ktreva why we should bring her into our clan she has people of her own and the heralds of valdemar are different from us in more ways than they are similar we do not eat the same foods speak the same tonguewe do not even swear by the same gods she should be made one of us because she is one of us she and her kind differ from us only in the names by which we swear not to the spirit behind those names he replied stubbornly and because we can learn much from each other the ktreva and this heraldmage in many ways our magic is much greater than theirs yet there are things they can do which we cannot it is my belief that what we learn from each otherthe combinationwill be greater than any that we can each of us perform apart another long silence followed each of the elders was considering what starwind had said surely they knew he was right that the ktreva could not live isolated in the pelagirs forever there had even been visions fore sight some of them had experienced which suggested that events in the future would require that they learn to broaden their ways finally the first elder spoke it will cost us nothing to look at this savil you bring us we must at least look before we judge savils sleep was interrupted by dreams memories and nightmares in them she relived experiences from the years since she had first donned whites the moment that kellan had chosen her battles fought in the service of valdemar even passionate feelings for those loved and lost then came a dream of a testa decision she was forced to make three times one which left her frightened exhausted and drained countless hopeless scenarios presented themselves to her over and over again she was forced to decide how to react just as her decision was made the scene would fade and another would take its place each was progressively worse than the last more hopeless more futile and in it she and those around her were suffering greater and greater loss only when the scenario required that she sacrifice kellan her companion did she wake from the nightmare unable to make the impossible choice she woke with a start her own voice screaming to be left alone tears streaming down from eyes wide open in the darkness it was only a dream dearheart kellan consoled her a hideous ugly necessary dream i am fine return to your sleep she was too sleepfogged to take in anything except kellans reassurance too exhausted to question anything kellan said relieved to have kellans voice in her mind she fell back into the embrace of the strange bed and slept until morning if she continued to dream she didnt remember any of it when she awoke she found starwind sitting beside her his hand resting gently on her shoulder she could feel the soft tingle of power as it flowed through him to her good morning wingsister he said cheerfully wind to thy wings wind to thy wings starwind ktreva she answered automatically her head throbbing she wished vaguely that he wasnt being so damned cheerful gods but ive one miserable headache he sobered and looked both contrite and a little guilty forgive me wingsister the elders felt it was necessary she frowned what have the elders to do with my headache then she sat up her own suspicions flaring were your people messing about in my head starwind closed his eyes and spoke quietly into her mind remember all little sister there is nothing to fear with that touch savil suddenly recalled the dreams and sendings shed gotten after the nightmare of sacrificing kellan the knowledge slowing coming forward to her consciousness in a single flash she knew as much about the tayledras as they knew themselves as if she had studied them and their ways all her life the history of the ktreva their philosophies their purpose as entrusted to them by their goddess their mysterious bond with their birds everything given to her including starwinds own memory of the meeting last night every newly gifted memory all rose up and became a part of her as they did her headache dulled and then faded savil lay there unmoving sharing starwinds loving gaze for quite some time they may have lain there for hours longer basking in the communion if a hertasi had not crept in quietly to bring them some fruit without conscious thought she thanked the hertasi who was already leaving in starwinds own tongue then she laughed out loud of the pleasure and strangeness of it all once before in her life she had known the incredible indescribable joy of finding that she belonged somewhere that there were people in the world who welcomed her as one of their own that had been when she became a heraldand now it had happened again so this is what it means to be one of you she whispered not entirely shayana starwind replied but you now share the most of it savils eyes had been alight with the joy of the newfound knowledge and abilities of these strange and wondrous people she knew she could now call her own she was overwhelmed by the allpervasive sense of the peace of this place of the serenity of those who lived here after all the conflicts within and besetting valdemar ktreva vale seemed like a vision of paradise and she wanted to remain here forever and as soon as she had that thought she knew it was impossible for a moment her eyes stung with tears you know i cant stay you must know that im a herald first and always will be so of course ashke of course starwind patted her hand to console her it was that which finally convinced the elders of the trueness of your heart but i want to she confessed desperately as starwinds elegant fingers brushed a tear from her cheek i want to stay here live here in this peace we each have our duties wingsister mine is to the land yours to your people neither of us can fully understand the other yet it is so but we can revel in that which we share i believe that this sharing this exchange between us will be of great importance in times yet to come savil nodded understanding remembering the certainty she held in memories now her own shared with him neither of them knew whybut the certainty was there as real as if they had absolute facts to prove it to be true there is much yet to learn wingsister and far too little time to learn it in we are now your clan as you are one of us every member of ktreva will do what he can to help you gain the skills that are ours and we know you will share willingly of your ways as well and i feel this will not be the last time that those of ktreva and kvaldemar will share their wisdom she thought about her dutybut she had been far ahead of her schedule and there was time a little but there was time where do we start savil asked with your lessons or mine he smiled where both our powers flow from at the nodes then starwind took her hand guiding her to her feet and their journey toward knowledge was begun in the forest of sorrows by john heifers this story marks john heifers fourth fiction sale other stories of his can be found inphantoms of the night future netanda horror story a day scary storieswhen hes not writing or editing he enjoys roleplaying games and disc golf he lives in green bay wisconsin with his fiancee treyon scrambled over the top of the small foothill and raced down the other side never once glancing back he could hear the sounds of pursuit behind him the shouts of men and thuds of galloping horses growing louder the forest loomed before him a thick green mass of trees and underbrush treyon ran for the treeline his side aching seconds later he heard a shout from the foothill there there he goes the hoofbeats started pounding again and treyon knew he was down to his last bit of luck the brigands seemed to be right behind him and that thought drew a bit more energy from his nearly exhausted body the dull ache in his ribs grew as he increased his speed with a surge of energy he dove into the brush and started crawling deeper into the forest behind him he could hear the horses panting and neighing with fear as they stopped short of the trees the voices of the men were fading as treyon extended his lead but he could still hear them whats the matter get in there after im the hells i will thats the forest of sorrows ya stupe you idiot its just a piecea woods nothing gonna happen in there except hes gonna get away you know what kenoranll do if we dont bring him back wouldja rather face her im telling ya i aint going in look its possible death in there or death for sure if we come back without him now lets give the others a chance tcatch up and well go in together boys moving so fast hell leave a trail any moron could follow well grab him and be gone before anybody even knows were here the voices grew fainter as treyon pushed deeper into the woods it grew darker as he pressed onward the trees dwarfing him and swallowing the available sunlight until it seemed he was walking in twilight when he could hear no sounds of pursuit treyon paused for a minute to catch his breath leaning wearily against one of the huge trees surrounding him looking around he wasnt surprised to discover he had no idea where he was better lost and alone than found by them he thought shivering as he remembered their conversation although he didnt know any more about the forest than the bandits did he knew one rumor they didnt only those with no evil intention may enter the forest of sorrows and live he repeated this to himself like a mental prayer almost trusting his belief in the legend to keep him safe more than the legend itself all right treyon enough of this time to find your way out of here hearing his own voice even whispered heartened him looking up he tried to find the sun to figure out which direction he had to go unfortunately the trees were blocking most of the available light making the attempt impossible shrugging his shoulders treyon found a suitable tree and began to climb well at least im not scouting trade caravans for them anymore he thought that having been his primary job with the bandits besides general whipping boy a few minutes later he was among the topmost branches of the tree he had been leaning against feeling the cool wind on his face and looking in every direction once he had gotten his bearings he started down about halfway to the ground his foot slipped and as he was already committed to his next step he started to fall suddenly his feet landed on a thick branch the jarring stop giving him enough time to wrap his arms around the tree trunk and stay there until his heart stopped threatening to leap from his throat once he had calmed down he looked at the branch he was standing on although this was the route he had used on the way up he didnt remember this limb at all shrugging he continued downward the surest thing now he thought is to get my feet as well as the rest of me back on the ground and get moving shinnying down the tree trunk he jumped the last few feetand landed to stare at the battered boots of caith the leader of the trackers who had been chasing him the bandit had stepped around from his hiding place behind the tree and before treyon could move grabbed his tattered shirt and drawn him close little coney sprouted wings and tried flyin to the trees eh not good enough ive pulled the same trick myself a couple o times keeping a tight hold on treyon he raised his head and whistled a series of notes twice within minutes the rest of the brigands had rejoined their leader found the little bastard now lets go kenoran aint gonna be pleased with the delay making sure treyon was in front of him caith pushed him forward and the group began retracing his path back out of the forest the forest was ominously silent making everyone more nervous than they already were by just being in the supposedly cursed woods they had been traveling for a while when caiths advance scout held up his hand the brigand group froze immediately each hand on a weapon every ear and eye alert for danger despite himself treyon craned his head to try and see what was going on soren the bandits best scout crept back to caith and whispered horse in the clearing up ahead what in the hells is a horse doing in these woods one of ours not hardly snow white and clean as a stew bowl after dinner looked right at me this doesnt sound right forest dead as a grave and now a horse comes out of nowhere i want a look taking a stiletto from a sheath behind his neck caith put it to treyons throat one sound outta you boy and ill open yer neck where ya stand now move pulling treyon along the bandit leader moved silently up to the head of the column in a small clearing about ten paces ahead was an animal that took treyons breath away the scouts description did not even begin to do it justice its coat was the color of newfallen snow with a mane and tail that shone even in the wan sunlight the horses lightblue eyes regarded its audience with amusement but it didnt take flight or move at all except to lower its head to crop at the strangely lush grass caith crouched down dragging treyon to the ground with him motioning the other bandits closer he whispered hurriedly heres our chance to make up for losing the runt a horse like this un will hopefully make kenoran more forgiving toren circle round that way yer brother will take the other side and get yer lariats ready the two scouts looked at each other then at the horse nodded and slipped into the brush like ghosting deer despite his fear treyon wondered for an idle second what kind of ability the brothers had that let them communicate without speaking like that his attention was quickly drawn back to the ambush before him the brothers made no more noise than the slight breeze rustling the leaves and treyon quickly lost sight of them so well did they blend in with the trees and bushes the horse was munching a thick clump of grass seemingly unconcerned about the huddled group of ragged men nearby treyon couldnt help wondering what it would be like to ride such an animal sitting on its sleek back as it raced full out across the plains it would probably be the closest thing to pure freedom he could imagine thinking about what kenoren would do to it made him almost ill at that moment treyon knew he had to warn the horse somehow looking up he saw caith was watching his two men who were almost in position his dagger although still under treyons chin had relaxed its pressure a bit allowing him to swallow without feeling the scrape of cold steel noticing a large dead branch next to him treyon subtly shifted his position until he had moved the branch under him pretending to overbalance he stepped directly on it bearing down with all his weight the branch snapped loudly causing everyone to freeze for a moment the horses head jerked up looking directly at treyon who wanted to scream at it to run get away escape he remained silent however locked into the animals stare watching as it did a very strange thing it winked at him before treyon could wonder what this meant he was rocked by a blow that came out of nowhere already overbalanced after stepping on the branch he swayed dizzily after the punch held up only by caiths grip on his shirt looking up again he saw caith glaring at him his mouth curled in a feral snarl by the gods boy if you cost us that horse ill take it out o yer hide treyon just hung there limply knowing the brigand didnt make idle threats the two turned their attention back to the horse caith keeping a tight hand on the boys shirt the bandit waited patiently knowing the brothers would spring their trap with perfect tuning and so it would have been if not for their target as one the two men flicked out their loops of tough woven rope their hands steady their aim true both lassos flaring out to settle around the neck of their quarry or would have if the horse hadnt danced out of the way of the snares with a graceful ease as if it had known exactly where they were all the while treyon exhaled in relief caith noticing the boys reaction cuffed him again the horse neighed the noise sounding like laughter in the silence then turned and slowly trotted off through the trees caith stood up grimacing and called out by the hells i want that horse toren soren take two men and run it down damn it dont come back without it another fools errand to send them off on just like finding the boy he thought the twins stood one of them pointing to two other men and the foursome set out after the shrinking white figure caith put his back against a tree as he waited with the last two bandits he looked around then snorted dont know why that horse is here when our own horses wouldna come in haunted forest my arse one of the other men a newer arrival whom treyon didnt know spoke up maybe its a companion oh is it wheres the bleedin herald hells no caith snorted again just got a little more horse sense than usual living in the wildll do that to an animal sometimes what better place for a horse to live than here eh breezes dying down the other bandit remarked treyon had been standing as well pulled to his feet when caith had risen looking around he also noticed the lack of wind which made what else he saw even more unusual easily passing into terrifying with barely a rustle the trees around the bandits were slowly bending their branches down toward each of the mens heads treyon remained motionless not wanting to attract any attention to himself caith and his men continued their idle conversation unaware of the movement until caith looked again at treyon here now what are you lookin his voice trailed off as he followed treyons gaze to the surrounding foliage which quivered then suddenly lashed out caith his reflexes quicker than the other two released treyon and dove to the ground thinking to find safety there when he hit the ground thick roots erupted all around him completely wrapping his body in brown tendrils and drawing him slowly underground his screaming face the last thing to vanish the other men caught completely by surprise fared just as badly one never got a chance to move impaled by a thick limb that burst from his stomach like a third arm the other managed to get his dagger out before several tree branches wrapped around his neck and jerked him struggling and strangling into its leaves his knife arm flailing uselessly as he disappeared from sight a few seconds later the dagger skittered down the tree trunk and fell to the ground underneath it treyon watched all this without moving without even blinking he just stood there until the screams finished echoing through the woods finally all was silent again the only sign of disturbance being the impaled bandits body still standing grotesquely upright treyon straightened up and took a hesitant step forward then another then another and took off again running through the forest until his legs would carry him no farther sinking to the ground under another large tree heedless of the cursed forest and what might happen to him treyon fell asleep almost before he hit the ground the cracks and pops of a fire slowly woke treyon the first sensation he had was of pleasant warmth surrounding him the second was the unmistakable smell of something cooking making his stomach clench with hunger treyon slowly blinked the last bits of sleep away aware that he was still tired but too concerned with trying to figure out where he was to rest any more he flexed his hand slowly feeling the mat of dry grasses he was laying on overhead a canopy of trees blocked out the sky meaning im still in the forest treyon thought moving his head slowly to the side he looked first at the trees which surrounded him trees that grew so close together they made natural walls encircling the small clearing although here and there small gaps of darkness showed through treyon shuddered as he remembered the attack of the forest again the only opening was a small break on the opposite wall of trees past the fire in the middle of the room and the cloaked form crouched in front of it treyon gasped in surprise for his bandittrained senses hadnt noticed the figure until just a few seconds ago sitting upright he tensed to bolt for the small exit a few steps and a dive and he would be free finally awake i see the indistinct shape said in a clear gentle voice still facing away from him if you wish to leave by all means there is no one here to stop you of course there is no one here who wishes you harm either treyon flattened himself against the tree wall his eyes still upon the figure who had appeared seemingly out of nowhere the bandit part of his mind was still screaming that this was a trap the being continued apparently unmindful of treyons fear of course id rather you stayed a bit and dined with me it has been far too long since a stranger found his way to my doorstep such as it is and it would be a shame to waste most of this stew at the mention of food the rich stew smell floated into treyons nose again reminding him how painfully hungry he was it had been so long if ever since he had eaten a meal that was more than scraps and leavings from the brigands the part of his mind that was still wary of a trap was quickly being overpowered by the demands of his stomach but treyon thought ifwhatever it ishad wanted to it could have done anything to me while i slept i should have woken up bound or held somehow hells even if this is a trap it ii be worth it for a full stomach summoning up the scraps of manners he knew gained mainly from watching the bandits beg and scrape to kenoran treyon got up from the bed of grass and stood can i have some food then the figure turned toward him pushing back its hood and treyon saw a man his face unlined yet somehow looking very old framed by a mane of fine silver hair the ageless face smiled gently and the man extended an already full wooden bowl of course child snatching it away treyon hunched over the bowl protectively and tried to scoop out a handful only to yelp in pain as he burned his fingers the man winced as treyon blew on his injured hand and held out a spoonshaped piece of wood not carved but looking like it had been naturally formed try this gingerly treyon took the spoon scooped up some of the stew and blew on it for a few seconds then popped it into his mouth chewing fast he sucked in air to further cool the hot food all the while his arm was curled protectively around the comfortably warm bowl the stranger said nothing just watched him eat and refilled his bowl when it was held out after treyon had finished his third helping he belched and asked for something to drink receiving another bowl already filled with clear spring water his stomach full and ready to face whatever was asked of him knowing it would be easier to take if he was prepared treyon squared his shoulders and looked at the man what do you want the man looked up from stacking the bowls in a corner the question clear from the expression on his face treyon continued for the food and shelter work or anything else you want its all right im used to it just tell me the mans head lowered again his shoulders shaking silently treyon thought he might have been laughing but when he raised his head again the tears on his cheeks gleamed in the firelight by the gods boy youre only twelve or thirteen at the most what has been done to you taking a deep breath he wiped his face i dont ask anything of you other than your company seeing the look on treyons face he added hastily just talk thats all oh the word turned into a yawn as his comfortably full stomach and the warmth of the fire made treyon sleepy why dont you rest some more and we can talk in the morning the man said quietly treyon found himself growing sleepy just listening but he wasnt convinced of his safety quite yet what about the trees he mumbled as his eyelids drooped nothing will harm you not while youre with me the man replied turning back to the fire feeling he had nothing to lose anyway and now wanting to sleep more than he ever had in his life treyon crawled over to the grass mats and was soon curled up breathing rhythmically in slumber the stranger stood stretched and walked to the wall near the small opening he looked back to ensure that the boy was sleeping soundly satisfied he walked straight through the trees his body encountering no resistance from the wood once outside he looked up through a break in the trees at a small patch of night sky over thirty years in the forest now and im still finding boys in trouble treyon awoke to dappled sunlight streaming in through the small gaps in the trees he blinked several times unsure if he was awake or still dreaming when no coarse shouts or heavy kicks jerked him out of bed he relaxed a bit remembering where he was breathing deeply treyon felt the bite of the crisp morning air on his face the rest of his body however was comfortably warm mostly because of the gray woolen cloak covering him throwing it aside treyon got up and stretched trying to get moving before the cold could soak into his bones he walked toward the opening to the small treeshelter and crawled out freezing in place as soon as he was outside directly in front of him the white horse was grazing contentedly even though treyon thought he hadnt made a sound the horse raised its head and looked at him caught in its gaze as he had been the day before treyon felt like the animal was reading his mind he didnt move a muscle content to hold its eyes with his own steady stare he felt proud that he wasnt compelled to look away in fear or submission it was almost as if the horse were evaluating him and apparently liking what it saw the horse looked beyond him for a moment then neighed wheeled around and cantered off through the woods again only this time with no bandits in pursuit a noise behind him made treyon whirl in a defensive crouch before he could stop himself the silverhaired man held his hand up in a calm gesture good morning straightening treyon mentally cursed his reflexes hello the man gestured toward the horses retreating back what do you think of her treyon turned to look at the horse again shes beautiful yours not exactly were very good friends though id give anything to ride something like that well i dont know youd have to ask her her names yfandes treyon looked up at the man who had come up beside him and was now watching him without a trace of humor on his face as if talking to horses was something he did every day not knowing quite how to respond treyon kept silent there was a notquiteawkward silence for a few seconds until the man spoke again are you hungry im afraid all i can offer is more of the same as last night if you dont mind the memory of the savory vegetable stew brought a smile to treyons face fine if you have enough always the man started to go inside then paused im sorry ive fed and sheltered you and i dont even know your name treyon paused before heading back into the shelter its treyon the man nodded and you can call me van treyons head snapped up as in vanyel demonsbane the man smiled as if he heard that question a lot the name is similar but the heraldmage vanyel has been dead for over thirty years he died around here as a matter of fact you know of him van grinned bits and pieces ive heard here and there after all i havent lived my whole life here come inside and ill tell you more over a hot meal treyon hurriedly scooted through the break in the trees van started to follow but stopped for a moment as a familiar voice carried clearly in his mind dont embellish too much while telling your bits and pieces now fandes im shocked you would even accuse me doing something like that if he wanted embellishment he should talk to stefen but i do think he should get his information straight from the legends mouth dont you as long as i get to correct you on parts you may be a bit fuzzy on deal van smiled deal except i wish i had his gift with children hes much better with them than i am well dear if wishes were companions then everybody would have one youll just have to make do yes yes but i have the feeling that this boy is a harbinger of something evil to come you sensed him didnt you of course why do you think i went after him all right all right van grinned again pardon me for trying to figure out your mind van could almost see yfandes smile over five decades together and youre still learning dear are you going in that boy needs to talk right away keep watch for anything unusual particularly from the north this may take a while understood and that was how vanyel earned the name shadowstalker van leaned back against the wood of the shelter watching treyon finish the last of his meal boy it sure must have been exciting treyon said after he had swallowed the last mouthful riding all over valdemar protecting those who needed help battling evil wherever it appeared a wry grin appeared on vans face i dont know i doubt it was all adventure and romance i mean youre from around here right treyon nodded so you know how cold it gets at night how hard the winters are im sure vanyel spent many days cold hungry and tired while he was protecting those who needed him yeah but he was the most powerful magician of all he leveled armies battled hundreds of demons at once cut through mountains like they were soft butter he could do anything why would he be cold and tired when he didnt have to be funny thats what his companion said more than once yfandes mindspoke along with a gentle laugh shaking his head at both of them van continued treyon it wasnt and still isnt that easy often times vanyel was probably battling other mages with power as strong or even stronger than his sure he could have used magic to keep himself warm and fed but that would have been just like sending a signal to the other mages telling them where he was like a torch on a dark night oh you seem to know a lot about magic the statement was meant as just that but van inferred something more behind it as did yfandes who commented the boys quick well before i settled down here i picked up some training in it but times changed and i ended up here where ive been ever since oh treyon stared into the fire for a time then said quietly its too bad vanyel isnt still around but thats just wishful thinking i guess i mean why would a legend concern himself with one person since treyon was still looking at the fire he didnt notice van stiffen at his tone or the pained expression on his face as he replied well treyon im sure if vanyel was still alive he would still be helping those who needed him at those words treyon looked at the older man sharply seizing the moment van continued treyon why were you in the forest after a long silence i was running away from whom bandits i was sold to them a long time ago i dont even know who my mother and father are under vans level gaze treyon felt compelled to tell him as much as he could so you didnt want to be a bandit no of course not running and hiding all the time never sure where your next meal is coming from always in fear of your life treyon paused as a thought struck him maybe vanyel and i had more in common than i thought the boy is quick van thought as treyon continued but i didnt see any way out of it i mean i dont know anything other than banditing sure i could go to a city but what would i do there but end up stealing to eat again so i thought banditing was what i was gonna do forever till kenoran came along kenoran yeah shes a wicked woman ifn i ever saw one knows lots bout magic too she took over the group by killing trold whod been the leader she appeared one night said she was leading us now i mean i was still with them then trold got up and started walking toward her talking bout how no woman was taking over his band she just looked at him and he started bleedin everywhere his eyes nose ears and mouth he ran into the woods n we never saw him again shes led ever since and now most of the men actually respect her not just because she could kill anyone who opposed her but she actually made life a bit better for us we even ate pretty regularly after she took over did she make you leave yeah but she didnt kick me out or nothing when she first saw me it was like she was looking into my head she always gave me the creeps well one night i had a dream and in it i was tied to this big rock and kenoran was standing over me with this sharpened stick with strange marks carved on it she was leaning over me and saying something bringing the stick closer to my head and then i woke up i dont know how to explain it but i knew that if i stayed there any longer what i saw was gonna happen to me so that night i headed for the border hoping to get to a town or city somewhere just as i got out of the mountains they caught up with me i ran for the woods and here i am treyon said omitting the part about the trees did you catch all that dear vanyel asked yes van sounds like a textbook bloodmagic sacrifice to me just as treyons dream sounds like foresight but whats puzzling is why she would take him so soon i mean treyon has the potential for two maybe three gifts but he hasnt even been trained in them yet what could she want with this boy when an ordinary peasant would power the bloodmagic just as well yfandes replied there must be a reason perhaps shes found a way to tap into the magical energy of anothers mind and use that as her own as well as the life forces it would be a powerful augmentation vanyel thought worriedly hmm thats very possible but what you said about augmentation gives me an idea what if shes found a way to take untrained gifts into herself and use them as if they were her own which could only be accomplished by the sacrifice of the victim ensuring the magic is released for her to absorb at the moment of death yfandes i think youve got it vanyel was careful to keep his face calm as the conversation continued well i guess well know soon enough we didnt get all of the bandits one of the group that was chasing me managed to get away and im sure is warning his leader by now why didnt you tell me this before vanyel asked a hint of anger coloring his thoughts vanyel dear weve had bandits crawling around the borders of these woods for so long another group just didnt seem very important however once this came to light fandes trailed off of course fandes im sorry well that means shell probably be on her way here good to be perfectly honest fighting the same bandits all the time gets rather boring it sounds as though you miss the old days vanyel thought for a few seconds before answering i dont know sometimes it just doesnt feel like we do enough for valdemar here i mean i dont regret my choice but after the battle of the ice wall there hasnt been much of anything from the north even in the past few years yfandes sent an image of herself snorting in amusement dont think i would try anything even years after word of what happened got back anyway if were right and this kenoran can do what we think then shes a threat that must be dealt with vanyel a magebattle could destroy a large part of the forest while bandits may be boring they also dont have the power to level acres of trees it could get out of hand if youre not careful true very true well well just have to contain her as much as possible most likely shes more educated about the legends of the forest and will be more loath to come in here vanyel replied well see you had better warn treyon about this hes not going to like it no doubt by the way beloved im sorry for referring to you as a horse in front of him but it seems easier than trying to explain what we really are yfandes smiled in his head understood and accepted hes waiting i think the mindspoken conversation had only taken a few seconds so treyon hadnt even guessed at what was going on van looked at him again smiled then began speaking calmly treyon kenoran is going to come after you here apparently one of the bandits got away and has most likely warned her by now if she gates in she could be on the edge of the forest already no no shell kill me please youve got to hide me help me get away from her treyon was frantic with fear looking around as if they were already surrounded by her men realizing he had said too much too fast vanyel tried a different approach treyon im going to help you shes not going to take you back i promise but now fear had taken hold of treyon completely and he stared at vanyel wildly you youre just one man shes got a dozen with her shes skinned them alive for failing her or burned them to ashes ive seen it happen what can one man do against that and a horse dont forget the statement was so ridiculous that it broke through treyons fear and made him look at vanyel as if he wasnt sure which one of them was crazier vanyel broke the silence she wont take you treyon i swear it the words hung in the air vanyels silver eyes meeting treyons brown ones with the promise between them finally he slowly sank to the ground and nodded i believe you i dont even know why but i do all right you should know why she wants you so badly first you have potential for gifts in you me treyons incredulous snort interrupted vanyel who nodded everyone has it buried deep inside their minds but not everyone has the ability to bring the power to the surface and use it your powers as i said before lie in the area called gifts which are more or less mindpowers contacting people with your thoughts bringing objects to you just by thinking about them moving and so on kenoran wants those untapped abilities wei think to use for herself and thats why we have to stop her because if she does that to me she could do it to others when this is done this boys havenbound yfandes thought nodding to both statements vanyel said exactly i think the safest thing to do will be to keep you here while i go find kenoran he trailed off seeing treyon shake his head i dont want to be left alone if shes anywhere nearby treyon i can protect you much better if youre in the middle of the forest what if she does this gate thing into the forest and grabs me while youre someplace else huh vanyel started to reply then stopped aware that he couldnt answer the question in a way that would satisfy the boy or himself now that treyon had exposed the flaw in his plan as long as he had gift potential she could eventually find him and a mage would have ways around the forests defenses most probably starting by burning the place to a cinder yfandes mindsent sighing in defeat vanyel turned his attention back to the conversation all right youre coming with me but you must do exactly what i say yfandes and i should be able to shield you magically but if she has those brigands or constructs looking for you its vital that you stay hidden exactly where i place you understand treyon thought for a moment nodded then asked constructs whatre those cruel mockeries of life created by magicians and fueled by magic they can be given limited powers by their creators but are still dangerous vanyel fell silent as he remembered one of the few he had ever seen the ravenbeast that had killed his aunt savil decades ago the form of that particular monster was still clear in his mind as if he had seen it yesterday his thoughts were interrupted by treyon i think kenoran has one oh have you seen it treyon shrugged trying to put what he knew into words im not sure sometimes when shes talking to the men at night i catch a glimpse of something behind her in the shadows mansized or a little shorter it never comes into the light and she never refers to it but somethings there all right a sudden thought occurred to treyon while they were on the subject van what if shes got things huntin in the woods right now vanyel shook his head dont worry there arent if there were theyd have been dealt with long before they got here my guess is that she wants to be here to recover you personally since the bandits couldnt finish the job no doubt she probably also wants to investigate the forest to see if there is anything here she can use for herself mansized eh this one must have a fair amount of power to keep something that big alive yfandes thought worriedly yes i know vanyel thought back distractedly but youre going to stop her right treyon asked a familiar light in his eyes vanyel smiled yes i promise the sun was just below midpoint among a scattering of clouds when vanyel yfandes and treyon reached the northern edge of the forest from their vantage point in the treeline they could see up and down the border of the forest as expected there was a contingent of men waiting about a hundred paces away most were dressed much like treyon in ragged shirts and vests tattered and patched breeches and wearing shapeless wellworn boots rough sandals or nothing on their feet at all the force of men was split into two groups about half a dozen on each side of the central figure who had to be kenoran she stood at least a handspan over most of her men more in some cases less in others unlike the bandits she was dressed well against the cold fall afternoon in dark gray robes and a dazzling white fur cloak complete with the clawstudded paws of whatever animal the pelt had come from holding the cloak in place on her shoulders her skin matched the tone of the fur stark white with redirised eyes like ruby chips glittering in a snowdrift she was standing near a cairn of stones piled long ago by someone who had buried another while traveling in or out of valdemar as he looked at the scene before him vanyel hoped he wouldnt have to make another smaller pile before the day was out a cheldaran he heard yfandes muse didnt think they came down this far vanyel squinted trying to examine her more closely ive never seen anything like that before what do you know of them just that you should be wary beloved she may be more formidable than you think vanyel focused his magesight on the tall woman for a minute than replied actually i dont think shes formidable i know she is look for yourself yfandes silently stepped up beside him and stared for a second her blue eyes widening in disbelief does she have what i think she does vanyel nodded shes found a way to tap the magegift as well shes connected to a node out there he tried not to think of what else she could have waiting and addressed yfandes again do you know anything else just rumors thats all supposedly one of the many barbarian groups to the far north but its said that of outland magicians these whiteskins are more closely attuned to their powers than most thanks for the confidence builder vanyel groaned in his mind as if she could hear their conversation the pale woman called out spirit of the forest hear me one of my own has become lost in your woods i know of you and what you are return him to me and the forest will be left unharmed hide him from me and i will find him no matter what it takes i will not wait long upon your answer for i know you are nearby her gaze swept the line of trees pausing for a moment as her eyes passed over the three figures in the treeline invisible to all save her a humorless smile creased her mouth then disappeared as she crossed her arms and waited vanyel contacted yfandes im going out van you cant what about treyon someone has go out and give her what she wants or shell make her threat real youre going to have to stay here and watch over him fandes youre my backup if that construct is out here youll have to guard treyon while i deal with her well what if something gets by both of us then well just have to play it by ear i guess this could take a while shes stored up a lot of power both in bloodmagic and from the node worried no just angry at all that destruction vanyel be careful always turning from them vanyel started to step around a tree but was stopped by a hand on his arm where are you going treyon whispered to face her alone are you crazy youre one against more than a dozen no this will be between me and her stay here with yfandes what do you want me to do if something bad happens van looked at him i dont suppose you can ride treyon shook his head vanyel thought for a moment than continued if something does go wrong i want you to run into the forest as fast and as far as you can yfandes will stay with you as long as possible but you should be safe enough until i can find you afterwards just keep moving and no matter what happens ill make sure kenoran cant come after you all right treyon nodded looking past him at kenoran and her brigands van i dont see the construct anywhere van nodded pleased the boy was still able to think clearly even when so obviously frightened i dont either but i dont sense him anywhere as well either shes not using it for this or its shielded so well i cant sense it either way trust yfandes to protect you for she will with her life if necessary treyon nodded silently as the silence of the forest was cut by the sorceresss voice spirit i grow weary of waiting for you return him or i will begin the search and i will leave no rock unmoved no tree living where i look vanyel winked at treyon then stepped around a large oak and disappeared treyon looked for him walking through the forest but in vain a gentle touch on his cheek from yfandes warm nose brought his attention back to the plains and the bandits before him suddenly there he was standing just outside the forests boundary the sunlight making his silver hair flash and glitter all was quiet save the two magicians so their conversation easily carried to treyon and yfandes i am here vanyel said the northern sorceress iceblue eyes narrowed for a moment then she smiled again you are not a simple forest spirit there is much power within you but i am sure neither of us wishes for conflict so i will be blunt you have what i want forestwalker give him to me and i will leave in peace deny me and be destroyed both treyon and yfandes watched silently hanging on every word vanyel was impassive if i give my life in defense of another so be it what you want from this forest you shall not have for he is under my protection then once you and this forest fall he shall have no protection with that kenoran swept her arms outward and a wall of magefire appeared not anywhere near vanyel but for dozens of paces on either side of the two mages driven against the wind into the forest the bluegreen flames began to grow rapidly as they licked at the trees and underbrush surprised by the unorthodox attack vanyel hesitated a bit before beginning his defense quickly he weathermagicked the nearby clouds to grow making them suck up the water vapor in the atmosphere swelling into gray thunderheads that covered the sky with a flick of his hand the water poured down drowning the flames in the forest fully on guard now vanyel went on the offensive calling all of the power at his command and sending it at the woman before him as soon as treyon saw the flames appear at the forests edge his bandits intuition knew that a trap had been laid and they had walked right into it a whinny of alarm turned his head toward yfandes just in time to see a dark blurry shape all claws and teeth leap out of the surrounding woods at him vanyel van until he heard the mindcry and shriek of terror simultaneously vanyel had actually been enjoying the battle kenoran was extremely strong but it was the strength of bloodmagic easily gained and stored but not so easily replenished once used eventually if he and yfandes had read her right the magegift she had siphoned from some unfortunate soul would eventually be exhausted and he could make her forget all about using bloodmagic forever that had been the plan but kenoran had seen fit to change the rules boosting his shields enough to hold off kenorans next assault vanyel turned at both cries one of alarm one of pure terror and saw something explode out of the forest in a spray of leaves and branches it would have been as tall as a man save for its hunched back it moved as fast as a wyrsa but on two legs and appeared to be a mix of human bear and wolf with ursine features and thick graybrown fur what was most frightening was what it carried in its mouth treyon the collar of his shirt tangled in the beasts teeth was being borne toward the battle with magicfueled speed behind the beast but at a safe distance galloped yfandes vanyel thought he had never seen her look so frustrated vanyel shes going to get him she sent angrily cant you stop it from reaching her vanyel asked no came the feartinged reply cant even get close to it shes laid a trapshield on the construct and now treyons inside so its around him as well trapshield in that instant vanyel realized just how ruthless kenoran really was remembering that if any magical or physical attack was directed at the construct the shields would react instantly destroying whatever they surrounded by lethal backlash great good gods maybe i can fetch no vanyel any gift will set it off even mindmagic yfandes sent hells that thing moves fast come to me then she may have the ability to steal these powers now lets see if she knows how to use them in the time the two had mindspoken this much the construct had already reached kenoran and had been admitted inside her shields vanyel bit his lip in frustration and he saw kenoran take the boy as she snapped a guttural word at the construct causing it to sit back on its haunches its hooded eyes becoming glassy with his magesight vanyel saw the sorceress shields flare even brighter now as she added the power the construct had been using to her own protections by this time yfandes had swung away from her pursuit and ran over to vanyel coming around to stand behind him vanyel put one hand on her mane as he watched the barbarian get ready to give me power on my signal he sent to her hope you know what youre doing now that she has him its the only way i just need a little more time kenoran slammed treyon down on the cairn knocking the wind out of him and effectively preventing any struggle holding him down with one hand she reached underneath her cloak with the other and brought out a daggersized wooden wand covered in rough runes and glowing brightly with power ripping open treyons shirt she touched the focus to treyons chest outlining his heart the wand leaving a glowing trail wherever it touched the boys skin looking up vanyel once again saw her feral smile as she said spirit you have defied me and for that you will be destroyed once i have taken this ones gifts i will take everything else you hold dear kenoran hold vanyel threw out his hand as if offering it to an unseen person recognizing the gesture kenoran looked down at treyon who was still lying motionless beneath her her head snapped up to look at the silverhaired mage before her at that moment she felt her shields actually buckle as the impact of vanyels magic hit them for a moment everything stopped as the two mages gazes met vanyel smiled as he saw the sorceress eyes widen as she realized what was about to happen kenoran recovered quickly however raising the wand about her head she screamed the final word of the spell out as she plunged the stake down at treyons unprotected chest the wand ripped through the empty air where treyons body had been a moment before to shatter on the rocks of the cairn now uncontrollably released the magic contained by the wand surged back though kettorans body held in by her shields it redoubled in intensity arcing and snapping as it contacted the restraining magic walls kenoran didnt even have tune to scream in seconds the wild energies had destroyed everything in the area of the sorceress shields as her protections vanished all that remained was a circle of burned ground and two small piles of ash and bone vanyel watched unblinking cradling treyon to his chest burying the boys head in his chest to prevent him from watching when it was over vanyel just held him while glaring at the brigands who had watched the fight at a safe distance under his stare they quickly broke and left for the hills and silence once again fell over the forest of sorrows and the small plain vanyel i cant breathe treyon gasped from his shirt standing up vanyel slowly let go of treyon watching all around him as if waiting for kenoran to suddenly appear from the grave and wreak more havoc when nothing happened his shoulders slumped as he relaxed slowly fading into translucence seeing this happen treyon quickly stepped over to vanyel meaning to hug him but when he tried to wrap his arms around the others slim body he met nothing but air off balance treyon just managed to avoid falling over before vanyel could speak treyon waved an arm through the middle of vans body watching it pass through the misty form as if there was nothing there at all treyon was hesitant to say it but he did anyway what happened i thought you defeated her his eyes overflowed with tears again as he thought he realized what had happened vanyel realizing what treyon was thinking was quick to correct him no no treyon thats not what happened using so much power so quickly can drain even a legend for a time seeing treyons expression as comprehension dawned he added yes i am the vanyel of the legends and songs i have been like this he pointed a hand toward his insubstantial body for decades i have been a part of this forest for over thirty years guarding the northern border against bandits and mages like kenoran in a way i am the forest around me every tree every plant every gust of wind that moves through the brush i feel it react to it as far as i can see and to things that enter the forest kenoran couldnt kill me or yfandes not without destroying every last bit of the woods around us and that i think is next to impossible but she almost got you and that was something i never wanted to happen i had no plans to put you hi danger you deserve better than that why why just because of who you are what im just a boy that doesnt make me anything special well then how about what you can give back to valdemar as what a brigand vanyel how can i help valdemar treyon was growing more and more exasperated as a herald came the soft reply what a herald me treyons mouth was gaping like a fish for the first time since the battle had ended vanyel smiled dont you remember me telling you about your gifts you need training to use them effectively and as you happen to be about the right age to begin you should get started right away theres a way station about a halfdays journey from here usually a herald passes by every few days on patrol for the outlying villages and he can take you to haven training haven gifts but i dont know anything about anything how can i be a herald whos going to believe that i can be anything but a brigand vanyel let his hand drop to treyons shoulder and for several seconds the boy actually felt the older mans hand steadying him i do treyon you cant stay here not with us he said cutting off treyons startled protest you need to be around others to learn all that yfandes and i dont have time to teach you besides haven is the place where youre needed not here thats all well and good but what about my needing someone treyon said sniffing back his tears and looking away at the ground vanyel knelt down beside him catching the boys downcast stare with his own gaze im not going anywhere granted haven is far away but if your gifts manifest like i think they will pretty soon youll be able to mindspeak with me as if i were standing beside you and by that time maybe youll have been chosen by a companion of your own treyon was silent for several seconds then raised his head again feeling truly hopeful for the first time since he had entered the forest i guess wed better get going then lets not rush off quite so quickly youll stay with us another night and well set off in the morning vanyel said smiling treyon smiled in return and the trio walked into the forest leaving the charred patch of dirt and the new leaves of grass that were already sprouting behind vkandis own by ben ohlander ben ohlander was born in rapid city south dakota and has since lived in eight states and three foreign countries he graduated from high school in after spending a period of time in military school for various infractions he enlisted in the

forstchen for baen books as well as several short stories he is currently developing several independent projects authors note this story takes place after the events chronicled inarrows falland before stormwarning colonel tregaron commander of his holiness twentyfirst foot was hot tired and very pleased as he surveyed the long line of marching infantry the regiment had made good time in spite of a sun hot enough to boil a mans brain inside his skull thick clouds of choking dust that rose with every step and short water rations it pleased him that he had yet to lose a single trooper to the heat even after nine days crossing the badlands and another twenty trekking from the karserethwellan border most caravans fat with water and rich food couldnt make that claim he shook his head grimly amused that his holiness would transfer regiments in high summer when beastly was the gentlest adjective useful in describing the heat still when the son of the sun called the army marched an infantryman seeing him grin hawked and spat you like eatin dust colonel tregaron raised his hand one soldier to another it cant be any worse than your hummas borlai im surprised your squadmates havent strung you up as a poisoner the troopers around the luckless soldier laughed as he mimed taking an arrow in the chest im struck borlai cried tregaron made a mental note to eat with first battle that evening the better to ensure no lasting insult came from his ribbing morale had remained high in spite of the miserable conditions and he had no desire to see even a small wound fester for want of tending he glanced over each rank as it passed looking for the small signs and minute sloppiness that marked declining morale or increasing fatigue some pikes sloped a little more loosely than the prescribed thirtydegree angle and an occasional head drooped but that was to be expected considering each soldier carried in addition to a full fiftypound kit three days extra field rations water extra throwing spears and either a mattock pick or shovel to dig fortifications it was no wonder karsite soldiers called themselves turtles for they all carried their houses on their backs several veterans seeing tregaron raised their fists in salute as they passed a weak cheer rose from the ranks as he doffed his plumed helmet and returned the gesture aye lads he said save your wind for the walk weve a bit to go before you can laze about that drew a laugh there was trouble on the hardorn border bad trouble and even the rawest recruit had heard the rumors of massacred caravans and slaughtered villages he knew sure as night followed day that there would be hard fighting along the frontier before the fall rains swelled the terilee river and blocked passage vkandis willing he thought well make the terilee by nightfall and be dug in before the bastards know were there he unrolled the grimy travel map he used to plot their daily course its scale was too small for any real detail now that they were close to their destination but the scouts had provided good reports of what lay ahead he ran one dirty finger across his short pointed beard as he studied the map the terilee river hardly more than a stream this time of year marked the border between beloved karse and ancars hardorn it had seen its waters colored red more than once in the past year as the usurpers bandits raided across its brackish waters bodies from those fights were said to have floated as far as haven in distant valdemar his staff walking alongside the regiment joined him as he rerolled the small map and bent to pick a stone out of his sandal cogern the twentyfirsts master of pikes and responsible for the order of the regiment stopped beside him tregaron saw backs stiffen and pikes straighten they might respect him but they feared cogern it was well they did the sergeant had a truly horrible visage the pikemaster had been lucky his helmets gorget and bar nasal had deflected the rethwellans blow or hed have received more than a maiming and a harelip tregaron then a green lieutenant had fully expected the master to feed the sacrificial fires he remembered his quiet amazement when the old soldier had not only recovered hed returned to duty he shook his head that fight had been almost twenty years ago he would never see the south side of forty again cogern had fifteen years on him yet the older man did his daily twenty miles hit the pells and led the charges with more energy than men half his age tregaron had no doubt that twenty years after he was wormfood cogern would still be offering tithes to vkandis sunlord and defeating karses enemies the commander and the pikemaster stood silently together a long moment while the staff waited patiently their horses led by cadets shifted and fidgeted in the hot dry air they look good tregaron ventured cogern spat and grinned theyd better he lisped if they know whats good for em he took off his helmet and ran his hand over his scarred head runnels of sweat trapped by the helms padding ran down his face cutting tracks in the caked dust drops fell from his chin to stain his rich scarlet sash what idiot moves a regiment across the northlands in summer he asked scornfully tregaron smiled when the son of the sun says march he started cogern snapped his fingers bugger the son of the sun he snorted the fat bastards lapping up chilled wine and making doe eyes at the acolytes while we grunt along out here tregaron laughed at the aptness of the blasphemy youd best lose that notion before a priest hears you bugger them too cogern repeated but softly and with a quick look around how are the recruits holding up tregaron asked moving the conversation back onto safe ground cogern rubbed his forehead this strolls melted the city fat offaem faster than drill and pells he paused weighing his words their weapons drill aint upta par but it aint bad either not for pressed troops anyway tregaron didnt envy the recruits who filled out the twentyfirsts ranks theyd used their victory parade through sunhame to volunteer some of the capitals less wary citizens into vkandis sunlords service many of the newest lambs had lost their stunned expressions and had settled into the regiments training routine which for them included fighting drills and weapons practice after marching a full day and after building the nights camp and surrounding fortifications two lambs had keeled over dead so far and cogern had reported theyd probably lose another before they got to the border the pressgangs were supposed to only draft hale men and a few women but were also given quotas and limited time occasionally they cut corners placing the burden on the trainer the training process usually weeded out the hopeless cases before the fracas started it pained him to lose troops for any reason but having them die due to sloppy recruiting rankled him one cadet holding the horses mumbled to another they laughed together tregaron stared at him a moment before he remembered the lads name the boy dormion was the son of a southlands freeholder sent to the army to avoid the tithe and very possibly the flames eh cogern snapped what was that urn i said said the lad visibly unhappy to have drawn the pikemasters undivided attention that they dont uhh have pressgangs in valdemar he paused uncertainly sir he concluded lamely after the silence lengthened cogern feigned a look of utter surprise how would you know anything about valdemar he stared at dormion with the horrified intensity of a man watching a large and potentially deadly insect crawling up his arm the other cadets sidled away leaving dormion gulp ing and pale alone i read it pikemaster in the chronicles in valdemar cogern said drawing out each syllable sarcastically they dont have to fight that gives them certain luxuries we cant afford he looked disgusted a reading cadet what will they think of next the old sergeant glared at the boy with an expression fierce enough to cow the bravest veteran this aint valdemar boy and youd best get that through your head now get back in your place dormion pleased to have escaped with little more than a tongue lashing scuttled away to rejoin the other cadets im surprised you let him off so easily tregaron said softly usually you just cuff them flat cogern scratched his nose with one ragged nail most of em are fish not real bright and just waitin for hooks in their mouths and knives in their guts oncet a while you get one who sees beneath things thems worth keepin an eye on he sighed i just wisht i could keep him out of the damned books hes got too much to learn in too little time for that folderol he met tregarons eye i saw the same thing in another lad some years back even took a sword for im just to give im a chancet grow up tregaron embarrassed took the worn rope reins from the cadet and led the gelding toward the standards that followed the lead battle the regiments flags marked both the commanders location in the formation and the relics that were the units pride the lacquered ivory boxes contained the femur of the regiments first commander a lock of hair from torlois the prophet and a finger bone from vkorion who before he had become son of the sun three centuries before had struck off his own hand as a tithe for vkandis each relic box also contained a certificate of authenticity signed by a senior priest tregaron suspected one pedigree was more the result of bribery than accuracy vkorion would have to have had at least a dozen fingers on the severed hand alone to accommodate all of the verified relic bones pride stirred in his chest when he saw the regiments stained and tattered banner the standard a gold sun bursting on a scarlet background with the number in blue thread stitched across the center was flanked by the smaller gold scarlet and blue guidons of the regiments three battles a fifth bearer carried the pole to which the tokens and names of the twentyfirsts thirtyodd victories had been affixed behind that by itself came the oriflamme the clothofgold standard that was the mark of his holiness favor the regiment had paid hi blood for the right to carry the flamme but it was a distinction that tregaron would just as soon have forgone beneath vkandis stainless banner clustered three flinteyed sunpriests the oriflammes guardians when it went into the field and the source of tregarons worries two were from the capital sent as much to counter hardorns magic as they were to protect the flag from dishonor they wore full priestly regalia their golden suninglory medallions glinting against their black court robes the third was a woman a fact itself of some note in vkandis patriarchal priesthood she wore the simple red cassock that marked her a common parishtender even though she was alleged to be at least as powerful a mage as the blackrobes tregaron knew little about heronly that she had been a provincial prefect drafted when the third member of the capitals troika had died of apoplexy darker campfire rumors suggested he had died while demonsummoning a common enough practice among the blackrobes even if tregaron didnt believe the story the blackrobe priests had warded the northern borders with summoned creatures until ancars magi had driven them back the tension between the woman and the blackrobes from sunhame was thick enough to slice and serve on flatbread he knew the church hierarchy was rife with factional strife but seeing it made him nervous all three were above his authority and he had no doubt that each had the clout to forward a report that if bad could cost him his regiment if not his life his worst nightmare was that if the woman reported well of him the others might speak poorly to spite her or vice versa in either case there would be a black mark against him with his holiness and no amount of military skill or booty would erase the stain he hoped they would judge him only by how he did his duty but he couldnt be certain their acrimony wouldnt affect their judgment where he was concerned he nodded to the three the woman pleasantly returned his greeting making a small gesture of blessing he found her handsome though with a mannishly square jaw and sharp features her eyes though not as soft as liked were warm and friendly and her generous mouth seemed more given to smiles than frowns the blackrobes by contrast looked stonily forward their expressions set in harsh disapproval tregaron kept his face expressionless in small things could big things be judged the provincial had been arguing with her counterparts again great he thought dryly and i thought the army would keep me out of politics fool he felt like the man in the proverb who when caught between fire and flood ran back and forth unable to decide whether to bum or drown i still dont see how all of this skulking and sneaking benefits karse the woman said waspishly continuing what tregaron was certain was a longrunning argument ancars troops raid us at will and we do nothing the fighting twentyfirst isnt nothing lady tregaron thought even though generally he agreed with her hardorn had been testing them and their response so far had been tepid it seemed a bit inconsistent that a raid from rethwellan merited a sixmonth campaign by a dozen regiments while hardorn earnedone footsore command the older blackrobe made a rude face his holiness predicted peace solaris he said to her as though addressing a small child so peace there shall be you know as well as i that lastern couldnt scry for a sunny day much less ancars intent solaris replied her voice dripping scorn its a meaningless augury and a meaningless peace ancars eventually going to conclude were too timid to fightand then youll have a full scale war try to hide that under a proclamation you go too far havern hissed continue your blasphemy and ill have you before an ecumenical court tregaron overhearing more of the exchange than he wanted blanched she had spoken treason and his life might very well stand forfeit for it she could have him killed to cover her lapse or havern might order him executed to snuff the chance hed repeat what hed heard fire and flood indeed he thought grimly flaying and the rack is nearer the mark cogern turned away mumbling something about adjusting the trumpeters tregaron followed but wasnt quite quick enough to miss solaris quiet laugh im sorry havern she said her voice quiet in what might charitably be called contrition had her voice not dripped scorn i overstepped myself her speech changed becoming singsong as she recited the liturgy of the word and will of vkandis his holiness is his holiness anointed by the hand of vkandis and is the son of the sun and his avatar on earth tregaron guessed her retreat to the liturgy had more to do with survival than religion still the very effusiveness of her recitation argued that even in this she was poking fun havern appeared unconvinced he peered at her a long moment as though trying to see inside her soul you country priests have had it too much your own way for too long i see that certain ah distortions and baseless rumors have taken root in the provinces come to my tent this evening and i will instruct you in the methods by which you might return to orthodoxy solaris shook her head ruefully im sorry havern ive already promised to minister to the third battle this night i gave my word to the colonel tregaron wasnt happy she had brought up his name especially as she had promised to do no such thing he sighed to himself no matter how hard he tried to remain neutral it seemed they were determined to draw him into their feud havern shrugged well he said easily as if the matter were of no importance id like to be reassured of your orthodoxy before i make my report to his holiness perhaps we can work something out tregaron backed away trying to put distance between himself and the three priests vkandis servants were under no obligation of celibacy but hearing what amounted to extortion embarrassed him solaris flushed two spots of color forming high on her cheeks she opened her mouth to speak when a distant shout and pounding hooves drew their attention tregaron relieved at the distraction trotted toward the regiments standards the mounted scout galloped down the line and reined in his horse with such savagery that stones and grit sprayed from beneath its hooves and flecks of foam flew from its lathered sides report tregaron snapped pleased to turn his attention to a problem he could handle cavalry soir the scout replied his upcountry accent emphasized by his stress two full regiments soir lessn half an hour north of here an movin toward us tregaron took a single deep breath calming himself and giving him a moment to order his thoughts do they know were here the scout looked chagrined aye more likely than not we tripped over three o their outriders while we was on our way back we got two the third gave us the slip tregaron sucked air though his teeth a southlands expression of disapproval well he said whats done is done he ignored the excited chatter as word of the approaching enemy made its way along infantry column his staff clustered close eager to hear the report did you see who they were one regiment had a boars head mounted on a pole soir with ribbons hanging from its tushes i dint see the second that would be reglaufs lot cogern said he led a regiment under ancar when they made their try against valdemar word has it he didnt do much except plunder farms it didnt occur to tregaron to question cogern the sergeant was supposed to know such things word also has it the old man lisped that he cut out early before theyd properly lost how many troops tregaron asked the scout the man pulled a string out of his tunic and counted the knots five battles soir about three hundred riders each id guess about the same in the tother regiment three thousand cavalry cogern spat twotoone or thereabouts just like selenay in valdemar dormion chirped earning a black look from cogern from the battle of border in the chronicles ancar had them twotoone as well and they whipped him cogern sighed the air of man beset by fools the brat doesnt know when to shut up tregaron thought cogern growled something obscene and crooked his finger at dormion come here child its high time i took a personal interest in your education dormion swallowed heavily his mobile features still um pikemaster he began he looked at tregaron you tickled the bear ensign tregaron laughed now you dance with him selenay cogern said with heavy dignity as he ticked off points on his fingers had the advantages of mindspeaking demon horses superior terrain time to pick her battlefield bettertrained troops and ancar for an opponent not to mention her troops were defending their homes and were backed by a substantial number of defectors including hardorns best guardsmen he paused to switch hands having long since run out of fingers ancar only had numbers he needed at least three to one to beat her on open ground and probably six to one to best them on that turf he had maybe three to two and most of them were rabble not real soldiers atall hell only about half his force even had the gumption to attack he closed his fist an stuck it in dormions face ancar he finished didnt have a prayer so dont draw false comparisons especially ones gleaned from books written by the winning side he exhaled heavily here endeth the sermon now get back to your units all of you the cadets scattered tregaron looked at cogern do you think he heard you damn that bardwritten tripe the pikemaster replied selenay could have held that hilltop with a company of recruits and a detachment of washerwomen demon horses magic and good writing dont make up for sound tactics and superior strategy i dont know tregaron said selenays done all right for herself by all accounts not you too cogern snapped his expression torn between shock and betrayal he crossed his arms across his chest muttering about tyros who read more books than was good for them tregaron laughing mounted his horse and scanned the field for a good place to make his stand theres a shallow stream up ahead soir the scout said pointing he had wisely kept his mouth shut while cogern ranted its about fivehundred paces from here do you want to form behind the water course cogern asked his voice and manner now all business tregaron considered a moment before answering no i dont want to give them any excuse to go toward our flanks a nice long feature like that might encourage them to get creative youre expecting them to come right for us cogern asked in a neutral voice yes tregaron answered when ancar assassinated his father he put alessanders generals to the sword as well he lost anybody he had with troophandling skills and the rabble he recruits arent much for the discipline that goes with good tactics he smiled sourly not that theyve needed it theyve been riding right over the local militia for a while now im betting its been a while since theyve faced regulars theyll go straight for our throats he straightened his shoulders well put the stream hard by our right and use it to anchor our flank on that side well assume an open field defense and meet them in that high grass over there he pointed to the open area beside the streambed all right cogern said turning to the cluster of runners and trumpeters what are you waiting for the staff members scattered to execute the orders horns blared under officers shouted as the lead battle company by company shifted their pikes and picked up a clumsy trot the regiments company of mounted skirmishers thundered past their riders adjusting bows quivers and heavy sacks they disappeared in a trice over a low brow to contest the hardornans passage tregaron knew a hundred archers werent enough to stop the invaders by themselves but he hoped theyd be enough of an irritant to make reglauf deploy his forces prematurely the vanguard had just drawn even with the streamlet when a single horn blew in the distance tregaron followed the sound and saw a thin dust plume rising above the bluffs that would be our guests cogern said his flat voice calm tregaron studied the thin brown column infantry dust tended to spread as it rose making a groundhugging haze rather than a rising tail yes definitely cavalry he turned in his saddle to address the trumpeters play form line of battleleft the horns skirled trumpeters farther down the line answered the calls acknowledging the orders front northwest cogern shouted his bass voice cutting the din in such moments all hint of his lisp vanished debouch by companies the battles officers and sergeants amplified the commands as the regiment dropped its packs and began to smoothly deploy into the serge alongside the dusty road tregaron heard the crack of a whip and snapped his head around to see one sergeant coiling his badge of office back into his hand he rode over as the man raised it for another how you are a fine sergeant gren tregaron said through clenched teeth but you are no longer in the seventeenth if you raise that starter to another one of my lambs without good cause ill have you flogged back to your old regiment is that clear the sergeant his face pale nodded silently tregaron jerked his horses head around and rode to take his position with the standards by then positioned on the leftcenter of the line the battles guidons had long since returned to their units frontrankers aligned the regiment into four neat rows using pikestaves as guideposts the pikemen in the first two ranks took their intervals setting their shields between them to provide cover if the cavalry stormed them with arrows the rear ranks composed of swords men each equipped with two heavy javelins marked off their running distances and prepared their gear the javelins were cunning weapons the swordsmen wrapped lanyards around the middles which when held between the casters fingers when throwing imparted a spin on the spear spinning spears flew farther and more accurately than straightthrown though no one knew why the javelins heads were attached to the shafts with weak glue or brittle pins when the weapon hit the glue usually failed or the pin broke making the thing useless for a return throw the regiments longbow company moved quickly out in front ready to act as skirmishers and contest the ground in front of the regiment with long range fire two scouts galloped across the field plunging whitewashed stakes into the ground at hundredpace intervals to mark the boyers ranges the farthest scout turned and using his last stick as a goad pounded back toward the readied regiment cogern cantered up beside him as for tactics sir he asked butterfly wings tregaron nodded if they let us have luhann double her leftmost companies if they try to turn our flank her sidell be the most likely place theyll try cogern passed the instruction to a runner most battlefield situations were too complex for trumpets runners gave more precise messages but were slow and often got lost or were lost cogern smiled the easy grin of man with a secret tregaron rarely saw the pikemaster as happy as he was before a fight vkandis knew his guts always knotted up beforehand your horse sir cogern said tregaron dipped his head and dismounted mounted officers made easy targets they gave their animals to an orderly to take behind the line wheres the damned oriflamme tregaron snapped it should be here here colonel solaris said stepping through the ranks to join them tregaron saw she wore no mail and carried no weapon where are your cohorts he said a little more harshly than hed intended but only a little she made a wry face theyve decided to support your fight from back there she pointed toward the area behind the regiment where the horses gear and a few noncombatants waited thatll do em no good atall if n they get behind us cogern said he looked at solaris do you have a weapon she held up the oriflamme i have this cogern looked closely at her a long moment then what are you waitin on girl he pointed to the stainless banner show em what were fightin for she grinned and hefted the pole raising the flamme high above their heads she waved it about swirling its swallowtail in a gentle arc the center battle cheered the shouting built as each battle fought to outdo the others the skirmishers reappearance quieted the noise the horsemen paused at the hill crest to fire one final volley at their pursuers then fled across the open ground they opened the sacks tied to their saddles and tossed handful after handful of small black objects into the grass behind them what are those solaris asked lowering the flamme and grounding the haft caltrops cogern said with malicious glee four sharpened pieces of iron welded together no matter how they fall one prong always points upa little dainty for a horses hoof the first mass of hardornan cavalry crested the hill a black tide that quickly covered the facing slope tregaron heard the thin voice of the archers commander take your aimfour hundred paces loose a thin iron sleet rose and fell some arrows struck home here and there felling a horse or rider the range was a bit long for accurate fire but tregaron hoped the harassment would goad the hardornans into leaving the mass reacted by spurring their horses and charging theyve got no order at all cogern sniffed sounding offended tregaron knew he hated inefficiency even when displayed by an enemy three hundred paces the archer leader yelled timing his fire so the riders would cross the stake just as the arrows arrived loose the toll grew heavier as arrows found their marks or pierced armor horses pulled up and fell screaming and thrashing as the cruel iron caltrops pierced their hooves most riders scrambled to their feet but here and there one lay still either knocked witless or themselves victims of the spikes hidden in the grass two hundred more riders fell the karaite horse archers added to their toll with their shorterranged bows as they moved to the flanks to cover the ends of the formation here and there a karsite fell arrowstruck but the hardornens volleys were erratic and largely ineffective the cavalrys thunder grew louder as they galloped down onto the waiting karsite line one hundred cogern turned cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed set to receive cavalry with a wordless shout six hundred pikes came down in a single glittering arc their bitter edges bright in the noonday sun the rear ranks gave way a pace ready to hurl their javelins on command the archers scampered for the rear cogern grabbed the regimental standard and raised it over his head at the instant he dropped it the battles commanders dropped their swords and six hundred javelins smashed into the onrushing horses the cavalry slowed their charge blunted by the heavy spears a second volley crashed home an instant later cutting down the lead ranks like a scythe through wheat the rear ranks piled over the dead and dying and pressed home the attack the crash of the horsemen hitting the readied pikes roared over tregaron like a tide of sound a breaking wave of ironshod hooves and slashing cursing soldiers his world retreated to a circle five yards across a hardornen her horse gutted by a pikeblade bowled over the front ranks and plowed into the command party one orderly slashed the animal across the knees bringing it down and throwing the rider two officers plunged their blades into her before she could rise the second twisting his weapon to gore her before withdrawing it she collapsed dead blood fountaining from her mouth and nose the lead hardornen was dead but the gap shed forced in the line filled quickly with other horsemen slashing and stabbing as they tried to widen the breach horns blew in alarm on either side of the command party as squads detached from the flanking units to help seal the break in the line tregaron looking for more troops to throw at the hardornens whipped his head around and saw solaris using the oriflammes staff to fend off one horseman while cogern moved to his flank the pikemaster stabbed deep driving his sword deep into the horses barrel dropping it in its tracks he then brained the rider with his sword pommel and ran him through with a quick thrust as he tried to rise karaite swordsmen flooded the area surrounding the horse troops and attacking from all sides their grim intensity and lacquered redandblack armor made tregaron think of ants swarming a moth distant horn calls announced the arrival of the second regiment he craned his head toward the sound and saw it advancing over the hill crest in slightly better order than the first the newcomers made a token effort to dress ranks then charged across the caltroplittered ground a few fell to the hidden spikes but the charge went home almost unblunted pikemen fell lanced through or scattered like ninepins as the horsetroops plowed into the center of the twenty firsts line swords slashed and stabbed the din drew louder and the center units beset by the fresh hardorn regiment sagged under the pressure trumpets blew frantically as under officers fought to hold the line the battle hung in the balance a race between whether the pikemen could reknit their formations or the hardornens could split the regiment and roll it up cogern took half the remaining swordsmen in the command party and went to shore the line where the fighting was thickest solaris followed keeping the oriflamme aloft the soldiers seeing the woman and the banner both now stained with blood fought harder the pressure intensified the battle growing more desperate as units lost cohesion the thick coppery smell of blood mixed with the stink of loosened bowels and horsedung threatened to overwhelm tregaron as did the clouds of dust as thick as smoke that obscured much of the field twice the pressure on the command party built and once tregaron himself had to swing his sword against the enemy more horncalls sounded from the right calling for assistance tregaron looked around frantically the entire right half of the line was engulfed and all reserves on that side were already committed he had to launch a counter something to take the pressure off the beleaguered center and right before it cracked under the hardornens hammerblows thisll have to work he said to himself as he summoned his remaining trumpeters most were dead killed defending the relics he pointed to two go to captain luhann tell her to prepare to attack en echelon shes to commence when shes ready dont wait for a signal were counting on her to take em in the flank and grind em into powder repeat the runner cleared his throat attack en echelon when ready dont wait for signal tregaron checked the message with the other runner then sent them to the left he repeated the same message with two more and dispatched them to the right though he doubted that wing of the regiment could comply he fretted in the minutes that followed afraid his order had come too late or that the hardornens would break the line he peered anxiously to where he could see the oriflamme still bravely waving he worried about what was going on there even as a battle or two of horsetroops made another try for the regiments banner more blood and more dead followed in a sharp little fight the hardornens finally broke driven from the standards by a volley of arrows fired from across his line of sight the dust cleared and he saw the archers on the extreme left complete the echelon movement that gave them a clear shot along the regiments long axis each pike company stepped off in turn marching forward a few paces then wheeling to the right in the distance luhann made it look like a parade ground maneuver he distantly heard her voice through the din using a leather megaphone to yell orders to her troops her voice didnt have cogerns carrying power but she compensated well he considered luhann his best triumph the army the fighting arm of a very male god was as thinly populated by women as the priestly ranks he remembered the laughter of his counterparts when hed accepted her as a cadet the crisp precision of her troops was all the proof hed ever need that he hadnt been daft in appointing her to command a runner panted up to him pikemaster cogern sends is respects sir and asks if youre ready to close the wings yet he says hes hanging on by is teeth tregaron gathered his thoughts a moment before answering my compliments to the pikemaster tell him the left has already started hes to lure them deeper if he can the runner repeated the message and scampered away tregaron had little to do but fret victory and defeat looked a lot alike in those moments while the center remained vulnerable and the flank attack developed his smaller force was strung out around threequarters of the compass while a numerically superior enemy held the center his regiment could be easily shattered and there was not a damned thing he could do about it he sent several squads he couldnt afford to give up to back cogern who had began a slow retreat in the center the hardornens pressed forward sensing victory just when he thought the battle could get no louder he heard a crash and clatter on the far right the sounds of fighting there intensified a slight breeze stirred moving the thick dust but not clearing it had the hardornens broken through was all lost distant trumpets sounded the trumpeter beside tregaron closed his eyes listening intently to the distant signal first battle reports attacking en echelon left wheel sir tregaron tried not to whoop with glee more trumpets blew this time on the left luhanns entire battle pikes in hand and its blood up finished pivoting on its right heel paused aligned its ranks and charged they crashed into the disordered hardornens crushing one side of the mass and working a fearful slaughter as the cavalry tried to flee the horse archers briefly visible though the murk rushed to seal the trap covering the opening between the two wings like a lid on a pot the bulk of two regiments were trapped tregaron knew his own forces were spread much too thin to hold the enemy inside so it was time to kill as many as they could before the hardornens broke free sound general advance he yelled at the remaining trumpeter the boy nodded blatted into his horn a few times then sent the final command in pure ringing notes the troops on either side of tregaron advanced carrying with them their standards and cheering they smashed the weakening resistance killing horses and riders with equal abandon a portion of the rear regiment cut through the thin screen of horse archers and burst out of the trap the hardornens scattered like windblown leaves as each rider fled to preserve life and health a hot gust of wind swept the dust away giving tregaron a glimpse of the carnage the entire field before him was littered with dead and dying horses and soldiers piled three deep in some places hardornens cried for succor in a dozen languages he saw as he walked forward across the torn and bloody field that the leading regiment had gotten trapped between cogerns and luhanns units badly weakened by the javelins robbed of its momentum and best fighters it was caught in the jaws of an implacable foe he looked at the trumpeter play no mercy the boy looked grim but complied ancar took no prisoners in karse and showed no mercy now the favor was returned luhann gave the final command and reglaufs regiment vanished under a wall of pikes later tregaron walked among the troops laid out in groaning screaming rows where the regiments hedgewizards labored to save as many as they could he adjusted his turban his one concession to the heat while his helmet hung from his belt many of the soldiers busy tidying the battlefield or finishing the wounded hadornens had also removed their helms even cogern who normally would have blistered the troops for such a lapse kept his silence he also tregaron noted wryly kept his helmet he glanced back at the wounded the regiment had suffered three hundred casualties a twentypercent loss it was a light butchers bill considering the desperate nature of the fight but still far too heavy tregaron took each dead and wounded soldier as a personal failure his losing karses most precious resource the hardornens had lost much worse than he at least five times his numbers killed one regiment destroyed and another scattered still hardorn recruited the scum of five countries and such losses were easily made good he bent to help one man who begged for water taking his own canteen and holding it to the mans lips tregaron held the mans head while he sipped he caught a whiff of punctured bowel this soldier would never recover his end would be agonizing as his own waste poisoned his body cavity do you wish mercy tregaron asked his voice gentle the soldier perhaps only then realizing what he faced sobbed once and nodded hagan the dying man whispered send hagan third battle fifth company hell do it tregaron stood and summoned an orderly who sprinted to fetch the mans friend havern waited at the end of the row he seemed positively cheerful as he looked around at the long rows of gored and wounded soldiers can i help you tregaron asked realizing as he looked at the man just how bone tired he felt well have the fires ready within the hour colonel the blackrobe said must it happen now tregaron replied the word and will calls for a victory sacrifice as soon as the battle is won colonel you know that i know that the battle tithe plays merry hell with morale sir tregaron said wearily he held up his hand you may have the mercied men for your fires but only after their friends have released them from their pain haverns face fell falling into the mask of disapproval he wore when debating solaris what the priests do in rethwellan is one thing colonel but here we follow the word and will literally those men too wounded to travel or otherwise unlikely to survive will go to the flames alive vkandis takes no pleasure in cold flesh i never understood why vkandis took pleasure in any flesh solaris said pleasantly havern rounded on her your deviance from the word and will has been repeatedly noted after im through with you solaris youll be lucky to preside over an outhouse much less an abbey tregaron recalling her rallying the regiment with the oriflamme felt his temper heat the sunpriestess held her place and inspired the regiment what did you do havern didnt bat an eye we got out of the way we were the wrong tool for the job you were the right one we deferred to you on the matter of how best to conduct the fight now he said maliciously you will defer to us on how to conduct the fires the army was given its dispensation to sacrifice those who would die anyway rather than the hale i will accept no compromise on that point solaris quietly slipped away and knelt by the gutstabbed man who still begged for water she uncorked tregarons water bottle and gave him several small sips tregaron listened to the sunpriests tirade about duty and responsibility while trying vainly to hold onto the scraps of his selfpossession solaris stood and walked to the next soldier who bled her life away from a gaping thigh wound it wasnt until the gutted man sat up and felt his middle that tregaron realized something bizarre had happened something far more important than the blackrobes prating he turned his back and walked away from havern as solaris stood and went to the third man the woman who moments ago had been unconscious moaned weakly and sat up tregaron caught a glimpse of solaris eyes as she knelt and placed her bloodcovered hands on the mans exposed skull her gaze was far away locked on a distant horizon and she whispered to herself as she healed each time she knelt her pupils shone with a golden glow and her hands were suffused in a warmth that looked like fire but brought health not hurt soon a dozen of the regiment followed her whispering in hushed tones at the miracles as she healed each of the dying the story spread like wildfire through the regiment by the time she finished a thousand men and women were crowded around her eager to see the prodigy they stood silently giving her space to work as she knitted flesh healed bones and restored health after what seemed like an eternity she stood from beside the last the silent regiment gave way opening before her to let her by a few braver or more foolhardy than the rest reached out tentative hands to touch her cassock as she passed tregaron trailed by the stunned and silent blackrobes followed her as she took shaky steps toward the more lightly wounded she placed her hands on a mans slashed and splinted arm nothing happened its gone she said in a confused voice its gone now its all right mum said the trooper who looked old enough to be her father i saw what you done for the others ill heal all right by mself she turned back toward the regiment tregaron saw the glow had faded from her eyes her selfpossession seemed to return and she looked at havern now you have none for your fires she said in a weary voice the dispensation protects the rest tregaron overcome by the miracles and the restoration of those he thought he would see consumed drew his battered sword and knelt before her the regiment following his cue knelt as well command us lady he said we are yours no sir she replied with a soft sweet smile her expression seemed transformed as though she were in ecstasy you are not mine you are vkandis if he has chosen to work through me it is through the worthiness of the cause not of the vessel havern cleared his throat ahmmm he began i know we all think we saw something he trailed off as a thousand hostile faces focused on him um yes he concluded and retreated please rise sir solaris said her expression still beatific i am not the son of the sun not yet anyway tregaron thought as he rose not yet a heralds honor by mickey zucker reichert mickey zucker reichert is a pediatrician whose twelve science fiction and fantasy novels includethe legend of nightfall the unknown soldierandthe renshal trilogyher most recent release from daw books isprince of demonsthe second inthe renshai chroniclestrilogy her short fiction has appeared in numerous anthologies her claims to fame shehasperformed brain surgery and her parentsreally arerocket scientists rain pattered to the roof of the way station rhythmic beneath the lowpitched howl of the winds herald judaia stared into the hearth watching twists of flame flicker through their collage of yellow and red though her eyes followed the fire her mind traced every movement of her mentor herald martin already he had curried his companion tirithran till the sheen of the stallions white coat rivaled the moon his sword and dagger held edges a razor might envy and he had soaped his tack until judaia feared he might wear the leather thin as sandal bindings the image made her smile through a longing that had sharpened to pain she imagined him struggling to buckle a back cinch the width of a finger and mistaking tirithrans bridle for a boot lace judaia turned for an instant her dark eyes met martins graygreen ones and she thought she saw the same desire in him that goaded her as burning and relentless as the hearth fire he glanced away so quickly his black hah whipped into a mane and every muscle seemed to tense in sequence movement only enhanced his beauty and the sight held judaia momentarily spellbound her mind emptied of every thought but him the rigors of her internship faded insignificant beneath the more solid and cruel pain of martins coldness unable to resist judaia glided toward him loving and hating the feelings his presence inspired apparently sensing her movement martin tensed suddenly he took several quick strides toward the door im going to check on tirithran and brayth he fumbled with the latch uncharacteristically clumsy the door swung open magnifying the drumlike beat of rain on the way stations roof beneath an overhanging umbrella of leaves tirithran and brayth enjoyed the pleasures of stallion and mare their grunts punctuating the sounds of wind and rain caught between judaia and an even more obvious passion martin froze in the doorway judaia brushed back a strand of her shoulderlength hair wishing it looked less stringy and unruly its sandy color seemed outofplace framing dark eyes nearly black still though not classically beautiful judaia did not believe herself homely either she had kept her body wellhoned even before the rigors of herald training her features though plain bore no deformities or scars other men had found her attractive enough yet other men had not mattered to judaia since she had met martin at the collegium three years past they had begun their training together yearmates yet martin had passed into full herald status and gone out on circuit a year before her now she learned from him and maybe if he could turn his eyes and mind from preparations for an instant she might teach him something as well martin remained still and silent for some time seemingly oblivious to the rain that slanted through the open door frame and left damp circles on his herald whites judaia studied martin in the moonlight trickling between clouds and over the threshold the first half of their circuit had passed with routine ease yet the martin she had seen direct tribunals chastise embezzlers and calmly settle disputes seemed to have disappeared replaced by an awkward child scarcely into his teens the transformation seemed nonsensical she had never heard of a chaste herald she had lost her virginity even before brayth had spirited her from westmark to begin her training a handsome child of local nobility martin surely had had his share of women and judaia had heard lyssa one of the seneschals granddaughters bragging about martins prowess in bed why then has he spent the past five months finding every excuse in the sector to avoid me this night judaia decided she would find her answer one way or another ah judaia said her soft words shattering a longheld silence i didnt know staring at lovemaking companions could turn a man to stone martin startled suddenly and obviously aware of his lapse he closed the door with clear reluctance and turned to face judaia rain plastered black hair in ringlets to his forehead and water dribbled along the crest of one eyelid martin looked so atypically undignified judaia could not suppress a laugh i considered us lucky to get in before the rain i should have known martin would find another way to get himself soaked finally martin smiled he flicked away the trickling raindrop and raked dripping locks from his forehead he headed for the fire his wet whites brushing judaias dry ones as he passed leaving a damp darker line that the warmth would quickly dry he sat in front of the capering flames judaia took a seat beside him martin fumbled dagger and whetstone from his pocket sharpening the blade for the twelfth time since its last use are you tired no you not yet martin admitted the conversation seemed to have come to an end and he abruptly steered it in another direction among strangers or while riding companions they always chatted with an easy fluency that seemed to mock the choppy nervousness that characterized their more private moments youre doing well so far he scratched stone over blade oh yes judaia said not bothering to hide her sarcasm ive gotten pretty good at riding around watching you work im probably the heraldic expert at observing martin martin glanced at the stone and steel in his hands as if noticing them for the first time im sorry i guess i havent been giving you much responsibility and you are ready for it again stone whisked over metal with a scraping hiss that set judaias teeth on edge next time you get to check the tax records judaia had learned to care for her gear too and she put the appropriate amount of time and effort into the task martins tending had become clearly excessive tax records tax records be hanged hellfires martin i want to make a judgment by myself no interference from you a judgment martin considered whetstone scouring steel a dozen strokes before he spoke again all right then the next judgments yours and yours alone id better warn you though were getting toward the borderlands and those people have a different idea of justice and a womans place i can handle it though excited judaia could not keep annoyance from her voice martins long closeness had fanned her desire from a spark to a bonfire there could no longer be any doubt about the source of that need lifebonded no question yet martin seemed as oblivious to the ultimate sanction as he was to her readiness for a more active role in their sector patrol another long silence followed interrupted only by the ceaseless gallop of the rain and the slash of stone against steel judaia could avoid the need no longer she clasped a hand to martins arm to halt the sharpening staring directly at him martin stiffened then ceased his work his eyes darted from floor to dagger to fire finally he met her gaze ah of the emotion judaia had suppressed came welling up at once she did not waste words on caution or euphemism pent up frustration burst forth at once and she no longer cared if she hurt or offended him whats wrong with you what martin parted damp strands of hair from his eyes startlement at her outburst quickly faded to apology look im sorry i guess ive been overprotecting you but it is your first patrol and judaia interrupted thats not what im talking about and you know it what are you talking about im talking about you so free and confident out there judaia gestured vaguely northward toward haven and the towns and cities they had policed then every time were alone together youre currying tirithran bald or youre cutting enough wood to fill six way stations summer to summer she released his arm so suddenly the whetstone tumbled from his fingers now martin echoed judaias anger well excuse me for being thorough thorough judaia leaped to her feet thorough if you get any more thorough youre going to whittle that dagger to a toothpick youre not just being thorough youre avoiding me martin sheathed his dagger and put away the whetstone yes he admitted a blatant confession was the last thing judaia expected to hear and it completely arrested her train of thought what martin rose again meeting judaias eyes candor clear in his greengray stare for a moment his shielding slipped and she caught a glimpse of deep struggle honor against need then he hurriedly rebuilt his defenses yes i am avoiding you why surprise dispersed judaias anger leaving only confusion in its wake i feel i mean we both know words failed her and she discovered an awkwardness as petrifying as martins had seemed that were lifebonded yes i know judaia could do nothing but stare jaw sagging gradually open without her will or knowledge at length she managed speech you know then why are you avoiding me because i made a vow to lyssa that she would be my one and only that i would never sleep with another woman judaia did not know which shocked her more her own disappointment the tie to lyssa or the promise like none she had ever heard before are you lifebonded with her too no then why would you make such a promise martin shrugged she wanted me to and i did lifebonds are uncommon enough i never expected to form one judaia saw the hole in martins logic at once lyssa she knew had slept with many others as recently as the night before martin left to patrol the sector did she make a similar vow to you yes judaia considered a tactful way to inform martin of lyssas deceit and found none though she hated herself for the cruelty she might inflict she chose a direct approach instead he deserved to know the truth im sorry martin lyssa hasnt kept her vow martin took the news too easily for it to have been a surprise lyssa is not a herald judaia stared not believing what she was hearing more than anything in the world she wanted martin and she knew now that he felt as strongly for her yet the pledge that shackled him had become onesided and the integrity of a herald his undoing as well as her own but its not right she shouted the agony of the thwarted lifebond writhing within her its not fair martins eyes went moist the greengray smeared to a colorless blur fair is not the issue once again he looked away and this time judaia applauded his decision to dodge her stare a heralds vows he said softly take precedence over desire honor always over right suddenly judaia felt very tired stormy night passed to crystalline day free of humidity rainbows scored patches of sky and pooled along spiders webs but their beauty did little to raise judaias mood she rode at martins side in silence overtended buckles and bridle bells reflected silver fragments of sunlight clean whites and curried companions shed the brightness until it seemed to enclose them like a divine glow birds flapped and twittered from the forests lining either edge of the roadway feasting on insects drawn by the warm wetness following a gale martin whistled a complicated tune written by his bardic brother he seemed to have forgotten the events of the previous evening returning to his usual brisk confidence and grace under pressure the normality of his routine only amplified judaias pain the lifebond already a noose now felt like a noose on fire brayth sensed the heralds pain mindspeaking with a tone pitched to soothe whats troubling you little sister judaia sighed loath to inflict her sorrow on another yet glad for a friendly ear its martin what about martin he seems happy enough judaia patted the companions silky neck thats exactly the problem how can he be so oblivious when im so miserable cant he feel the same pain the same thwarted need in explanation judaia opened her shields fully to brayth showing the mare the conversation in the way station and the mass of conflicting emotions it had inspired at least in judaia the lifebond is as strong in him as you he feels it too but his honor is stronger even than the bond frustration made judaia sullen and her next words came from superficial anger lady take his damnable honor i hate it do you truly hate his honor or the situation to which that honor has fettered him uncertain of the question judaia gave no reply but she did feel guilty for her lapse companions chose only those pure of intent and devotion to duty came with the first heraldic lesson brayth continued questioning do you love martin because of his honor or in spite of it if he had made a similar vow to you would you expect him to keep it the last judaia felt qualified to answer well of course but id never ask for such a vow or if i did i would keep my vow as well blind loyalty to one who deceives is simply slavery honor it may be but an honor without justice brayth shook her head her frothy mane like silk on judaias fingers tell that to martin already have ah brayth glanced back at her rider a light dancing in her soft sapphire eyes next time sister two legs youll have to convince him as the companions words settled into judaias mind the approaching pound of hoofbeats drew her from deeper consideration she glanced at martin and the intensity of his focus on the road ahead cued her that he had heard as well he signaled tirithran to a halt and brayth stopped at the stallions side the broken pattern of the oncoming hoof falls and lack of bridle bells told her without the need for vision that the horse and rider were not companion and herald a moment later a stranger appeared from around a curve in the roadway he rode a stocky border pony its dark hooves drumming hardpacked roadway and its chestnut tail streaming the thin man on its back wore a welltailored cloak and tunic of plain design as he drew closer crows feet and a shock of graying hair showed his age and his carriage revealed high breeding the pony slowed to a walk as he came within hailing distance thank the goddess ive found you greetings good heralds judaia nodded and deferred to her mentor anyone seeking would certainly have found them they traveled the main roads their circuit so far had remained tame and routine and they had lost no days arriving in each town village and city at the expected time what can we do for you martin asked apparently sensing the mans distress judaia exercised her gift though weak compared with those of her yearmates concentrating on the mans abstraction she saw a birthing room filled with clean straw pallets she found four women in the picture one clutched an infant tightly to her breast gaze focused so intently she seemed not to notice that two others argued vehemently clothes torn and arms waving another baby wailed apparently frightened by the noise though both combatants took clear and obvious caution not to harm the child the fourth woman lay still on the straw clearly injured and two more infants sprawled limply near a corner stung to action by what she saw judaia sent the image to martin bypassing the need for the strangers slower verbal description martin had a strong communication gift which made the sending easy though he had little sight to locate the knowledge for himself still though she formed an image judaias gift brought picture without sound the need for haste drove her to request the important details first ordinarily she would let martin handle the situation but he had promised her the next judgment though he could not have guessed the urgency that would accompany their next decision martin would not go back on his word now judaia cherished the honor she had cursed moments before the stranger had already begun his story all giving birth on the same day judaia interrupted delving for the necessary the womens fight its over what the man broke off into a startled silence then apparently attributing her understanding to heraldic magic he addressed the question the argument is over who gave birth to one of the babies herald martin drew breath but judaia overran him doesnt the midwife know she apparently got hurt in the struggle herald shes unconscious but alive we have people tending her but she might need a healer im afraid this cant wait until shes well anger rose in judaia against the bitterness that motherhood could inspire every bit as strong as the bond of love so many lauded between woman and child horror touched her then along with a possibility she did not have to know now but she asked for the sake of her own conscience did the babies get caught in the battle as well no herald the stranger seemed as horrified by the prospect two stillborn judaia had heard enough well meet you there she signaled brayth and the mare launched into a gallop toward the border holding from which the stranger had come not bothering to compete with the wind martin mindspoke with judaia as they rode you took that over nicely judaia sensed a touch of displeasure though she could not feel certain he hid it well behind a sense of pride at her budding competence this ones my judgment remember now martins discomfort came through more clearly are you sure you want this one something less serious might do for a start brayth flashed around the curve in a stride and a half neck stretched and head low for the straightaway are you breaking a promise never martin recoiled from the possibilty tirithran matching brayth stride for stride just giving you an out i dont need an out i can handle this and the midwife needs you the best i could do is carry her to a healer brayth whisked around another bend and the borderland came into sight a patchwork of large but simple homes to accommodate the men with their multiple wives and myriad children crops and pastures dotted the areas between homesteads and a small but ardent crowd surrounded a single building set off from the rest though judaias sight had shown her only the inside of the cottage she knew this had to be the birthing room with your gift you might draw the midwife back to consciousness or stabilize her enough that a healer isnt necessary i cant do that either martin saw the wisdom in judaias words or he simply bowed to his promise eyes locked on the approaching building he did not bother to reply as the companions silver hooves rang over stone and earth a few members of the crowd glanced over these nudged more until every eye eventually turned toward the heralds a mass of voices rose in question conversation or attempts to inform the whole blending into a din judaia did not bother to decipher some slunk away whispering among themselves judaia knew that many of the border holdings considered heraldic gifts unholy or the work of demons judaia and martin dismounted together leaving the companions to tend themselves beyond the crowd ignoring the huddled mass of comments judaia pushed through the citizens parting to allow a path for the heralds to get to the doorway the midwife sprawled just outside the door apparently they had taken her from the crisis but feared to move her far in her current state two men and a woman hunched over her these moved gratefully aside as the heralds came forward head wound one said unnecessarily can you help her martin replied if i cant i can get her to help quickly he gestured tirithran vaguely then inclined his head to indicate that judaia should take care of the problem inside judaia reached for the portal apprehension finally descending upon her as she tripped the latch in the heat of defending her need to judge she had found no time for selfdoubt now finally on her own consideration of her weaknesses came unbidden she had only the experience of watching martin when it came to justice her gift of sight would help her little here it would take a communication gift to delve into the complications of situation and intention unlike martin judaia could cast only the first half of the truth spell she could tell when a subject lied but could not force honesty the way he and the more strongly gifted could she would have to rely only on the first stage and on her own instincts and the price for a mistake might prove the breaking of family and the severing of a bond between mother and child too quickly the door swung open again judaia saw two women arguing heatedly their screams drowning one anothers words so that the herald could understand only a few broken phrases the one nearest the door looked robust her brown hair neatly combed despite the turmoil of childbirth the other had curly locks hacked short a hint of russet amid the darker strands a naked baby boy curled asleep in the straw clearly the object of their dispute it pleased judaia that they had taken care not to let their blows go wild enough to squash or harm the child against the far wall a third female more girl than woman cradled another infant the two stillborn lay hi a corner near the door stop judaia said though she did not shout the authority in her voice silenced the women she seized on the hush my name is herald judaia and i was sent to settle this dispute the boy is mine the curlyhaired one shouted liar the other lunged toward her fist cocked to strike judaia snatched the descending wrist in midair wrenching the woman around to face her rule one no fighting she hurled the arm away and the woman staggered several steps all three fixed their gazes on judaia the wouldbe attacker glaring rule two no one speaks unless questioned by me you may call me herald politeness has never displeased me judaia studied the women guessing she would get the most unbiased story from the satisfied observer you there she faced the quiet woman against the wall me maam the youngster shook back mousy looks keeping a firm grip on the baby that supported its head she rose whats your name lindra maam thirdwife of salaman she avoided judaias eyes keeping her gaze low at the level of the heralds mouth is this your first baby judaia hoped lindra would answer in the affirmative she seemed no older than fifteen and judaia hated to think the holderkin stressed their women any younger first live baby yes maam apparently lindra finally absorbed judaias words for she corrected i mean yes herald i lost two others early and you gave birth to the baby youre holding oh yes maam herald im certain of it the other two women fidgeted obviously fighting the need to hold their tongues lindras response bothered judaia the mention of certainty suggested exactly the opposite a simple yes seemed far more natural so judaia prodded for details what do you remember now lindra met judaias gaze directly when it came to defending her child she could clearly gather the gumption and fire she otherwise lacked i carried twins herald the first came out easy but he was dead she gestured the bodies in the corner tears turning her muddy eyes moist she had to push around for the other the stress of the first and the pain she winced i fainted i didnt actually see her take out my little girl but i know shes mine herald a mother can tell she hugged the child closer the nearby fight stole all veracity from the latter statement but judaia let the observation lie she saw no need to use the truth spell here she had more obvious subjects for it the curlyhaired woman had picked up the baby boy clutching it with all the fierce tenderness that lindra showed the girl the other woman balled her fists obedient to judaias rules though she clearly wanted to reclaim the child by violence judaia placed a hand both comforting and warning on the womans empty arms i speak for the queen now my decision here no matter its end will stand who holds the baby while we speak will have no bearing on the judgment judaias words seemed to soothe the angered woman her fingers uncurled and her manner softened still the took she turned her curlyhaired neighbor held venom though she released her grip judaia kept her attention on the emptyarmed hold woman speak your name i am keefhar firstwife of kailer while the woman spoke judaia closed her eyes focusing on the verse she would need to run through nine times she pictured a fog with blue eyes shaping the truth spell with a bent toward muting it gradually a blue fog took shape about keefhars head and shoulders as all subjects of the spell she remained oblivious to it lindra seemed too fixated on the baby girl to notice the third women squinted rubbing her eyes as if to blame the magical vapor on her own vision surely none of them would have seen such a thing before nor known its purpose keefhar judaia watched the blue fog closely she had kept it sparse which would make its comings and goings more difficult to evaluate she relied upon her sight to gauge the status of her spell which baby did you bear the boy herald keefhar rolled her gaze to the infant nestled in the others arms the blue haze dispersed indicating a lie the stillborn was hers she jabbed a finger at the curlyhaired woman the fog returned as bright as at its casting about this at least she had spoken truth she lies the woman indicated screamed judaia dropped the truth spell swiftly placing another on her only remaining witness as weak as her power was the double casting would cost her a nasty overuse headache but she pressed aside consideration of consequences she could tolerate pain as the price for a competent first judgment the boy is mine the curlyhaired woman shouted the magical fog disappearing with her words in her rage the hold woman discarded judaias rules as well as her request for manners the dead one is hers keeping one hand looped protectively around the boy she used the other to gesture disdainfully at her accuser the remnants of the truth spell did not return until after she finished speaking clearly she had spoken all falsely judaia imagined the crisp blue eyes of the fog drawing closed and the truth spell winked from existence she kept her own eyes open and alert for movement not trusting the women to remain at peace until she rendered her judgment her thoughts flew bringing understanding of the cause of the argument and why the girlchild had been spared from the tug of war the answer came with martins description those people have a different idea of justice and a womans place others had told her that the parents of girls paid dowries while a sons possessions and holdings remained his own since men married many times a son brought wealth to a family while daughters cost them dearly in wedding price the door opened and martin stepped inside the midwife will live judaia waved him silent before he could continue the three holderkin looked noticeably relieved though whether glad for the midwifes health or for escape from the punishment that would have come with a charge of murder she did not know or try to guess she reached for the baby boy and the curlyhaired woman relinquished him with obvious reluctance keefhar smiled judaia spoke in the name of the queen i make the following judgment the baby girl shall remain with lindra the women nodded all apparently satisfied martin stiffened but true to his word he said nothing judaia continued as to the baby boy all eyes followed judaias every movement he was born to lindra and will remain with her she handed the boy too to the youngest of the mothers lindra smiled cuddling the children love making her dark eyes sparkle but i thought she started judaia did not let her finish many healthy babies are born floppy and blue with no further explanation she left the birthing room to announce her decision to the elder whose slower pony should have arrived in the time it took to hear and judge she left martin to reinforce the finality of her decision they would obey the word of a man in a way they never would a woman even a herald the ride from the borderland holding commenced in a silence far deeper than the previous one but this time martin seemed the more pensive of the two he did not hum or sing and his eyes remained fixed on the mound between tirithrans ears scarcely able to suppress a smile judaia waited for martins inevitable assessment of her work it did not come in fact neither herald passed a word until martin drew rein in a quiet clearing alongside the beaten track he dismounted there removing the bitless bridle and bells from tirithrans head judaia joined him releasing brayth as well the companions grazed on the boughs and underbrush while martin prepared a meal in the same thoughtful hush he had assumed throughout the ride finally martin broke the silence i spoke in private with the midwife judaia leaned against a thick roughbarked oak nodding encouragement for him to continue you gave only one of those babies to its rightful mother judaia nodded lindra bore the boy the girl was keefhars baby martin stared you knew of course i knew judaia met martins greengray stare that appeared even more muddled than usual familiarity made the eyes beautiful despite their indeterminate color guilt twinged through judaia for the pain his silence must have caused him in the birthing room he alone could have reversed her decision but he had promised not to interfere with her judgment and his honor had held him to that vow as strongly as to the other martin seemed incapable of blinking you intentionally gave a baby to the wrong mother are you insane maybe judaia plucked at the bark beneath her fingers studying the fragments she pulled loose if you find considering the welfare of the children insane having a womb doesnt make a good or worthy mother bloodline isnt enough no one martin no one can grow in the hands of a liar or in a home without honesty loyalty and trust as far as im concerned keefhar gave up her right to motherhood when she knowingly traded her child for another once again judaia met martins eyes and she did not blink either sometimes herald martin she grinned sometimes whats right is more important than the truth or any vow sometimes justice over honor martin considered the words for some time gradually his lips framed a smile and he pulled judaia into a friendly embrace that might become so much more and all the awkwardness at least was gone a song for no ones mourning by gary a braunbeck gary a braunbeck has sold over short stories to various mystery suspense science fiction fantasy and horror markets his latest fiction also appears infuture netandcareless whispershis first story collectionthings left behindis scheduled for hardcover release this year he has been a fulltime writer since and lives in columbus ohio sweat ran down the young mans back and his ankle hurt severelyhed leaped from the window on impulse and landed badly after the scullery maid discovered him in the masters private chamber she had simply opened the door and walked in her servants eyes taking in everythingthe bags of silver coins clutched in his hands the portrait set haphazardly on the floor the exposed secret cache in the wall the brokenlocked opened lid of the masters money boxbefore she thought to shout an alarm to the others in the manorkeep but by then the young man had tossed a chair through the stained glass window perched himself there like a raven for only a moment before hearing other loud voices and footsteps thundering toward the room then jumped though careful to bend his knees the impact was nonetheless painful it was a miracle hed to made it to his horse without losing more of the money but make it to his horse he did and ranyartas fierce and strong a horse as ever the young man knewgalloped swiftly away from the manor through the streets past the city gates where the guards and armsmen in the towers too busy with their own private harvestfest celebrations were neither able to take up their crossbows nor lower the gate in time to stop him he hoped they heard his laughter as ranyart carried him away into the darkness of the forest road that had been several candlemarks ago and now both he and ranyart were weary from the chaseand the armsmen had given chase for a while before he lost them near the westmark hills he was glad he had been alone this time claiming to be a simple minstrel who wished only to entertain with song in exchange for a warm fire and a good meal not only had his being alone enabled him to flee quickly without having to make excuses to anyone in whose company he might have been seen but had such a disaster occurred while he was with a troupe the other members would now be suffering for his actions and isnt that always the way father he thought whenever the rich find theyve been bested by one of a lower heritage they vent their wrath on others whom they deem undeserving of mercy or kindness or understanding let alone a chance to prove their innocence and forget about individual worth in the eyes of the rich we are all the same valueless fodder so much human flotsam for them to treat with as much disregard or contempt as they please i remember the way lord withen ashkevron of forst reach treated you after those damned heraldmages from haven showed him what a gifted one could do with metalworking i remember how the bastards all laughed at you and you were a good enough man to pretend you didnt hear the laughter or see the smirks but did any of the gentry any of the courtiers ever bring their trade to you again after that no gods how they killed your spirit half my life youve been dead and i miss you no less now than i did on the day mother and i had to watch the gravediggers toss your body in that foul disgraceful hole damn them damn then all the young mans name was olias a thief who secretly possessed a meager measure of both the bardic and heraldic gifts often in his travels when both money and food were running low he would insinuate himself into the good graces of various traveling minstrel troupes enchanting them with his storytelling and enviable abilities on the lute rebec and cornemuse his fiddle and pipe and taborplaying though not offensive to the untrained ear left something to be desired in his opinion inevitably the leader of the troupe would invite him to travel and perform with them which olias was more than pleased to do accompanying them from city to village to hamlet and hollow playing for lords and ladies and peasants alike since he never wished to endanger the members of the troupes who were always kind to him despite their typically desperate circumstances he took care to ensure his thievery would appear to be the act of someone with whom the victim was familiar it seemed that every merchant and nobleman possessed their fair share of enemies and it was surprisingly easy to discover who among them was the most envied or despisedas well as the names of those who harbored resentmentand thus lay the groundwork for his deception sometimes it was as simple as placing a few stolen coins outside the doorstep of his chosen scapegoat always another member of the gentry or a successful tradesman never one of the poor making it appear that they in their haste had dropped some of their illgotten treasure as they ran from the sight of their crime occasionally he would have to resort to more complex methods of duplicity in order to avert suspicion from himself or the other playersemploying his mild gift of thoughtsending to plant misgivings in others mindsbut the effect was always the same none had ever accused him or any member of his temporary troupe of the robberies for oliaslonely angry bitter and distrustfulit was a good life good enough the road he now found himself traveling was little more than a rutted tract of hardpacked dirt meandering through a skeletal tunnel of nearbarren tree branches this harvest had been an usually cold one and the trees sensing this chose to slumber earlier than many of the people in valdemar were accustomed to tendrils of mist snaked from between the trees and lay across the road like a blanket of living snow shifting curling reaching upward to ensnarl ranyarts legs for only a moment before dissolving into nothingness overhead the moonlight straggled through the branches creating diffuse columns of foggy light that to olias frayed nerves became fingers of foggy light from a giant ghostly hand that at any moment would fist together and crush him he was aware as if in deep nightmare of shadows following along from either side of the roadsilent misshapen things spiriting along with the mist for furlongs until he snapped his head toward them then they would disappear in slow degrees mocking his anxiety melting back into the darker unexplored areas of the nightsilent forest these shadows called to mind far too many campfire tales and old wives stories of the outkingdom and the pelagirs with its uncanny creatureswhich was not all that far from here unhooking his armed crossbow from its saddlecatch were some of those shadows moving even closer the young man wiped the sweat from out of his eyes then leaned forward and whispered in ranyarts ear i cant speak for you old friend but i dont much care for this stretch of road i know that youre tired but i promise you that if youll just quicken your pace and get us the hell out of here the small bag of sugar i have in my pouch is yours in answer ranyart broke from his amble into a trot then a gallop and soon they passed through a clearing to emerge on a more inviting expanse of road where the trees and mist and shadows were at a comforting distance and the moonlight shone all around crisp and cold and clean forming no phantom fingers but there was in the air a strong stench of burned wood and straw of firescorched stone and something more an odd thick sicklysweet aroma thatthough it was not so mighty as to overpower the other smells seemed to be inexorably entwined with all the others ranyart chuffed shaking his foamstreaked head i know replied the young man wrinkling his nose but were both too tired to go any farther tonight and there is a mild wind blowing against us at least that makes the stink less offensive well stop here until dawn and hope that the wind continues to blow in our favor beneath him the muscles in ranyarts back rippled as if the horse were shrugging its reluctant consent good then its settled they made camp quickly olias taking care to find a nearby stream so ranyart could quench his thirst then turning his attention to building a fire and killing a pair of squirrels for this nights meal he arranged his groundbedding under an imposing old sorrow tree thus called because its like rare in these parts was usually found in the distant forest of sorrows then lay the crossbow within easy reach before attaching his dagger sheath to his uninjured ankle as a further precaution he slipped a small stonecarvers blade beneath his sorry excuse for a pillow then removed the sugar from his pouch and gave it to ranyart almost smiling as he watched his horse devour the brilliantwhite chunks when ranyart had finished he stared at olias as if to ask is that all im afraid theres none left old friend youd think after all these years you would have learned a little moderation ranyart snorted once loudly then threw back his head as if quite insulted and stalked off to the side of the road where he settled himself for the night ill remember this when you come begging for your morning oats ranyart snorted again but this time less indignantly perhaps even with a touch of humility youll not charm me said olias ive known you far too long to the rest of it died in his throat when he heard the sound of approaching hoofbeats coming hard and fast from somewhere down the ghostly road hed left behind not half a candlemark ago the back of olias neck prickled and his heart pounded against his rib cage somehow the armsmen had found his trail hell to havens he hissed throwing aside his blanket and grabbing up his crossbow then rolling quickly to the right where a small downwardsloped patch of land created a furrow just big enough for a man to hide himself it was only after he was in position that he realized the sound was that of a single horse carrying a single rider a sound hed trained himself to recognize perhaps one of the armsmen in an attempt to prove himself to the others had stubbornly pursued him this far olias looked at the crossbow in his grip and at the deadly sharp shiny silver tip of the arrow no he wouldnt hurt this armsman not in a way that could either kill him or cripple him for life he held his breath listening to the nearfrantic hoofbeats getting closer and was wrenched from his concentration when the campfire hissed then snapped loudly spitting sparks upward a few of which danced out into the center of the road all but announcing his presence a careless fools mistake not dousing the flames no time to worry about that now pushing forward on his knees and biting down on his lower lip to fight against the screaming pain of his wounded ankle olias scrabbled on his belly like an insect up toward the campsite and grabbed the quiver slinging it over his shoulder and its strap across his chest then sent a silent call to ranyart who was at his side in moments bending low the bulk of his massive body so olias could snatch a coil of rope from one of the saddle hooks craning to see if the rider was yet in sight olias quickly disarmed the crossbow slipping the silvertipped arrow into the quiver and removing a grapnel arrow in its stead tying one end of the rope to its stem he loaded the grapnel arrow into the crossbow and rearmed the firing mechanism that done he took a deep breath rolled twice to the left came up on his elbows aimed at a large stone near the base of a tree across the road and fired the grapnel caught solidly and from the middle of the road it would be wellnigh impossible to see it unless one were specifically looking for such a thing which the armsman most likely would not be forgods willing he must be as tired as those he was pursuing olias wound the remainder of the rope around his right wrist making certain that the portion lying across the road was flat in the dirt and would not be seen until rider and horse were right on top of it and by then it would be too late slipping back down into the cramped furrow olias held his breath as the hoofbeats grew louder closer somewhat less fierce and slightly slower than before he wondered why the armsman wasnt digging heels into the horse forcing speed still it was running swiftly enough that the rope when he yanked it taut should trip the horse and cause it to throw its rider without permanently harming either of them the horses hooves clattered against some stones embedded in the hardpacked ground as it bolted from the forest and neared the campsite olias grasped the rope with both hands now winding it once around his left wrist and threading it through his grip then rose to his knees and readied himself to pull when the horse nearly upon the trap stopped dead hi its tracks hooves sparking against stones one front leg in the air and bent at the kneean almost absurd image as if some wizard had frozen the beast in midmotionthen slowly mist jetting from its nostrils began cantering backward the armsman had spotted the trap damn disentwining his wrists from the rope as quickly as he was able olias pulled another silvertipped arrow from the quiver and armed the crossbow then struggled to his feet gods the pain in his ankle was agonizing and limped into the road taking aim at the rider let me see your hands armsman and may the gods help you if for the second time that night the words died in his throat the boy who sat upon the horse was no armsman he barely looked human even from this distance it was obvious to olias that the boy had been the victim of a brutal beating most of his face and chest was covered in blood and wounds his lower lip looked to have been halfsliced away by a knifes blade and one side of his face was so horribly swollen that neither his eye nor part of his nose could be seen olias snapped the crossbow to his side pointing the arrow toward the ground and moved slowly forward one hand extended in a gesture of peace so as not to alarm the horse it was only as he came up beside the gray mare that he saw the rest gods he whispered who did this to you boy the rider made no reply not only had the boy been beaten not only had he been cut and thrashed and judging by some of the marks across his exposed stomach whipped until nearly dead but someone had burned him as well clumps of ugly flameseared hairlooking more like pigsbed straw than anything that should be part of a human beings bodyhung limply from the boys head made all the more hideous by the contrast of its color against that of the sickening glistening crimsonraw sections where his scalp had been either sheared pulled or burned away from his skull olias swallowed twice hard and loudly over the years since his fathers death olias had worked feverishly toward hardening himself against others pain and misfortune none had offered any comfort or sympathy to father in his time of neednor to himself or his mother after fathers deathso he vowed that none no matter how pathetic dire or horrifying their circumstances would ever touch him that deeply again the next thought he blamed on weariness for this boy whom he had mistaken for an armsman nearly reached into his core to wrest some small measure of tenderness but olias wellpracticed in this particular art of selfdefense was able to quash the moment of vulnerability by concentrating on the skill that had gone into securing the boy to his horse his hands had been bound tightly together at the wrists and the bindings tied to the pommel of the saddle there were no stirrup irons but the stirrup leathers had been left in place used to tie the boys calves to the saddle itself he was belted thrice two times at the waistonce to the pommel once to the high cantle using rings on the saddle meant for that purposeand a third time around his neck it was this last that threatened to move something buried deep in olias heart for the opposite end of the leather strap had been split in two and each of the ends tied to the boys ankles as if he were a hog being bound for slaughter olias leaned closer sniffing the leather beneath the coppery scent of blood and the charred aroma of flames and smoke the scent of drenched hide drying was unmistakable whoever had bound the boy to this horse had soaked the leather straps knowing damned well that as it dried it would shrink tightening itself around the boys neck and slowly crushing his throat why didnt you just kill him thought olias what did this boybarely a boy more child than boywhat did he do that was so unspeakable as to warrant this kind of sickmaking punishment this torture olias was still lost along such paths of thought when the boy turned his head downwardas much as the strap would allow him toand opened his undamaged eye which was so startlingly silver olias felt a moment of awe tinged with fear ffrindiau choked the boy caredig ffrindiau olias puzzled over the words hed traveled far through valdemar and had or so he thought encountered all of its various languagesafter all valdemar was a patchwork quilt of a dozen different peoples escaping from a dozen different unbearable situations and each of them had their own unique tongue which naturally would undergo changes as the various clans began to intermingle but this boy was speaking in a language olias had never heard before it might have been some kind of primitive hybrid of tayledrashawkbrother tongue some of the inflections were similarbut he doubted it hawkbrother tongue didnt have so many guttural clicks nor was it nearly as musical as this boys language under other circumstances he probably wouldnt have cared at all but despite his defenses despite his not understanding the words themselves olias felt the pain and loneliness and fear in the boys plea he unsheathed his dagger and set about cutting the straps then lifted the boy who was much much larger than he first appeared from off the horseand nearly collapsed to the ground when the extra weight caused the bones in his wounded ankle to snap ranyart olias called trying to balance himself on his other leg ranyart ran up beside him olias managed to drape the boy over ranyarts saddle then guided both horses over to the campsite where he promptly collapsed to the ground clutching at his broken ankle and snarling with pain the boy lifted his head then pushed himself up and slid slowly from ranyarts back and stumbled over to olias poen he asked gently placing one of his scarred and bloody hands on oliass ankle cymorth poen dont touch it shouted olias throwing back his head and wincing gods please please dont i the boy closed his good eye then tightened his grip a strange bluish glow appeared under the boys hand quickly spilling outward to encircle olias ankle and before he could further protest or strike out at the boy olias felt the broken bones and tendons instantly painlessly mend themselves moments later the boy helped him to his feet and olias was dumbstruck the ankle was fine the boy had healed him looking up he watched as the boy set to work on his own wounds the same bluish light emanating from his hands as he touched first his head then face lip throat chest and legs finally grasping each wrist in turn to remove the bruises and strap burns each time his hands brushed over a different area more of his body glowed with a shimmering soft blue light until for a moment at the end he was encased in a spectral luminance but in an instant the light dissolved into his flesh and he stood there just a boy far too large for his age but looking healthy and unharmed and least outwardly only time would tell how much damage had been done to the boys mind and spirit by whatever filthy sadistic cowards had unleashed their brutality on him no wonder they tied your hands so tightly thought olias they couldnt chance your healing yourself before the horse had carried you far away from them that is if they even knew about your healing powers were they afraid of something else odd one were they aware of your powers at all damn what does it matter and why should i care still the thought persisted why hadnt they just killed him didnt it occur to anyone that some other traveler might chance upon the boy and set him free wouldnt they know if that were to happen the boy might come back to seek vengeance the boy lifted his cherubic smiling face to olias gods thought olias feeling almost silly that was not the face of one who would go seeking vengeance ththank you said olias pointing down toward his ankle it feels feels fine it feels wonderful in fact the boy his piercing hypnotic silver gaze never wandering from oliass eyes simply smiled more widely and nodded his head whats your name child have you a name the boy cocked his head to the side the expression on his face puzzled sighing olias stood up straight and patted his own chest with both hands olias i am olios he pointed at the boy whats your name the boy grinned then stood up straight patting his chest with both hands and said quite loudly olias olias groaned shaking his head no no no am olias me thats my name he pointed at the boy once again and raised his eyebrows in silent question the boy looked at him opened his mouth to speak but didnt then snapped up his head eyes widening with understanding as he pointed to his chest and shouted llewythi pressing his hand against oliass chest the boy whispered somewhat hesitantly ffrindiau chi ti llewythis ffrindiau ydhuch urn yes replied olias nodding his head for some reason he sensed it was important to agree with the boy at this moment yes of course llewythis ffrindiau llewythi laughed then embraced olias nearly crushing his rib cagegods the child was strong patting his back several times in a gesture of thanks and affection youre youre welcome i think responded olias pulling himself away from the boy and checking himself for internal bleeding then pointing toward the fire where the squirrelmeat was roasting on a spit over the flames are you hungry the boy furrowed his brow in confusion obviously no more familiar with olias language than olias was with his sighing olias rubbed a hand over his own stomach hungry do you want something to eat the boy tilted his head to the side then shrugged his frustration growing olias took a calming breath and said rwyn mynd gael cinio gobeithio mai tywydd braf gown ni then gasped and promptly covered his mouth with his hand as the boy made a delighted sound licked his lips rubbed his stomach and nodded vigorously did i just invite him to join me in his own tongue how in havens could i do thative never heard this language before in my life the boy perhaps sensing the others confusion touched a finger to his own mouth then his head then pointed toward olias you made me do that didnt you you you gave your language to me for that moment didnt you ydhuch llewythi cymorth ffrindiau he made his way toward the campfire bwuq he said laughing as he pointed to the roasting squirrels yyes stammered olias bwuq it seemed that was the boys word for food he proved himself to be a most pleasant and courteous meal companion not taking more than his share of food and making sure that olias had all that he wanted though there had been only two squirrels it seemed to olias that the layers of delicious meat on their carcasses were enough to have come from ten squirrels a candlemark later when both olias and llewythi were so full they couldnt eat another bite it still looked as if they had barely touched the food adding more wood to the fire then crawling into his groundbedding olias looked at llewythi and said in his own language i dont know where you came from or what exactly you are but im almost glad for your companyand believe me ive not said that to another human being in a long long while youre welcome to stay here with ranyart and me for the night the boy snuggled up against one of the trees folded his hands in his lap and leaned back his head but did notor would not it appearedclose his eyes i guess that means youre happy to accept the invitation whispered olias under his breath then lay back lute in hands and strummed an old tune while staring up at the clear starry night from time to time olias would chance a quick glance at his guest and always the boy seemed to be fighting against falling asleep why do you not wish to rest thought olias are you frightened that your dreams will force you to relive what they did to you or is it something else something you cannot express to me so that ill understand he held his breath momentarily opening his senses to the night as the wind changed direction and the stench of fire smoke and destruction grew stronger out there somewhere in the night a great violence had taken place olias was able to feel the lingering resonance of the destruction and brutality and unspeakable terror closing his eyes and focusing on the sentient threads he sensed the presence of something powerful in slumber something otherworldlyno not otherworldly at all but something that came from beyond the otherworld something he couldnt quite grasp and bring forward so that he might see and understand whatever it was it was beyond any power hed ever encountered and somehow it was connected to this boy what are you my strange lostling and what did you do to deserve such a fate then youre nothing to me so why should i care each of us must deal alone with our demons dont count on anyones help lostling because youll not get it tonight you were lucky but as far as i am concerned come the dawn you are on your own as if he had both heard and comprehended olias private musings llewythis face shadowed for an instant with a soulsick hurt that made him look even more helpless and pathetic and so very very sad lest that look reach into his heart olias turned his face away returning his attention to his lute alone lostling we are all alone from cradle to grave dont share your pain with me i dont want to see it after a whileand without his being aware of it olias had begun to play my ladys eyes a sentimental song and one that he had always thought to be so much drivel but it allowed a minstrel to show off his fingering it had been his parents favorite song they had danced to it at their wedding unexpectedly olias felt his throat tightening as unwanted tears began to form in his eyes swallowing back the emotions that were trying to surge to the surface he laid the lute aside and forced himself to think of his blunder earlier tonight in allowing the scullery maid to panic him he could have easily gotten past her and the others after all hed taken time to walk through the manorkeep and decide upon his escape route but for some reason being discovered like that had unnerved him and that had never happened before what did it matter though that fat arrogant disgusting slug the servants called mlord was a lot poorer now than hed been before allowing the minstrel into his home though olias doubted the man would remain poorer for very long he at least had the satisfaction of knowing that the bastard was stewing in his own juices tonight cursing everyone and everything because he had been taken in by a common thief he sat up rummaging around for the bottle of wine and took three deep swallows then looked over at his companion llewythi looking exhausted and desperately in need of sleep was still awake and staring at olias his face betraying his concern olias began speaking to the boy he couldnt stop himself it was as if the spirits wandering this sowannight were forcing him to talk i was thinking about no best not tell him what you were just this moment thinking about after all a thief is a thief in any clan i was thinking about my parents my mother was employed as an apprenticeseamstress at the manorkeep of lord withen ashkevron of forst reach my father was the village metalworker and blacksmith i remember i know this may sound odd to you assuming you understand a word im sayingbut of all things i remember his hands the best they were so large and powerful that when i was a child i imagined that i could curl up in either of his palms and sleep there they were rough hands hardcallused and scarred but his touch against my cheek was as gentle as angels breath i remember the way he would come home after a days labors and scrub those hands until i thought he would scrape the flesh right off of them and whenever my mother would say to him why do you wash so angrily he would show her one of his sad halfgrins and say it wont do for you to be touched by anything so dirty and hard and my mother would laugh oh gods i miss hearing her laugh if my fathers hand so lightly against my cheek was the touch of angels breath then my mothers laugh was their song and the love in their eyes whenever they would look at each other neither of them were gifted in any way they werent what i suppose youd call particularly bright they werent educated but they were good people fine people decent and honest and loyal dont misunderstand each had their faultsmother was often a little too worrisome which annoyed father no end and he gods bless him could never seem to pay attention to anything besides his work for very longconversations with him were a test of your patience trust methe man didnt know how to listen and at times he and mother argued over my upbringing and how to manage their money well enough to keep the creditors at bay but they made certain that neither of them ever went to bed angry at the other i once asked my mother why and she told me that father had this fear that were they to go to bed angry one of them might die during the night and the survivor would be left with unanswered questions and unresolved regrets i used to think that was funny until mother told me that my father had once exchanged harsh words with his father then stormed out of the house only to return the next morning and find that the old man had died in his sleep he never got the chance to apologize she said to me he never got to take it back hes carried that sorrow with him for many years and he wants to make sure that none of us ever has to face that olias shaking his head snorted a humorless laugh i always wondered why i never saw him really smile i dont think he felt he deserved to smile not after what happened with his father mother understood that about him and she accepted it as best she was able and did everything she could to give his heart some small measure of of peace theirs was perhaps the most loving marriage i have ever seen then one day some heraldmagetrainees came to forst reach with lord withen ashkevrons sister savil i found savil herself to be a remarkably kind and pleasant woman but some of her trainees baha more selfcentered arrogant bunch of brats i hope i never see absentmindedly olias picked up a nearby stick and began tapping it against the neck of his lute among those savil brought with her was a young man named gwanwyn who took great delight in amazing the courtiers with his metalworking prowessand as much as i hate admitting it his skill was impressive lord ashkevron was suitably amazed that he called for a contest between gwanwyn and my father i wish for a new sword he said one to rival even my armsmens finest blades until that night my father had fashioned most of the swords used by lord ashkevrons soldiers so few doubted that he would prevail the only rule was that gwanwyn could not employ any magic during the competition i remember all the people i was very young so maybe there werent as many as it seemed but to my eyes half of valdemar turned out for the contest my fatherhed never been comfortable in large crowds was nervous as a boy calling on his love for the first time but mother mother eased his anxiety as well she could telling him that no matter the outcome she would always love him dear sweet silly woman as if love could be enough im not sure how it happened but im certain gwanwyn cheatedhe must have he bested my fathers efforts by more than half a candlemarkno one could have fashioned a blade that quickly without the use of magic it just wasnt possible toward the end when he began to realize that gwanwyn was winning my father became careless and pulled his blade from the fire before it was ready for the hammer and the first strike snapped the metal in two hed never made that mistake before and i saw him die inside at the sight of those two halves lying on the ground before him the people watching all laughed gods i remember their laughter it was such an ugly sound until that moment id never realized that people you called neighbor people you called friend could take such delight in your disgrace only the heralds were silent my father was not a small manhe was perhaps one of the tallest men hi the citybut i could see him shrink under the weight of that ugly laughter when he walked away that day he was looking at the ground i dont believe i ever saw him look up again they broke his heart and crippled his spirit after that day none of the gentry ever brought then business to him again by the time he died hed been reduced to taking groom duties at one of the local stables he never spoke much except to thank the stablemaster for his position of all the pains that he had to endure toward the end the worst of itthough he would never say it aloudwas the way people looked at him with such pity distaste and pity mother died shortly after we buried father the grief and loneliness was too much for her i tried the gods know how i tried to fill the void left in her life by fathers death i would play for her at nightid always had a talent for musicbut every song reminded her of father there is some grief you never recover from i guess i took to thieving shortly before she died shed become very ill and i knew she didnt have long left and i was damned if her body was going to be tossed into a paupers grave like my fathers i managed to steal enough to pay for a proper grave and marker but i hadnt enough for a new grave for my father to this day his body still lies in that paupers field and enough time has gone by thatthough i can easily raise the price asked by the gravediggersi have forgotten the exact location of the spot where his body was buried i cant help but think that his spirit must be saddened by that for i know how much he wanted to rest by mothers side he picked up the lute and stared at it i will never forgive any of the gentry any of the wealthy or the highborn for what they did to my parents never they think they are so far above the rest of us safe in their mansions they are all the same in my eyes and i in theirs who am i after all to them no one well damn them all to hell i say ill take from them what was denied my parents in life and ill do with the money as i please if i wish to spend it on food and drink and the price of a woman in my bed so be it if i choose to give it away to beggars hi the street then that is what ill do and may the gods pity anyone who dares to try and stop me he angrily strummed the lute and someday i swear ill make lord withen ashkevron suffer for his betrayal of my father and then ill find gwanwyn and ill kill him slowly so that hell know the pain my parents suffered because of his pride he strummed the lute once again coldly and calmly then lay the instrument aside lest he damage it in his anger he looked toward llewythi damn you as well lostling what is it about you that causes me to speak in an unknown tongue what is it that made me want to tell these things to you llewythi only stared in silence looking more and more like some village idiot olias groaned in frustration then flipped onto his side facing away from his guest gods at times like this i wish there were another place another land another world in another time where i could be rid of them all where i wouldnt have to look upon the faces of valdemar and see the ghost of my parents in everyone in every place i wish gods how i wish he awakened sometime later to the sounds of rustling and immediately drew his dagger from his ankle sheath and whipped around brandishing the weapon llewythi was standing by the tree his eyes closed his arms outstretched the fingers of his hands extending outward then curling toward him as if he were beckoning someone olias watched dumbstruck as threads of thin silver light danced around llewythis fingertips then reached out to encircle a small bundle attached to the back of llewythis horse the ropes holding the bundle in place untied themselves the covering fell away and the silver threads wound themselves around something that looked like a glass pipeonly this instrument was much larger than a pipe easily the size of a mans forearm tapered at one end and open at the other inside the glass had been blown in such a way that several spheres some larger than others had formed along its length the instrument rose from the horse cradled in silver threads and moved through the air to land gently in llewythis grip smiling the boy sat down once again and rubbed his hands against a small patch of ice near the base of the tree until the heat from his palms melted the ice sufficiently to wet his fingers laying the glass pipe across his knee llewythi placed his fingers on the surface of the instrument the spheres within began to revolve and whirl some slower than others some so fast they could barely be seen olias couldnt tell how this was possible the spheres were obviously part of the pipe yet each moved as if independent of it llewythi began to finger the glass in much the same way harp players plucked at the taut strings of their instruments but as he moved his fingers up and down the length of the pipe each of the spheres glowednot any single color but all colors one bleeding into the next until it was impossible to tell the difference between gold and red red and gray gray and blue and with each burst of color and combinations of colors there came musical notes the first was a lone soft sustained cry that floated above them on the wings of a dove a mournful call that sang of foundered dreams and sorrowful partings and dusty forgotten myths from ages long gone by then progressively rose in pitch to strengthen this extraordinary melancholy with tinges of joy wonder and hope as the songs of the other spheres and colors joined it becoming the sound of a million choral voices raised in worship to the gods becoming musics fullest dimension richest intention whispering rest to olias weary heart as the light moved outward in waves and ripples altering the landscape with every exalted refrain voices a hundred times fuller than any human beings should ever be pulsing swirling rising then cascading over his body like pure crystal rain and suddenly the rain the music was inside of him assuming physical dimensions forcing him to become more than he was than hed been than hed ever dreamed of becoming olias dropped down to one knee the sound growing without and within him and he was aware not only of the music and the colors and whirling spheres of glass but of every living thing that surrounded himevery weed every insect every glistening drop of dew on every blade of grass and every animal in deepest forest and as the song continued rising in his soul lavish magnificent and improbable olias heard thoughts and sensed dreams and absorbed myriad impressions as they danced in the air passing from spirit to mind to memory with compulsive speed and more sensory layers than he was able to comprehend lifting everything toward a sublime awareness so acute so alive so incandescent and allencompassing that he thought he might burst into flames for the blinding want underneath it all it was the closest thing to splendor hed ever known llewythi lifted his hands from the pipe but the music didnt immediately stop instead it faded away in degrees one layer of sound absorbed into the next until at the end there was only the original note pure and easy sighing release like a breath rippling by olias covered his face with his hands and took several deep breaths in an effort to still the pounding of his heart then lifted his head and opened his eyes to daylight daylight in a place he didnt recognize barren of trees and bush ranyart was gone as was llewythis horse and the campsite even the road wwhat what have you done he croaked llewythis only response was to smile then turn and walk away gesturing for olias to follow the groundmostly sunbrowned mud covered in crackswas much firmer than it appeared at first glance though the terrain was far from level they began ascending a hill and were met by a strong steady wind soaring down carrying with it the first stinging spatters of rainyet the sky above was blue the clearest olias had ever seen he doubled his efforts to catch up with llewythi and continued climbing blinking against the sea spray not rain after all until the ground leveled off and he found himself standing at the top of a jagged overhang looking to each side he was struck not only by the vast expanse of the cliffs upon which they were standing but by their beauty as well silvery clouds rolled in above their heads twirling and turning like banners in a breeze moving quicker than any cloud formations olias had ever seen winding around one another and spinning in place he opened his mouth to speak and llewythi silenced him by placing a finger against his own lips an odd noise caused olias to shake his head the sound of a million insects buzzing here atop the cliffs the buzzing merged with the sounds of the sea and became clearer more defined not a buzz at all but the combined whispering of a million different voices speaking in as many tongues some were complex and excited others low and monosyllabic still others a combination of vaguely recognizable words that degenerated into animal clicks and whistling and yaps what are those those voices those sounds shouted olias over the roar of the rushing waters below again llewythi raised a finger to his lips then pointed out to sea the waters rumbled and churned crashing against the base of the cliffs with the sound of shattering glass the vibrations rocked upward through layers of stone and sand shaking olias to his bones then with stupendous force and thunderous volume the spinning tower of silver clouds shot down into the sea churning as it struck the surface and creating great revolving waves of frothy spray before vanishing beneath the waters the froth left in its wake formed a circle that spun around and around and around its speed becoming frantic as it formed an everwidening and deepening whirlpool the atmosphere crackled with power olias covered his ears against the shrieking winds and watched as the whirlpool turned inside out rising like a geyser atop the foaming fount appeared a shining white stallion with an opal mane its front legs lifted high heraldic its belly the curve of the moon the rest a silken fish scaled from chest to tail like a shower of silver coins the churning fount surged across the sea the glorious creature riding the crest its legs pumping mane flowing in the wind as it neared the cliffs the fountain of water slowed and began to curve downward the spray spinning off lowering the creature until it hovered directly at the edge of the overhang olias couldnt speak the eyes of the creature demanded silence the creature threw back its head and opened its mouth a soft nearly imperceptible sound rose from deep in its chest a clear crisp ping as if someone had flicked a finger against a crystal goblet the soundso much like the music llewythi had played earliergrew in volume and it seemed even density assuming a physical form invisible to the eye yet filling the air enveloping olias in a liquidarmor numbness drugging him like a frosty sip from a healers herb cup but allowing him to maintain wakefulness as the geysering fount slowly shifted sideways moving the creature until its face was inches from his own the exalted sound the wondrous lone crystal note sung in response to the call from llewythis glass pipe filled olias center then suddenly split apart becoming night stars that in turn became a symphony of musical notes even more unbearable in their purity than the music llewythi had created and olias realized that what he was hearing was the second verse to llewythis song a song of mourning and rejoicing a song meant for no one and everyone but in that instant olias chose to think of it as his this chaste glory this innocence this music a song for no ones mourning sung only for him to honor the memory of his parents and all they had dreamed of he hugged himself dropping to his knees and rocking back and forth the spuming foam covering him like lather he was agonizingly aware of the swirling voices the unknown languages shifting forward dislodging themselves from his mind and themselves becoming tones the first crystal note the creature had sung swam forward until it found its matching languagetone and the two of them mergeda sharp sting in olias earsand were translated pwy fydd yma ymhen can mlynedd into his own language who will be here in a hundred years olias torso shot straight up his eyes staring into the unblinking golden disks of the creatures gaze gods he whispered greetings olias said the creature my name is ylem you should feel honored llewythi doesnt bring many others to this place where am i asked olias silently you are where you wished to be another place another world another time you are in a place that lies between valdemar and the otherworld created by one who feels he has no place in either only here can he feel some sense of home you neednt worry about ranyart were you able to cross through the veil that separates this world from valdemar you would find him only a few feet away from you i dont understand perhaps in time but ylem did not finish the thought after the first merging of tones the others happened quickly and easily a note sung by ylem would find its match in a languagetone the two of them merging and translating in olias mind until he could not only hear the other languages spoken in their native tongue but understand them as well ylem leaned to the side kissed llewythis forehead then whispered something in his ear try as he did olias could not hear what the creature was saying ylem was in front of him again hooves pressing against olias shoulder hi a gesture of blessing then releasing a triumphant crystal cry the creature spun around its tail snapping in the air and sailed atop the fountain back out to sea diving downward and disappearing beneath the waters but not before speaking one last time to olias take care olios and realize if you can that you are not the only one in this place who has known soulsickness and grief keep your anger near you will need itbut not for the reasons you may think for several moments afterward olias could only kneel there shaking then a voice a small quiet childs voice asked are you all right olias looked up as llewythi placed a hand upon his shoulder are we speaking in my language or in yours asked olias can you understand me yes then what does it matter olias struggled to his feet gasping for breath where are we in the barrens of my world said llewythi pointing first to his head then his heart then spreading his arms in front of him i made it i dreamed it do you like it olias rubbed his forehead i i dont know but so far what ive seen has been gods llewythi now looking more like an overgrown child than ever laughed a childs laugh grabbed olias hand and led him away from the cliffs they stumbled down a sharp slope toward a pampas of richly green grass leading to a field where tall corn stalks brushed back and forth through the air to olias everything smelled like lavenderwhich to him had always been the scent of his mothers skin left there by the soap she bought from a local tradesman they moved toward the entrance to a grove but as they neared it olias saw there were no trees beyond the few dozen that rose before them arranged in two opposing rows between which stood a stained glass archway olias slowed his steps something about this was familiar but he didnt know why the trees were as tall as a castles tower each with a thick black trunk the branches of each tree were obscured by onion layers of bleak blue leaves which collectively blossomed into human faces each one turned skyward and staring up through milky pupilless eyes every face wore the pinched tight expression of concentrated grief and as the wind passed through the trees the faces opened their mouths and moaned deeply steadily mournfully llewythi looked upon them as if they were old friends olias whispered they sound as if theyre in pain they are but theyre used to it theyre keeningwoods and this is what they do keeningwoods thought olias and then the forest of sorrows looking backward he began to see a pattern llewythi had taken various parts of valdemar and transposed them into this place the same way a skilled musician would transpose one theme into another the barrens could very well have been llewythis version of the borderylems uncanny form attested to that and ylem itself could very well have been based partly on the legends of the borders creatures and partly on the companions the sea taking the place of companions field and here the keeningwoods replaced the forest of sorrows it both made sense and did not of course a child like llewythi would have to build upon things he already knew and who in valdemar didnt know of the companions or their field or the forest of sorrows or countless other beings and places some part of him shuddered inwardly at the thought of what a child might do with the concept of the outkingdom or the pelagirs pointing toward the keeningwoods olias asked llewythi why do they make such an anguished sound to remind all travelers that there are only three things that really matter people you love your memories and sadness such a wistful look in his silver eyes as he said this they passed under the keeningwoods and through the archway emerging on the threshold of a resplendent stone city where a raucous band of blackwinged children flew past them all smiling and greeting llewythi by name theyre my friends said llewythi i like having friends even if i had to make them up just outside the city they came to an ancient bridge made of sticks and bones when they reached the middle llewythi stopped and pointed over the side beneath the clear stilled surface of the turquoise water was a series of evenly spaced hollowed boulders each with a transparent sheet of glass attached to the front inside each of the boulderswhich werent boulders at all olias saw upon closer examination but glass spheres like those within llewythis strange pipe only covered in moss and isinglasssat a claylike lump some were shapeless blobs others more human in shape some were skeletal others so corpulent their forms could barely be contained still others were merely handsized featureless fetuses all of the figures huddled with knees pulled up tightly against their chests none of them seemed complete their dark sunken eyes stared blankly at the floating weeds and golden fish swimming by you see them asked llewythi dont they look safe no whispered olias they look imprisoned oh no no id id never do anything like that i dont like feeling lonely and i know that they feel the same way so i made sure that the water is filled with stories and music to keep them company why do you want them to feel safe because its its nice to feel that way i dont want them to be lonely lonely is cold i dont like the cold theres so much cold sometimes dont you ever feel cold most of my life thats sad no it isnt its just the way that is your keeningwoods weep i feel cold but not here olias shrugged no this is this is fine he looked down once more at the beings in the water how long will you keep them this way llewythi stared down at his feet i guess i donti mean until until when until i decide what to make out of them olias stared at his companion then said very slowly very carefully how did you come by this power ive heard of no heraldmage who possesses such abilities what empowered you i dont know my dreams i guess i dream a lot sometimes i dont have a mother or father if i ever did have i cant remember mostly i live in the stables of my village the grooms there are kind to me they make sure that i have food and blankets he stood a little taller a little prouder i sweep up after the horses i do a good job the stablemaster says so i have a fine feather pillow the stablemasters wife made it for me she says im a nice boy and its a shame the other children wont wont play with me olias almost laughed at llewythis referring to himself as a child perhaps in his mind yes but his body was that of the strongest armsmen a childs mind in a warriors body but a stablehand gods were they in a place such as haven a boy with llewythis gifts would be treated with the deepest respect and awe no one would dare think to make a gifted one sleep among the horses llewythi said olias slowly and carefully why were you made to sleep in the stables because no one would take me into their home even though they knew of your powers llewythi stared at him for a moment then looked down at the ground and shook his head i never never understood why i could do some of the things i couldcan do i thought they might be bad things some of them so i never told anyone i never showed them but certainly there must have been olias sighed puzzling for a moment over how to say this there must have been people in your village who suffered either from sickness or injury children gods save us certainly there must have been children who fell ill and might have died if oh yes there was one child a little girl who became so sick with fever that no one thought she would live if a healer were not sent for but i made her better how if no one knew a birdstrangely metallic in coloringflew overhead at that moment and llewythi waved his hand toward it its wings went limp and its body began to plummet toward the ground but a few seconds before it would have struck the earth llewythi waved his hand once again and the birdwrenched from its trancefrantically flapped its wings and screeching flew away thats how i did it said llewythi i can make people sleep or not see me thats how i got into the little girls bedroom and made her all better everyone in the village they said it was a miracle a blessing from the gods and anytime someone in the village needed healing you you made them sleep or not see you yes olias nodded his head did you cast this spell over only those you helped or did you the whole village everyone llewythi nodded his head that way id be sure no one could see me ah i like helping them and no one knowing it gives me nice dreams sometimes and sometimes when i feel lonely id think about the little girl and smile and its nice in the stables really it is i like it im sure youre a fine stablehand surprisingly olias found that he meant it but the other people in the village they dont they dont talk to me the other children tell me that im too big and and ugly and no one wants to play with a foundlingthats what i am it makes me feel feel bad sometimes because i dont know where i came from or or anything so when i finish sweeping at night i like to dream even when im awake and if i dream hard enough the dreams they sometimes come out of my head and become real and the people in my dreams theyre always my friends except for gash you dont want to meet him hes mean and he always wants me to tell him what he is he says that if i can ever do that if i can tell him what he is then hell go away and never come back i try to guess but im never right and then he destroys things dont be scared though because hes never come around these parts oh you poor simpleminded thing thought olias has the world treated you so wretchedly that even in your dreams you invent one who torments you who makes you feel so alone and sad and worthless godsdid you do so out of choice or has your heart been so brutalized that you simply think its natural for someone to abuse you unable to find the words which would adequately express what he was feeling olias reached out and placed his hand on llewythis shoulder smiling llewythi placed his hand atop olias and asked are you do you like it here yes llewythi i think its very nice i think its splendid the boys face beamed at this mild praise really would you like to see more very much so yes are you do you want to be ii mean yes whispered olias i will be your friend he could have swum a hundred raging rivers then on the memory of llewythis smile how strange it was to feel an attachment after so many years done how strange to feel some of the soulcoldness fading away but somehow here in llewythis odd worldwithinaworld it seemed right how strange to feel affection for another human being how strange indeed dear father dear mother what would you think of your boy now if you could see him lost in a place that doesnt really exist befriending a simpleton in whose hands his destiny evidently rests what would you think once over the bridge the land became flat and hard and dusty as they walked beside one another olias and llewythi spoke of their childhoods of games and tales and small wonders of the animals theyd played with and the places theyd seen and it seemed to olias that as they spoke some part of the world sang a song of rejoicing of second chances and hope renewed a bardic ballad of two lifebonded friends meeting for the first time and of the simple untainted glory of learning to trust i can see why you like it here so much said olias it must be difficult for you to leave llewythi touched his head then his heart i dont leave ever its always here with me even when im gone the abstract wisdom in those words caught olias by surprise could it be that llewythi was not as dim as people thought they came then to another section of the shoreline the sea lapped at the edge of their feet playfully as if acknowledging their new bond and giving its blessing they came to rest on a large boulder worn down by time sea and the seasons until its shape bore a humorous resemblance to a giant kings throne lying back olias allowed the sea mist to anoint his face and felt even more at home llewythi hm could you please tell me what happened to youi mean who who hurt you who tied you to that horse llewythi stared out at the sea then looked down at his hands i i dont know why i can do these things i just know that i can i play my glass pipe and the music brings me here its so nice here everyones so good to me theyre theyre happy to see me no one in valdemar treats me this way thats why i come here all the time thats why i made this place so i could go somewhere where people would be nice to me i know i understand that much but didnt mean for it to happen he shouted eyes filling with tears the sudden violence of his emotion shocked olias who was so startled he nearly cried out as llewythi spoke his voice became louder and even more childlike beneath every word his pain deeper than olias had imagined came snarling to the surface it was the panicked voice of a child lost in the night hands outstretched in hopes that someone kind would take hold of him and protect them from the darkness and pain and make the fear go away a pain that asked in its own way please please show a little kindness a little tenderness sssomettimes when im asleep sometimes the dreams they come out of my head and i cant make them do what i want because im asleep and i dont know that theyve come out i i ddont mean for it to happen but it just happens sometimes its never been a bad thing before but the other night i was so tired id worked hard and and i was so tired and when i fell asleep gash came outand hes so mean he hurt a lot of people in the village he burned down some of the other stables and killed the horses and thththen he he started killing everyone i woke up when i heard the screaming but it was too late couldnt stop him from killing everyone because i was asleep thats never happened to me before when i woke up gash went back into my head but hed been so mean by then and the people they knew that it was me that had brought gash into the village because a a herald was there and he said he sensed that gash had come from me he he tried to make them all understand but they didnt they all came after me and they they hurt me i mean ive been hurt before some of the other stableboys they like to hit me and call me namesbut this time it wwas different the herald tried to stop them but there were too many they hurt me for so long and they screamed at me and some of them even laughed like they were enjoying it i tried to tell them that im not a bad boy im not i didnt mean for it to happen but they wouldnt listen to me they just kept hitting and spitting and then they burned me and and he doubled over clutching at his stomach the sobs racking his bodydeep soulshattering sobs as the grief and fear and confusion dragged rusty steel hooks across his body all over again then he fell backward pulling his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around his knees convulsing olias climbed over to him taking llewythi in his arms as the boy wept even harder his next words coming in broken bursts i didnt mean to hhurt anyone i ddidnt i didnt i know whispered olias stroking llewythis hair i know i jjust wanted them to know i wouldnt have have done any of it i wouldnt have dreamed another world llike this if if i could just tell gash what he is hed go away you see and ththen mmaybe i could have a friend just one thats all just one friend you have one now i will be your friend for the rest of our days llewythi there there take deep breaths deep there you are hold onto me thats it hold on i wont let go i wont leave you alone ever i swear it on my parents graves swear if youll never be lonely again neverand no one will ever harm you from this day forward not while im around its all right shhh there there go on go on and cry thats right let it go let it go he leaned down and kissed llewythis sweatsoaked forehead then brushed back his hair and held him even tighter rocking back and forth feeling strongand it was good to feel this way for someone after so long the sudden rush of affection was dizzying almost overpowering but he didnt care he could protect this boy this sad gentle boy who wanted nothing more than acceptance something olias himself had secretly wished for since the day he buried his motherbut instead of trusting others he had foolishly chosen to hide his loneliness behind a scrim of anger and bitterness it was then that olias looked behind them and saw the wall of stone an ancient ruin nearly overgrown with moist red vines sculpted into the wall was a womans face her eye sockets were empty ravenblack ovals and her mouth opened as if calling out for some longlost love was the entrance to a cave it was a face which held so much unspoken pain and grief that her expression alone would have been enough to move even the hardest of hearts but that is not why olias eyes began to fill with tears the face was that of his mother turning away he stared into the distance and realized that they had walked a straight path since leaving the barrens he knew this because he could still see the keeningwoods from here as he stared at them they seemed so much closerat least in his minds eyeand his troubled heart grew even heavier for now all of them wore his fathers faceand not the face hed known as a child not the robust laborreddened strong face of a hearty man no this face was the same one hed put on the day of his defeat by gwanwyn and never taken off even in death this was the face of a brokenhearted disgraced man whose value had been diminished even in his own eyes why dear gods can you tell me why even here our grief haunts us can you make me understand why our souls cannot find a measure of peace as if in answer a great rumbling came from the depths of the dark cave then the echo of even darker laughter gash whispered llewythi clutching olias arm there was no time to run already olias could see the things shape shifting forward from the depths of the earth moving toward the light and bringing with it a smell that was at first musty and stale like the odor from a longclosed chest whose lid has suddenly been forced open the odor grew ever stronger rancid and sickening the stench of bloated carcasses rotting under a blazing sun its step shook the ground and when it at last emerged from the cave it had to bend over it was so tall thrice the size of the tallest tower it was worse than any nightmare gash was not one but two soldiercreatures fused together the first walked on reedthin legs while the other grew out of its back a torso whose head sat far above that of its carrier with one twisted grotesquely long arm that reached nearly to the ground its misshapen bulk held upright by a pulsing black sack growing from between the carriers shoulders the shimmering gray skin had the jagged texture of rough stone though not as dark its legs scraped together as it walked loosing small clouds of chalk dust the weight of the thing growing from its back forced the carrier to walk hunched over and in obvious pain the bodies looked to have been once covered in armor that some terrible conflagration had melted to their skin the carrier looked at olias and smiled its pulverized lips squirming over rotted needlelike teeth its face was an abomination of all nature countless boils and leaking diseased wounds covered its cheeks and the sunlight reflected against the stonesized tumors that buried its left eye its entire face was covered in a maze of something that looked like a spiderweb of hairless flesh when it spoke it was in a voice filled with phlegm and corruption ah a brave one it spat i do so like brave ones they die so well olias couldnt move llewythi had gone into some form of seizure his body stonerigid and still his eyes rolled back into his head exposing only the whites olias thrust out his dagger the only weapon he had against gashs colossal form it looked pathetic a sad joke youll not need that if you can tell me what i am olias gently set llewythi aside then stood and if i cannot gash tossed back both its heads and released a mad highpitched cackling laugh then balled one of its hands into a fist and threw forth a fireball that slammed into the sea hissing then the next one will be for you now look me in the face boy and tell me what i am olias stared long and hard and unblinkingly it seemed to him that both parts of gash were as familiar as everything else hed encountered thus far the carrierbrutal coldheartedcould well have been a perverted form of himself of his soul of what it might some day become the otherso blankeyed and vacantvery easily might be another form of llewythi but not one of his choosing came the thought no that is how others have seen him how they have made him feel inside hideous and freakish the boy is gifted after all those gifts are raw and undisciplined so he would be susceptible to others unspoken perceptions is it so hard to imagine that some secret part of himself has come to view himself as other haveand not only that but has done so without his even being consciously aware of it if that is so then why do you see yourself in the carrier what is it about that thing this place the faces of mother and father that he lowered the dagger to his side as around him he heard the distant echoes of llewythis song plaintive and sorrowful and simmering with ethereal beauty and like a seed becoming a root becoming a sprout becoming a blossom the answer came to him as one by one the pieces of llewythis painful puzzle fell into place i know what you are said olias through clenched teeth you are loneliness and grief and the death of dreams you are the sickness which taints the spirit and the helplessness which breaks the heart you are fear and cold darkness doubt and regret you are envy and avarice and the lies we tell ourselves to excuse our cowardice or selfishness you are every cruel word every unkind thought and act of violence ever brought into the world you are the weeping of mothers over the bodies of their children the blood of soldiers spilled in battle the last gasp of the starving in the streets you are this boys misplaced anger and confusion and you feed on his sadness you are my fathers disgrace and the thing which swallowed my mothers laughter you are the blackness of my soul all of my hate and lust for vengeance come to life and in your diseased gaze i can see what my spirit might one day become you are my weakness and failuresall weakness and failure but most of all you are jealous gash snarled jealous of whom and why you are pain and you are jealous of usnot just the boy and me but any human being who can forget for a while that you are real you might be a part of our lives but we can sometimes forget you exist we can listen to music or tell our tales or dance hi the waters as they lap the shoreline or we can steal from the wealthy or flee into the night where we meet a new friend we can drink wine and eat fine food and sleep with chambermaids who pleasure us beyond imagining or we can simply lie back and stare into the flames of a campfire and revel in the unadorned glory of the night stars ah yes we can forget about you and still go on living but you gash who are pain and grief and loneliness you can never for one moment forget about us you wish you could but you cant no matter how much you try and that is why you hate us so and why you are jealous go away said olias dismissing the monstrosity with a wave of his hand you no longer have any hold over this boy or me damn you thief but a thief no more from this day i will protect this boy and i will provide for him as best i can with what meager bardic and herald gifts i possess with honor and honesty hurting no one and if i can somehow make myself worthy i will travel to haven and ask the heraldmage savil to teach me discipline so that i in turn might teach it to my friend and you can be certain gash that neither i nor llewythi will think of you very much at all gash turned around and stormed back toward the cave but with each step it took some part of its body fell to dust i am not the last of my kind it screamed back at him what created me can easily create others you would do well to remember that thief then turning to face him as its legs exploded into rubble it gave one final hideous grin and hissed ill remember you to your mother and father i have them in my belly no you dont said olias but you wish i believed that what remained of gash froze unmoving unspeaking then cracked broke apart and fell to ruin when the sand and dust clouds died down olias looked to see that the woman in the wall was gone in the distance the keeningwoods were simply trees no faces no anguished sounds llewythi was still unconscious but the seizure had passed olias knelt down and gently lifted his friend carrying him as he would a newborn baby walking slowly along the shoreline toward the bridge which would take them back through the stone city then to the barrens and cliffs beyond in his heart he knew they could not stay here no matter how much they might wish to this had been a hiding place a sanctuary of sorts for their wounded souls now that they had each other neither would ever need it again but the ability that went into the creation of such a placea world between worldsthat was desperately needed in valdemar to think of the suffering such a gift could erase olias leaned down his head pressing his cheek against llewythis youll be safe now he whispered i promise weve done it dont you see in each other we have found home and ive not forgotten dear father dear mother ive not forgotten how to care how to love nor how to fondly remember you without rancor or regret i will make amends somehow for all the wrong ive done i will honor the memory of your lives by living my own as well as i can and with my friend by my side i think that may be very well indeed as the echo of llewythis song found them once again olias couldnt help but notice there were two additional tones joining in the glory one sharp loud and steady was the sound of a blacksmiths hammer striking down proudly and confidently shaping steel into blade and the other so pure and easy and light was that of a good womans laughter dancing across the heart leaving warmth and affection in its wake llewythi awoke soon after and with silver threads beckoned his glass pipe come his songwhat olias had thought of as a song for no ones mourningwas even more transcendent than the first time and when they found themselves back at the campsite where ranyart and llewythis horse were waiting patiently it was with renewed hope that they readied themselves for their journeysfor there would be many of that there was no doubt they had much to do and learn and teach climbing onto ranyart olias looked at his new friend his dearest and most loving friend and thought that theirs would be a good life good enough they say that if you travel the road between haven and the forest of sorrows on sowannight when the otherworld is so near you might chance upon a pair of riders resting at a campfire they may invite you to join them for their evening meal which will be plentiful for none ever leaves their camp hungry and later if you are so inclined they will take up lute and pipe and sing to you of another place another land another world in another time where two broken souls found friendship and acceptance and redemption they say you can see the spirits dancing as the riders sing they say you can hear the sound of the sea come so close you swear its right behind you they say you can hear a blacksmiths hammer striking anvil and a womans laughter ghosting happily through the trees but most of all they say you will leave these riders as more than you were before as if every sadness had been lifted from your eyes and their wondrous song will rest in your heart forever as all true music should in loving memory of edward king shaw blue heart by philip m austin and mercedes lackey philip m austin is currently an inmate at soledad prison in california about this story he writes misty lackey is the one who made this story come alive she deserves the majority of the credit and all of my thanks she has been a good friend and mentor shes been nonjudgmental and helpful in so many ways through her good offers ive been able to dream of a future a creative future without walls and bars that dream is worth more than any monetary reward theres a herald to see you your majesty the page called quietly from the doorway of the queens private suite selenay sighed and put down the silver pencil she had been using to scribe a design for an illuminated initial can it wait until tomorrow she asked without hope she was technically supposed to be asleep not getting her fingers paint and inkstained copying one of darens favorite poems she cherished her time alone all too rare and much needed she understood why elspeth needed that shed out in the back gardens and the feeling of clay under her fingers her own hobby of calligraphy and illumination was very similar intensely physical and requiring complete concentration and gave her brief respites when she could forget the responsibilities of crown and country he says to say that its your shadow majesty the page replied clearly baffled by the enigmatic message but if the page was baffled selenay was not she sat up quickly and put away her implements tell him to come in and see that were not disturbed her shadow was an enigma a herald who never if he could help it appeared as himself very few people kerowyn alberich her own husband dareneven knew he existed much less what he really looked like this was a necessary precaution for his special and demanding duties he like skif was a spy and an assassin her own special tool to use as needed and always with reluctance when she did not need him he sometimes requested leavea day a week a month she never asked him why usually it was innocuous and he returned with tales of his companions doingsfor it was often his companion who wanted the leave and not him sometimes though it was not and when he reported for duty his eyes told her she did not want to know what he had been doing despite the fact that she must hear it whatever he did he did it because she needed it done whether or not she knew it never had she found a reason to even rebuke him for his private missions and she knew that agonizing over whether to tell her before or after the fact must often cause him sleepless nights he had requested leave some few weeks ago and she searched his expression for some clue as to his mood but this time he came as himself an ordinary man with a pleasant face unmarked and unremarkable except for his haunted eyes she relaxed as she read relaxation in his posture so it had been a true holiday then and not some secret mission of his own come in sit down she invited brushing a strand of hair out of her eyes and forced down the shiver that always came when he looked at her she did not know his history she did not know if anyone knew it but whatever his past had been it had left dreadful scars on his soul i hope you enjoyed your midwinter holiday pilane appreciated it as much as i if not more he said with a smile as he gracefully lowered himself into the chair he indulged himself in his passion almost as much as he wanted to selenay laughed sometimes i think he chose you because you are the only herald in valdemar willing to sit and turn pages for himand to take dictation from him and be his hands but he is a most remarkable writer i have copies of all of his books in my personal library in fact she relaxed a little more sitting back hi her chair i fear though i pay far more attention to the drawings and illustrations than i do to his scientific discourse i wont tell him your majesty the young man laughed he does take his hobby quite seriously selenay chuckled im sure he does but what brings you here especially so late at night you could shouldhave given yourself an evening of rest before reporting to me i have a story to tell you your majesty selenay stiffened folding her hands in her lap to hide their sudden trembling shed half expected to hear those words too often the story he had to tell was the dark and deadly result of what he was for some reason he preferred to give his reports as stories it was as if he tried to maintain some kind of fiction that she was innocent of his actions she was not and could never be she gave him orders and the freedom to act she was as culpable as the archer who looses an arrow that she did not always know where it would land made her more responsible not less i thoughton a night like this one in the deeps of winteryou would enjoy this he continued and smiled it is the story of the blue heart your majesty a regional legend of the mountains near white foal pass selenay sighed and relaxed again just a story after all and oddly enough she was suddenly in a mood to hear a story in those mountains the herald continued there is a small and isolated village its population is less than two hundred and most of them make their living from the fine wool of the longhaired goats they raise i know that wool the queen said in surprise very soft and fine and very expensive the herald nodded it is indeed and it is with that wool that the story begins the trader examined the sample of wool cloth with pleasure and delight it was soft as a puff of down warm and light as a purring kitten and a lovely shade of bluegray hed never seen such cloth nor anything of so fine a weave plush was the word hed put to it and he was already calculating his profits he already had a customer in mind a man of wealth and power in military and secular service of sunlord vkandis baron munn who had led his own private household troops against the unbelievers and as a consequence was high in the favor of the son of the sun the baron made no attempt to conceal his fondness for luxuries and he was a good if choosy customer it will be hard to find customers for so unusual a weave but i can take all you have at ten coppers the bolt he said expansively with a condescending smile as if he were doing the rustics a favor but the village headman only shook his head sorrowfully oh trader gencan that giving a mood were not in he said just as condescendingly and sighed its a been a hard year that it has we need so many things so many things or therell be no wool for next year for well have had to eat our goats to stay alive his voice hardened as he bent to the bargaining thirty coppers itll have to be or nothing at all what gencan yelped taken by surprise why that was exactly what hed expected to sell the stuff for these mudfoots werent nearly so green as they looked and neither was his former competitor from whom hed stolenahacquired this trade route perhaps this was why he had not fought to retain it there was nothing worse than a tradesman who knew the value of his goods he bent to the bargaining with a will and sweated until hed brought them down to something reasonable something a man could make a decent profit on sixteen coppers a bolt was one copper more than hed wanted to pay but at least it allowed him a profit margin they had just settled on that price when he happened to look out the window and froze in surprise at what he saw wandering by who is that he gasped wondering if he had somehow stumbled on a creature like one of the fabled hawkbrothers the headman followed his gaze and smiled our lovely butterfly he said with a smile of pure pleasure thats our butterfly shes your daughter then the trader replied unable to take his eyes from the girl but the headman laughed no oh no trader in a way she belongs to the whole village now gencan spared him a sharp glance the village whats that supposed to mean but now the headman frowned just a little the girl drifted out of sight and gencan was able to gather his scattered wits about him again its a strange story trader the headman said at last and not altogether a happy one gencan pursed his lips and nodded sagely well then he replied what say we drink to our bargain and you can tell me her story he signaled to his servant to bring in the wine nothing makes a bitter story more palatable than a good wine he poured the headman a cup of the strong smooth wine then settled in to listen with as good a will as hed bargained leaving his caravan in the charge of his most trusted assistant he rode out that very night pushing hard for karse eight days later he was kneeling forehead to the floor before baron munn the cost of a private audience had been steep but the results of this audience could make him wealthy beyond the income brought by any trade route he would be able to retire and hire others to lead his caravans while he directed them like a great lord with his retainers baron munn sucked at a plum pit and looked down at him out of one halflidded eye the baron was a massive bulky man but his face and limbs showed only the barest hint of the fat of soft living he had been called the bull of the sun and he looked like his namesake in every way down to the expression in his face rise he said at last waving a hand languidly state your business gencan only removed his forehead from the floor so that he could watch the barons expression i thank the great and wise baron munn for granting me an audience he said with every token of humility i am not even worthy to scrape the bottoms of the great ones fine fine the baron interrupted get on with it he selected another fruit and bit into it licking the juice from his fingers i have come to tell you of a young woman great lord gencan said quickly baron munn looked up from his halfeaten peach pale eyes bright with interest she is barely fourteen summers old gencan continued and just coming into the full bloom of womanhood her hair is the white of snow of clearest ice a waterfall of molten silver her eyes are the blue of a clear sky of the finest sapphire her skin is as flawless as cream from the cattle of the temple her face and her form are as perfect as that of a young goddess the baron was truly interested now he licked his lips and set his fruit aside oh he was feigning indifference but gencan had not been a trader all his life without learning how to read people he played his winning card such a lovely creature could only have been created by the sunlord himself gencan continued piously and in the wisdom of the sunlord he has balanced all her virtues by a single defect he has given her the mind and heart of a child of no more than eight years so she is now and so shall she remain all of her life innocent simple trusting and loving she cannot know a lie cannot tell one she cannot understand any but the simplest of commands or do more than care for herself as a child would her needs are those of a child her joys and fears those of a child and she will do anything she is told to do by an adult baron munn straightened in his thronelike chair gencan watched as the light of interest and curiosity in his eyes turned to the flames of desire a desire that turned his strong face into a caricature of himself now he looked even more like a bulla bull scenting a heifer and gencan knew that the whispered rumors he had heard about the baron were true baron munn composed himself after a moment pulling a mask of indifference over his features he stared at gencan as if he were deciding on what he meant to order for dinner but his ragged breathing gave him away tell me where this girl is trader the baron said harshly i will send my people to see if all you have told me is the truth his hand the strong hand that had swung an ax it took two ordinary men to wield clenched on the arm of his chair that ax itself hung behind his chair in a jeweled sheath lest anyone forget what it was that had brought the baron to power if it is true and i may have her you will be rewarded his hand clenched again and gencan blanched remembering how many heads the baron had removed with that ax to the greater glory of the sunlord if you lie he continued i will make you my slave my emasculated deaf and dumb slave gencans mouth was suddenly very dry it is all true great lord i swear it he ran his tongue over his lips and tried to keep from trembling with fear as he was led away to wait in twenty days the spies returned their reports of the girl were even more enthusiastic than the traders baron munn in a fit of joy and generosity rewarded the trader with gold gems and spices from the south spices so rare that gencan had never tasted them and could not resist trying them in his own celebratory feast gencan died that night a rich and happy man never knowing that he had been poisoned by those spices from the south at the barons orders there were other rich powerful men who had the same appetites that the baron had the baron did not intend gencan to increase his profits by selling his knowledge to them as well gencans own people and all the barons spies but one followed the trader into the arms of vkandis guided by his spy the baron led a handpicked company of men out of karse and into the mountain lands disputed by his land and the land of valdemar baron munn did not trust any man to steal this girl for him there was too much chance that she could be sold to another taken away or tampered with the late fall wind had a bite to it here in the mountains it whipped up the canyons and fled crying over the village with a hundred mournful voices circling around the goat pens until the goats added then own plaintive bleats to the winds cries and yet compared to the mountains above the village itself was relatively calm protected by the mountains themselves and the trees that had been planted to shelter it from biting winds the villagers were used to the winds used to the deceptive cries there was no reason to stop work from being done not even a reason for children to stop their games people simply wrapped themselves and then children a little tighter in their coats and narrowed their eyes against the blast it was not even a reason to keep mikhal from taking the older children up onto the slopes for their daily lessons in herbcraft and woodscraft but all work stopped when young deke the watchboy came pounding up the dirt street arms and legs flailing yelling that soldiers were coming fast on horseback and lots of them the headman listened to dekes breathless gasps of warning his mind rolled with shock and confusion soldiers he thought desperately why who would be sending soldiers theres no reason for soldiers to come here theytheytheyre coming from karse deke gasped around his panting and that was not good news soldiers from karse were often no better than bandits as the leader of the village his was the decision he had to do something and quickly it was too late to get the people out of the village hed protect what he could run as fast as you can deke up where the wild apples grow he said tell mikhal to hide the children and you stay with em dont you come back you tell him not to bring the younglings back till he thinks its safe and the soldiers are long gone you tell him to hide good you understand like the time we was looking for him and he didnt want to be found you tell himtell himwe dont want to know where they are he grabbed the boys shoulders and shook him once and dekes eyes got even bigger you understand he said fiercely you understand the boys chin quivered his eyes so big they filled his face he nodded bobbing his head on his thin little neck good the headman let him go now go run deke was off pelting away as fast as he could go fear adding to his speed as he vanished the headman heard the pounding of hooves and turned to see the first of the soldiers riding into the village he stepped out to meet them mikhal was the oldest man in the village no one knew exactly how old he was and he didnt even know himself he was the village teacher and had been for more than forty years not the kind of teacher the priests were in the ways of books and classrooms but in the things a youngling in a mountain village needed the ways of the mountains the wild things and the goats today hed brought the children up here to pick the last of the wild apples making a game of it but making sure they learned as well and not just the acts but the reasons behind them seeing that they took only half the apples on the trees and none at all from the ground telling them how the wild things the ones that stayed awake for the winter would need what they left but that lesson was shattered when deke came pelting up the mountain path mikhal listened carefully to deke and saw the sense in the headmans orders calmly methodically and without any fuss he gathered up the children including the childlike butterfly and led them away down paths only he and the goats knew then down paths only he and the wild things knew only then did he tell them in simple words they could understand why he had hidden them away and why they must stay hidden even the wind shuddered away from the scream a shriek of agony that went on and on forever before it finally died to a sobbing whimper the headmans wife sagged back into the arms that held her firmly erect baron munn handed the hot iron back to the captain of his household cavalry and turned back to the headman four more men held him tightly forcing him to kneel in the dirt but holding his head up by the hair so that he could not avoid watching now the baron said pleasantly tell me where the girl is no more lies no sending my men off on wildgoat chases to look where she isnt i dont know i swear it the headman sobbed desperately i told old mikhal to hide them all and i dont know where he went no one knows no one can know hes gone where only the wild things are please by the gods you must believe me the man wept great racking sobs that shook his body oh i do believe you munn said and smiled but one of these others may know what you dont he waved a hand at the villagers gathered under the swords of his men they winced away so in case there is someone who knows this entertainment jvill go on until i am certain that you are correct and when your dear wife can bear no more i shall choose someone else he signaled to his captain who handed him the iron reheated to whiteness as pleasant a diversion as this is my objective is still the same i want the girl the headmans wife began to scream again before the whitehot iron even touched her hands on her ears the girl crouched on her haunches rocking back and forth she tried to shut out everything words thoughts all they killed headman cracy an his wife last night deke sobbed his voice full of anguish hurt em real bad afore they killed em she knew that shed known that long before deke learned it she could still feel the pain that had sent her to huddle in the back of the cave racked with agony she could not explain deke hugged his skinny arms to his chest pausing now and then to wipe his nose and eyes with the back of his hand they started on my pap and mam this morning deke continued his face screwing up into a mask of grief and bewilderment she knew that too and she knew that dekes momma was only heartbeats from that same darkness that had taken momma cracy and headman cracy why they like that mikhal the boy sobbed finally flinging himself into mikhals arms why they gotta hurt and kill people we never done nothin why they gotta hurt my mam and pap mikhal pulled the boy to him holding him close to his chest in a sheltering embrace while the boy sobbed mikhal cursed under his breath the girl knew why mikhal cursed himself for sending deke to spy on the village mikhal thought he should have gone himself its cause theyre bad deke mikhal murmured between curses its cause they want what we got an just cause they life to hurt folks an thiss a good excuse to make somebody hurt none of its our doin deke none of it the old man kept his voice high enough for the other children to hear he was a teacher even in the midst terror he would teach aint none of it our fault he said and the girl felt his eyes probing the darkness looking for her we just gotta get through this an make sure it dont happen again they hurled momma cracy an poppa cracy hurted em an kilt em the girls thoughts were filled with confusion terror and anguish they hurted em but its cause they want me they gonna hurt dekes momma an poppa they gonna hurt everybody till they get me she rocked back and forth tears burning down her cheeks trying to work out reasons and answers but there were no reasons and she had never hi her life touched minds like these mikhal was right mikhal was right but these horrible people wanted her these people were all her family every adult was her momma and poppa every youngling a brother or sister they all loved her and she loved them all it was all she had ever known that love that cherishing theyre getting hurted an its cause of me she buried her face in her arms and faced the inescapable ifif i go to em they might hurt me if i dont they gonna hurt everybody an maybe kilt em too her traumatized mind kept trying to resolve the questions and finally she groped her way through the fog to an answer and a decision she loved them they loved her they were being hurt because of her she could not bear that and there was only one way to stop the hurt she slipped away as quietly as a mouse running down to the village to make the bad men stop baron munn stared at the lovely girl completely enthralled she was more beautiful than he dreamed more vulnerable and tender and her terror only served to make her lovelier in his eyes that terror fed the hunger within him in a way that even the dying pain of her elders had not done she was perfect in every way she cowered at his feet where she had thrown herself weeping placing herself between him and the woman he had been torturing trying to hold him off with her soft little hands hands like fluttering doves like white butterflies he took her face in his hands carefully and raised her eyes to his even weeping could not make her less than lovely her eyes were as blue as the sky in winter as a bottomless lake the eyes are said to be the vision of the heart and your heart is a heavenly blue he said running a hand over her molten silver hair what is your name little dove pppilane she choked out silver tears coursing sweetly down her cheeks he smiled he ordered the villagers to make a cage in which he would carry her back to karse he ordered it carved and painted and lined in layers of the villages fine wool to keep her warm and sheltered and safe he had captured the butterfly now he would bring his prize his pilane back to his barony for all to see see and lust after but never to touch only he would savor that touch at his leisure and savor what came after touching the villagers made his cage in a day and a night all of them laboring until they dropped from exhaustion he left as soon as it was completed under cover of the first snow of winter he headed for white foal pass at a forced march driving his own men as hard as he had driven the villagers he wanted the journey to karse to safehaven to be as quick as possible behind him the remaining villagers could only gather to mourn their dead and to pray to the gods for their special daughter they held no illusions about what was to befall her her beauty would serve to enchant him only for so longand when it palled he would feed his desires in other ways they prayed then for something someone to send her quick releasethrough rescue or painless death when the stranger rode into the village it seemed that their prayers had been answered and a rumor that he was the messenger of the gods went through the village on the wings of the wind he certainly looked anything but human riding a tall handsome white horse with strange knowledgefilled blue eyes and he himself was garbed in pristine white his face heartstoppingly handsome beneath silverstreaked hair but most startling of all were his silver eyes as filled with knowledge sorrow and understanding as those of his steed what else could he be and even though he protested otherwise they knew he was goddesssent he listened carefully to their story with a troubled and angry face i can stop them he said in a clear edged voice as sweet as springwater and as sharp as a blade of ice i can stop them but the danger is great and there is a chance that your pilane will not survive better that than a life as that mans toy mikhal snarled bitterly her life will be short enough in any case in his hands behind him the rest of the villagers nodded or spoke their agreement some wept but all agreed baron munns actions had left them no illusions go to white foal pass then as soon as the snow stops the stranger told them and then he rode away that night the light snow turned into a full winter storm a blizzard the likes of which no one not even mikhal had ever seen snow fell so thickly and heavily that it was a struggle just to get from house to house within the village then it became too cold to snow the wind strengthened and whipped the snow already fallen into huge drifts the cold grew deeper and deeper the blizzard lasted until moonrise the next night then died at first light the villagers put on their snowstaves loaded up their sleds and followed old mikhal along the goattracks to the pass they found the barons soldiers and horses frozen as if they had been struck down by a cold more deadly than any man could imagine and all in a single moment they found the baron with his hands frozen to the bars of the locked cage his dead eyes staring into it as if he had seen something he could not understand but pilane was gone without a trace they never found her the queen wiped her tears away and waited for her herald to say something more but as he sipped his tea she shook her head is that all she demanded just that a mystery there is a little more the herald said putting down his own cup one version of the story tells that the messenger took their prayers to the goddess and it was she who made the storm and took the girl to her side another says that the man was only a man but also a great and powerful mage who used his magic to bring the storm and save the girl and that he took her to his palace to live in peace the last version says also that the man was a mage but that he was heartfriends with the strange and mysterious tayledrasthat he begged their help and it was they who sent the storm and took the girl to their homes above the trees where she was loved protected and happy for the rest of her days tayledras the queen replied and she wondered did elspeth know of this legend she was with the tayledras even now did she know the real ending to the story the one thing that all three legends agree upon the herald continued is that whether it was a goddess a mage or the tayledras whoever took pilane created a butterfly to take her place and remind those who loved her of her beauty her goodness and her own sacrifice to save them they call it the blue heart and it is a butterfly they say that lives only in early winter after the first snow and only during the full moon and they say this was done so that the memory of pilane and all she was would never be lost to the mountains he sighed and was quiet for a few heartbeats and that ends my story your majesty he said at last its a lovely story selenay replied lost in thought for a moment then something occurred to her and she sat straight up in her chair the girls nameit was pilane and thats your companions name the herald grinned a little shamefacedly it means butterfly in a very old mountain dialect he chuckled which may be the reason why he has made himself into an expert on the little creatures but selenay had another reason for laughter you mean that he had you two out in the snows of the mountains chasing a legend she laughed a butterflythat is only a legendout in snow and moonlightin white foal pass when she finished tears of laughter were bright hi her eyes and she was holding her side youthe most dangerous man in the circlechasing snowbutterflies in the moonlight he hung his head sheepishly i am afraid so majesty he replied and with your leave i really must go the queen waved her answer weakly from her chair laughing soundlessly as he stood and turned to leave the herald placed a small package on the table beside her cup a gift your majesty he said then he was gone the door closing behind him after several moments the queen wiped her eyes and got herself back under control she picked up the package curiosity overcoming her laughter the heralds gifts were rare but fortunately were seldom as sinister as his stories could be inside a wrapping of soft gray woolen cloth she found a carved wooden presentation case for a handsized book a case she opened with the key taken from the ribbon tied around it in the right side was a blackvelvetlined recess containing a thin book in raised silver letters on the elegant white leather cover were the words the blue heart and beneath them c pilane in the left side of the box was a glasscovered velvetlined display case positioned carefully on the black velvet was a butterfly each wing was no larger than her two thumbnails together the wings were the color of molten silver with an oblong blue spot on either side of the creatures slender body those marks when seen with the wings fully opened as they were displayed made the shape of a heart a heart as blue as a companions eyes or the color of the clear winter sky
