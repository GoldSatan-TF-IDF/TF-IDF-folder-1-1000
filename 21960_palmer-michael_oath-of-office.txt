michael palmer oath of office prologue im finished i cant believe this has happened again i just blew up at one of my patients the last time when i screamed at calvin summers for continuing to smoke despite a massive heart attack my medical license was suspended for six months and i had to go away for treatment the board of medicine said there was no excuse for that kind of behavior from a doctor no matter how pure my motives now its roberta jennings she just stormed out shouting at me that she was not going to tolerate that kind of abuse and that she was going to contact the board as soon as she got home my office staff heard her the patients in the waiting room heard her what am i going to do im alone on the wall beautifully matted and framed by carolyn is the signed hippocratic oathmy oath of office pledging kindness and compassion to all my patients what in the hell have i done jenningss tires just screeched on the pavement as she sped out of the parking lot i can picture her at the wheel her face all flushed and angry the door to the hallway is closed i cant simply sit here like a lamb waiting to be dragged to the slaughter especially when i didnt do anything that wrong i love my patients but theres not a chance in the world the board of medicine would understand that they wont care that roberta jennings is eating herself to death hypertension type diabetes ankle edema varicose veins arthritic knees hiatal hernia carbon dioxide narcosis they wont know how many times i begged her to changehow many diets how many referrals how many discussions they wont see that i had every right to scream at her the way i did they wont care that i have been at work for hours seeing my patients in the hospital which no other docs even do attending medical rounds doing paperwork i havent even had lunch i have to do something to save myselfto save my career i gaze at two pictures of my family on the corner of my desk my favorite is the one taken in springtimecarolyn and our three daughters huddled together on our front porch swing the girls are ravenhaired beauties just like their mother the milkmans kids id often half joke because they didnt look much like me the other picture is of chloe my youngest i know im not supposed to have a favorite child so it feels horrible to admit to myself that i do must do something everything ive worked so hard for is in danger my breathing is coming hardshallow and more rapid its like im trying to suck in molasses i know exactly whats going on inside me chemical signals from the amygdala area of my brain are instructing my heart to beat faster adrenaline is being pumped into my bloodstream like rocket fuel witnesses everyone out there is a witness to what happened they will all be called before the board that would be the end a lamb to the slaughter i must do something to prevent them i dont remember unlocking my desk drawer and bringing out my pistol its still in the locked box i put it in when joe perrys office was held up last year now its here in my hand i release the safety everyone out there in the waiting room will testify as to what they heard and thats all it will take to finish me off nobody cares about my patients the way that i do cant believe this happened what choices do i have how else can i save my career my family people heard it would be their word against mine he saidthey said the board would never pull a doctors license on a flimsy claim like thatespecially one as dedicated to his patients as i am or would they must do whats fair no witnesses i open my office door and step out into the hallway the fluorescent overhead lights are hurting my eyes with the pistol hanging at my side i head down the corridor into our newly furnished patient waiting area my heart is pounding against my sternum blood is churning in my ears the room has begun to spin i wish there were another way two women are in the waiting areamargaret dempsey and allison roundtree they both look restless disturbed by what they heard i wonder if they were talking about just leavingdeserting my practice and transferring their records to another doctorprobably to my partner carl sunlight in the foyer is illuminating dust motes circling in the air small details yet so clear i doublecheck that ive got two additional clips tucked inside the pocket of my white coat no witnesses i cry out ashley is sitting behind the reception counter looking distressed the new nurse crystal is behind her ashley is thirty two kids her glasses hang over her breasts suspended by a gold lanyard that sparkles against her tightfitting black sweater details there is no other way i need to protect my career for a moment i feel uncertain confused then my resolve returns must act before they see the gun i raise it in front of me im doing this for us carolyn its the only way to save the childrento save you and our way of life any doctor threatened like i am would handle things the same way the first shot explodes in my ears the gun recoils i fire again and again and again there is blood everywhere glass shatters ashley looks up at me wideeyed i shoot her in the forehead she flies backwards and lands on top of crystal i feel calm now in control im a doctor and i always will be i begged her to lose weight i had every right to yell at her in fact i didnt even really yelljust raised my voice a little i walk with determination back down the hallway and turn toward our tiny kitchen teresa and camille are there they were undoubtedly discussing what to do about me when they heard the shots now they are on their feet screaming no witnesses i shout again and again no witnesses my office manager tries to speak but i cant make out what shes saying my finger tightens then loosens then tightens again the pistol spits fire teresa is hit in the throat camille in the chest the women crumble like rag dolls camille tries to get up a shot to the back of her head settles her down i replace the clip almost done back to the hall carl franklin is in his office he may not have heard what went on with roberta but maybe he did carl was never much of a doctor to begin with hell probably be ecstatic when they pull my license and tell him to take over my patients because im never going to be allowed to be a doctor again his office door swings open just as i arrive two feet separate us i can smell his fear for a moment i hesitate i cant get my brain around things my thoughts are without focus is he going to be a witness or isnt he john what in the hell carl cries i empty the entire clip into his chest and face his blood splatters over me fragments of his bone cut into my skin i want to tell him its all roberta jenningss fault but its too late i slump against the wall breathing heavily they never would have understood they never would have cared how much being a doctor meant to me all at once i stop my god ive done something very bad now the board of medicine will be hardpressed to let me keep my license at all ive made a terrible mess of everything i replace the clip a final time then i close my eyes and press the muzzle of the gun to the side of my temple i picture chloe in my mind im going to miss her most of all wondering how it all unraveled so quickly i pull the trigger chapter one hour down three hours to go the afternoon was turning out just as lou had hoped it would enough traffic through the er to keep things from being boring for emily but nothing that would leave her with a lifetime of nightmares and therapy bills not that the teen wouldnt be able to handle just about anything that came down the pike but in an inner city emergency roomeven a small satellite facility like the eisenhower memorial hospital annex the pike on occasion might be carrying violence of the highest order okay em mr schultz is being a perfect patient ten stitches and not a peep out of him two more and well get him bandaged up and home thank you doc the man beneath the saucershaped light said in a raspy voice that could have cut stone i didnt feel a thing your dad does great work miss thank you i know emily replied he loves sewing my jeans when they tear and he was always stitching up my stuffed animals even when they werent ripped my sons school has take your kid to work day just like yours schultz said but im a roofer three stories up with the wind blowing doesnt seem like a great place for a nineyearold so marky went to the nursing home with my wife and helped her put the trays together what does your mom do miss my names emily mr schultz she reminded him emily welcome my moms a psychologist mostly couples therapy she didnt think her patients would enjoy having her thirteenyearold kid sitting in on their sessions i can see why she might feel that way but for a second choice lou said tying off the final stitch i believe mom might have chosen to send emily up on the roof with you rather than into this place in fact the first argument he and renee had gotten into in months was about her belief that there had to be a rule against bringing a doctors family member into an emergency roomeven one with only three nurses a licensed nurses aide an armed security guard a receptionist one er resident and one boardcertified emergency specialist the annex essentially served as a walkin center to reduce the volume of the massive mother ship just six blocks away let me send her into the office with steve renee had pleaded steves not her father i am besides how interesting could it be for her to hang out surrounded by a bunch of starched shirts and musty law tomes i can hear her now reporting to her class i spent my day with my mothers new husband steve watching him making piles of money off a bunch of unfortunates who are suing a bunch of other unfortunates or you might as well send her to my brothers office graham does even better at making money than steve plus it might actually give him something to talk to me about besides my lack of a k even though lou had ultimately won that round he had to admit that as usual renee had a point and he had told her so when he apologized for sounding like a jerk for whatever reason he had been feeling sorry for himself on the day the forms were due back to the carlisle school and despite some misgivings of his own about exposing em to the raw underbelly of dc he had decided to turn take your student to work day into little bighorn two hours and thirtyfive minutes to go so far so good despite a steady stream of patients gerhard schultz was about as challenging a trauma case as the eisenhower annex typically saw lou missed the action in the main er but in his past life he had squirreled away enough action points to star in a video game for now parttime shifts at the old annex would do just fine not surprisingly the patients and the staff loved emily to pieces there was a grace and composure surrounding her that won people over almost as quickly as did her dark unassuming beauty thirteen going on thirty people loved to say that about their kidsespecially their daughters but the old saw though true in emilys case invariably brought lou a pang it was hard not to believe that in many ways he had robbed those seventeen years from her okay mr schultz he said one of the nurses will be in to dress your arm in just a few minutes no work until next monday if you need a note the nurse will put one together and ill sign it last tetanus shot a year or so ago i um tend to bump into sharp things sharp rusty things lou corrected well give you a woundcare sheet your dads a good man the roofer said again i been around a lot of doctors i can tell ive been around a lot of fathers and i can tell too emily said lou wouldnt have been surprised if her smile had healed schultzs nasty gash then and there in addition to curing any illness that might have been lurking inside him looking utterly perfect in her sky blue scrubs she walked back to the doctors lounge shoulder to shoulder with her father well that was fun she said when he had settled her in on the sofa around a cup of hot chocolate from the keurig machine you think you might like to be a doctor lou asked remembering that he could have answered that question in the affirmative when he was four i suppose anythings possible you and mom are certainly good role models shes a terrific shrink its hard for you isnt it whats hard lou asked knowing perfectly well what she was talking about the divorce it wasnt what i wanted if thats what you mean people get remarried to their exes it happens on tv all the time em mom is remarried you got that bucko add me to the mix and you get a sitcom that would compete with modern family emily chewed on her lip and picked at a fingernail im glad you won out and brought me in with you today she said finally i didnt win anything its take your kid to work day and youre my kid you always were and you always will be lou crossed to the door and glanced over at the two new arrivals in the waiting rooma latina woman and the extremely ancient man he assumed was her father the fellows color was poor and he was working for each breath check an ohtwo sat on him roz he said to the nurse and have gordon start going over him right away thanks im glad you feel that way emily was saying what would you say if i told you i was losing interest in school lou narrowly missed spraying out his coffee youre like tops in your class you get all as im looking out the window and daydreaming a lot that cant be anyones idea of an education you dont go to school to get an education emily immediately perked up what do you mean call it welcomes law you go to school for the degree anything you learn while youre there is gravy her eyes were sparkling now go on every single day that you manage to stay in school translates into ten thousand people in the world that you wont have to take bs from in your life the more degrees you have the fewer little smallminded people there will be who have big power over you i stayed in school long enough to get an md degree now nobody can boss me around what about dr filstrup at the physician wellness office lou groaned in terms of insight and verbal sparring emily was her mothers daughter so much for welcomes law lous affiliation with the pwo went back nine yearsto the day when his medical license was suspended for selfprescribing amphetamines he had always been a heavierthanaverage drinker but speed which he took to handle the sleepdeprivation of working two moonlighting jobs quickly brought him to his knees enter the pwo an organization devoted to helping doctors with mental illness physical illness substance abuse and behavioral problems the pwo director arranged for an immediate admission to a rehab facility in georgia and kept in close contact with lous caseworkers and counselors until his discharge six months later after that a pwo monitor met with him weekly then monthly and supervised his recovery and urine screens for alcohol and other drugs of abuse after a spotless year his license was restored and he returned to work at eisenhower memorial three years after that he was hired as the second of two pwo monitors for the next year things went perfectly then walter filstrup was brought in by the pwo board to head up the program you know bucko lou said to his daughter sometimes youre too smart for your own good although he seldom went out of his way to discuss his job frustrations with his child neither was lou ever one to measure his words and the kid was a sponge all right he said consider my current position with pwo the exception that proves the law now lets get out there and see some patients you ready to stay in school emily cocked her head thoughtfully for the moment she said thats all i can ask for so lets not fall behind in the er business you never know when somethings going to come out of left field and slam you against the wall chapter with a nurse the licensed nurses aide and the resident busy with the old man in one of the back examining rooms lou handled an ear infection in a toddler an upper respiratory virus in an elderly woman and a cracked finger bone in a fifteenyearold high school shortstop who was dangerously close to losing an entire limb if he didnt stop leering at the doctors daughter sixty minutes to go it may have been a case of doing the right thing for the wrong reason but take your kid to work day was proving to be a total success the nurse clinician a newlywed named barbara waldman appeared behind a wheelchair at the door to the treatment room the man in the chair was someone lou knew wella sixtytwoyearold who lived in various doorways near the annex desmond lou exclaimed helping the man onto the examining table and out of his tattered air force jacket that gang again desmond carter dabbed at his bleeding nostrils with a rag and nodded for most of the homeless in the area being beaten for sport by any of several gangs who roamed the neighborhood was routine usually though the attacks occurred at night desmond though black was known for playing irish tunes on a battered pennywhistle when the music business was slow he cashed in bottles a vietnam vet he was rail thin but with eyes that never betrayed the hardship of his life today his face was swollen and bruised with a split lip and the bloody nose his oily trousers were shredded at the knees revealing deep abrasions one shoe was missing good to see you dr lou desmond said sorry this keeps happening my friend want us to send for the police aint worth it just some bandages and fix my nose if its broken how you been doing fine still at the gym when i have time a little sparring some training when one of the upandcomers asks for it listen we got to get you undressed and cleaned up then well check you over and get an xray of your nose and any other part that needs it desmond that gorgeous young woman over there is my daughter emily shes here helping us out for the day ms emily desmond said nodding and managing a weak toothless grin its fine with me if you want to stay lou considered the situation and shook his head yeah emily said you walk around your apartment all the time in your boxers had barbara waldman been chewing gum she would have swallowed it you have your hands full with that one dr welcome she managed listen em lou said i dont think so why dont you wait in the lounge until we get desmond taken care of he missed his daughters glare as she left the room nurse and doc gently stripped the vet down and helped him into a pair of disposable scrub pants and a johnny he had absorbed a pounding but it was hardly the first time his abdominal wall was a road map of scarsthe result of wounds lou had learned that had led to two purple hearts lou clenched his jaw he had encountered more than enough violence and depravity to have developed something of an immunity but in truth he knew he would never be inuredespecially when the victim was a guy like desmond carter he was preparing to examine the man when he heard the soft clearing of a throat from the doorway emily was standing there hands on her hips looking incredibly like her mother dad you know how much i hate being treated like a baby she said ive seen street people before and black people and even hurt people its okay for me to watchi promise you youre not protecting me from anything lou looked up at the ceiling and then the wallanyplace but at his daughters wonderful face he had been outmatched by her from the day she was born besides exposing her to desmond carter this way seemed right still it was probably something he should discuss with renee he envisioned his ex after the fact arms folded tapping her foot in exasperation and heard her reminding him that she did in fact have a cell phone better to ask forgiveness than permission he decided barbara does desmond have a record of an hiv test negative test drawn here four months ago she said em you can come in he heard himself say but stand over there by the wall barbara how about getting her into double gloves and a gown might as well give her a face shield as well swimming in her gown and looking like a teenager from outer space emily inched forward and watched as lou packed both desmonds nostrils and explained what he was searching for in each segment of his physical exam he could see her eyes widen at the mans scars desmond are you sure about no police lou asked next time maybe i got a caseworker ill tell her sure barbara lou said turning to the nurse how about ordering a chest film and nasal bones maybe get a cbc as well then well do whatever we have to to fix that schnoz okay then im going to stop in the back and see if gordo and roz are all right with that poor old man i think theyre going to transfer him no problem lou said moments later the receptionist appeared at the doorway dr welcome theres a dr filstrup on the line for youhe says its urgent lou suppressed a smile an urgent call from walter filstrup that had to be an absolute first he probably wanted lou to pick up some tuna on his way home and drop it off at the office largely because of the documented strength of his recovery and the way he related to clients lou was well regarded by the pwo board but he was hardly ready to take over as director and the truth was there were few beside filstrup who seemed interested in the job from day one he and filstrup were like a cobra and a mongooseactually more like a cobra and a baby goose the wellness office was a small one as physician health programs went leaving the opinionated bombastic therapist with only a couple of minions to boss around chief among them lou em lou said barbara will be right back linda please patch dr filstrup over to the doctors lounge ill talk to him there the phone was ringing as lou entered the lounge welcome its me lou cringed at the sound of his bosss voice im a little busy right welcome listen youve really blown it this time i left the seat up in the office mens room youre not funny in fact youre never funny walter what is this all about its about your darling client john meacham the man whose license you singlehandedly got restored hes a terrific guy and a terrific doc i had coffee with him the day before yesterday hes doing fine well today he shot seven people to death in his office and then turned the gun on himself lou sank onto the arm of the worn leather sofa unable to take in a breath if youre messing with me walter he managed finally i swear im going to hang you by your thumbs turn on the news any news you sure its our client your client in case you forget i never thought he was too tightly wrapped and i told you that on more than one occasion i kept pushing to get rid of that touchyfeely social worker therapist you were using and to get him to a psychiatrist but no walter stop it this isnt the time tell me again john killed seven people in his office and then killed himself not exactly theyre all dead he isnt where did they take him deland regional as soon as i can get relief here im going out there i cant believe this believe it and believe something else too all those supporters you have on the board may not be so supporting after this rather than make a disastrous situation even worse lou set down the receiver surprised when his legs held him up he stepped numbly into the hallway headed back to emily ahead of him facing into the treatment room her arms folded severely across her chest her magnificent profile as motionless as marble was renee lou moved in next to her barbara waldman had clearly not yet returned and emily was alone in the room with desmond carter she had moved to the mans bedside and was holding his hand renees disapproving expression would live forever in the take your child to work hall of fame at that moment emily looked up mom she cried with unbridled glee guess what im going to be a doctor chapter the first lady of the united states darlene mallory snapped her flip phone closed and glanced over her shoulder at her chief of staff seated directly behind her that look was more than enough for kim hajjar to know what had transpired hes not coming is he kim said leaning forward and whispering in darlenes ear no hes not try to look happy you mean as opposed to looking like i want to wring your husbands presidential neck strictly for any paparazzi who might be watching darlene forced a smile and nodded im getting tired of this kim i know hon i know last week he announced his intention to begin his reelection campaign no surprise to anyone except me he never even spoke to me about it kim hugged her friend it had been six years since she had agreed to join her former kansas state roommate then senator martin mallorys wife in washington during that time the two women had grown closer than ever the press cared little about first lady appointments but what coverage they devoted to hajjar never failed to mention that she was the first lebanese white house chief of staff and that she was a former beauty queen they seldom touched on her masters degree in sociology with cameras watching darlenes every move having an aide with whom she could communicate almost telepathically had proved invaluable well i suppose id better push on with this darlene said sighing does martin know how much press is here covering this event i believe thats why hes not coming the kids are going to be so disappointed the director says theyve worked really hard on their song ill schedule them to sing at the rose garden next week when you and martin are welcoming the president of ireland do you think martin will be upset if we do that i dont think hell care in fact he may blow off president callaghan the way he did these kids the position sounds important but in ireland its largely ceremonial still callaghan being a woman martin may not want to withstand the flak of standing her up darlene smiled even though her insides were knotted up what would i do without you hajjar put yourself in for a raise thats just what i need to do i can see the headlines now economy descending deeper into dumper first lady celebrates by raising staff pay okay no raise ill think of something though well the directors got a whatarewewaitingfor expression i suppose i need to move on youll be great as usual darlene stood smoothed her skirt and gave the press corps her a smile she had chosen a baby blue suit for the ribboncutting ceremony which was in celebration of the grand opening of dcs new boys amp girls club the suit had cost at macys and it sold out from every department store the first day she had worn it in public thanks largely to kims tutelage she now knew what colors best flattered her fair complexion light brown hair and hazel eyes her brief speech would focus on her two favorite topicsraising her daughter lisa now a sophomore at yale and working as first a pediatrician and then the presidents wife to improve the nutrition of all citizens of the world especially children unlike some first ladies who embraced the guilty pleasure of fashion darlene did not and whenever the cameras werent rolling she favored the dungarees and plaid work shirts that were the mainstay of her wardrobe at k state once a farmer always a farmer she had been oft quoted regarding her background as a wheat farmers daughter to the left of the two rows of folding chairs where they were sitting a broad blue ribbon stretched diagonally across the glass doors of the gleaming new building fluttered gently in the breeze the young peoples chorus stood off to one side on metal risers waiting patiently to sing their song the face of the waters kim had researched the piece and passed on the information that it was about creation it was a fitting anthem thought darlene considering that once again she needed to create an explanation for president mallorys absence politics aside his recently unpredictable behavior concerned her the way it would any loving and devoted wife martins nosedive in the popularity polls was one of the most historic drops in presidential history but before the economy tanked he had touted this particular boys amp girls club as a symbol of americas renewed community spirit and a shining example of the effectiveness of his controversial domestic spending policies now with the countrys fortunes in free fall the costly modern steel and glass structure might well become a symbol of his administrations fiscal excesses darlene crossed to the lectern and spoke to the crowd of several hundred im afraid i have just received a call from my husband he is tied up in an emergency meeting and regrettably will not be able to attend this magnificent grand opening however he is making arrangements for the young peoples is he scared to show his face in public through the glare of the afternoon sun darlene could not see the face of the man heckling her but he was certainly close by too close kim must have sensed darlenes concern because she immediately went into attack mode and began scouring the crowd for the potentially dangerous protester the large secret service contingent did the same meanwhile darlene continued with her address the president wanted me to let you know the heckler wasnt finished whats next he called out will our tax dollars buy a new football stadium for the skins by this time kim had spotted the man and alerted secret service agents to his location the agents acted quickly to cull the protester from the crowd darlene was used to hecklers although their numbers seemed to be increasing at every one of her appearances it made her sad that the outburst may have eclipsed the real story of the day which was the children perhaps it would turn out for the best that the president had chosen to stay home immersed in a forest of angry pickets most of the antimallory protesters that day were kept at bay behind a sawhorse barrier set up across the parking lot darlene estimated their number might be half as many as those attending the ceremony in addition signs with unflattering epithets for the president and his administration were nailed to nearly every tree in the area the kids were getting a serious lesson in civics american style undeterred darlene smiled and was about to start speaking again when she felt a tiny tap on her right arm she looked down into the wide tearfilled eyes of a boy no more than seven or eight the child was dressed splendidly in a green and blue striped tie and vneck pullover sweater please he said i promised my mommy and daddy the president would be here please darlene laid a hand on his tiny shoulder and swallowed at the orangesized lump in her throat kim immediately sized up the situation and led the child back to his parents listen kim said when she had returned how about if i cover for you and you try again to get him down here its only like a fiveminute drive and the motorcade is probably still standing by darlene smiled at her friend did you just read my mind no i read your eyesprobably the easiest thing ill have to do all day do you need my talking points darlene i might not spend my free time dissecting every global conflict like some first lady that i know but trust me i could give this speech in my sleep for now ill just stall themmaybe do a little softshoe darlene stepped back to the microphone introduced kim and then excused herself from the platform stage a few feet away she stopped at a relatively secluded area and with secret service agents keeping close watch called her husband for the second time darlene what is it is everything all right martin sounded genuinely worried probably fearing that the protesters had turned violent everything here is fine marty darlene said in fact its better than fine its really something special except youre not here and you should be is that why youre calling me darlene heard the anger in her husbands voice he had never had much of a temper but lately outbursts to one degree or another had been coming more and more frequently at the podium kim was entertaining the crowd with stock humorous stories about darlenes college days look i know youre concerned about the polls honey darlene said to martin but you need to stand up for what you believe polls dont mean a thing polls didnt get you reelected people did and these people care about you martin breathed heavily into the phone darlene what the hell is wrong with you are you blind darlenes pulse accelerated the way it did in the moments before they fought she felt defensive and was surprised at how quickly her husband had angered please dont speak to me that way martin she said in a harsh whisper agent siliphant radioed me i know how many protesters are there do you think i want to come just to get shouted down by an angry mob do you know what my approval rating is right now do you marty i thirtyeight down in less than a year from sixty please martin do this for the children you better have made a good excuse for why it is im not there darlene i dont want to hear on the news tonight that president mallory is a coward or doesnt give a shit about needy kids that club wouldnt exist except for my initiative there was a click and the line went dead darlene stood shaking breathing deeply to calm herself at the podium the mayor had taken over and was regaling the crowd with a story about his childhood on the harrowing streets of dc kim appeared by her side let me guess she said it didnt go well darlenes hands were still shaking im really worried about him she said it was never like martin to behave this way hes never run from a fight in his life what do you think we should do kim answered with an impish grin i say once were done here weve got two choices for what we should do next and those would be either we go shopping or we go get a drink chapter fighting to control his speed and to maintain at least a modicum of concentration lou made the thirtymile drive from dc to deland regional in forty minutes he hadnt bothered to change out of his scrubs over the years like most people with a television he had sat riveted to the set countless times watching reports of pathetic souls who had for whatever reason lost it and gone postalmurdering at random in most cases the explanation for the carnage remained a mystery cloaked in the catchall of crazy after a short stay as the lead the stories inevitably slipped from the news the killers who didnt take their own lives or werent shot to bits by the police vanished to prison someplace or into an asylum to everyone aside from their shattered families and the shattered families of their victims the memory of them vanished like april snow lou could not recall the name of even one of the killers no matter how many lives they had taken but this killer was different this killer was john meachamfor nearly four years his client and more recently his friend flipping the tuner on the radio of his toyota he checked in on a series of stations the story was front and center on many of them and a bulletin on most of the rest within fifteen minutes there was nothing new and lou settled back on fm the allnews station meacham a fiftytwoyearold internal medicine specialist had been practicing in kings ridge for three years his partner sixtytwoyearold carl franklin was one of the seven victims at this moment meacham is listed in critical condition at deland regional hospital police speculate that the recoil of his pistol jerked his shot off line enough to keep it from being immediately fatal they report that all seven victims were pronounced dead at the scene of the carnage meachams medical office on steward street in the kings ridge medical park only one of the victims a female whose name is still being withheld survived long enough to say anything to authorities a source in the department has told reporters that all she said before she died was no witnesses no witnesses lou shrugged and shook his head seven dead and one life hanging by a strand no witnesses what in the hell does that mean emily had gone home with renee and the chief of the er department at eisenhower had rushed over to finish out lous shift the severe weather which had been on and off stormy all day was on againfog wind and a chilly pelting rain from what lou knew kings ridge population maybe ten or fifteen thousand was a bedroom community for dc surrounded by expansive farms mostly corn he had driven through it a couple of times and remembered the downtown as being fairly affluent and well maintained with a quaint village green coffee shops and restaurants spaced along on the main street deland regional a few miles west of the town was a leveltwo trauma center which meant that orthopedics neurosurgery and plastics were covered although not necessarily in house all the time according to the news john meacham had survived a gunshot wound to the right temple under usual circumstances patients with such an injury would have been transported by chopper to the nearest levelone facility in this case eisenhower memorial itself perhaps a neurosurgeon was available at deland lou speculated and didnt want to lose a juicy case or perhaps the weather was too chancy poor goddamn meacham what in the hell happened out there john meacham was tightly wound but not this tightly wound in fact he had a betterthandecent recovery program and had mellowed considerably word was bound to get out that he had been attending alcoholics anonymous meetings for four years and a few hundred alcoholics and drug addicts in need of the program would decide that they were better off going it on their own any excuse in a storm meacham was one of the first docs lou had been assigned after he went to work parttime as the assistant to the director of physician wellness a father of three and a history buff the internist was a lifelong virginian working in dc at the time he played bluegrass on several instruments and could take his motorcycle apart and put it back together the only two drawbacks in his life were his temper and alcohol the day he exploded at one of his patients for continuing to smoke following a coronary meacham admitted to lou that he had a ferocious hangover after drinking the night before the result of his outburst was a report by his patient to the board a sixmonth suspension and a referral to the pwo lou ordered an immediate psych evaluation and sent meacham away for a month of rehab and anger management as soon as he was discharged home lou signed him to a legally binding monitoring agreementrandom urine testing twice weekly regular psychological therapy frequent facetoface sessions with lou and involvement with aa what could go wrong much to his chagrin and that of his dentist sid moskowitz lou was a teeth clencher and grinder moskowitz had been pushing forever for some kind of mouth guard but even in the ring lou could barely handle an appliance jamming up against his gag centers like two stalks of rubber celery he could kick the grinding habit he insisted even as moskowitz was totaling up the cost of the crowns he would soon be installing he could kick the habit just as he had kicked the drugs but not today with the wipers slapping steadily lou turned into the crowded physician parking lot of deland regional four cruisers strobes flashing were parked near the er entrance twentyfive yards away was a phalanx of sound trucks lou estimated that the glassandredbrick threestory hospital had a capacity of somewhere between and beds it had a decent reputation from what little he knew although he had no firsthand experience with the place before he made it to the elevator and up to the secondfloor icu lous credentials were checked three times there were two uniformed copsa woman and a manposted outside the unit and another man a broadshouldered african american in plainclothes whom lou guessed might regularly rehearse his air of authority in front of a mirror no ones allowed in there the man said performing a heavylidded inspection of the new arrival im a doctor sos the guy in there who just killed seven people nice comeback how about if i said i was a close friend of his id lou passed over his drivers license and walletsized medical license neither of these say im a close friend of his i left that one at home i can be a wiseass because im in charge the detective said you cant because youre not and the head nurse left word that no one is to be let in until she says so theyre going after the bullet in your close friends head theyre what incredulous that they were going after the bullet in the icu and not the operating room lou stared across at the man who looked perfectly serious not possible lou was thinking even in the most ragtag leveltwo trauma center imaginable no one would be fishing for a bullet while inside the icu generally what remained of the slug were fragments and more often than not the brain trauma caused by trying to remove them wasnt worth the benefits but no matter what any procedure whether an exploration or a decompression maneuver to reduce swelling would be performed in the operating room going after the bullet lou said of course just like they do all the time in the movies usually thats when i snatch up my popcorn and leave too gross too absurd the remark appeared to have sailed over the cops head what kind of doc are you anyway he asked emergency i work at eisenhower memorial in the city whos going after the bullet i have no idea i dont live around here im state police we were called in to take over for the locals lou was about to grill the man for information when the glass doors to the unit glided apart and a trim olivecomplexioned woman in scrubs emerged tension was etched across her face it took only a second for lou to recognize her sara sara turnbull and he went way backalmost to the beginning of lous residency when he was razor sharp thrilled to be having his dreams come true and enthusiastic as the energizer bunnyback to before his fathers financial implosion and lous subsequent moonlighting jobs and the extra shifts and the utter exhaustion back to before the unstoppable downward spiral and the amphetamines and the visits from the drugenforcement people god am i glad to see you turnbull said when they called from downstairs to say you were on the way up i nearly jumped through the phone theyre killing him in there lou i dont care what hes done its not our job to judge chapter okay if i go in there officer sorry to give you a hard time the cop said it looks like you have a boxers knuckle there im not used to seeing doctors with boxers knuckles i work in a really tough er lou replied sara turnbull was a crackerjack nurseas smart and intuitive as she was compassionate there was a time when lou could have added passionate to her list of attributes but those times were long past the last he had heard from her was a getwell card forwarded to him in rehab how long have you been working here lou asked as they joined the crowd milling in the gleaming icu just four months my husbands a nurse on medsurg we have a oneyearold son its not eisenhower but its a decentenough placeat least it was this is a mess lou an absolute mess im charge nurse today and i cant follow some of the things that are happening like someone blindly jamming a hemostat into a patients brain fishing for a bullet exactly thats dr prichap as far as i know hes a decentenough neurosurgeon but ive never seen anyone do that it may be a while before you see anyone do it again lou said what else dr meacham is going downhill fast but no one seems all that alarmed do you know him for a few years weve actually gotten to know one another pretty well this came right out of the blue i cant believe he did it hes over there in three dr schwartz the intensivist has been in and out but mostly its been dr prichap it looks as if things have quieted down now prichap may have given up hunting for the bullet i hope so lou said almost to himself lou followed sara into the cubicle which was crowded to near overflowing with nurses radiology lab and respiratory techs what appeared to be a resident and a short copperskinned manprobably from india anthar s prichap md was stitched in blue over the breast pocket of his lab coat although he wore scrubs beneath his white coat it appeared that he had performed surgery just as he was next to prichap was a tray with bloody sponges and instruments piled on it no bullet on the bed barely visible in the crowd was john meacham his trachea had been intubated through his mouth and he was being ventilated mechanically by a stateoftheart machine that occupied most of the space the crush of bodies did not a tall mansix feet or someacham looked lost almost diminutive he appeared to be unconscious his eyes were taped shut and his head had been shaved on the right side the bullet hole just above his right ear seemed to have been widened on the wall viewbox were anteriorposterior and lateral skull films showing a deeply embedded slug fragmented into one small and two larger pieces none of which were easily accessible to the entrance wound itself dr schwartz the hospitalemployed intensivist was apparently off with other patients why hang around for a plain old everyday gunshot wound to the head lou introduced himself to prichap and received an uninterested nod in return no handshake then without a word the neurosurgeon drifted into the background as lou conducted a quick visual scan of meacham what he saw immediately disturbed him there were two intravenous linesone inserted in the elbow crux of meachams left arm and the other at the wrist of the right the line at the elbow was barely running despite a blood pressure reading on the monitor screen that demanded fluids and pressor medicationseighty over forty surrounding the spot where the catheter had been inserted was a large swelling the line was infiltrated and rather than pouring lifesupporting fluid into the circulatory system it was pooling fluid in the tissues careless dangerous medicine sara that needs to be replaced he said pointedly ignoring prichap who at that moment was looking rather pleased with himself for whatever reason the sara turnbull he remembered would never have allowed a critically traumatized patient to have only one working iv perhaps in the chaos she simply had not noticed in seconds she was taking down the dressing and preparing to replace the iv linethis time at the wrist lou glanced up again at the perilously low blood pressure reading which had dropped from a systolic of eighty to seventyfour unless the cause could be identified and reversed john meacham was heading out quickly lou began mentally ticking through the possibilities it took only a few seconds to connect with the right one stunned at what he was seeing lou worked his stethoscope into place and listened to meachams chest there were no breath sounds on the right side the exam was not really necessary all the information he needed was visible in the distension of the jugular veins along the sides of the mans neck the slight bowing of the trachea toward the left the persistently low oxygen saturation and the asymmetrical hyperexpansion of the right chest a tension pneumothoraxcollapse of the right lung due to a tear probably caused by excess pressure from the ventilator air was being forced by the vent through the ruptured lung and into the chest cavity the midline structures including the heart esophagus aorta and other great vessels were being pushed to the left the absence of breath sounds on the right merely confirmed the diagnosis lou noted that the vent pressure was dangerously high and turned it down from beside the machine the respiratory techa tall pencilnecked man in his late twentiesstood smiling at him blandly did you do this on purpose lou wanted to shout did you everyone please listen to me he called out louder than hed intended the commotion immediately stopped im dr lou welcome from the er at eisenhower memorial this man has a rapidly expanding tension pneumothorax we need to dart his chest immediately to get the air out of there then well get a chest tube in i need an iv angiocath in a number sixteen or fourteen needle quickly please missing from the emergency except in himself was any sense of tension and urgency lou wondered if anyone in the room really cared whether john meacham made it or not it would not be hard to understand if they didnt even though as sara had said it should never be a caregivers role to pass judgment on any patient this was as bad as it could get poor bastard poor victims what in the hell happened a largebore needle with a plastic catheter running through it was brought on an instrument tray along with latex gloves a large syringe surgical sponges some surgical snaps and several culture tubes blood pressure seventy over thirty oxygen saturation percent color worsening moving rapidly lou gloved and swabbed some betadine antiseptic below meachams collarbone on the right side then he set the plastic catheter aside and attached the needle to a cc syringe his movements were careful and considered but almost automatic like a boxer throwing a rightleftright combination to lous left behind the crowd he could see the neurosurgeon prichap gazing almost placidly out the glass wall of the cubicle no apparent concern no offer to help out the needle thrust was where the right second rib space was intersected by an imaginary line between the middle of the collarbone and the nipple gripping the syringe tightly lou forced the needle against the top of the third rib and then drove it to the hilt over the bone and into meachams chest the jet of air under great force actually blew the plunger out of the syringe lou twisted the syringe from the hub of the needle set it on the tray slid the catheter into meachams chest then quickly sutured it to the skin air continued to hiss out as the collapsed lung struggled to reexpand blood pressure eighty over fifty color slightly improved o sat seventytwo chest tube kit please lou said firmly here you go doctor turnbull said replacing the used steel tray with a fresh one and opening the setup used to insert a much larger tube lou glanced over and realized that the blown iv had been replaced by one that was running smoothly the emergency was beginning to feel more normal despite some improvement however meacham was still in big trouble in case he was not in a coma lou anesthetized an area of skin over the fifth rib two inches below the catheter then using a scalpel he opened a slit through skin and muscle grasped the end of the chest tube with a heavy clamp and drove it into the space between the stilldeflated lung and the inside of the chest wall given the relatively minor trauma of most of the patients in the eisenhower memorial annex this was he realized the first time he had inserted a chest tube since before he was sent away just like riding a bike a suture to hold the tube in place connection to a waterseal container to keep air from being sucked back into the chest cavity and the deal was done pressure still eighty over fifty o sat seventynine not good lou knew that all he had accomplished was bringing john meacham back to a man with a bullet hole in his head nice job turnbull whispered squeezing lous elbow thanks although i suspect the barn door might be closed shut by now i dont know who i should go ballistic at firstthe respiratory tech the iv nurse or that prichap guy i havent had much experience with him but like i said ive never heard anything bad well you have now how about i take a few deep breaths in the interest of reestablishing my serenity and speak to him theres a small nurses lounge out there to the right tell me when and ill bring him there for you provided you can get his attention away from the painting on that wall out there lou checked meacham over again not much change he tried to imagine what it was like to pull out a gun and shoot to kill someone it just didnt register the usual motivesgreed hatred angersimply didnt apply only crazy he headed down the hallway to the nurses lounge two minutes later dr prichap entered once again he didnt bother shaking lous hand the neurosurgeon like others in his specialty lou had dealt with over the years exuded arrogance lou flashed on his fourweek rotation holding instruments on the neurosurgery service in medical school never forget son the chief had told him during one seemingly endless procedure thats brain youre sucking on just in case lou introduced himself again prichap looked as if he could not care less the nurse said you wanted to see me he said ive known dr meacham for a number of years just wanted to get your take on what might have happened to him he lost his mind that is what happened he lost his mind and killed seven people i suppose is this the only hospital youre on the staff of i am in a fiveperson group we cover six or seven hospitals and youve not encountered behavior like dr meachams in any of those hospitals not that im aware of what specialty are you er i work in the er at eisenhower i see feeling the surgeon losing interest lou decided on a frontal assault tell me dr prichap what were you hoping to accomplish by fishing out that bullet lou fully expected the man to erupt or at least to storm out of the lounge instead prichap turned his head and gazed out the window much as he had in the icu i do not suppose it would have accomplished anything he said distantly but if it the surgeon snapped out of his reverie as if he had been jabbed by a cattle prod well good to meet you doctor he said turning toward the door as he did so he nearly collided with sara turnbull dr prichap dr welcome she said breathlessly come quickly please dr meachams arrested lou bolted past the neurosurgeon and out the door deland regional had community support and a reputation for giving good care yet the respiratory tech had overinflated meachams lungs the infusion nurse had badly blown a line and the neurosurgeon was acting like the doctorbarber in a saturday western even usually reliable sara turnbull had failed to notice a malfunctioning iv what in the hell was going on chapter bar none was three blocks from the capitol the upscale lounge served unusual cocktails that seemed to appeal to congressional aides more than to their stodgier older bosses at this hour it was as safe a place as any for darlene and kim to escape to for a drink they waited outside under an awning while a team of secret service agents checked out the interior with them on the sidewalk was victor ochoa a tall veteran agent with saltandpepper hair and dark narrow eyes that appeared to be on constant alert he stood a respectful distance from the two women until sudden static from his radio announced a transmission cobra here he said all clear for buttercup and wildcat cobra a womans voice replied buttercup and wildcat ochoa echoed by tradition the three members of the first family each carried a radio code name beginning with the same letter the president bronco had chosen b for them darlene had adopted the name of her heroine from the novel and movie the princess bride and lisa now twentyone and a totally independent sophomore at yale chose bullfighter kim to no ones surprise had gone with the kansas state mascot safe in there for a drink victor darlene asked so long as you keep away from the fireball gimlets youll be fine the agent escorted them the space was dimly lit and modestly filled a jukebox in one corner of the bar played alternative rock songs at a volume that permitted conversation without shouting darlene smiled up at ochoa and patted him on the arm im guessing youd like us to sit over there she said pointing to an empty booth that was closest to the emergency exit i knew youd eventually get the hang of this madam first lady ochoa said victor its darlene please id rather you call me princess buttercup than madam first lady and youre wrong i dont think ill ever fully get the hang of this role ochoa laughed warmly our guide to protocol is thicker than the dc phone book no excessive familiarity including no first names even though youre about the most downtoearth approachable first lady ive worked with tell you whatill be saying maam and thinking darlene hows that thatll be fine what does your protocol guide say about my going grocery shopping without an advance team clearing the cereal aisle first it says that isnt going to happen maam darlene followed ochoa kim and another agent beyond the bar smiling and shaking hands with surprised patrons as she passed by then she asked ochoa for two vodka tonics and settled into the booth sitting directly across from her friend ill be the second to admit the constant attention gets tiresome kim said but at least after shopping we wont have to lug any of our purchases back home that is a plus alas it was one thing when martin had an approval rating of sixty percent now were in free fall the depression or recession or whatever it is has seen to it that even shopping is unpleasant for me imagine what it must be like for those poor folks who suddenly dont have a job moments later ochoa materialized from within the crowd carrying two tall vodka tonics each garnished with a crescent of lemon the women clinked glasses more out of habit than over anything to celebrate i wonder if victor had to sample our drinks before he brought them over kim said darlene took a sip of hers which she quickly followed with a much longer swallow the sting of martins behavior abated some how did you know this is what i needed darlene asked honey it doesnt take sigmund freud to figure out that youre stressed out look at those circles under your eyes youve got a social schedule that would exhaust a rhinoceros on top of that youre working every spare moment trying to change the eating habits of three hundred million americans while keeping the fragile ego of their president appropriately stroked sometimes i dont think you realize just how much youve taken on well maybe its time i put my agenda on a diet kim took a healthy swallow and set her glass firmly on the table nonsense she said just because the president of the united states acts like your work is irrelevant doesnt make it so you just have to pace yourself better thats alla little more shopping a little more spa time a few more vacations an extra hour at the gym sweetheart youre changing things out there youve read the reports youre like the pediatrician to the nation and people are starting to pay attention to your message sure theyre starting to listen but change is coming very slowly and if we dont get reelected any chance of making much of a difference will be gone meal by meal isnt that your war cry keep pushing dar just dont push yourself over a cliff blow off steam when the pressure gets too intense and for gods sake dont let that galoot youre married to get away with not giving you or your cause the respect you deserve darlene clinked kims glass with more enthusiasm you know hajjar i think youd make someone a great chief of staff are you looking for a job depends kim answered her rich brown eyes gleaming playfully will i have to keep reminding you how terrific you are absolutely darlene said well then count me in just then ochoa came over to their table leaned down and spoke softly in darlenes ear madam first lady russell evans is upstairs in the private party room he asked if you two would be willing to join him for a drink darlene took a hard swallow of her v ampt against the tightness that had developed in her chest she flashed kim a surprised look evans former secretary of agriculture had been one of her husbands first cabinet appointments his resignation in disgrace had been responsible for at least some of the drop in martins numbers the scandal had been especially hard on darlene she and evans went back to their childhood years in the kansas plains town of dubuque where their farming families were neighbors even though they lived several miles apart in fact martin had first met evans through her not long after the three of them started at kansas state and often used him as an adviser during his climb up the political mountain russ evans is upstairs darlene whispered goodness he wants to speak with us you okay with that are you part of me still thinks he was set up if thats what you mean i feel the same way darlene said but so far the way the facts are stacking up things look pretty bad still he never was anything other than helpful to me victor wed be happy to speak with him chapter agents moved quickly to escort darlene and kim to the front of the bar the tightness in darlenes chest refused to abate meeting with evans like this would be juicy fodder for the paparazzi darlene had heard rumors that evans was going to plead guilty to statutory rape charges in connection to a motel rendezvous with a teenage prostitute when the news broke darlene had sent him a supportive note expressing her hope that an explanation would come clear for the episode and urging him to put his faith in the justice system perhaps she wondered he had been unable to take her words to heart and wanted to position himself for a presidential pardon not only had their lifelong friendship endured but she had taken a med school elective course in farming and nutrition that he taught years later she was the one to suggest that martin consider appointing evansthen an instructor in farming economicsas secretary of agriculture martin subsequently stood by their friend despite a fair amount of opposition in congress darlene and kim followed the agents through a doorway to a narrow stairwell that ascended to the balcony level at the end of another hallway they came to a padded vinyl door weve already checked the room its safe to go in ochoa said darlene pushed open the door and allowed kim to enter first evans was alone seated at a low table in the center of a dimly lit cavelike room the paneled walls were painted black and the mood lighting cast deep shadows across evanss round face during the months since darlene had last seen him he seemed to have aged years he stood up somewhat clumsily as the women entered and darlene wondered if he might have been drinking he was a large usually cheery man with thinning light brown hair and at this moment he exuded gloom darlene kim thanks for coming up he said extending his meaty hand its good to see you good to see you too russ darlene said giving him a quick hug in lieu of his proffered handshake you look as if youre holding up okay evans replied with his trademark deep baritone laugh ive gained fifteen pounds and am rapidly losing what little hair i had left he said but ill accept the compliment anyway darlenes apprehension was replaced with a heavy sadness at seeing the man looking so beaten evans had eschewed life on his familys farm in exchange for a masters degree and a faculty position at an agricultural college before the scandal hit she had enjoyed meetings in his office surrounded by framed photographs of americas farmland agent ochoa said you wanted to speak with me is it about your case please have a seat evans pushed closer to the table i was at your event today you were kim asked i didnt see you there again that laugh but this time there was an undisguised tinge of bitterness well i kept to the background evans said not that it matters how so asked darlene i guess im still surprised how little anyone recognizes the guy who for two years was ninth in the presidential succession order once youre not a player in this town well youre not a playerexcept of course to the press corps now those guys still have no problem recognizing me scandal sells papers this morning though they were too focused on you to notice me everyone knew the president had blown off the event not even an appearance by farmer pornpone as the tabloids are calling me could pull their attention away darlene reached across the table and cupped evanss hands in her own you know you have supporters out there russ not everyone believes the charges against you evans managed a pale smile of appreciation nice of you to say darlene unfortunately whoever paid off the girl gave her enough to keep her lies coming to say nothing of the impact of the box of kiddie porn that investigators found in the back of my closet sorry if im out of place kim said but what were you doing in that hotel room weve heard all kinds of rumors and evans held up his hand no dont be sorry and dont you worry about it he said my lawyer asked me to keep my side of the story away from the press until he heard what the us attorney had against me now that we know theyre calling off the prosecution because they cant find the woman who filed the complaint ill tell anybody wholl listennot that it will help get my job back you see my son derek has been in trouble since his teens drugs and such i havent spoken to him in nearly three years until i got this anonymous phone call telling me he was holed up at a motel just outside of dc and that he was in some sort of trouble i think you know that dereks mother and i have been divorced for some time i decided not to tell her about the call until i knew what was going on i got to the motel as fast as i could and knocked on room twentyfour as the caller had instructed the door opened up and i found myself alone in a hotel room with a very young and very naked girl a hidden camera on a tripod recorded everything she literally threw herself at me pushed me backwards onto the bed and kissed me several times before i could throw her aside i knew it was a setup and a very volatile situation i probably should have called the police right then and there but instead i ran and called my attorney i had no idea there was a camera hidden in the room later i found out the room was registered in a bogus name the day before and the clerk who was on the desk at the time told the police it probably was me the girl said she had done business with me before and that i liked to have her undress me but this was the first time i had asked to have the camera there when the police looked at the film cartridge the part showing me shoving her off and running away was conveniently missing what about the box of photos in your closet evans could only shrug and shake his head sure sounds like a setup to me kim said after a moments pause even if they drop the charges ive lost evanss voice broke and for the first time he seemed close to tears martin was very reluctant to accept your resignation russ you know that dont you i know what youve told me darlene and i thank you for that i dont get it kim said you were the secretary of agriculture dont take this the wrong way but i dont see why anyone would go after you evans nodded as though hed heard that opinion of his former position before as darlene can tell you theres a lot more to our part of the government than just making sure food is safe for eating the work we do touches the lives of virtually every american its our responsibility to provide a sufficient safe nutritious food supply produced in a sustainable and environmentally supportive way doesnt seem like anybody would want you out of office for that kim said i suppose the frameup could have had nothing to do with my being the secretary but there are lot of variables that go into what we do weve got local food producers pushing an agenda counter to what the major growers demand environmentalists lobby hard for more sustainability and weve got technological advancements in fertilizer seeds and pesticides to keep track of darlene felt a chill go through her and went rigid in her seat kim noticed and placed a concerned hand on her knee you okay to her great dismay evanss explanation of the issues surrounding farming reminded her of her father only in the darkest days before financial reversals and unremitting melancholy caused him to press a shotgun up beneath his chin and pull the trigger darlene nodded and took a sip from a glass of water im fine she said knowing that her friend could tell she wasnt russ do you have any idea who might have set you up take your pick evans said every decision makes someone a winner and someone a loser i wish there were something i could do to help darlene said actually there is name it the former agriculture secretarys face tightened after martin told me he intended to appoint me head of the usda i began developing a legislative agenda for our first term in office my aides have a series of bills drawn up that i was going to present to the president when when i resigned they involve everything from school lunch requirements to the handling of foods containing genetically modified organisms i dont have much ill be leaving behind but i would love to see those bills get submitted by the president and passed i was hoping that because of your and my history and your commitment to kids nutrition you might help that happen does the president know about these bills no i tried getting them to him but it was too late he doesnt want to hear from me im pretty sure the woman martin has lined up to replace me has no intention of following through on any of my programs ive got nothing left darlene my friends are bailing on me as if i were septic my integritys been plowed to the roots these are good important pieces of legislation if they go under my last shred of dignity and purpose goes with them darlene bit at her lip and tried to keep evanss profound sadness from becoming too much her own no promises but have them sent to me she said the three turned as the door behind them was opened by victor ochoa mrs mallory ms hajjar im sorry for bursting in like this but theres been a multiple shooting with deaths in kings ridge virginia we feel you should return to the white house until we have more information deaths do you know how many kim asked it looks like seven we should know more by the time we get you home seven people shot to death darlene felt ill countless terrible vivid images began flashing through her mind she hadnt ever told anyone except her husband but as a teen she had been the one to discover her fathers body you just have to make every day precious kim said as they gathered their things cause you never know chapter the final battle for dr john meachams life was over almost before it began on a vent with iv blood pressure support and other meds he was essentially being resuscitated before his heart stopped beating dr schwartz the salaried intensive care specialist who had deferred to lou for the insertion of the chest tube administered some cardiac stimulants without any success and then after no more than ten minutes turned to lou do you see any reason to continue doctor he asked lou flashed on the day when he and meacham had first met at the physician wellness office meacham was as tight as a drum skin and positive that he would never be allowed to practice medicine again lou as a survivor of disaster in his personal and professional lives knew otherwise most of that first session had consisted of him exposing his new client to the life strategies of aastrategies that he had ridiculed at first as being naive and simplisticuntil he actually began to use them in his life meacham had caught on quickly with the help of an aa sponsor and people at the rehab his need to drink ceased almost immediately following that his hairtrigger temper gradually came under control now this i cant think of anything else we should be doing dr schwartz lou heard his voice saying as if from down a long tube schwartz looked up at the clock and nodded toward sara turnbull seven forty pm he proclaimed and just like that john meachams life was done has his wife carolyn been around lou asked realizing that in the craziness of the hours just past he had lost track of some of his own civility she was in the family room a little while ago sara said should i check no lou said i know her ill go out the sliding doors and down the hallway to the left head down consumed by heavy sadness at the senseless deaths of so many lou stepped through the unit doors the husky detective was still at his post so doc hows it going in there its not lou said dead dead the cop nodded whether its cops bullets at the scene or a shiv in the back in the slammer from one of the other inmates these things almost always seem to end this way well there go the answers i suppose lou replied wondering how easy it would be for him to let matters drop the cop was right there was still a boatload of unanswered questions starting with the meaning of the words no witnesses lou opened the lounge door the modest room furnished in vinyl with dogeared magazines scattered about was deserted his eyes went first to a television set mounted cattycorner high up on the far wall the volume was turned off though lou could easily read the cnn news flash graphic from across the room breaking news suspected mass murderer in critical condition not anymore lou murmured wondering if the grim outcome would have been any different had the local neurosurgeon not gone probing blindly for a bullet in or near the area of the brain dealing with cardiac rhythmicity he averted his gaze from the broadcast just as the door to the family room opened and carolyn meacham entered she was slight woman with carefully trimmed gray hair and more makeup than lou felt she needed it was surprising that there were no family or friends with her but perhaps some were on the way her makeup did nothing to disguise her pain without a word she raced across to lou and threw her arms around him burying her face against his chest she was a spirited womana new yorker lou thought he remembered with a hard edge he had liked her from the very beginning in all the time he had dealt with her and meacham he had never once seen her cry now her tears flowed liberally it was impossible to imagine what she must have been experiencing since receiving the news her three children were all in their teens hes dead isnt he she asked before pulling away lou nodded just a couple of minutes ago i came out here from dc to see if i could help but there was really nothing i could do he was fine when he left home lou hes been going to meetings and staying sober and this morning when he left for the office he was fine where are your kids at my sister rosalees in chantilly when the news broke i had her pick them up at school and take them to her place to keep them away from reporters good move do you want to go in to see him carolyn hesitated and for a moment lou thought she was going to decline then she nodded and took his arm her sobbing had already ceased the scene in meachams cubicle had largely been cleaned up when they arrived nurses had respectfully not pulled a sheet up over his face although they had left a bandage in place over the bullet hole death as lou had often encountered it even violent death frequently had a calming effect on a patients countenance to some extent that was the case here carolyn stood motionless for a time gazing down at the man she had shared a life with for so many yearsthe interested interesting caregiver who would never get the chance to see their daughters into womanhood what happens next she asked stonily lou felt himself react to her abrupt change in tone now you have to sign some papers with the nurses and johns body will need to be autopsied he said simply carolyn glanced over at him is that really even necessary isnt it obvious how he died its standard practice for all homicides carolyn shook her head lets go she said spinning and heading out the door with lou rushing to keep up there were no final caresses no request for a minute alone no more tears it was as if someone had thrown a switch making carolyn meacham aware of the horribleness of her husbands crime lou gave passing thought to asking what her husband might have meant by the cryptic remark no witnesses but this hardly seemed the time i need to pick up my kids and go home carolyn said with no emotion ill drive you im fine to drive it was an order not a statement well you may be fine to drive but youre not okay to be alone ill ride with you we can talk in the car then if need be i can take a cab back here carolyn made no attempt to talk him out of it outside the rain had picked up and the fog had thickened the unseasonable chill persisted it was carolyn who first spotted the crowd of reporters lurking about her silver volvo suv many were using makeshift plastic tarps to shield their equipment from the rain lou headline news himself when the dea and police descended on his home and arrested him for writing prescriptions for himself marveled at the resourcefulness of the vultureshow they already knew this particular car belonged to carolyn meacham as if underscoring his thoughts their camera lights lit up as soon as he and carolyn neared he wondered how long it would take for them to come up with his name calls to filstrup would be sure to follow oh happy day lou pulled carolyn close to him shielding her from the onslaught reporters shoved their microphones in her face like mothers trying to forcefeed their children and shouted out questions that became garbled as they clashed with one another in midair carolyn was silent ice her head high her intelligent green eyes fixed straight ahead through the swarm she somehow managed to get her door unlocked and then reached across the seat to open lous side he tossed his raindampened jacket into the backseat and quickly climbed in carolyn turned the ignition key the reporters banged on the windows and doors and stepped aside only when the car began to move lou she said yes something made him do this he was not a violent person something made him do what he did lou passed on the urge to remind her that a few years ago her husband had nearly gotten booted out of medicine for losing control i suppose thats an understandable feeling he said instead as she pulled onto the driveway john meachams widow left rubber on the wet tarmac of the doctorsonly parking lot find out what happened lou she said find out why john killed those people chapter they drove largely in silence wipers on intermittent traveling along a country road that snaked through a hilly landscape dusk had passed and night had settled in quickly but carolyn did not appear bothered by the headlights of the vehicles splashing past in the opposite direction in fact lou guessed she might be going as fast as any of them are you all right to be driving he asked carolyn sighed heavily i need to be driving she said even in this crappy weather i need to be doing something just sitting in that lounge waiting for news trying to make sense of it all hoping he would live praying he would die it was so horrible so lonely lou you couldnt possibly imagine a beloved husband dead hundreds of lives irreparably shattered carolyn left to dwell in the aftermath those were lous thoughts before he said no carolyn youre right i couldnt imagine they fell back into the heavy silence the volvos wipers now beat a steady rhythm against the driving rain fog transformed the approaching headlights into a hazy glow that stretched across the darkening horizon even with bad visibility the rainslicked road and carolyns abovethelimit speed there were drivers daring enough pass them when permissible carolyn made a disgusted sound when one zipped by im not going to speed in weather like this she said lou reached for his jacket in the backseat and fished out his cell phone he assumed that renee had already seen news reports of meachams death but knew since she and emily were there when the call came in from filstrup that shed want to hear directly from him he began keying in renees number when he felt the suv shift hard to the left his seat belt went from loose to taut in a blink keeping him from being thrown against carolyn before lou could regain his bearings the car swerved again this time to the right the tires lost traction on the rainsoaked road suddenly the volvo was fishtailing lurching violently from side to side moments later carolyn had calmly regained control her speed had if anything increased lou flashed on the possibility that she had insisted on driving because of some kind of suicidal urge she veered right then left then right again lous stomach dropped as though he were front seat in a roller coaster the left wheels of the suv crossed the solid center lines twice one of those times coming close to crossing into the oncoming traffic but in both instances carolyn pulled the car back just in time her expression had grown tense her eyes narrowed she leaned on her car horn and began flashing her lights at the driver in front of them get out of the way move over she shouted carolyn whats going on lou cried out what are you doing carolyns eyes remained locked forward unblinking she continued to flash her lights and beep her horn move over she yelled get over now please slow down carolyn slow down and pull over instead of responding carolyn steered the suv into oncoming traffic presumably to try to pass the car in front but here the road turned and lou saw the dotted yellow dividing line become a solid one in the next instant he was blinded by a set of powerful headlight beams he heard a deeptimbred hornnot a cars beep but something much larger lous stomach knotted the horn had to be an eighteenwheeler a second later he saw the rig emerge from the fog like a huge phantom carolyn acting unfazed continued on a straight course unable to pass the car to their right she sped forward as though playing a game against the fortyton machine look lou she called out still surprisingly calm though her voice had an anxious edge the car three ahead of us its left taillight is out someones going to get killed unless we warn them theres been enough death today carolyn let it be slow down please slow down the car boxing them in accelerated lou reached across his seat and took hold of the wheel pulling it clockwise aware that the move might well cause carolyn to lose control lou dont do that i have to warn him the tires slipped several feet then gained purchase pulling them into the righthand lane lou released the wheel the car shuddered and rose on two tires there was a ferocious crack as the rig sheared off the leftside mirror the rush of wind as it flew past was probably all that kept them from flipping over okay now carolyn lou said with as much insistence as urgency pull over there and let me drive again she leaned on the accelerator and the horn in this fog somebody is going to ram into the back of them carolyn dont she turned the wheel right this time attempting to pass the intervening car via a narrow muddy soft shoulder lou sat pressed against his seat back unwilling to grab at the wheel again the speedometer moved upward forty fifty fiftyfive carolyn meacham looked purposefully ahead beyond reason carolyn stop lou screamed youre going to kill us both because a guys taillight is out they raced even with the car to their left the driver leaned on his horn and refused to slow down lou could feel the high center of gravity in the suv threaten to flip them every jolt on the uneven ground seemed magnified theyre just two cars ahead patches of fog flew past like ghosts then lou froze through one of the patches directly in front of them a speed limit sign had appeared carolyn he shouted get back into your lane do it now instinctively lou clenched his teeth and readied himself for impact they were going sixty lou couldnt hold back he leaned as far to the left as his seat belt would allow grabbed the wheel and pushed it counterclockwise the volvo skidded into a left turn and fell behind the car carolyn had been trying to pass perhaps instinctively she slammed on the brakes the front two tires dragged along the grassy shoulder kicking up dirt and rocks the sign slammed into the hood and sheared off vanishing upward into the mist then in a full spin the car left the road lou saw a tree materialize from the fog he shut his eyes tightly and raised his arms to his face for protection the impact wasnt as violent as he had expected lous head snapped against the window beside him as the volvo spun viciously splintered glass exploded into his face and cut his neck the rear of the volvo was still in the center of the road then without warning the coaster ride was over carolyn are you all right he said wiping at his forehead and seeing blood on his hand did you see that she asked him her breathing not far from normal did you you mean the taillight yes the taillight drivers never fix them until the vehicleinspection people tell them they have to that guy could have caused an accident chapter throughout most of the bizarre chase to overtake the driver with one working taillight lou remained in what he called emergency calma state of heightened awareness and preparedness cloaked in an external composure it was a reaction to crisis shared by those caregivers whose business often revolved around sudden changes for the worse in their patientsintensivists anesthesiologists surgeons physician assistants nurses in the er and various units emts and paramedics now with the immediate danger over it was as if whatever had been blocking the surge of adrenaline through his body had been removed his pulse had doubledor tripled he was breathing heavily if not hyperventilating and when he opened the dashboard compartment looking for tissues his hand was shaking the cut to his brow did not look like much and pressure with a wad of kleenex quickly stopped the bleeding carolyn can you get us out of the road he asked his voice louder than he had intended john meachams widow nodded weakly and drove the volvo farther onto the roadsides muddy shoulder she appeared dazed though to lous relief uninjured still he checked her head neck and extremities and palpated her chest and abdomen for areas of tenderness his blood pressure cuff and other instruments for emergencies were in a large medical bag which he kept in the trunk of his car but he assured himself that her cardiac rhythm was under a hundred and regular and her radial and carotid pulses were strong finally using a flashlight from the dash he did a crude neurologic exam including eye movements and pupillary response what did i do carolyn muttered what the hell did i just do there were several cars stopped behind them lou gave the thumbsup sign through carolyns window and the drivers slowly pulled out and drove away two of them paused long enough to say they had called lou that taillight i was so worried the missing light would cause an accident her voice trailed away she continued staring blankly out the windshield at the rain her hands right at two oclock left at eleven gripped the wheel tightly as though she were still driving lou took an umbrella from the rear floor and climbed out of the car his left knee was stiff and had probably taken a hit but it was not nearly sore enough to keep him from tomorrows sparring session at the stick and move gym he took in several sharp breaths of chilly night air and tested the rest of his limbs nothing next he made a quick circle around the volvo the damage appeared minimal he waved to a driver who had slowed down signaling that everything was okay then he climbed back into the car whatever had possessed carolyn seemed to be resolving her eyes were no longer glazed her hands had relaxed carolyn the car should be okay to drive but this time if its alright with you ill do the driving that would be fine she said still somewhat vaguely lou patted her on the shoulder everything is going to be okay lou what did i do look you experienced a major trauma back in the hospital you werent thinking clearly thats all it happens in extreme stress situations a person just does something something irrational we see it in the er all the time he felt a flash of embarrassment at what might be construed as a reference to carolyns husband i was so worried about those taillights she said again as lou gently separated her hands from the steering wheel whats going to happen to me now before he could answer a siren blared behind them and then whined down into silence the flash of blue strobe lights danced erratically inside the volvos interior lou glanced in the sideview mirror to see a plussized police officer exit his vehicle and snap open an umbrella the policeman sauntered over to the drivers side of the car and shone a powerful flashlight beam through the rainspattered window onto carolyns face oh goodness carolyn said gripping the wheel once again lou set a cautioning hand on her arm roll down your window and let me do the talking he whispered you dont have anything to worry about carolyn did as he asked the officer umbrella keeping them both dry bent at the waist and poked his head inside the car anybody hurt he asked he spoke with a modest southern drawl his eyes which lou read as showing no threat scanned the two of them with concern carolyn immediately became more animated oh gilbert thank goodness its you she said talking without taking a breath this was all my fault i i was chasing down a car in front of us that had one broken taillight i got so worried they were going to cause an accident that i ended up having one myself lou gripped carolyns arm she nodded and stopped he climbed out of the car opened his umbrella and still slightly favoring his leg walked around to the officer officer my name is lou welcome im an er doc from eisenhower memorial and a friend of carolyns and um of johns gilbert stone chief of police of kings ridge stone took his hand and maintaining steady eye contact squeezed it with near bonecrushing force cap duncan lous mentor and owner of the stick and move had once told him that any statement of superiority or control a man wanted to make should begin with the handshake lou wondered now if the husky lawman was trying to do just that he gave thought to matching or besting the mans grip but set the notion aside in his dumbmoves file stone shone his flashlight on lous face momentarily blinding him you sure youre all right son he asked were both fine thanks given what you do and where you do it im inclined to trust you in that regard i appreciate that stone inspected the front end of the volvo and what remained of the sign and let out a highpitched whistle not so different from the sound his cruisers siren had made beneath the lawmans woollined bomber jacket lou saw a tan shirt with a silver metal star pinned to the breast pocket and a perfectly knotted black tie guess we got real lucky here stone said hoisting up his dark brown pants over an ample belly you say youre a friend of mrs meacham i amwasfriends with her husband as well stones thin lips folded into a crease that vanished inside his mouth any ideas why he did what he did well no except to say i cant imagine him doing it but he did yes he did lou echoed grimly he considered sharing details right then and there about the bizarre happenings in the icu at deland regional and how they dovetailed with carolyn meachams odd behavior but decided this wasnt the time or place its been a hell of a day stone sighed his eyes locked on lous tough day indeed lou answered you sure youre in no need of medical attention son no thank you im all right stone just nodded okay like i said i trust you now then you have something you want to tell me about the accident stone continued his hard stare this accident is all my fault lou said i never should have let her drive shes in no condition given what happened today but she absolutely insisted said it would be best if she had something to focus on id really hate to see her in trouble with the law after what shes just been through stones grin was impenetrable so youre saying it didnt happen quite the way she said it did by then the two men had connected what if i told you the wheels lost grip rainslicked roads and all lou said well id be inclined to believe you my doctor was carl franklin one of the best we ever had at the moment i am having some mighty harsh feelings toward the man who killed him but that doesnt translate to the mans wife i didnt know the meachams that well on account they havent lived in kings ridge very long but what i did know of them i had nothing againsteven johns history of trouble with the medical board a few years back lou tensed this was no hayseed sheriff for however many years he had been the man in kings ridge gilbert stone was not merely rattling about the town procuring coffee and doughnuts he was in charge of it he also hadnt hesitated to mention meachams history to what should have been until now a total stranger either stone was indiscreet to a fault or somewhere in the course of gathering information about his fiefdom dr lou welcomes name had bopped across his desk lou warned himself to stay sharp i wish i could explain why john did what he did he said me and you both son stone replied it sure dont make no sense im glad you understand my concern for carolyn oh i do i surely do so just a ticket then stone put his campaign hat back on like i said im sure carolyns been through hell today lets make sure her car drives fine and ill send her off with a warning to be more careful on these slippery roads wonderful stone hesitated a beat then locked on to lous eyes once again and im going to send you off with a warning as well he said me if you know something about my town or the people in it such as carolyn and john meacham or anyone on the staff of our hospital and you choose to keep that information hidden from me you wont find me to be so easygoing chapter the president and first family lived on the second and third floors of the white housefifteen bedrooms and fifteen bathrooms along with a sitting room kitchen dining room and spectacular solarium darlene had done her best to make the master bedroom feel homey and familiar to her but to no surprise she had yet to completely succeed at heart she would always be a farmers daughtera woman of downtoearth taste in furnishings and art she and martin slept in an s fourposter tiger maple bed that she had chosen from notebooks of photographs that the office of the curator had provided to her the rest of the rooms decor was more conventional and modern although piecebypiece she was changing it perhaps if they made it to a second term at that moment a big if despite her wellintentioned efforts at bedtime meditation and yoga darlene still felt restless enough at times to accept some help from the vial of sleeping pills in her bedside table tonight with continuous news coverage of the horrific events in kings ridge russ evanss sad visage embedded in her mind her lingering anger over martins decision to leave her solo at the boys amp girls club and a full schedule facing her in the morning she had little doubt there was an ambien in her near future she was sitting upright in bed rereading a paragraph from the current issue of food health finally unable to advance past that page she set the magazine aside and returned her attention to the eleven oclock news which was reporting on the latest developments in the kings ridge tragedy details of the crime and of dr john meachams life were continuing to emerge but there was still no clear explanation for what the man had done a physician murdering patients and staff in his office people remained in shock and desperate for answers she clicked off the television picked up her magazine again and had just finished the page when the bedroom door swung open the president of the united states slipped inside threw his jacket and power red tie over a chair bent down and kissed her on the forehead one look at his tired eyes gaunt face and graying temples and she felt compassion and the stirrings of forgiveness for the man she had vowed to love until death martin had been a rodeo jock in college and it was his piercing blue eyes powerfully set jaw and cowboy good looks that had first attracted her to him then she came to know his droll wit tenderness and the bottomless compassion for the causes he believed in from that admiration came a profound and deepening love if there was any aspect of his personality she had to work to accept it was the power of his ambition sorry im late getting up here i had to give a statement about the killings in kings ridge how terrible that is everyone seems shaken i saw you commenting on the news a little while ago you did an excellent job very honest and from the heart thanks princess the whole thing is just awful right out of the blue the guy goes postal i dont think thats a phrase you want to use in public martin chuckled no i suppose not especially since the union endorsed me you got anything on under there nothing that cant be taken off with the flick of a finger in say a nanosecond he slowly lowered the sheet his eyes sparked you are just the best thing ive seen all day he said in a worn voice darlene had promised russ evans she would at least speak to martin on behalf of his legislation but the way martin looked to her nowhaggard creases like canyons cutting across his foreheadshe felt herself having second thoughts the old saw about carrying the weight of the world wasnt completely true for many but it was for him she lowered him to his belly and kneaded his shoulders you could have seen me earlier she said in a soft voice there was a passing instant when she wished she had kept her feelings about the dedication to herself but she had strong beliefs that a marriage without communication was doomed to turn toxic martin swung around pressed a warm hand to the side of her face and gently caressed her cheek ill make it up to you he said before giving her a quick kiss on the lips i know that i disappointed you today and im sorry really and truly sorry darlene smiled down at her husband whatever effects of the job she had observed seemed to have diminished her heart filled with love and her eyes must have reflected her desire because martin rolled over and kissed her hard on the lips cupping her breast in his hand her mouth opened in response and she kissed him back deeply their lovemaking had been occurring less frequently of late coinciding not so much with pressures of the presidency but with the time that martins outbursts had become more common he slipped off the rest of his clothes and moved her down beside him his hands continuing to explore the spots she liked his touch brought darlene a profound feeling of comfort and desire she felt him becoming aroused and herself beginning to respond perhaps this night the ambien would stay in the drawer so baby martin said beginning the sort of banter he enjoyed during sex tell me something else about your day darlene tensed no lies no evasions that was the unwritten rule of their marriage she once again flashed on russ evanss sad desperate face actually she said while martin worked at her neck with his lips there is something i need to discuss with you but it can wait martin moaned in her ear hmmmm sure get it off your chest if it will help you relax you seem a little tense darlene gazed up at the ceiling as he continued to explore the soft curves of her chin neck and breasts he was right about her feeling tense even though he was as usual unwilling to take any responsibility russ evans came to the dedication today said quietly we didnt see him there but afterwards he followed us to the bar none and asked us to meet with him in private upstairs martin stopped kissing her and remained motionless the temperature between them dropped several degrees and did you did i what martin sat up the ice in his eyes was reflected in his voice meet with him i didnt see what harm could come of it i mean we have known each other since we were kids kim was with me and and victor was right outside martin swung onto the edge of the bed but never took his suddenly hard eyes from her i cant believe you met in public with that pervert he said do you think i dont have enough problems without my wife adding to them with the man who is already the biggest blight of my administration reflexively darlene pulled the sheet up to cover her breasts thats a cruel thing to say marty we three were alone in the upstairs of the restaurant no one except the agents even saw kim and me go up there russ evans was our friend he believed in everything i stand for hearing him out seemed the least i could do you had no business talking with that man hes a disgrace an utter disgrace he humiliated the both of us he says someone set him up people like him always say that after theyre caught martin have you ever considered that what happened to russ could have been a politically motivated frameup at this the president leapt off the bed and stormed across the room breathing heavily what would make you even imply such a thing well when he asked to see me i thought he was going to try to position himself for a presidential pardon use me to get to you go on but he didnt do anything of the sort all he cared about was some legislation hes been working on he wanted me to tell you that the laws are important ones and that people and especially children shouldnt suffer because of him he asked meno more like begged meto convince you to read over his bills and support his programs that was it that was the only thing that mattered to him martins face turned crimson youre kidding me right darlene you really are a gullible hick please tell me this is a joke martin i you what you what darlene you had drinks with a pervert and then you chat it up with him about a program that hasnt even been formally presented to me his anger had charged the air like lightning fueling itself before a strike martin please youre sounding unreasonable you have no business talking to russ evans he shouted pounding the top of their bureau and sending a velvetlined box of costume jewelry spilling across the floor the mouth that had moments before been kissing her was now contorted into a snarl darlene kept her eyes locked on him watching with concern as he stalked back to her her chest tightened and for a brief moment she felt trapped between her husband and the headboard of the bed then the president sat down on the edge of the mattress just as gently as hed done earlier he put his hand on her knee she could feel her leg shaking sweetheart he said i am so sorry for going off at you like that just the mention of that mans name is enough to make me go crazy with all the pressures i have right before my reelection bid is to start in earnest ive got to live with the fact that i nominated a child predator to join the highest ranks of my administration but maybe just maybe hes innocent we both know that isnt true martin said but i also know how important kids are to you so im going to make a deal ill read whatever evanss remaining people submit then well see thank you thats all im asking but you have to make a promise to me anything anything at all you are never and i mean never to speak to russ evans or mention him in my presence again promise me that darlene again she conjured up an image of evans sitting across the table from hera soul adrift and without hope of rescue despite her lingering doubts and the horrible accusations against the man her heart ached for him but loyalty to her husband was by far the stronger pull of course she said i promise come closer now lets start over again darlene turned off the bedside lamp but martin quickly switched it back on ive got work to do he said pulling on a tshirt and a pair of sweats you get some sleep ill be in later and see you in the morning i im glad i told you she said more than a little bewildered me too he replied grinning without warmth because i already heard about the meeting from one of the other agents chapter stick and move was a thousandsquarefoot gymnasium located amidst a stretch of warehouses within walking distance of lous twobedroom apartment inside were three boxing rings each the standard twentyfeetbytwenty heavy bags hung from one side of the gym like trophy sharks on a dock and a row of pearshaped speed bags were wallmounted to the other there were several stationary bikes a quality set of free weights walllength mirrors plenty of room for jumping rope and several sets of medicine balls and best of all from lous point of view it smelled like a serious gym a day had passed since the horror of kings ridge lous knee had calmed down from a four out of ten on the stiffness scale to maybe a two the gym was active and noisy when he arrived to train cap duncan sparring helmet in place was already in the ring pounding his gloves together and dancinga glistening graceful block of granite on legs he noted lous arrival with hungry eyes and motioned him through the ropes cap was bahamian black shaved bald and fitripped was the gym rats word a good guess would have placed him in his twenties but lou had organized a surprise fiftieth birthday party for him two years ago cap who along with a bank or two owned the place was short for capn crunch a moniker he earned during a brief but highly touted professional boxing career largely because of the distinctive sound that noses made when he hit them crunch hey there doc with all that you talked about at the meeting last night i thought you might not make it in i need this more today than ever cap lou threw his ragged sweatshirt aside and worked the kinks from his neck he was two or three inches taller than his sparring partner in addition to being a decade younger and his welldeveloped shoulders formed a decent v with his waist but it would be difficult for anyone who compared the two men to believe that he was the harder puncherand they would be right the two of them had connected the day that lou arrived from six months of treatment at a rehab center in atlanta and moved into an attic room in the halfway house where cap was a counselor when the financing came through allowing the purchase of the stick and move lou went to work there and the fighter became his trainer and his aa sponsor there was no one on the mean streets or in the recovery community that cap didnt know and few on either side who didnt respect him with his hands already hot and sweaty inside his gloves and his wrists stiff from athletic tape lou moved to the center of the ring still working the tightness from his shoulders and neck and wondering if he should say something about the bandage on his forehead beneath the front of his helmet so hows your day been he asked finagling with his mouth guard to sound intelligible caps first punch which seemed to have arrived out of nowhere caught lou on the side of his headgear if youre in the ring i know i know lou said finishing one of caps favorite aphorisms be ready to get hit so what do you think this is ballet class caps words were thick from speaking over and around his mouth protector but lou knew his translation of them was close enough he circled assessing his options but not yet ready to commit to any punches then he made his second mistake glancing down momentarily mesmerized by the older mans footwork this time he saw caps jab coming from the right but was no better at defending it the blow connected against his temple with a solid thump remember how i said id drive you to the meeting on friday lou said already beginning to breathe heavily well another cheap shot like that and youll be going by cab oh yeah i forgot you were just in a car accident cap said tell you what ill go easy on you this session by easy you mean youll only need to soak for an hour in the ice tub he grinned broadly around his green mouth guard lou blocked a leftright combination and returned one of his own which barely connected cap could still fight him almost blindfolded in order to do much of anything against the man he was going to have to concentrate childless but married a few times here and there when it suited his purpose cap had devoted his youth to boxing spending every waking hour training in grungy gyms slowly climbing the amateur ranks he could dazzle opponents with his footwork but it was his punching as powerful with his left as he was with his right that garnered the most attention as a kid he fooled around with alcohol and reefer but then a trainer set him straight he gave up smoking and drinking and began to care for his body through diet vitamins and more training eventually cap got his big break scoring a professional fight against a muchhyped contender for the ibas middleweight belt the fight that should have made his career was ultimately what landed him in the same halfway house where lou would one day reside alone in the dressing room only minutes before the bout cap received a bouquet of flowers along with an envelope containing five onehundreddollar bills and a note instructing him to lose by a knockout in the seventh round cap knew it was a mob thing in his circles talk about fixing fights was as common as advice shared on punching technique but instead of losing the fight cap beat his opponent to a pulp and won a technical knockout in round two he never got to box professionally again before his next scheduled bout the state boxing federation pulled him from the card citing a positive test for performanceenhancing drugs banned under their governance forced out of the sport he loved he soon began taking narcotics to help ease his emotional pain and humiliation the back alleys of dc became his home a brown bag his constant companion people whom he suspected had set him up offered him work as an enforcer but he never took the jobs finally when he had suffered enough two more people camepeople from aa youre slow tonight welcome cap said after he threw a series of blazingfast jabs purposely pulled to keep from doing any real damage you sure youre all right to box lou got in a quick effective body blow and danced away preening im fine he said i need this to clear my head lou bobbed and weaved while circling his friend he feigned a couple jabs that cap shrugged off sweat was engulfing both men now caps shaved pate was glistening beneath the incandescent overheads no matter what was ever troubling lou sparring like this was the treatment did you gash your head cap asked jabbing at but not hitting lous forehead indicating the bandage was visible from underneath his headgear that accident was the craziest thing lou said yeah how so lou bobbed again and this time got in one good shot to caps jaw then he danced back and dropped his red mouthpiece into the palm of his glove so he could be heard more clearly carolyn meacham the dead docs widow was convinced the busted taillight on the car in front of us was going to cause an accident so she ends up causing one herself trying to catch up and warn the driver cap waited until lou had reinserted his guard then almost immediately hit him with two quick punchesone to either side of his face lou thought he heard a crunch from the vicinity of his nose and his eyes teared he wiped at the area with the back of one glove and checked for blood none keep your hands up doc hands up now go on lou increased his movement around the ring sweat was pouring off him now stinging his eyes he loved the feeling after the crash she couldnt explain why shed gotten so reckless he said lucky for her she knew the chief of police he let her off with just a warning if you can believe it i cant believe you cant keep your hands up cap answered stepping away and removing his mouth guard take a moment without the guard i think trying to talk is wearing you out lou obliged and took a few deep breaths to catch up just for a minute or two he said i promise to keep my hands up did you get everything i said about carolyn meacham most of it obviously she was distressed about what her husband had done it could have been that any clue what set him off no idea lou said he really was a talented doctor and an interesting guy his aa recovery seemed right on track and he hadnt had any issues with his temper since he got in trouble four years ago cap continued shifting from foot to foot like a runner at a red light staying loose i heard on the news cap said that one victim before she died had said something about no witnesses they were speculating thats what meacham was saying during his rampage no witnesses i suppose it had something to do with that lady he was yelling at what lady on the news i saw them interviewing her apparently she left the office right before your pal went ballisticso to speak she said that meacham had screamed at her about her weight and that she ran off in tears she got home turned on the tv and saw the shooting on the news first im hearing of that lou said i probably should have been watching more tv nobody should ever be watching more tv bro unless its the fridaynight fights so what was this no witnesses thing all about lou toweled off and feeling himself beginning to stiffen started his own sidetoside shuffle he needed more sparring time but cap was one of the wisest people he knew if the man was interested enough to ask his question was worth answering according to the police lou went on the only victim who lived long enough to say anything quoted meacham as saying no witnesses thats strange i agree but why because if i understand what went down correctly the potentially strongest witness the woman i saw interviewed had left the office before the shooting puzzled lou looked across at his sparring partner what are you getting at he asked the kids from the streetthe ones i traintheyd call that redonkulous redonkulous yeah its a portmanteau portmanteau i always thought you spent too much time reading i have a vocabulary notebook i hardly ever get to use what i write down in it but heres my chance portmanteau means a new word formed by joining two others and combining their meanings redonkulous is a blending of the words ridiculous and donkey it implies something bizarre or impossible to the extreme why donkey poker donkey cap said matteroffactly whats that cap shook his head in dismay doc you need to hang on the streets more often get back in touch with the people poker donkey is just what it sounds likea really bad poker player okay i got it so why is what i said redonkulous say its true and meacham was shouting no witnesses while hes gunning folks down okay why would he be worried about witnesses what did he think these people had witnessed lous chest began to tighten as an anxious feeling took hold hed be worried they had witnessed him yelling at a patient john was already on probation with the medical board about his drinking and his temper which is why he was under pwo supervision an outburst like that might have cost him his license for good no witnesses cap said but this lady he yelled at shed already left the building before he started shooting obviously she was a witness and someone he couldnt get at now you think john realized his mistake after the shootings otherwise he probably would have gone after the lady and plugged her instead of himself its possible lou said its sort of like meachams widow realizing after the fact how she caused an accident because she was trying to prevent one if thats the case then carolyn wasnt just traumatized by her husbands death she was acting just as crazy as he was cap reinserted his mouth guard put up his gloved hands and resumed his fancy footwork not just crazy he said redonkulously crazy chapter babs peterbee the sixtythreeyearold matronly receptionist greeted lous arrival with a look befitting a funeral lou was accustomed to seeing the effervescent woman lodged behind her desk in the cramped physician wellness office but throughout all the tragic clients disciplinary hearings and budget crises he had never seen her looking so deeply concerned hes waiting for you in his office peterbee said as he approached her meticulous workstation mood lou asked cat im so sorry dr welcome it was a poorly guarded secret that the staff at the pwo measured walter filstrups demeanor on the saffirsimpson scale the one used by meteorologists to rate the power of hurricanes the director seemed to enjoy his reputation and fostered it most days filstrup was a category strong winds a couple of times that lou remembered he spiked up to a category but never in the two and a half years since the shrink was hired to run the pwo had he been labeled a cat by any of the staff the only thing i have to fear is fear itself lou said giving peterbee a winston churchill v before he remembered that the quote was from fdr okay he was more nervous than he was willing to admit i wish that were the case lou i really do she responded peterbee puckered her face possibly holding back tears hey lou said we both know ive been through worse just dont let anyone change you since you got here youve made a huge difference in the lives of a lot of people i can only be me lou sang to the tune of the sinatra song the pwo somehow managed to squeeze four cubicles a reception desk small conference room supply closet where they also kept the printer and fax machine and filstrups office into square feet of space teeth on full clench lou knocked on the directors closed door imagining his dentist dr moskowitz poised by one of the spaceage chairs in his dental office licking his chops as a couple of crowns drew ever closer ready for battle he thought come on in he heard filstrup say the man sounded bright and unburdened another bad sign filstrups office was as usual cluttered and uninviting his bookshelves overflowed with medical textbooks and his desk was lost beneath dictations articles and clients chartsan absolute hipaa nightmare by contrast the psychiatrist himself was neatly and nattily dressed in a favored blue suit crisp white dress shirt and solid gray tie he was a trim modestly built man his horseshoe head of hair was a chestnut brown his glasses gold wirerimmed and his face without distinctive features filstrup took off his glasses cleaned them with a tissue and rubbed at his eyes sit down lou he instructed his deep baritone was belied by his size lou removed papers from the aeron chair set them down on the carpeted floor and took the seat himself so how are you holding up filstrup asked there was no detectable anger in his voice which was a source of some surprise where was the rage that crimson forehead im doing okay walter lou said given the circumstances how about you im doing all rightgiven the circumstances filstrup said its over lou realized at that moment walter is calm because its already over walter lets cut to the chase lou said im assuming you asked to meet with me to discuss the situation in kings ridge now almost smirking filstrup snapped open up a case file that lou assumed belonged to john meacham lou watched as his boss flipped unhurriedly through the pages we talked about this case when i took over as director for the pwo do you remember lou managed a microscopic nod how in the hell could i forget walter walter filstrup had assumed the helm of the pwo from dr abigail stevenson with all the grace and patience of a deer trapped in a living room his first act was to demand that the two assistant directors review in front of him all the active cases the ads were lou and a passive little psychiatrist named ollie comer who had been there since the programs inception twelve or thirteen years ago and was on the tail end of a profound protracted burnout the discussion surrounding john meacham was not pretty during the pitched battle over lous choice of treatment comer who was not in recovery and had actually been lous monitor following his release from rehab said not a word john meacham should have been seeing a psychiatrist filstrup said now echoing his position from that unpleasant day after he had taken over the operation you say it like its a fact walter lou countered as he did then as though there isnt another option that would have worked for a case like john meacham there isnt filstrup shot back now lou had to once again clench his jaws to keep himself from a useless inflammatory snide retort when filstrup took over the pwo john meacham was doing just fine he was attending aa meetings daily sometimes twice a day abstaining from any alcohol or other drugs and not surprisingly given the work he was doing on himself keeping his anger issues in check twelve steps to remaking a lifeand john meacham had taken them all and would keep on taking them lou firmly believed alcoholism is a disease not a moral issue walter weve been through this before no youve been through this with me and i havent agreed you havent listened i know what i do here works i have successful case after successful case to prove it why because you were once a drug addict yourself that gives you all the authority here its been my opinion lou that your past experiences dont help your judgment they cloud it john didnt need psychotherapy if thats what youre getting at lou said he needed to get sober and to keep going to meetings and thats what he was doing until he killed seven people i cant think of one of your cases that shouldnt have involved some degree of psychotherapy filstrup said i conducted a thorough review of your clients including ones from before i joined the pwo you recommend a comprehensive mental health course of treatment less than ten percent of the time in your substance abuse cases because thats not the way were going to get their licenses reinstated lou said feeling heat beginning to scorch the back of his neck psychotherapy can drag on and on when recovery is no farther away than attendance at meetings and adherence to the principles of aa the first of which is that you cant drink there may be other approaches and programs that will get drunks sober but this is one that i know works thats why i havent gone out of my way to recommend any others so john meacham is a success by your standards lou took in a sharp breath here we go no he managed no longer able to cull the strain from his voice obviously something went terribly terribly wrong with john but i was monitoring him walter he was doing everything required of him he was happy and productive we never got a positive on his urine tests this wasnt about alcohol my point exactly welcome this is a straightforward mental health issue it always was redonkulous caps portmanteau popped into his head the boxer was right and so was filstrup and so for that matter was he meacham was crazy at the moment he fired those shotsabsolutely insane but something had created the insanity and it was nothing that freud or jung or any therapist could have couched out of him we have an obligation to protect the public from doctors who pose a danger to their patients filstrup was saying lou shook his head in dismay no walter he said thats what the board of medicine is for of course we need to pay attention to that too but we also have an obligation to our docs sometimes were all they havethe only ones who are going to give them the benefit of any doubt the only ones who know and can vouch for the extent to which they are recovering from their illness filstrup had had enough john meacham did not receive proper treatment he said and thats exactly what i told the pwo board kaboom kapow dr louis francis welcome exit stage left i dont believe ive ever seen you move this definitively on a case walter he said now thats the wiseass welcome i know its elementary my dear watson you didnt follow my recommendation you went out on your own like you always do with anybody who has a drug and alcohol problem and now you are up to your glutes in casualties and disgruntled board members casualties anger tightened around lous chest he forcefully reminded himself that there was nothing to gain from going off at the man verbally or throttling him by the throat filstrup was like someone who knew nothing about weapons being presented a and a full box of ammo listen walter i think you should just get to the point the point is filstrup said slowing his speech to intentionally drag the announcement out that after considering all the facts in this case the board has unanimously approved your suspension from the pwo pending any appeals effective immediately and without pay lou showed no surprise because there was no surprise to show surprise would have been crunching filstrups peanut nose with a sharp left cross i was right to recommend meacham for a return to practice lou said finally i like this job and im good at it somewhere out there are answers as to why this happenedanswers that dont have anything to do with his need for psychotherapy and when i find out what those answers are ill be back to petition the board to reinstate me the work we do here is too important to be victimized by your narrow views the only answer youre going to come up with welcome is that i was right lou was on the street a block from the pwo headquarters with no recollection of leaving the office or the building the early afternoon was starting to get seriously warm his mouth became dry and he realized he was only a short walk from the dark cozy airconditioned comfort of the tam o shanter for years his favorite bar he walked without thinking of anything but how upset he was with walter filstrup the man was wrong as usual he didnt have any understanding of alcoholism or addiction the science was thereirrefutable identical twin studies and other excellent pieces of research alcoholism was a disease lou stepped beneath the roughhewn carving of the hat and the words the tam swinging over the heavy wooden doorway the scottish poet robert burns had written the epic poem in and more than once during his years of drug and alcohol excess lou had regaled the patrons of the place by reading the tale of a man who drinks too much and must race a hallucinated devil for his life inspiring bold john barleycorn what dangers thou canst make us scorn how in the hell could filstrup blame him in any way for what happened in kings ridge suspending him this way was like shooting the bearer of bad news the sounds and smells of the tam started tapes whirring in lous head his mouth became even drier he licked his lips and began thinking how easy it would be to get even with filstrup by just getting smashed furious now he took a step toward the alreadycrowded bar then he took another at that moment other tapes began playingsnatches of nine years of meetings and long walks and talks no one ever said it was always going to be easy pick up the phone before you pick up a drink its perfectly okay to want to lou wasnt even aware he had taken out his cell phone cap its me he heard himself saying im inside the tam no i havent okay ill get out now ten minutes ill be out there sunshine replaced the comforting gloom the music and the tapes stopped robert burnss poem faded lou walked across the street and leaned against a building to wait for his sponsor nine years and he still wasnt safe without constant vigilance he realized he never would be chapter unable to clear john meacham out of his thoughts lou headed back to the town of kings ridge the decision to share some of what he knew with gilbert stone had essentially been made for him by cap duncan and walter filstrupthe one who was certain that there was a pattern of extremely odd thinking and actions at work in the community and the other who had decreed that lou was to have an unexpected bolus of free unstructured time on his hands stone strode into the police station waiting area from behind an imposing steel door he was dressed as on the night he and lou first mettan uniform black tie metal star his engaging smile showcased what lou guessed were topoftheline caps the night just past had been a frantic one for him with calls from a dozen or so of his pwo clients who had been informed by filstrup of his suspension the best lou could offer them was his assurance that he would fight to restore his status and continue to be available to them in an unofficial capacity in the meantime he promised each of them that he would do everything within the limits of his new situation to continue to help them lou had come away from his roadside encounter with stone toting a wariness of the mans oblique manner of asking questions and an uneasy respect for the degree to which he had his finger on the pulse of his town kings ridge may have looked and felt like mayberry rfd but this man was no bumpkin dr welcome stone said shaking lous hand like a human garlic press good to see you again son that knot and cut there on your head look to have settled down pretty good its fine please call me lou lou it is stone replied his expression as inscrutable as it had been at the scene of the accident i almost said welcome dr welcome i suppose you get that a lot from time to time lou understated in fact except to tell him and his brother that their name came from someplace in england their father had no knowledge of or interest in its origin over the years lou had developed a number of different responses to inquiries about it ranging from that it was modified from the finnish word velkommen which was a soft incredibly cuddly arctic hare to that his greatgreatgrandfather had it officially changed to welcome from the welsh getthehellawayfromhere thanks for seeing me he said this time no problem at all when a person calls with something to talk about pertinent to a multiplehomicide investigation well naturally that person becomes an immediate priority now lets go chat in my office the sprawling redbrick onestory station was according to its cornerstone just four years old stones office occupied the entire end of one wing two long opposing walls of glass were shielded by drawn blinds the wall facing his massive oak desk was a bookcase filled with law tomes and other professional volumes in addition there were a number of contemporary thrillers including what appeared to be close to the entire colors collection of john d macdonald one of lous favorites the wall behind the desk featured laminated testimonials and a variety of photos of stone posing with a whos who of state and national dignitaries nice digs on the trip back to kings ridge lou had wrestled with a serious moral dilemma how to discuss his relationship with john and carolyn meacham without violating the legally protected confidentiality of the pwo it certainly seemed from news broadcasts as if walter filstrup had already released details of the murderers relationship with the organization it was safe to assume that wily gilbert stone knew at least some of meachams history information probably unearthed beginning the day the physician first moved to the area how much lou should disclose now was the issue since hed signed on as an assistant director of the program he had protected its clients the way he protected the anonymity of people in aa still as things stood the odds of his winning reinstatement from the pwo board of directors were about as long as those of a mule taking the kentucky derby to win out lou would need to prove that meachams actions were the result of something that no monitoring program could ever have predicted and to do that he was going to need gilbert stones help first he had to convince the chief of police and himself that there might be something wrong at the deland regional hospital and in his town stone took a spiralbound notebook from his desk drawer and motioned lou to a danish modern chair across from him so lets have it he said okay lou replied leaning forward beyond the obvious im beginning to wonder if there might be something really strange going on in kings ridge son ive been chief of police here for over twenty years trust me when i tell you theres a lot of strange things going on in kings ridge now if by strange you mean an explanation besides insanity for john meachams rampage well im all ears what if i told you that the shootings were a case of flawed reasoning on johns part and that there might be a similar pattern of seriously flawed reasoning at work in other people id want to know about it right here right now it took fifteen minutes to share what lou had decided he wouldhis role with the pwo meachams alcoholism and anger management issues the verbal abuse of a patient four years ago that had gotten meacham into hot water with the dc board of medicine and finally the verbal assault reported to the police by his patient roberta jennings first of all lou went on there was no alcohol in his system tests for other drugs of abuse are pending but alcohol was always the one for himthe trigger for his outbursts secondly it seems as if he kept repeating no witnesses during the attack what did he mean by that stones expression was puzzled we know all this son he said our detectives and the staties are the ones who are conducting the investigation and doing the interviews except it doesnt make any sense lou countered did anyone ask carolyn meacham or any of their friends if he had been acting weird lately stange thoughts unusual mannerisms any neurologic signsa tic perhaps how about roberta jennings what did she have to say what did she see that afternoon in the office a man killing his neighbors and coworkers makes no sense at all i agree but whats your point lets say meacham was worried about there being witnesses because he knew his behavior would cost him his medical licensepossibly for good so youre claiming thats why he shot all those people exactlyto keep there from being any witnesses except he never went after the most important witness of allroberta jennings herself stone just frowned crazy is just that he said unpredictable inconsistent maybe the bubble just popped and he saw all that blood and all those bodies and just like that came to his sensestook his own life before he could do any more damage thats exactly my point he waited until roberta jennings had left the building before he acted if his real motivation was to eliminate all witnesses he should have started shooting before roberta got out the front door check with any profiler who knows about workplace violence im sure theyll agree first kill the object of your rage then go after the others something was going on in the chemistry of meachams brain it may not be something physical like a tumor or blood vessel malformation but something had disrupted the delicate balance of transmitters connecting the neurons of his brain i suppose we could look into that stone said i appreciate you sharing your theories with me stone looked as if he were about to end their session but i told you theres more lou said i was there at the hospital for a few hours before john officially died some of the doctors and nurses treating him were not following standard protocol for a gunshot victim some of their actions were poorly thought out to the point of actually being dangerous now wait just a minute stone said you can slander my dog and even my children but dont you go disparaging our hospital we take a lot of pride in that place as a doctor im sure you know its reputation lou saw that he had hit a nerve and immediately backed off but he did tell stone about prichaps odd fishing expedition into meachams brain dr prichap is pretty new here stone replied but ive never heard anyone say a bad word about him i have a cousin the man operated ona disk i think or a spur of some sort shes dancin around like a chicken now well i dont like to speak badly of any doc and dr prichap may just have been having an off day but what he did was illogical and didnt demonstrate the best judgment stone sighed youre the doctor but im not sure youre giving me much to go on here meacham could have just snapped after roberta left the office prichap might have felt getting that bullet out was the only chance he had this doesnt scream pattern to me what about carolyn meacham he asked trying another tack she almost killed us trying to chase down a driver with one busted taillight she was trying to prevent an accident that would never have happened afterwards she couldnt figure out why she had done it flawed judgment again stone appeared slightly more interested so what weve got here are three seemingly illogical acts each resulting in undesirable outcomesa shooting a medical procedure and a car accident is that about right thats right and what is it you suggest we do from here doctor lets keep looking for patterns something strange and out of the ordinary other than the obvious other than the obvious i think we should interview carolyn meacham and the people close to her same for anthar prichap and the staff who cared for meacham in the icu no way were going to allow you to do anything of the sort stone said but i will speak to the staties in charge about your theories lou felt his future with the pwo slipping away chief stone he said im in some real hot water at the physician wellness office in fact ive been suspended the only way im going to get my job back is to prove i didnt totally misjudge john meachams capacity for violent outbursts and the only way im going to do that is to speak with some of the people involved how about roberta jennings is there any way i could talk to herask her about johns demeanor right before the shootings stone mulled over the request bobbis pretty shook up about things he said but she did say shed try to cooperate in any way she could lou held his breath without warning stone stood up let me talk with her he said see what she has to say thanks chief i really appreciate that well i appreciate you bringing all of this to my attention lou sat alone for several long minutes thinking about filstrup meacham the pwo and all the docs his suspension had left adrift he was thinking about calling to check in with emily when the policeman returned well i got good news lou he said slipping on his woollined bomber jacket it took a little convincing but robertas agreed to meet with you lou brightened that is great news he said what did you have to do not much stone said grinning i just told her that id be right there beside her while you did your questioning turns out that was all the convincing she required chapter roberta jennings lived on a quiet deadend street in a carefully maintained ranchstyle home though there were pictures of grown children and grandchildren throughout the house the decor could hardly be considered child friendly the living room was dominated by an extensive collection of lladro figurines proudly displayed inside two ceilinghigh glass cases the plush walltowall carpet was pearl white and the furniture was small firm and uninviting the object of john meachams outburst was roosted on a hardback chair looking about as comfortable as her furniture lou noticed a tremor of her fleshy hands as she sipped her tea and suspected it might represent early onset parkinsons disease or perhaps a familial tremor meanwhile the springs of her victorian sofa were digging into his backside he tried without success to shift into a more comfortable position are you sure you wont have something to eat or drink she asked him gesturing toward a platter piled high with oreos and an assortment of butter cookies beside the snacks was a porcelain teapot steam wafting from its spout no thank you lou said we really dont mean to take up too much of your time jennings puckered her lips gave lou a disappointed glance and then swallowed three of the cookies one after another without much chewing as a doctor lou found it difficult not to feel deep concern for the womans health much as he knew john meacham had done jenningss ankles were swollen purplish and crammed inside shoes that at that time of the day at least were way too small for her she wore polyester pants that allowed give for an expanding waistline and her neck and chin were flabby her excessive weight had drained most of the luster from her face and while roberta was perhaps sixty lou guessed her bodys age to be fifteen years older i dont get many visitors jennings said after a sip of her tea since terry died i havent been very sociable terry was lou asked her husband and one of the best guys youd ever have the pleasure of knowing stone interjected me and terry used to go duck hunting together best shot in the county ask anyone who knows and theyd tell you the same the absolute best shot im sorry for your loss lou said when did he pass on about a year ago jennings said he had a heart attack it happened so suddenly one minute here the next minute gone if it was that quick he probably didnt suffer any lou said feeling the response though well intended was lame dr meacham pleaded with him to lose weight same as he did with me he knew you were headed for the same fate lou thought im sorry i have to bring up those memories of terry and also of what happened that day in dr meachams office he said but chief stone told me you might be willing to tell me what you remember jennings looked tense i have a hard time just thinking about it she said again stone cut in bobbi dr welcome here is looking to ask some real simple questions hes promised that if anything he says upsets you too much hell skip it dr meacham yelled at me jennings said her voice breaking its as simple as that right out of the blue he yelled at me besides that lou asked did he say or do anything unusual it could have been something minor a tic perhaps or an odd movement some sort of warning that he was going to erupt was he at all unsteady on his feet did his speech become slurred or thickened jennings shook her head no nothing of the sort he was lucid calm and reasonable and then he just went crazy and nothing specific that you remember set him offsomething you said or did he weighed me if thats what you mean can you tell me about that he had me coming in every month one visit he would just check my weight and blood pressure with my clothes on and talk to me about the dietician and whatever program i was trying the next visit one of his nurses poor women would be there after i got undressed to weigh me with a johnny on then dr meacham would examine me and order blood if he thought that was necessary and how was your weight this time i dont really remember jennings said probably quicker than she had intended dead end lous med school had spent hours teaching the students to avoid the pitfalls of asking leading questionsquestions with the answers built in does your chest pain ever go down your left arm and up into your jaw he knew he was dangerously close to descending into that approach now he flashed on what cap had said not just crazy lou redonkulously crazy john meacham had taken a situation every doctor regularly encountereda patient unable or unwilling to take the measures necessary to get healthy or even to stay aliveand had blown his response far beyond what would be expected or acceptable it was the same sort of reaction his wife had exhibited when confronting the car with one taillight out dont give up he urged himself tell me mrs jennings did you have any interactions with dr meacham outside of the clinic were you involved in any clubs together community organizations church groups anything like that not that i can think of jennings said looking disappointed at being disappointing unless you count him giving me dirty looks when he saw what i was eating at millies millies worldfamous millies diner stone answered i cant believe you havent eaten there or at least heard of it if comfort food needed comfort it would eat what millie was serving up best burgers in the state mac and cheese that tastes like what your mama used to make chicken wings spicier than cinemax after dark if you havent eaten at millieshell sonyou havent eaten its about four miles outside of the town center on highway i cant believe youre a friend of dr meachams and hes never taken you there jennings added i work a lot lou replied well since terry died i eat there three or four times a week jennings said gazing wistfully out the window guess you could blame millies for some of my issues with dr meacham i never was quite this heavy but without my terry around well i just lost the will to cook plus my friends all eat there too so i have their company i usually order the corn bread chicken pot pie or beef stew or if im in a real adventurous mood the creamy cajun chicken pasta uncertain precisely why lou sensed his interest perk so dr meacham knew you ate there and tried to lecture you about making healthier choices he asked jennings made a face that suggested lou had missed her point dr meacham and his wife probably ate there almost as much as i did she said only it seemed like he was a stickler for the lighter fare like the glazed chicken breast with brown rice or else something like turkey stew i checked to see if i could catch him eating the macaroni and four cheeses or the lobster newburg but i really never did i cant believe millies is news to me lou said is that the sort of thing you were looking to know dr welcome at this point anything you can share with me is helpful chief stone clearly sensed that lous fishing expedition had gone as far as it could he hoisted himself off the couch with a grunt then stretched a stiff leg bobbi youve been incredibly generous with your time he said i realize this has been a traumatic experience for you if you do happen to think of anything along the lines of what dr welcome was asking about you know how to reach me lou stood as well and handed the woman his business card do you mind if i write my cell phone number down there he asked realizing that the vindictive filstrup had possibly already had his extension shut off i hope ive been of some help dr welcome jennings said if there is some way to explain this unexplainable evil id do anything i could to assist you youve been most gracious mrs jennings lou had turned to follow stone out when his cell phone sounded the caller id on the display screen read simply daddyo and the ringtone was the beatles hard days night lou clicked the green talk button hey pops he said im just leaving a meeting can i call you right back im starving dennis said ignoring lous question what are you doing his father had the voice of a fourpackaday smoker despite his never having taken a puff of a cigarette dennis welcome lived in virginia about a twentyminute drive from kings ridge and considered lous home in dc close enough to permit dropofthehat meetups and as he was again between jobs and handled being alone about as well as a lemming the spirit lately moved him to try at least a couple times each week you know what dad im pretty hungry myself lou said as he followed stone down the walk to the cruiser great meet me at the wave rider in thirty lou knew his father was already salivating to be treated to his beloved wave rider bacon burger but he had another idea actually dad im thinking we should try someplace different this time dennis welcome snorted into the phone yeah he asked what are you thinking have you ever heard of a place called millies chapter everybody eats at millies the block lettering above the main entrance was set beneath a tenfoot enamel rainbow judging by the number of cars in the parking lot as the noon hour approached lou believed the claim had some muscle behind it waiting in the busy lobby for his father he used the time to scan the photographic history of the place which had gone from a classic railroad car diner through a number of incarnations and reincarnations according to the text accompanying the photos millies had opened for business thirtyfive years before with a fivethousanddollar bank loan ten soontobe maxedout credit cards and one very determined ownercumcook named millie neuland the original railroad car endured and now glorified by an imaginative designer held sway at the epicenter of a vast dining room surrounded by a dozen private salons given that lou had lived in the region most of his life he was impressed that his path and the restaurants had never crossed impressed but not that surprised renee was totally into foods of various ethnicities and in his life before her he ate far less than he could have worked far more hours than he should have and spent what money he managed to hang on to in dark parts of the city that featured no rainbows in the years since its grand opening millie neuland bought up much of the surrounding acreage paved a parking area the size of a fairground and at one point added a quasi motel on the far side of the lot to house the cooks and waitstaff everybody eats at millies or works there after a lifetime of dealing with his father lou became aware of his presence almost before he had entered the building dennis welcome was an expansive barrelchested charmer with a saltandpepper crew cut and a deeply etched face that seemed perpetually tanned his wardrobe consisted of one or two pairs of jeans heavy virtually indestructible work boots and perhaps a hundred flannel shirts of various colors and plaids this day he had chosen a forest green dennis was devoted to his two sons and granddaughter only slightly more than to his red chevy pickup the miles on its odometer and the local union sticker fixed to the center of its rear window barring the year or so following the cancer death of his wife he was the most inexorably upbeat person lou had ever known except when it came to holding on to his money whether it was water bottling real estate new toys or a chain of barber shops he was as capable of losing investments as he was at making people believe in them mindless of the milling crowd dennis embraced his older son with a frontal heimlich maneuver that would have dislodged a tbone from the throat of a grizzly bear food here any good he asked ignoring the menu lou had handed him they have everything here dad burgers if youd look at the menu youd see theres a whole page devoted to burgers its like the size of the phone book besides why do i need a menu when i have a doctor here to look at it for me what about just a plain old cheeseburger they have any of those you know i dont like any of that fancy crap on my cheeseburgers they have cheeseburgers dad bacon cheeseburgers too probably comes with an avocado on it come on lou said taking his fathers tattooed solidly muscled arm lets go sit down the lunch crowd continued filing in around them to be quickly tended to by a team of pretty chipper hostesses there were plenty of available booth seats around the wall encompassing the main dining room and a number of empty tables as well but dennis as lou knew he would made a beeline for the counter seating insisting as always that he liked being up high and that the swivel action of the stools benefited his arthritic hip the counter like the rest of the massive dining area was well wornpossibly by design lou reflected or possibly because of the difficulty in catering to everybody while keeping the place buff varnish was worn away in some spots and the brass fixtures were short a good polishing still the overall effect was an inviting charm and warmth as if to underscore the motto of the place the walls and wooden pilasters featured autographed photos of celebrities and politicians usually paired with a perpetually beaming milliethe quintessential grandmother lou recognized two former virginia governors several players from the redskins nationals and wizards as well as a rapper whom emily adored but renee despised as they made their way to the counter lou caught snippets of conversation from the expanding sea of patrons nearly everything he heard dealt with the meacham murders lou and dennis grabbed adjacent stools sandwiching themselves between two much older gentleman each of whom appeared to be dining alone the wall facing them opened on the kitchen where perhaps a dozen whiteuniformed cooks and chefs of various kinds were picking up steam for the lunchtime rush ahead flames fueled by dripping grease danced in the background creating sizzling steaks that lou could smell the culinary ballet was impressive and for a time father and son watched mesmerized the stainless steel counters just opposite the grill were lined with cutting boards large mixing bowls and trays of vegetables movement sound aroma cue the cash registers it was good to see dennis immersed in something other than the wallmounted tvs at his beloved wave runner the narrow passage between the counter and the kitchen was patrolled by a tall gaunt waitress with crowsfeet eyes and tousled red hair the same height as her head her name tag read iris nothing about her personality explained why she was working with the public not surprisingly dennis ordered a cheeseburger fries and a coke we dont have coke iris said okay pepsi then no pepsi we only serve millie cola millie cola lou what is this place a place that only serves millie cola he said why dont you give it a try okay one millie cola and one glass of ice water on the side dennis said iris scowled and wrote on her pad and how would you like your cheeseburger with cheese dennis said another scowl lou went for the cobb salad and an iced tea so how ya you doing dennis asked once their cadaverous server had moved on you mean about john meacham lou asked as usual having no problems reading the man your brother called he said he suspected you might have had something to do with meacham through your work apparently the papers said he was an alcoholic and had been involved with a group like yours in dc graham could have called and just asked me im in his speed dial have they mentioned your name not yet but you did i did what have something to do with the guy like graham said i did yes and are you in trouble speak softer dad are you in any trouble graham said you might be if graham a successful money manager worked as hard at keeping dennis away from recurrent fiscal ruin as he did pointing out the mistakes lou was forever making in his life there might have been significantly less red ink in the family ill give him a call later on so maybe hell stop speculating lou said he wondered if the younger welcome had reasoned out that lous job might be on the line as well or worse your brothers smart dennis understated he figures things out tell me about it so so i dont know im still trying to piece it all together lou could sense the old man to his right straining to listen in he turned his back a few more inches and lowered his voice even further if he had known dennis was going to be in a chatty mood he would have insisted on a booth he should have been able to predict it the violence surrounding the meacham case was the sort of thing that utterly fascinated his fatherand most other people for that matter he fall off the wagon dennis asked nope that much im sure of drugs you know i consider drugs and alcohol flip sides of the same coin in that case it doesnt make any sense i agree with you there pop no warning not that i can find it doesnt make any sense dennis reiterated usually a guy goes ballistic and kills a bunch of people then folks start coming out of the woodwork to say how they knew he was unstable a loner distant that sort of thing so far none of that lou said or else if its a serial killer they all say how he was just the nicest guy in the world and always had a cheerful word for everyone and that they cant figure out how two dozen bodies got buried in his backyard without anyone suspecting a thing their drinks arrived dennis sipped his apprehensively i dont generally like any excuses for coke he said but this ones pretty good im glad they could please you you should let the waitress know i dont think she likes me nonsense your charm is winning her over i can tell so why are you out here actually i drove out to talk with the chief of police he set me up to meet with one of the witnesses that was nice of him i suppose dad theres something really strange going on around kings ridge careful to keep his voice out of range of the old man to his right lou told his father what he had shared with gilbert stone when he was finished dennis fixed him with the same sort of curious stare he typically reserved for people with excessive body piercing that is odd he said one or two weirdos might be a coincidence five or six is a trendunless of course youre overreading things always possible lunch arrived and after one bite dennis welcome appeared to have become a convert to the church of millie neuland call me delicious he said to the reedlike waitress brandishing his cheeseburger with two hands she favored him with an enigmatic smile that might have announced she no longer considered him a form of pond scum fresh food makes all the difference she said yeah just how fresh are we talking about here fresh as in everything we serve is local produce meat we even bake our own bread i would call that fresh dennis said wiping away the juice from another bite of cow lou smiled to see his father so upbeat with onthejob injuries recurrent layoffs the premature death of his beloved wife and one financial disaster after another the man had not had it easy but one could rarely ever tell without warning iris planted her palms on the counter and leaned in close to lou i overheard you boys talking about john meacham she whispered you know a bunch of the crunchy granolas around here are talking about having some sort of memorial service for the victims thats nice lou said sensing where the woman was heading but theyre also talking about including the murderer i mean he is a murderer seven times over i say burn the box theyve got him stashed away in and flush those ashes lou stopped eating and fixed the woman with a baleful stare dr meacham was a friend of mine he said sensing he was about to boil over he had a wife children its fine for you to have an opinion on matters but your opinion is getting close to spoiling my meal iris lost color topped off lous iced tea from a pitcher and then left muttering i told you that graham called didnt i dennis said changing the subject with the subtlety and grace of a

it a readthrough is all im asking fine ill give it a read fine can you pass me the ketchup from a spot down the counter the waitress nodded smugly that she hadnt missed a word of the fatherson exchange and approved of how the discussion had gone the tolerance lou had developed for people struggling with their lives was nudged a bit by the woman though not nearly to his limit the distraction was quickly interrupted by a vegetable chef who was turning a row of peeled carrots into perfect orange disks he performed the maneuver with the dexterity of a neurosurgeon the movement like working a pump handle was all wrist with the point of the huge blade never leaving the cutting board the sound of the broad end of the knife snapping down was like an ak submachine gun but what caught lous eye wasnt just watching the pro at work it was the youthful frecklefaced cook directly to the chefs right the young mans dark brown eyes were fixated on the slicing end of the razorsharp knife his right hand was just six inches or so from the carrot pieces that were flipping out from the blade like poker chips once then again it looked to lou as if the young mantwentytwo if thatwas going to make a move to snatch one of the newly minted coins from the cutting board lou tensed the chef lost in concentration remained fixed on his gleaming blade which never came up off the cutting board more than a millimeter or so farther than it had to another flinch from the boythis time involving not only his hand but his shoulder as well the kid was going to go for it lou felt certain of it pushing back from the counter he rose from his stool no one seemed aware of the drama that was playing outleast of all the husky chef himself to lous left dennis was lost in the glory of his perfect burger one more slight tic by the boy and lou had seen enough but it was too late the kid seemed to be lost in some sort of hypnotic fugue state timing his moves like a striking rattlesnake his latexgloved hand shot out toward a particular perfect orange disk nooooo lou cried out toppling his tall stool backwards and diving arms outstretched across the counter the heavy teninch blade snapped down on the boys extended thumb with unimaginable force bone cracked like a snipers shot the boys shriek filled the enormous dining room accompanied moments later by the screams from dozens of others then there were more unrelenting shrieks from the vegetable cutting board in the kitchen came a geyser of blood chapter oh jesus my thumb my thumb in an instant blood was everywhere spurting into the air from within the tattered rubber glove and cascading across the wooden chopping board onto the floor lou vaulted over the counter and past the waitress whose expression gave no indication that the startling event had even registered he slammed into the chaos of the kitchen through a swinging door with an eyelevel porthole as a crush of customers and staff closed in behind him its joey someone cried out joeys cut his finger off lous powers of observation were immediately heightened seconds passed as minutes the world around him began moving in slow motion his tone became firmer but his speech slowed what might have been dozens of factors were analyzed and synthesized at once crunch mode im a trauma specialist from eisenhower memorial he heard himself announce calmly please give me room give me some room someone call nineoneone and tell me when youve done it one of you bring over some rubber gloves the rest of you back away please incredibly the boy was still on his feet staring down at his hand with what appeared to be little comprehension blood had sprayed across his white apron like a macabre piece of spin art the blade had crunched through the bone just above the metacarpophalangeal jointthe knuckle separating the digit from the hand it had been a vicious cut requiring almost unimaginably intense force the bone had been splintered more than sheared in two some soft tissue remained intact at the basea piece of good fortune that would enable optimum anatomical alignment in preparing the boy for transport still as things stood two bloody tendons and a bridge of skin were all that kept the digit from dropping into the stack of bloodsoaked carrots if this were a single finger other than the thumb it seemed quite possible the hand surgeon would opt simply to complete the amputation but this was the thumbthe digit that because it could be pressed against the pads of the other four fingers on the hand created the opposition that in essence separated primates from other animals writing grasping fine motor skills for life to go on as it was for this youth meticulous reimplantation was critical and preserving anatomical relationships and circulation had to be lous mission but first there was the matter of the kid himself lou grabbed a towel and laid it over the boys hand instantly the white cloth became soaked in crimson joey is that your name lou asked supporting him by the shoulders joey the kid managed he began shrieking again and raised his hand to eye level heavy drops of blood fell from beneath the towel he just stuck his hand in there the chef cried out the heavy bloodcovered blade still in his hand i never saw him jesus joey what in the hell were you thinking joeys fair freckled complexion was ashenone of the early changes of shock all right joey lou said im going to lower you down here you go doc someone said a box of disposable rubber gloves appeared on the high bench where the accident had occurred from his earliest days in the hospital lou had to battle against the intense urge to dive right in and help whenever there was an open bleeding wound then articles began appearing in the literature reporting the surprisingly large percent of hivpositive patients found in sequential testing in both inner city and suburban emergency wards and finally conversion to positive happened to a fellow moonlighter who didnt follow protocol in a small affluent community hospital fifty miles outside of dc please no one come near the blood without having gloves on he said donning a pair and quickly backing it up with another one of you roll an apron under his neck and someone else get his legs elevated with something under his knees and ankles the higher the better if theres a blanket around put it over him and i need towels lots of towels he brought his mouth next to joeys ear joey my name is dr louis welcome call me lou hang in there with me and well get you fixed up okay he took a clean towel and slid it in as a replacement for the bloodsoaked one do you have any allergies to medications any past surgery he craned his neck back until he made eye contact with his father then he pulled his car keys from his pants pocket ask that guy over there in the green plaid shirt to get my medical bag from the trunk of my car he ordered the chef nearest to his left then get me a large bowl of ice water and some dishwashing soap dove palmolive anything you have is okay the circle of people gathered around them began to close in youve got to back up lou said firmly applying gentle pressure give us more room blood flowed from the wound in thick spurts hemostasis ice cleansing he evaluated the pluses and minuses of each maneuver stop bleeding get alignment sterilize protect any microscopic arteries that might still be intact lou made decisions while talking to the boy almost continuously a single rolled apron had been placed under joeys neck and stacks of towels were now elevating his legs from the knees down lou rested the damaged hand palm down on a clean towel gently adjusting the thumb into an anatomically correct position okay joey listen to me now everything is going to be just fine im going to help help me joey answered back meekly please help me someone give me a scissors please lou pulled one of the towels from the pile and cut off a long threeinch strip next he wrapped the strip twice around the middle of joeys forearm and tied it off the bleeding began to slow to add torque lou slipped a wooden cook spoon under the strip and turned it until the bleeding began to slow even more he made note of the time there may have been as much as two hours of wiggle room to keep the tourniquet on before there was tissue damage but he had no desire to cut things that close here you go lou he heard dennis say lous heavy black leather bag materialized on the floor beside his knee a number of states had enacted good samaritan laws to protect doctors who offered help in an emergency from being sued but many of those laws were vaguely constructed and some had even been challenged in court as a result there were docs who went out of their way to avoid involvement in trauma or medical emergenciesan aspect of his profession lou had never been proud of instead he had chosen to make himself better prepared he carried a wellequipped medical bag in his trunk and at one point had actually participated on a committee that helped the airlines to design a sensible and useful emergency firstaid kit that could be placed on planes you still with me joey yes im with you sir the physical evidence of shock had already begun to recede and some strength had returned to the youths voice bleeding had been reduced to an ooze i need that icy dishwashing soap now lou called out given that the ambulance would be there soon there was little in lous emergency bag that would be of major help but there was gauze and a great splintthumbsized threequarters of an inch wide pliable aluminum backed with foam rubber and just as important there was a pair of shears that could shape it years had passed since he had put the splints and shears into his kit who knew he irrigated the wound carefully wrapped the laceration measured off a piece of splint well more than twice the length of the thumb and twisted it into a u that held the fracture in an anatomically perfect position with three inches of aluminum extending across the wrist and onto the hand front and back then again from the kit he snapped open a chemical ice pack and set it on the bandage by the time the cold was gone joey would be undergoing treatment lou finished the job with heavy cotton batting up to the tourniquet and two ace bandages youre doing great pal lou said to him youre one tough customer ill tell you that you are really something lou checked the youths blood pressure one hundred reasonable he continued the stream of encouraging banter youre doing just great joey just great out out okay back off everyone please millie neuland came rushing through the crowd if she had aged since any of the dozens of photographs of her were taken lou could see no evidence of it gray tousled hair round wirerimmed glasses bright blue eyes rouged cheeks finely painted eyebrows and a nearly perfectly round face her gingham dress frilly half apron and single strand of pearls completed the picture the quintessential grandmother lou had begun wiping off the boys pallid cheeks millie knelt next to him mindless of the blood the ambulance is on the way she said to no one but lou a genteel southern lilt in her speech if youre not a doctor son you dang well should be im millie neuland i guessed lou welcome im an er doc at eisenhower lucky us oh joey can you hear me baby you got a doctor right here with you joeys eyes fluttered open hi ma your son lou asked might as well be his names joey alderson been here at the restaurant for years looks twelve but hes near twentyfive ma i really messed up this time joey managed in a hoarse whisper how bad millie asked lou there was emotion in her voice but her tone was that of a woman used to being in charge and dealing with crisis he put his hand under a knife that was chopping carrots my father the guy over there in green and i were sitting just a few feet away how bad the restaurateur asked again encouraging no mincing of words lou glanced down at joey who appeared to have drifted off reimplantation he said sensing the word was one that the youth was unlikely to completely understand we have some wonderful hand surgeons at eisenhower memorial i can make some calls and we can get him over there i dont know you and i dont know any of the doctors at eisenhower memorial millie replied but since you work at one of the big hospitals in the city you might know that many folks out here consider a referral to there tantamount to a death sentence were very proud of our hospital here my restaurant is one of its biggest supporters in fact the surgical suite is named for me and this place joeys a little limited in some ways he may frighten easily the doctors at deland know him well they know how to be sensitive to his needs i understand lou said now measuring every single word carefully the metropolitan hospitals in cities like dc all have the reputation you spoke aboutmostly because people who are referred in are usually quite ill from the distance they could now hear the siren of an approaching ambulance lou knew that assuming his concerns about deland regional were on the mark time was running out on his chances to get joey alderson into the city a frontal assault seemed to be his only option with the approaching siren getting louder he met millie neulands gaze with his and held it millie i promise to explain my feelings later he said but i have my reasonsvery strong reasonsand i am begging you to allow me to bring joey into eisenhower memorial begging you the woman clearly nonplussed by the force behind lous words studied his face the siren now in front of the restaurant cut off moments later they could hear the voices and commotion from the direction of the main entrance lou felt his heart sinking there was nothing more to say well millie said finally if joeys going to be trucked into the city then im going with him chapter there was a time kim hajjar and her three closest dc friends met for drinks once a week but more and more their good intentions were being eroded by their professional lives their meeting spots seemed tempered as well gone were the margaritas at chichis and scorpion bowls down at the hong kong the group of women now preferred quieter watering holes where they could commiserate about jobs kids husbands or in kims case the dearth of quality men darlene would have been a welcome addition to the group but the secret service along with concerns about paparazzi made it impractical for the first lady to join their periodic earlyevening revels having been to bar none with darlene just a few days ago kim suggested it would make a good kickoff spot to enjoy a cocktail before dinner at the blue crab grill the muchhyped new restaurant on connecticut avenue the women were rarely on time for their own gatherings two of them were lawyers and like kim worked hours bordering on the cruel and unusual candice an obgyn was often held hostage by the biology of her patients usually though the group managed to carve out a few good hours always ending with the pledge that when the time came for their next gathering their friendship would override all but the most dire considerations that night kim showed up at bar none on time knowing the others probably would not having spent an exhausting day making final preparations for the visit of the president of ireland and his family she was happy to have a quiet interlude before the gang arrived kim felt lucky to have nabbed a spot at the bar but after downing a beer in fewer swigs than she would ever admit she now needed to use the ladies room she loved working for darlene but always appreciated the ease with which she could move about when unencumbered by her entourage there were no advance teams to pass judgment on the premises beforehand no agents chatting inconspicuously in the corner and best of all no one following her to the restroom when she returned to the crowded bar kim was not surprised to find her place occupied by a woman in her twenties dressed to attract several preppy swains had already picked up the scent and were beginning to circle she moved downwind to the only empty stool unfortunately the occupants next to her were an attractive couple with loveydovey eyes and exploratory hands kim sensed the alltoofamiliar pang she had had her chances over the yearsa couple of engagements and even a brief marriage to a man who was all shiny on the outside but on the inside was searching for mommy now any man who wanted to learn who she was and what mattered to her would have to do some serious digging might need something stronger than an amstel light she thought kim was working to avoid staring at the happy couple and to keep from lamenting her uninspiring love life when she felt a gentle tap on her shoulder turning kim came facetoface with nicole keanes stunning beauty the two women embraced with genuine affection i thought you said you were trapped in some sort of deposition kim said nicole olive complexioned with dark seductive eyes was as statuesque as any runway model and although none of the friends could be considered at all unattractive she was the most hit upon to the dismay of her wouldbe suitors she was also the woman with the oldest marriage license and most number of kidsthree deposition over and done nicole said it is so weird having the absolute goods on someone and sitting in a deposition listening to them lie agree kim said im as big a baseball fan as the next person but to hell with a grand slam home run or a nohitter lying under oath is the true great american pastime and i am now absolutely ready to participate in the other great american pastime she caught the bartenders eye with little trouble wild turkey neat oooh that kind of day huh loooooong nicole said as her drink appeared on the bar kim could not resist another glance at the touchyfeely couple and nicole caught her looking do you think theyre really happy kim asked both women watched as the couple kissed lightly i wouldnt say theyre unhappy nicole said but i remind you of the first rule of pepsi generation sanity i know i know never go around comparing your insides to everyone elses outsides i think we need to start importing more men is it just my imagination or is every guy in dc married or gay there are still some eligibles rooting about its not like you werent a former beauty queen darling nicole replied you just dont flaunt it i dont think my eightyhour workweeks have done much for my overall desirability thats for sure trust me youre still a stunner nicole said kim gave her friend a hug flattery my dear will get you another drink and a little cleavage on display will get you half a dozen as if on cue the bartender motioned to kim and guided a bottle of amstel light down the crowded bar to her i take it back nicole said with a face like that you can keep your cleavage in the henhouse you sure you got the right woman kim asked the man he was very clear it was for you he who kim asked looking over at a pod of perhaps a dozen and a half eager twenty and thirtysomethings beginning the evenings hustle i dont see him well what did he look like i didnt really notice he looked like all of them what can i say i think he wore glasses maybe dark hair i do know when he passed me the drink he had slid money for the beer and an extra two bucks between the bottle and the coaster two bucks nicole exclaimed the bartender chuckled if it had been a five i might have remembered him better kim turned the screw top of the bottle and wondered if it had been loosened before nothing like a couple of years in the white house to fan any spark of mistrust into a conflagration throw it away she said after a moments thought the bartender had watched her test the bottle here he said exchanging the amstel for one from the fridge youre ready for a fresh one anyhow you really think its already been opened nicole asked probably not but weirder things have happened youre right there sister the kisshappy couple gulped down their last swallows and headed for the door nicole slid onto one of the vacated stools the other women were later than usual she observed perhaps it was worth calling the moment she said the word the bar phone began ringing the allpowerful nicole kim said before she could begin wondering why whoever it was hadnt called on one of their cell phones wanna guess which one of them it is the bartender listened for a few seconds then hung up it was for you the bartender said to kim it was the guy who bought you the beer inventive nicole said creepy kim responded the jukebox had begun playing a song kim knew by the band green day the bartender leaned toward them to be heard over the increasing din he told me to tell you to look under the drink coaster intriguing nicole said double creepy kim replied her brow furrowed as she flipped the cardboard coaster over so that only she could see nicole and the bartender waited the note was written in a small neat hand kim read it and felt her stomach knot her heart rate accelerated like a drag racer as she scanned the restaurant do you see him she asked the bartender now with some urgency are you sure hes not here the man glanced about again but shook his head like i said i really didnt take a good look at him in this place guys are always buying drinks for pretty women they want to connect with its like the coin of the realm i remember what the women look like more than i remember the men the noise level in bar none had elevated as more people filtered in the bartender waited until it was clear he wasnt going to learn the contents of the message and then headed off to tend to other customers nicole scanned the room okay she said finally i give up whats it say nicole i detest pledging people to secrecy kim said grimly and the last thing i want to do is upset you but i need to keep this one to myselfat least for the time being you cant be serious i tell you about my damn sex life the good stuff too believe me baby if i had a sex life id tell you all about it too but this is businesscompany business if darlene says its okay for me to talk with you about it the first thing ill do is get you on speed dial good thing i love you nicole said kim embraced her good thing you do kim said the other two women arrived together just a couple of minutes later per her agreement with kim nicole led them to the far end of the bar so that kim could speak to a man who seemed interested in her the new arrivals giddy to be drifting away from the responsibilities of their lives acted as if they had just been told of their friends engagement as soon as the three women had melted into the evening crush kim moved back from the bar slipped the coaster from her purse and read it one more time secy evans has been framed i must speak to darlene mallory in secret if you agree to help arrange the meeting go put a dollar in the jukebox kim nodded to no one in particular replaced the coaster in her bag and moved slowly across the room toward the jukebox there was no sense in trying to pick out the writer of the note kim was convinced now that he was clever enough to keep himself disguised or concealed until he was ready to disclose himself and his purpose it felt strange to know that he was out there someplace watching clearly he had done his homework darlene was the one closest to the president who might be willing at least to listen to what this man had to say kim made her way to the jukebox taking several furtive glances over her shoulder what if the note was true what if russ evans had been railroaded into resigning she approached a man leaning up against the brick wall drinking a heinekentall intelligent with razorcut chestnut hair he looked at her unabashedly as she neared a chill ripped through her their eyes met she was just about say something when a flashy blonde in a tight white sweater came and wrapped her arms around his neck he gave a what can you do shrug and kim slunk back into the crowd it had been foolish of her to suspect the man whoever wrote the note was frightened enough to take these sorts of precautions he wouldnt be standing around making eye contact with her more people had crammed into the darkened lounge area making it impossible for her to observe them all she stopped in front of the wallmounted jukebox rifled through her purse and pulled a crisply pressed dollar bill from her wallet russ evans has been framed she kept thinking assuming it was true countless other questions were in need of answering first though there was the matter of proof and clearly that proof had to be evaluated by the first lady kims hands trembled as she inserted the bill into the machines narrow maw the song playing at the moment was voodoo child by jimi hendrixappropriate she thought given the sense that she was being manipulated the bill disappeared into the slot like a snakes tongue retreating back into its mouth as soon as it was gone kim felt a vibration from inside her purse glancing about once more she opened her bag and took out her iphone a year ago shed taken a picture of the white house during an august sunset and liking it so much she made it her iphones background image but superimposed over that image now was a semitransparent rounded rectangle bordered by a thin white line in the center of the rectangle was a singleline text message ill be in touch chapter nearly five hours had passed since the hand team had taken joey alderson to the or lou and millie neuland regularly checked the empty corridor beyond the picture window wall for any sign of his surgeon eisenhower memorials interior designers had made the family room as homelike as possible given the restrictions of a hospital a fortyeightinch flatscreen tv covered much of one wall and according to the laminated instructions tacked beside it could even stream netflix the bookshelves offered a collection of paperbacks childrens books and magazines there were also two computer workstations with wireless internet access and a kitchenetteeverything needed to pass the anxious hours whatever doubt millie harbored regarding bringing joey to eisenhower memorial seemed to have vanished before the sheer magnitude of the place and the attention to detail and family needs but it was the quiet confidence of hand surgeon dr rafe kurdi speaking to her hours ago in the er that sealed the dealespecially when he shared glowingly that he his wife and kids had once a year or so ago eaten at her restaurant this is going to be a long and complicated operation kurdi explained but just as preparing wonderful food is what you do fixing damaged hands is what i do saving joeys thumb while preserving as much function as possible is our goal we have been aided in this effort by the exceptional work that dr welcome here performed at the scene he has a welldeserved reputation in this place for knowing what he is doing joey is a very lucky young man that he was there im figuring that out millie said dr welcome insisted that we come here rather than to our local hospital lou could hear the unasked question in her voice and knew that sooner or later he might have to explain why he believed there was something terribly wrong in kings ridge and also at her beloved deland regional lou pictured joey alderson twitching with anticipation as he timed his lunge beneath the huge chopping knife going for a single bright orange slice of carrot was he yet another example lou checked the wallmounted clock nearly eight the stress was showing on millies face she hadnt appeared at all frail until now lou took hold of her hand which was surprisingly callused the woman smiled grimly i dont know what i would have done without you she said pulling a tissue from her purse to dab at her tears hes going to do fine after all these years in the er i can tell a battler when i see one do you have any idea what could have happened back there in my kitchen i saw most of it developing and right up until the last second i didnt believe he was going to do it has he ever done anything that impetuous or poorly thought out before joeys a little what you might call accident prone thats why they know him so well at deland i see but hes not really recklesscertainly not in this way back at the restaurant you used the word limited when you spoke of him what did you mean by that millie sank down on a sofa and lou did the same on the far side joey came to my office one day when he was just thirteen she said he told me he was looking for a job i still have no idea how he found me or how he got out to the restaurant i tracked down his familywhat there was of it anyhow no father alcoholic mother joey was the oldest of four they lived in a dump of a place in baxter family services was about to move in and dole out the kids to foster homes i talked them into letting me have joey even though he had some learning issues and an attention problem he graduated from high school when he was nineteen a few years after that i set him up in a small apartment in the dorms thats what i call the place out behind the restaurant where some of the staff stays he does a good days work and the rest of the staff really likes him and sort of protects him if you know what i mean i do lou was unable to reconcile anything in the boys history with what he and dennis had witnessed and this hardly seemed like the time to start barraging millie neuland with probing questions still she continued her narrative with no prompting now dont get me wrong she said joey is hardly a regular guy hes sort of i dont know quirky sometimes lou perked up at the word quirky he asked you know odd strange hes not exactly obsessive but he gets onto a hobby and goes overboard with it its sort of like he gets fixated on things like that piece of carrot lou began ticking off what he knew about conditions that featured fixations without dominating obsessive compulsive behavior his list as might be expected from an er doc was a short onevariants of autism such as aspergers syndrome and can you give me some examples of things that joeys gotten locked in on he asked wondering about carolyn meacham and her nearly deadly fixation on a busted taillight the last thing joey really got into millie said was learning how to tie knots i once bought him a book of over a hundred different knots thinking he probably wouldnt have enough of an attention span to do much with it it took him two or three months but he learned to tie every one of them eventually he could even do a bunch of them blindfolded it was amazing to watch how long ago was that asked lou maybe two christmases and before that it was puzzles and before that radiocontrolled cars using a kit the boy built one that went faster than im comfortable driving then he just lost interest and went on to something else so hes been like that for a long time lou tried to keep the disappointment from his voice if joeys behavior had been a recent development it might have been an interesting avenue to explore instead it appeared to be just another in a string of dead ends oh hes been that way ever since ive known him millie said now i cant be certain ive touched on all his hobbies joeys a very private person and not a boy anymore i make it my business to keep out of his world he has a drivers license and an old ford pickup and pretty much comes and goes as he pleases i dont go traipsing about his apartment at the dorm and he doesnt invite me over for dinner millie said that with a laugh and then added cause everybody eats at millies and to your knowledge hes never behaved irrationally done anything dangerous no oh no joeys a stickler for the rules my only demands of him beside honoring the ten commandments are that hes on time for work and polite to everybody hes never let me down on either regard their conversation drifted off and for a time millie dozed and lou read some articles in an emergency medicine journal they were startled upright when the door to the family room swung open and dr kurdi entered he appeared as fresh as he had when he left to do the case and he was smiling pleasantly almost ecstatically it went as well as we could have hoped he said im optimistic that were going to get a significant amount of function back lou had been imagining what joeys life of hobbies would have been like missing a functional thumb thats great news rafe he said you get as much credit for the success as we do millie squeezed lous arm can we go see him she asked in a little while one of the recovery room nurses will be in to get you hes still pretty out of it from the anesthesia hell need to stay here for a couple days we want to keep a close eye on him and give him pain meds and iv antibiotics well thats fine millie said a note of disappointment in her voice im not much for driving any distance but there are plenty of folks at the restaurant who will come and get him in fact someone will come and get me tonight im just glad hes going to be all right lou put his hand on millies shoulder its no problem for me to bring him back to kings ridge when its time he said in fact it would be my pleasure ill drive you home later tonight too i have a couple of new cds i want to listen to on the way back home also i work right down the street at the annex so i can pop in as much as i want and ill phone you with progress reports how would that be most of millies wrinkles vanished around a bright smile how would that be she echoed let me put it this way neither you nor dr kurdi will ever have to pay for another meal at millies again chapter lou rolled double sixes and moved his pewter scottie dog ahead twelve spaces emily reacted immediately springing from her beanbag chair and tapping feverously at the in jail square on their monopoly board oh no you dont she said thats your second double in a row youve got to go to jail no no no lou countered its three doubles in a row and go to jail two in a row and i get to buy north carolina which i in fact am about to do this was a serious development and the teens somber expression reflected it her father already owned two monopolies to her one north carolina would give him a shot at putting her away her usual strategy of acquiring railroads at any and all cost along with the orange or red monopoly wasnt working out im sure its two doubles emily said as she plucked up lous dog and set it on the jail square lou picked up the piece and reestablished it on north carolina three he said two emily moved the terrier back to jail lou sighed deeply and spoke through clenched teeth okay lets get the rules were not getting the rules because you know that im right no because i know that im right and giving you the rules would be the same as admitting that i could be wrong i could always send you to your room emilys face lit up i knew it i knew youd resort to that you should be ashamed of yourself okay im ashamed of myself go to your room lou could not keep from smiling as well these were the times he treasured the mostthough this one would sadly be ending soon it seemed that with each passing day emily was becoming sharper and more fun he loved spending time with her at his apartment even though renee rarely missed an opportunity to disapprove of his chosen neighborhood the cozy twobedroom place above dimitris pizza across the street from the gym and not far from his old halfway house had served him and more important emily quite nicely all right then the rules lou said emily dug out the flimsy scotchtaped rule booklet from underneath a pile of tattered monopoly money come and get it she tossed it between them when he reached for it she dived at him and wrestled him facedown onto the rug bouncing on him until he cried uncle when she let up and rolled off he quickly read if you throw doubles three times in succession move your token immediately to the space marked in jail emily looked at him batting her eyes im sorry mr butler she said in a heavy scarlett ohara accent did you say something not really good because when it comes to rules frankly my dear i dont give a damn theyre stupid oh they have their place lou said emily harrumphed do you know how many rules steve has she asked its insane over there but hes still like way more strict with me than with his own brood thats a little hard to believe in a split second she went from lying on her stomach to sitting in a lotus position oh trust me she said its true example please okay he and mom wont let me have my computer in my bedroom and when his brood is with us he lets david have his you cant have your computer in your bedroom here either lou said thats not the point the rules should be the same for everybody how are you and steve getting along these days lou knew the answer to that question renee had filled him in on emilys more recent flareups with her husband and had even asked lous help with reining in her temper steves all right i guess emily said when hes not trying to be my father from what ive heard i dont believe he thinks of himself that way lou replied i know he loves you and wants only whats best for you well whats best for me is getting rid of the nolaptopinmyroom rule lou frowned but it was hard for him to maintain a stern expression his daughters spirit reminded him of her mother you know sweetie part of the art of living is knowing when you can break the rules and when you cant emily made a sourpuss face i prefer to follow your example she said you dont take shit from anybody hey come on you have too much class for that kind of language and for your information ive managed to get myself into quite a few pickles by not following the rules so dont make me your shining example there yeah name one uh how about god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference emily said finishing the alcoholics anonymous serenity prayer that lou had long ago imprinted on her okay but thats different you had a problem and you dealt with it im talking about rules like what you fight against at the physician wellness office all the time lous chest did a doubleclutch how much had renee told her did she know about his suspensionthat filstrup blamed him for what meacham had done god grant me the serenity what about the pwo emily shrugged just that you say youre always fighting with your boss because you know that youre right and hes wrong about something you dont play along just to play it safe you fight for what you believe and i believe if david can have a laptop in his room i can have one too lou quickly decompressed she knew nothing but he decided it was time she did thats not always a winning strategy he said there are times you can be wrong even though youre right does that make any sense no what if i told you that because of my tendency to trust my judgment more than the rules that im currently not employed with the pwo emily went pale you got fired not fired exactly but im not in good standing right now with our board of directors whatd you do wrong lets just say that if i listened to my boss and some others who didnt feel as strongly as i did things might not have gotten so drastic so fast so if you hadnt always been trying to prove that you were right you might still be working there is that what youre saying something like that yeah listen i dont want to see you complicate things with steve give him a chance dont fight him at every corner show him that you at least respect his judgment ask him what you could do to earn the same privilege that david has maybe the answer will surprise you maybe it will turn out to be something simple now you sound like mom well your mother is a very intelligent woman and beautiful lou nodded yes and beautiful very beautiful emily said very beautiful and incredibly talented lou sensed something was afoot yes your mother is very talented shes a great cook and fabulous dresser you forgot to mention a brilliant psychologist one of the best around and that youll never meet a woman wholl compare to her quite possibly so its true your mother has set a very difficult standard to meet and i say my nightly prayers of thanks that you inherited so many of her wonderful qualities emily was smilingbeaming was more like it then lou realized that she was looking past him he twisted around renee was standing in the doorway her set of his apartment keys in her hand oh please guys she said dont stop on my account chapter kim hajjar beamed at the orderly behavior the children from the inner city young peoples chorus exhibited as they passed through white house security at the southwest entrance no pushing no horseplay no yelling a darn fine start to the day looking like a mother duck with four dozen ducklings in tow she led the children to the rose garden via a series of wellmarked paths that took them around the back side of the west wing the chaperones flanked the line and brought up the rear of the procession hopefully over the years she thought some of these kids will visit the white house again after that who knows the morning was already quite warm and the cloudless sky guaranteed it would get even warmer forecasts had predicted rain throughout the day so kim saw the cooperating weather as a sign that the event would proceed without incident the buses had shown up on time one hundred and fifty folding chairs were in perfect rows on the rose garden lawn facing the podium and a set of risers refreshments were being served the green white and orange irish flag stood to the left side of the podium and the stars and stripes to the right there was a buzz of conversation from the assembling crowd many of whom were from a guest list that she had help to compile and the best part was that martin mallory would in all likelihood not be a noshow today kim working with the presidents chief of staff had assured herself of it just the same she breathed easier when she saw martin standing beside darlene chatting with some dignitaries despite his expertly applied makeup the president looked drawn and haggard by contrast darlene was radiant in a simple white christian dior dress and cloche hat adorned with a silk bow and rosettes the children filed into the rose garden as orderly as they had passed through security kim enjoyed seeing the awe in their faces as they took in the grandeur and beauty around them the crabapple trees were no longer flowering but the roses tulips primroses and grape hyacinth were in spectacular bloom the constant chirping of birds added a natural accompaniment to the quartet of professional musicians playing traditional irish music kim and darlenes eyes met the brief exchange said much at least for this morning martin had come through and there had been no word from double mthe name they had chosen for their mystery man after reading the handwritten note on the back of the bar none coaster darlene felt intrigued and vindicated i knew it i just knew it she had said once then again during their closeddoor meeting in her office but why would somebody go after evans kim asked you remember what he said to us at the bar none his office impacts local food producers major growers environmentalists even the manufacturers of fertilizers pesticides and seeds his policies affect millions of lives and probably trillions of dollars any number of his positions might put him in someones crosshairs kim thought back to their conversation with evanshis frustration and almost palpable frailty she warned herself not to jump to conclusions about his innocence she wasnt connected to him as intensely as the first lady was and needed to remain objective double m claimed to have proof for russ evanss sake she hoped the man would not stay hidden for long the folding chairs were rapidly filling kim signaled to the head of the young peoples chorus that the children should take their positions on the riser the kids looked super and no doubt darlene was imagining what it would be like going from exam room to exam room in her office taking care of every one of them you can take the pediatrician out of the practice kim was thinking but you can never take the pediatrician out of this woman she straightened out a couple of chairs and patted two of the younger kids on the shoulder it was showtime from the podium with the emblem of the presidential seal facing the crowd she instructed people to take their seats there was a rustle of movement and the dwindling murmur of voices as the guests settled in darlene was seated to the left of the podium president callaghans husband was seated to the right both presidents had musical cues that would instruct them when to enter is potus in position kim spoke into her radio a crackled reply came back ready to go good kim nodded to her assistant and moments later the musicians began to play the irish march wind that shakes the barley president callaghan emerged through the oval office french doors to enthusiastic applause she stood in front of the podium waving to the powerful and influential guests many of whom had irish heritage strong ties to her country or both scanning the crowd kim stepped away from the podium and listened from the lawn nearest to the risers she was startled by a light tap on her leg and looked down to see a mochaskinned girl with ebony pigtails wearing the plaid pinafore and black tights of the girls smiling up at her shyly kim knelt down honey youre supposed to be on the riser with the others she whispered your song is right after president mallory makes his entrance but i need to tell you something the child said in a honeysweet voice me what is it sweetie a man said to tell you that your present is in your purse kim took in a sharp breath ill be in touch what man the one who came up to me right after i got off the bus do you remember what he looked like he had a red and white washington nationals hat on theyre my favorite team the crowd was settled and kim realized that the director of the chorus was looking over at them everything okay with simone he said in a stage whisper fine kim said you did good simone you did perfect now go back with the kids and give us a terrific concert a washington nationals cap double m seemed to be an expert at disguise by diversion give a person like the bartender and this child something easy to focus on and in all likelihood that would be all they recalled kim glanced quickly around the rose garden just as she had that night in bar none the results were the same nothing yet somehow double m had managed to slip something into her purse the man was sharp resourcefuland quick the irish march was over and the musicians had begun hail to the chief with the first notes of the james sanderson march martin mallory emerged from the oval office to what kim considered a polite standing ovation as he waved to the crowd she checked her shoulder bag a small white box held closed by a red elastic rested on top of her clutter it weighed no more than a couple of ounces nothing to be wary of stepping backwards out of the line of sight of almost everyone she pulled the elastic off the box held six compartmentalized pieces of chocolate it took kim a few seconds to realize that only five of the pieces were real candy the sixth small chamber contained something else something not at all edible an earpiece hail to the chief was winding down to be followed by the national anthems but kim could hardly hear the music her pulse was a kettledrum in her ears ahead and to her right the president was waving and smiling for the cameras kim pretended to adjust her earring and fiddled with the small apparatus until it slipped inside her left ear immediately she heard static then a mans tinny voice probably electronically altered still his words even heard through her pulse were quite audible this is the end of the recording it will loop for ten minutes more before its contents become permanently erased darlene mallory must listen to this recording and agree to help chapter already on high alert darlene tensed even more when she saw kim approaching something had happened between her chief of staff and the young girl from the chorus and whatever it was darlene strongly suspected had something to do with double m then when kim stealthily brought out a small white box from her bag opened it extracted something and quickly closed it again she was certain martin was at the podium now waving to the crowd god but he loved his job each percentage drop in his popularity had been like a dagger in his heart hard as his plummeting numbers were on him both physically and mentally he maintained an unyielding belief in his programs and in his vision for the future of america but lately reassuring him deflecting his bullwhip temper and validating his decisions had become something of a second fulltime job for darlene then there was the matter of her pledge not to contact or mention russ evans to him again it was for this reason darlene had decided not to tell her husband about double mat least not yet she never had much in the way of craftiness and martin generally could see right through her when she tried holding anything back from him revealing her connection with dm as she and kim sometimes called the informant had to be carefully orchestrated and kept secret until she knew what the man was about kim stood by darlenes right shoulder blocking most angles and bent down far enough to whisper in her ear its him now the first lady kept her gaze forward and her face expressionless lower your hand kim said darlene did as instructed keeping her fingers curled to form a makeshift cup the plastic object kim placed there was smaller than a marble and surprisingly heavy at the same moment martin began his address a screech of feedback from the podiums single microphone sent a flock of birds into flight and the av tech scurrying for his control knobs martin tapped twice on the microphone head there he said in a voice now rich with electronic reverb the first lady is always telling me to expect the unexpected the laughter was prolonged and genuine that feedback was probably caused by this earphone kim said very powerful double m knows his stuff darlene nodded smiling for those still looking at her kim straightened up and stepped back toward the crowd thank you all for being here today martin continued this is a wonderful opportunity to express americas deep gratitude and appreciation to a country that shares so many of our values our bond is formed not only in the history we share but in the perseverance that defines our two nations and i say this not only as a president who can claim and document a deep irish heritage but also as a man who is extremely fond of a perfectly poured guinness the laughter this time was even more enthusiastic darlene knew this speech well and was prepared for the reaction to martins guinness joke the timing couldnt have been more perfect with the attendees distracted she pretended to adjust her earring the earpiece slipped into place without any difficulty the first thing she heard was a brief rather unpleasant hissing sound it was followed quickly by a clearly understandable mans voice that sounded as though she were hearing it through a tin can microphone darlene mallory must listen to this recording and she must agree to help through her left ear darlene could hear her husband speaking before i begin my remarks and before president callaghan delivers hers martin said it is my great pleasure to introduce the young peoples chorus from washington dc who are here today to welcome us all with their moving rendition of the face of the waters the children began to sing the harmonies of their angelic voices engulfed the remarkable scene you dont have to be afraid of us darlene heard a mans harsh voice say you come well recommended for this part so all you have to do is follow my instructions this was a different voice from the one she had attributed to double m her stomach dropped as if she had fallen off a roof she glanced over at kim who looked curious but also apprehensive the man continued were not going to take the blindfold off you if we do that wed have to kill you darlene gasped the voice was calm and as clinical as a science teacher educated and probably middle aged she thought she wondered briefly about the technology being employed was the voice being transmitted or was it actually held in the device itself you can speak any time something isnt clear to you understood a stuttering womans voiceno a girlssaid yes i understand darlene felt bile in her throat in front of her macabrely the children continued their pristine hymn all right then let us review the role you have agreed to play i need to be certain you understand it perfectly where are you going to meet secretary evans at the motel six on georgia avenue ill take a cab and have it drop me off a block away the girl sounded less fearful now there actually was some strength in her voice how will you get the key room twentyfour is registered to william betancourt ill show the front desk

half now half when youre done you did terrific here it will be a pleasure working with you thank you darlene stared blankly ahead her hands were trembling and her breathing was shallow a cold sweat had formed on the back of her neck and dripped unpleasantly down the inside of her blouse the voice of double m returned if you want to help secretary evans we must meet theres an alley behind the movie theater on columbus avenue eight pm tomorrow night come alone tell no one except kim hajjar about this recording lives are in danger the children finished singing and were rewarded with rapturous applause darlene rose to her feet applauding though numbly he legs were jello this is the end of the transmission double m said it will loop for ten minutes more before the recording went silent chapter despite knowing that joey alderson was in his midtwenties lou had trouble not thinking of him as a boyespecially following the disaster at millies for much of the early drive from the hospital back to kings ridge joey stared contentedly out the window making no attempt to initiate conversation his thumb and hand immobilized in plaster were supported in a sling over the two days before picking joey up for the ride home lou had twice stopped by the hospital to see him the first time joey was heavily medicated and barely able to put two words together a day later lou managed to engage him in a brief conversation even though joey was sweet and eager to respond there was no question that he was as millie had said limited he had almost no insight as to why he had put his hand in harms way for the sake of getting at a piece of carrot how you doing over there buddy lou asked wishing he had had the time to clean out his toyota before putting a postop patient inside it joeys smile was engaging im doing fine he chirped how are you doin okay joey doin okay listen joey i dont want to upset you any but i wonder if youve had any more thoughts about what happened at the restaurant you mean with my thumb lou groaned inwardly exactly im still trying to figure out what you were thinking lou caught joeys shrug out of the corner of his eye all i could think about was how badly i wanted that carrot the vapid response was no surprise you didnt think you might get hurt this time joey turned and gazed across at him his expression was blanknot deep in thought not searching for an answer to lous question but seemingly disconnected from his mind lou realized he had seen a similar expression before carolyn meacham stared at him without comprehension moments after she had abandoned her reckless pursuit of the sedan with a broken taillight a parody of dylans classic crossed lous mind the answer my friend is blowin in kings ridge the answer is blowin in kings ridge joey pointed out the window at a roadside exit sign can you get off here he asked sure lou replied grateful to have anything approaching a meaningful exchange what for ive got to get to the pet store before i go home i didnt know you had any pets lou said joey placed his left index finger to his lips letting lou know it was a secret you wont tell millie now will you she doesnt really allow any animals in the dorms lou flashed on his discussion with emily about bending rules he didnt feel he had been all that convincing but at least she had left his apartment with a promise to give steve a sporting chance no problem pal he said so what do you have dog cat youll see joey replied mischievously arts critters was a small storefront operation sandwiched between an optician and a cutrate jeweler in a modest strip mall lou offered to get whatever was needed but joey refused he fished a thin tattered wallet from his jeans and strode excitedly into the store a few minutes later he emerged carrying a mediumsized brown paper bag cant wait to get home he said when they arrived at millies the lunch rush was over leaving plenty of available parking spaces the restaurateur was waiting for them just inside the entrance and burst out the front door before lou shut off his engine she was carrying a cardboard box of food lou helped undo joeys seat belt then reached across his lap to open the passenger door joey set his bag on the floor before getting out hi there buddy millie said hi ma millie set the box on the ground and gave joey a quick peck on the cheek lou popped the trunk and set the food inside i just put some snack stuff together for you you can come over to the restaurant for your meals if youre up to it oh im up to it the report is good his surgeon thinks were looking at maybe seventyfive percent functional recovery maybe more joey you sure you dont want to stay with me no ma you know how happy i am to be in my own place all i thought about in the hospital was how much i just wanted to get home i have some pain medicine that i dont even think ill need but if i do i can take one or two every four hours and some infection medicine i need to take twice a day he needs to go back in three days lou said i think i can adjust my schedule to come out and nonsense i have people who will drive us youve been just wonderful lou hes going to help me get settled in at my place joey said perhaps a bit too quickly ill be at the restaurant for dinner very well dear millie said you know how i respect your privacy thats your home not mine millie thanked lou again wrapped him in her arms and stood on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek the dorms ten or twelve units white vinyl siding black shutters was nothing special in fact despite welltrimmed hedges and several small flower gardens it reminded lou of the sort of motel that might have rates by the day half day or hour unfortunately it also reminded him of places he once took refuge in when he was in no shape to go home never again he thought violating aas most essential dayatatime maxim never ever again the print curtains looked fairly new and there were brass numbers nailed to the front of each red painted door joey lived in unit number six carrying his package inside his sling joey fished his key ring out of his pocket and unlocked his door lou followed with the cooks small duffel bag and then the carton of food cozy he thought cozy and surprisingly neat but small there was a kitchenette and an adjacent dining area with a table for two that lou guessed most often sat one the sitting area featured a brown tweed sofa modest flatscreen television mounted to the wall and a couple of area rugs that covered part of a parquet floor where do you sleep lou asked noting that what was probably the door to a bedroom was closed joey pointed to the couch it folds out into a bed he said its more comfortable than youd think oh trust me lou said i know all about foldout couches what about your pet where do you keep it them not it theyre in the bedroom he said he nodded toward the closed door again there was playfulness in his expression so whats in the bag lou asked joey pulled out what looked like a chinese food leftover container and clumsily opened the top a bit scampering about on the bottom were two small brown mice ah pet mice lou thought harmless enough still he understood why the young cook was reluctant to have millie know about his hobby ready to see something cool joey asked conspiratorially ready lou said you got to promise not to tell joey said scouts honor joey turned the knob and nudged the door open with his foot a strange musty odor immediately wafted out the first thing lou saw were two workbenches with tools spread across the top there was a small empty wire cage at one end with a mouse wheel in it but the main attraction was in the center of the rooma huge lucite cube six feet on each side raised off the floor a foot or so on a heavy wooden platform fixed to the top of the cube and plugged into a wall socket by a long cord was what appeared to be a ventilation apparatus there was also an inchindiameter lucite tube bent upward at a ninetydegree angle and sealed at the outer end with a rubber stopper and inside by what appeared to be a levered trapdoor warming lights were clipped to two of the four sides illuminating a tall irregular mound arising from the floor at the center of the cube and looking somewhat like the spired castle of a disney princess in one corner of the floor was a dish of water in another was a mound of what looked like a mix of wood pieces and sawdust a complex mouse habitat lou thought just the sort of thing the eccentric kid of a hundred knots would build then he stopped and caught his breath the surface of the castle was moving get it joey asked proudly the mice arent my pets theyre the food for my pets pet what lou asked his voice breaking between the words he remained fixed to where he was standing unable to advance as he struggled to sort out what he was seeing termites joey said simply beautiful arent they termites lou could see them nowa sheet of constant motion coating virtually the entire castle he managed a couple of baby steps toward them termiteshuge termites some of them half an inch long or more joey im not any kind of a bug expert but i do know that termites eat wood not mice lou tried with minimal success to tie the bizarre scene to the events surrounding joeys nearly amputated thumb and the other strange behaviors hed observed since coming to kings ridge you watch and then tell me what these guys can and cannot eat joey said he removed his arm from the sling and used it to hold the animal container while he removed one of the mice by its tail and set it in a mason jar with a cotton ball on the bottom the other mouse he placed in the wire cage i have to knock this fellow out first joey said the termites wont eat them if theyre dead and i dont want them to feel any pain lou watched transfixed as joey poured a bit of liquid onto the cotton ball chloroform in seconds the mouse was on its side joey used a long forceps to pick up the limp animal then he removed the rubber stopper from the lucite access tube set the mouse inside and nudged it onto the small trapdoor with a thin stick all the while softly whistling the theme from the andy griffith show then after giving lou a final look at the ingenious setup the cook pushed down the lever opening the trapdoor instantly the lower third of the princesss castle flowed like lava onto the inert mouse covering every millimeter of it there was a loud clicking noise that reminded lou of rain pelting against a tin roof more insectshuge heads with black pinchers and yellow bodiespoured or flew around it the clicking sounds intensified as the swarm became more frenzied the animal corpse for surely it was already that was now encased in a ball of clamoring insects at least three inches around each trying to burrow down onto the meal then just as quickly as the termites advanced they began to retreat back to and into the mound the clicking decreased in volume until it could no longer be heard lou circled the table never once averting his gaze from the frightening diorama he expected hed see the remains of the meal mauled and bloody but there was not any blood to be seen what lou witnessed instead was nothing there was no mouse left at all chapter lou felt leagues better the moment he set foot inside caps stick and move one good whiff of stale gym air with its distinctive blend of sweat cheap aftershave and bleach and he felt he was home but he still could not forget joey aldersons astonishing termites before heading over to the gym he had made a quick search of the internet but could find no entomological evidence that such creatures existed only they did the image and hideous clicking of that ambercolored swarm totally consuming a mouse in a matter of seconds would stay with him indefinitely lou wrote down the name and number of oliver humphries at temple university in philadelphia listed as one of the experts in the field of termite entomology if time allowed he might give the man a call joey was extremely excited at lous stunned reaction to his pets and offered to drop another mouse into the lucite habitat lou politely begged off an encore but did ask where he had come up with the bugs i cant show you today joey had said a broad smile creasing his boyish face but come back on the weekend and ill take you there i think youll be pretty amazed im pretty amazed right now lou had said and a bit horrified too lou concentrated on the young fighters chasing their dreams and joeys nightmare bugs gradually receded toward the back of his consciousness as always the gym was a sanctuary for his brain the grunts soft thud of boxing gloves and rhythmic skip of jump ropes across the cement floor were symphonic after changing quickly in the locker room lou slipped on his bag gloves and got to work on the heavy bag cap was in the ring nearby training a young fighter who had pretty decent moves lou started off with a set of straight jabs remembering what his mentor had told him about not telegraphing the punch by leaning forward then he switched over to a rapidfire combination set that included a mix of jabcross jabhook and jabhookhook punches by minute five of his tenminute set he was sweating profusely and feeling almost airborne he tried to focus on his punching technique but then a surprising thing happened he found himself thinking about renee thud thud renee thud steve thud emily thud steve was a decentenough guy lou convinced himself as he walloped the bag with his hardest punch yet maybe he was a little dull and set in his ways but at least he had a big heart and good intentions besides lou knew sparks were not a guarantee of a successful marriage heck hed given renee enough of them to start a matrimonial forest fire and look where that got him lou had come to believe that renee loved a solid percent of him during their eight years of marriage it was that remaining percent the addict who lied about his drug and alcohol use that renee could not endure as in many failed marriages she discovered lous unacceptable percent only after she had said i do as a recommended part of his recovery he had done his best to make amends to her now all he could do was to support her in her marriage and continue to push that percent further and further from his life when the time was right someone would show up who could help him get over her thud thud renee thud lou slammed the bag a few more times then stepped aside when cap came over and hit the bag with a beautiful sequence of jabs he seemed to be exerting little effort but his punches sounded like gunshots throughout the remarkable barrage he continued smiling its good to be the king where you been cap asked as he unleashed an uppercut that would have put a fullgrown gorilla on its back long story lou said well you might want to make it a short one cap said without sounding the least bit winded i just got a call from the street that there are two guys lurking outside the gym snapping pictures of this place your building and what i think is your car what have you been up to lou felt as if hed just been on the receiving end of one of caps punches i guess stirring somebodys pot lou said wrapping his arm around the swinging bag like they were dancing partners what kind of guys are we talking about they look like muscle cap said thick beefy guys the kid who called seemed sure they were packing heat and i dont think hes ever wrong about such things so do we invite them up for a workout thats up to you and how interested you are in them im plenty interested then we turn the tables and follow them cap said after delivering a right cross that sent lou staggering backwards off the bag sooner or later theyll get tired of hanging around and probably nervous too im betting sooner this is hardly their kind of neighborhood how am i gonna tail them in the car that theyve been tailing leave that to me cap said he smacked the heavy bag one last time hard enough rattle the chains following caps instructions lou grabbed a couple of slices of pizza from dimitris making a conscious effort not to look around while making the purchase outside the two men in a black cadillac sedan rolled past then past again in the other direction be careful to act nonchalant cap had insisted you dont want these guys getting suspicious lou carried the pizza box upstairs to his apartment once inside he turned on the tv and took out a slice he felt like a duck in a carnival shooting gallery walking back and forth in front of his apartment windows while eating a slice of fourcheese with mushrooms but he wanted to be certain he was seen from the street below again caps idea not his lous cell phone rang he stepped away from the windows to answer it theyre on the move cap said they think youre in for the night lets go lou raced down the back stairwell threw open the unalarmed fire exit door and stepped into a narrow alleyway a beatup chevy prizm sans hubcaps and the passengerside mirror sped down the alley toward him and flashed its lights once the rear door opened and lou scrambled into the backseat as the car kept rolling then as soon as he slammed the door it accelerated cap was driving but lou did not recognize the two twentysomething black men in the car with him the one sitting beside lou was cleanshaven with short tightly curled hair he was big as in needs to buy an extra plane ticket to fly big ah man i smell pizza you bring us any pie he asked after we get back to the gym its my treat terrific i do a large with everything hold the anchovies lou meet notso cap said from the drivers seat notsos beefy hand enfolded lous like the wrapping on a burrito notso lou asked his real name is anthony the man riding shotgun said but his last name is brite got it lou said suppressing a smile you okay with that mr brite my mothers the one who first called me it so i guess the answers yes and you would be lou asked the second man the man maneuvered around to get a better look at lou he was slightly built a while from his last shave and was wearing a gray tshirt tattered at the neck his left ear was studded with a lone diamond while his tortoiseshell glasses gave him an air of intelligence he reminded lou of spike leeminus the new york knicks gear names george he said george kozak his hand was to lous as lous was to notso brites okay notso and george lou said pleased to make your acquaintances im lou welcome thats dr lou welcome cap corrected so behave or hell take out your liver fat chance george mumbled turning to face front again yo yo he cried out youre losing em cap hell man you need me to drive i didnt even want you to come yeah sure you know you cant separate me from my car thats right notso chimed in or me from my glock he pulled his handgun from a shoulder holster beneath his black windbreaker and set it on his lap lous heart stopped then with utterly unpleasant slowness it began pumping again two decades in the er had featured far too many gunshot wounds and far too many deaths of all ages he could count the number of times he had held a gun on the fingers of one hand and could not even stand being this close to one handguns and beets he had said on more than one occasion enumerating the two things in the universe he hated most jesus notso put that thing away he snapped easy lou cap said the muscle were tailing are almost certainly packing notso just wants to be prepared stow it big fella notso looked at lou queerly and slipped the glock back into its holster who the hell are these guys anyway george asked i have no idea did you get a look at them a couple of white guys with thick necks and bulges in their jackets one of them has a cheesy mustache meet any thicknecked white guys lately whod want to tail you cap asked making another turn what are they driving see that caddy a few cars up ahead cap said yeah well thats them lou leaned forward to get a better look dont know the car he said thanks for putting your piece away notso i work in an er and ive seen too many holes in too many people dont worry about my cousin george said my aunt got it right about him the only thing were going to be shooting with on this trip is my digital camera whats the camera for lou asked information my friend george answered as he snapped a couple of pics of lou without triggering the flash we dont know what were going to find so this way we can capture the memories whered you get that camera from anyway notso asked yo mamas so poor she cant even pay attention funny george said feigning a laugh i got it from school blubber belly its for a project im doing youre in school lou asked with more incredulity than he had intended yeah college george said community college notso corrected oh shut the fuck up you bucket of lard last time you picked up a book you freaked out because it had already been colored in he turned back to lou im a sophomorewell a junior with four more credits thats terrific lou said what are you majoring in biology hes learning how to grow weed notso said you wish believe me if i ever start growing weed youll be the last to know cap groaned his displeasure george will you shut your mouth and keep your eyes locked on that car ahead this aint a joke why do you think i called you about them i know bad when i see it for a short while the four fell silent cap managed to stay four or five cars behind the caddy without losing sight of it after a mile or so it turned onto the highway headed west another mile and lou had it figured out cap he said i believe i know exactly where these guys are headed yeah and wheres that kings ridge virginia lou said notso smiled in the flash of approaching headlights his teeth shone thats way cool he said i aint never been to virginia before chapter darlene knew what she was about to do might end her marriageif not in fact then at least to all intents martin had learned about her meeting with russ evans almost as soon as it happened should he learn of this one he would never understandespecially if she turned out to be wrong about evans but she wasnt wrong an anxious young womans voice on a hightech recording told her so and hopefully very soon she would have proof of course it was always possible that the tape was a fabrication but to what end even if someone put together a fake even if the young woman was an actress russ evans was finished politically the three cars escorting darlene and kim to the moviesa town car and two nondescript sedanspulled to a stop a block past the iconic regent street theater dusk was settling over the district during the intentionally circuitous ride from pennsylvania avenue darlene gazed out at the streets teeming with people moving through their lives making connections only when they wanted to she had willingly given up that privilege when she and martin entered the campaign now she felt wistful that russ evans could no longer walk comfortably among people without attracting unwanted attention with half an hour to go before the movie the advance team of agents completed its assignment with trademark efficiency and radioed to victor ochoa that it was safe for buttercup and wildcat to enter the theater darlene had forgotten the name of the film they were going to see until she read it posted out front on the illuminated marquee double m had chosen a pg chick flick darlenes mouth was dry with tension she was defying the man she had married and about to deceive the people who had been sworn to protect her at any and all cost but her friend since childhood and more recently her professional soul mate had been destroyedframed and now the man she and kim called double m wanted her help at least to clear russ evanss name why with nothing tangible what does he expect i can do darlene pushed the questions to the back of her mind it was imperative that she remain sharpaware of everything and everyone around her slipping free of ochoa and his crew was not going to be easy even though only he and a female agent named bonnie would actually be in the theater seated in the back darlene wore a pair of tinted glasses with thick white frames and an auburn shoulderlength wig beneath a gold print satin scarf the outfit was one of severalthe most effective in factthat she used when she wanted to keep gawkers and disrupters to a minimum in addition she had on a pair of faded blue jeans and a brown leather jacket with the hard rock cafe emblem sewn onto the back ochoa handed kim and darlene their tickets bonnie and i will be in the back he said just make sure you take the seats weve designated for you sorry its not your type of movie victor kim said my girlfriend told me that there are no car chases and no one gets shot hey i like sweet endearing romantic comedies as much as the next guy who gets paid to carry a gun darlene hooked her chief of staffs arm and eyes down escorted her into the theater and down to two seats on the side aisle there were fifteen or so other patrons scattered throughout the remaining seats but none anywhere near the two of them the film nearing the end of its run before dvd seemed to have been carefully chosen by double m and to this point at least no one appeared to be paying any attention to them how are you holding up kim whispered without turning i dont have butterflies flying around in my stomach darlene said if thats what you mean well thats good i have buzzards oh what if this is a bad idea a trap of some sort terrorists double m is incredibly resourceful and inventive i think if he wanted to get to you he could have done it already no he wants your help and if you want to help russ youre going to have to trust himat least this once the onscreen ads had given way to the previews subtly darlene glanced down at her wristwatch one hour to go she whispered keep your eyes on the screen kim said giving darlenes hand a squeeze the sixty minutes seemed interminable finally darlene tapped a fist on kims knee rose from her seat and headed to the back of the theater im going to use the bathroom she whispered to bonnie stay here for half a minute you can check out the room but please be sort of quick about it are you okay i will be once i get in there by agreement she stood resting her elbows on the back wall and waited darlene knew bonnie was startled by her uncharacteristic abruptness but it served its purpose the woman checked the bathroom in thirty seconds or so and pronounced it empty moments later darlene was inside grateful for the many hours she had spent with her yoga instructor personal trainer and in the white house gym she crossed over to the pair of sinks and nimbly pushed herself up onto the one farthest from the door it was no problem to slide the curtain aside on a small transom window that was now level with her waist and to undo the latch as soon as she pushed open the window a wellmanicured hand featuring a shade of nail polish identical to her own gripped the sill from the other side then a womans head popped into view wearing the same wig glasses and satin scarf as darlene she climbed through the window then stepped on the edge of the sink and dropped to the floor with a cats grace the jeans and hard rock jacket completed a striking match madam first lady the woman said as darlene helped her down im nicole keane kims friend its a pleasure to meet you the stepladder is right outside you wont have any trouble it was difficult for darlene to keep from staring at the lawyer whom kim had described as the perfect body double a tenfinger boost and youre out of here nicole said kims by herself ten rows down the second aisle just keep your head down and avoid any eye contact with the two agents in the last row they think im in a hurry to get back to the movie and wont expect any chitchat in fifteen minutes kim is going to tell them i have an upset stomach and ask them to check the bathroom again then shes going to come get you at your seat and well switch back ive got the plan memorized like it was one of my court briefs perfect tenfinger boost nicole said interlocking her fingers the ladders right under the window is he there darlene asked i didnt see him just the ladder darlene set her foot onto nicoles makeshift hoist slipped easily through the window located the ladder with her foot and climbed down into the dimly lit alley behind the theater chapter the alley appeared deserted there was a dumpster nearby that reeked of popcorn oil and several cars parked against old brick buildings beneath a latticework of fire escapes darlene stepped out into the glow of a single hooded bulb at the end of a metal pole protruding from the theater there were several similar lights spaced along the alley hello she called out in a strained whisper are you here silence and then im here it took several unsettling seconds to locate the source of the voice a tall man sixfootone or so with broad powerful shoulders approached her from behind a parked car he wore a baseball cap and glasses with a thick black frame and had a neatly trimmed full beard he was probably goodlooking but in the gloom with the glasses and the beard it was hard to tell darlene guessed him to be about forty he was wearing a patterned blazer blue oxford shirt and crisply pressed pants a man of the outdoors she decided he remained a couple of yards away his eyes never leaving hers kim and i call you double m for mystery man she said he held an electrolarynx against his throat making his speech eerily roboticand not identifiable good nickname he said you can come closer im not afraid of you double m closed the gap between them by half but declined taking darlenes extended hand my name is alex he said thats not your real name is it darlene said no but that doesnt matter his electronic voice was creepy especially given the setting but darlene was determined not to react okay then double m alex she said you want this to be our level of trust thats up to you i would be in great danger if my identity became known well we dont have much time what are we doing here trying to save lives he studied darlene as though she were an equation to be solved a professor or a scientist she guessed go on she said first of all you need to know that the recording you heard was real i believed it was otherwise i would not have risked so much for this meeting you may have to risk even more who was on that recording asked darlene who was the girl the other man speaking what happened to her behind his lenses double ms eyes narrowed at this point i cant reveal who is involved in that tape darlene was beginning to feel exasperated with the mans paranoia what is it you want from me alex double m sucked in a nervous breath you must use your influence to get your husband to reinstate secretary evans darlene tensed is evans behind this she asked i dont even know the man well im sorry but that cant be done darlene said politics simply doesnt work that way russ evans has resigned and hes embarrassed the president theres nothing in the constitution to prevent reinstating him double m countered darlene stifled a laugh one thing ive learned from my years as a politicians wife is that the constitution may be a marvelous framework but it isnt politics double m appeared agitated we cant let the presidents nominee get appointed russell evans must be returned as secretary of agriculture and soon and lives depend on it they might might well from what i can tell gretchen rose has impeccable credentials and widespread support her approval by congress is all but assured are you suggesting that she is somehow involved with what i heard on that recording indirectly he said darlene felt herself emotionally pulling away from the man assuming russ had been framed she wanted to do anything she could to help him but it didnt feel as if this skittish man was the answer by indirectly you mean its about her policies double m said so did secretary evanss policies get him framed yes you need to tell me more our time together is running out you need to come clean with me and you need to do it right now im sorry i cant do that cant or wont darlene replied folding her arms tightly across her chest i have my reasons for being oblique i sincerely want to help my friend russ darlene said then youre going to have to trust me without getting all the facts thats the deal at least tell me whats at stake here tell me why its so imperative that gretchen rose not be appointed its impossible to say precisely whats at stake but it could be a great deal darlene frowned okay were done ive put a lot on the line to meet with you this way and im very disappointed that i took the risk i dont appreciate circuitous conversation you wont get my help this way theres just too much at stake for me shoulders sagging double m turned and appeared ready to depart after one unsteady step he whirled back around her name is margo the girl on the recording yes so in order to get my husband to reinstate russell evans you want me to find this girl named margo double m reached into his jacket pocket and darlene had a flash of panic that he was going for a weapon before she could react or even process the thought his hand came out holding a handkerchief i have something for you he said reaching into his jacket with the handkerchief to withdraw a lettersized white envelope as you heard on the recording shes a prostitute im sure of that besides her name thats all i know inside this envelope are several photographs of her that i took her face is partially obscured and i never got a clean a shot because i was trying to be discreet but ive also included a flash drive with an mp voice sample that could be used for matching purposes as well as the girls fingerprint which i lifted using a piece of scotch tape off the chair she was sitting on do you know people who could help i might i heard her mention she was living in dc well that might be useful double m handed over the envelope darlenes heart sank as she flipped through four grainy color photographs of a titianhaired blindfolded girl with a willowy frame both seated upon and standing beside a wooden chair not much not much at all im not making any promises darlene said i assume from the precautions not to leave your fingerprints that i can keep these double m adjusted the electrolarynx against the side of his trachea i was hoping you would if i learn any more ill get the information to you come on alex you can at least be honest enough to tell me youre holding stuff back okay lets just say ive told you everything i can may i ask why you approached me and not my husband your husband wont believe the tape recording is real in addition he has too much to lose by reneging on his stance he respected russell evans when he nominated him but hes not nearly as intensely connected to the man and his policies as you are and how are you so sure about my feelings toward evans because i read your interview in time magazine where you talked about knowing him since you were children and you likened him to your own father i did extensive research about you from what ive learned i know that the comparison to your father isnt something you would have made lightly darlene was impressed just so im clearyou want my help to find this girl and then im to arrange a meeting between her and my husband i would be doing this to convince my husband that russ evans was framed and must be reinstated thats correct i also suspect he would have to arrange some sort of a presidential pardon for margo at that moment a small pink rubber ball arced out from the bathroom window and bounced several times across the alley before disappearing under a car thats the signal from kim darlene said she and nicole are in the bathroom i have to get back inside she set her foot on the bottom step then paused how should i contact you double m reached into his jacket again and took out a cell phone this is a disposable cell phone nobody will be able to trace your call to me and you wont be able to trace me from it either theres one recent call on it ring that number only when you have something to report afterwards please completely destroy the phone whatever it is youre going through seems agonizing darlene said im truly sorry i knew youd understand the man said ill take care of the ladder darlene ascended the remaining steps gripped the windows edge and silently hoisted herself back into the bathroom victor ochoa approached darlene as she and kim were exiting the theater may i speak with you a moment in private he asked kim had been talking nonstop about the movie in effect allowing her to transmit a plot summary to darlene just in case of course victor darlene said ochoa escorted her to a secluded corner of the theater whats up darlene asked her heart was a jackhammer in her chest she knew victor well enough to sense that something was very wrong his expression did nothing to dispel that notion listen im on your side the swarthy agent said evenly i have one job to do and thats to keep you safe and you do it well darlene said trying not to stammer not when you sneak through a bathroom window to rendezvous with a tall muscle man in the alley behind the theater victor i its not my business to know all the details of your life he said but it is my business to know where you are and who youre with look im not your husband and im not here to judge you ive worked for three first ladies before you i trusted them and they all trusted me but if i find youre not trusting in me anymore if i find youre playing games that are keeping me from doing my job then my allegiance will have to go someplace else is that understood madam first lady darlene felt her throat tighten you wont tell my husband not if you stop trying to sneak away darlene squeezed ochoas arm ill explain to you soon she vowed not necessary but id appreciate that im lucky to have you no that guy you met back there is lucky the graying agent replied if i hadnt seen that envelope come out of his pocket he would have developed a new orifice or two in his body chapter just past the sign for kings ridge the caddy made a sudden left turn onto a poorly lit roadtwo narrow lanes no dividing line few cars cap was forced to drop back until their quarrys taillights were red peas in the mounting darkness they continued west into the days final blush of sunlight getting tougher lou said to cap the only thing we have going for us is that theres no reason for them to suspect anyones tailing them if this is what virginias like notso chimed in i choose our hood any day i hear theres a collection bein taken to send you out here permanently george said a mile then another now there were no cars coming the other way and only darkness between them and the glowing red peas they bounced across a railroad track and rolled past several whitepainted corrugated hangars with no trespassing signs mounted to the outside walls cap cut the chevys headlights plunging the car into darkness the blackening sky made it difficult to follow the winding stretch of road that snaked around low hills and paralleled a small rill on the left soon though the curves straightened out and the landscape turned flat again on both sides now there was nothing but corn so welcome where do you think theyre headed cap asked no idea lou replied is this the way to john meachams house no wed be headed in the opposite direction if thats where they were going it looks like all there is out here is farmland notso pointed out the window zat wheat he asked is wheat green notso george answered do you even know what wheat looks like i know what wheat look like notso said folding his arms across his chest in a pout look man its dark outside quit ridin me well its corn you big goof acres and acres of fuckin corn lou glanced out at the stalks on both sides of the road rippling in the light night breeze like a vast emerald ocean cap decelerated i think theyve turned left he said he waited a few seconds before catching a flicker of the sedans taillights through a path cleared in the corn a minute later he made the same turn tailing the caddy was becoming more challenging all this corn is making me hungry notso said rubbing his ample belly george turned around seriously brite he said could you please talk about somethin other than food jes sayin im hungry is all notso answered why yall buggin me so bad cant a man want to eat no cap and george said in unison for a few minutes they rode in silence anyone ever hear the expression knee high by the fourth of july lou asked i have cap said it has to do with corn my gramps used to grow it in a corner of the backyard of his place in north carolina it means something like if the stalks werent knee high by july fourth the crop would be bad exactly lou said thats what i remember although i have no idea who i heard it from well it isnt july yet but that corn is certainly way higher than my knees cap turned left again this time onto a gravelly dirt road the stalks on each side towered upward like a ghostly army rocks coupled with potholes and the gathering darkness made driving without headlights tricky lou felt every jolt of the lowriding prizm as it struggled to negotiate the uneven terrain george pointed up ahead theyre turning again he said i got em cap replied swinging the car onto an even narrower dirt road that was carved into a seemingly endless expanse of corn you sure you can find your way out of here notso asked looking around anxiously theres always a way out lou said patting the hefty mans shoulder notso was rubbing the gold handcuffs pendant he wore as if the miniature manacles were rosary beads again the car jostled from side to side as the wheels found more ruts shit notso said what is it lou felt a tingle of alarm i dropped my gun before anyone could comment he reached above his head and flicked on the cars interior light notso lou yelled covering the light cap with his hand and quickly flicking the switch off what are you doing sorry man he said but i got to find my gun we told you to leave it in your holster i got nervous so i wanted to be sure i could get at it lou glanced up just in time to see the sedans taillights perhaps a quarter mile ahead go dark cap pulled over to the edge of the narrow road car wheels crunching corn stalks underneath and shut off the engine save for the white noise of insects and the swishing of the corn the silence was heavy after a minute his window open cap restarted the engine and inched forward ahead the blackness intensified stop cap notso said with authority why cause im gettin out to walk on ahead of you they might call me notso brite but that dont mean i make the same mistake twice i got hearing like a shark what in the hell are you talkin about george said sharks live in the fuckin notso was already out on the road gun in hand lumbering ahead through the night cap followed for a few minutes then pulled to the side and cut the engine he lou and george joined notso in front of the prizm and moved cautiously ahead will you put that gun away george snapped at his cousin who do you think you are arnold schwarzenegger cap shushed them harshly stop talking and listen insects and corn nothing else insects and corn notso did not stay silent for long it sure is quiet out here he said in a reasonably hushed tone spooky quiet man i couldnt sleep a wink if i didnt hear sirens and car horns all night lou grinned over the years the urban theater had taken up residency in his soul and he often said as much to renee when she suggested that he move to a neighborhood more conducive to raising emily cap had wandered over to the corn he snapped off an ear and inspected it then he pulled back the leaves and held it up to capture what little bit of light existed where they were weird he mused what lou asked i remember my grandpa telling me that each corn stalk makes one ear but this one has four and there was no chance for him to say more two gunshots pierced the blackness lou looked ahead at notso thinking the big man had mistakenly fired his weapon but notso was looking around confused three more gunshots rang out run scatter cap cried another shot notso groaned loudly doubled over and clutching his stomach and stumbled into the corn cap following lou and george thrashed into the jungle on the opposite side of the road stalks lashed at lous face and arms as he plunged into the blackness there were more shots coming from not far away then from somewhere across the road lou heard notso brights voice a single grunting agonized word shit chapter lou stumbled into the dense corn quickly losing his footing and falling hard air exploded from his lungs thick stalks snapped in half with a sound like breaking bones as jagged edges sliced his face and arms dust coated his mouth and throat gunfire seemed to be erupting from all directions piercing the darkness with flashes of light crawling deeper into the corn lou had become separated from george movement of the stalks tipped the gunmen as to where he was and instantly bullets snapped through the leaves overhead and slammed into the ground close enough to spray clumps of dirt into his face pivoting his body lou flattened himself in a deep furrow between two rows then lying motionless in the dark he listened ones down a gravelly voice called out from somewhere behind him stay cool the angry warning emanated from just a few feet to lous right were closing in on two of them the first man yelled back lou kept still and forced his breathing to slow he sensed movement the man was on the move moments later lou heard notso bright groaning in pain and crying out im shot cap help me ca two quick shots cut him off and then there was silence got him for real this time the gravelly voice cried out lous heart sank lets get some light on this situation floodlights affixed to widely spaced poles flashed on creating a shadowy artificial day lou could see almost everything around him he was readying himself for a dash deeper into the corn when he heard three quick pops of gunfire from his right accompanied by the sound of shattering glass the two spots nearest him went out instantly one of em has a gun he just shot out two floods lou managed a cold smile george must have brought more than a camera with him hey welcome that you the man closest to him called out your fat black friend is dead toast you should have stayed at home because youre next it was strange for lou to hear his name called but not surprising clearly his mounting suspicions about kings ridge had gotten someones attention there was a sudden intense rustling of corn from some distance away to his right and moments later the gunman shouted drop it asshole i said drop it he had george welcome he called out a minute later ill give you until five to show yourself then im gonna blow this little suckers head off one lou judged the killer to be some twenty feet directly in front of him after rising slowly he remained hunched over as he moved ahead two lou the motherfuckers shot notso three fuck you go ahead and shoot me you prick in the eerie glow from one of the remaining spotlights lou could see the gunmans broad back one shoulder and the gun he held pointed at georges head four im not afraid of you you fat blood running down from gouges in his forehead and neck lou had moved as close to the man as he could chance one more step and five ten feet away george was on his knees his glasses had been knocked off and lou sensed the frustration and anger in his eyes but no fear thats it welcome his blood is on your bellowing lou exploded from his crouch like a football lineman the gunman whirled awkwardly and george rolled at his legs connecting just below his knees the man managed two quick shots but he was off balance and the slugs slapped harmlessly into the soil driven by a burst of adrenaline and countless hours of sparring lous fists came up he landed a powerful leftrightleft combination to the larger mans jaw snapping his head from side to side like a puppets his knees already wobbly he dropped his gun and staggered backwards lou launched himself again pummeling his face and the center of his chest both men went down lou on top still hammering downward with as much power as he had in him it was as if he were punching stone the man with at least a fourinch and fiftypound advantage reached up and grasped lou by the throat he was a beast and his hamhock hands were pure power lou tucked in his chin to protect himself but too late his trachea and larynx were seconds from collapsing still on top he slammed his forehead down onto the mans nose blood burst from both nostrils but incredibly the killers grip hardly lessened his teeth were bared in a snarling rictus and lous vision began to dim grinning obscenely he rolled lou onto his back thick dollops of blood splashed down into lous eyes he landed two more wild blows but the behemoth simply squeezed harder lous flailing weakened it was over images of emily and renee his father and brother took over his thoughts at the instant his vision went completely dark he heard a loud gunshot followed by a muffled cry of pain from on top of him the flow of blood from the man exploded into a fountain and he toppled limply to the ground gasping lou could only lie where he was finally he managed to turn the huge killer lay motionless beside him blood soaking through the groin of his trousers then lou realized that the top of his head had burst open as well george knelt nearby smiling proudly i couldnt find my thirtyeight george said but this damn water buffalo had a cannon just look at this thing this is some serious firepower groaning lou forced himself to his knees georges bullet had gone straight up between the mans legs and had blown off the top of his head serious firepower indeed nice shot lou understated you all right welcome george asked you look like something jason got ahold of in friday the thirteenth lou pawed at the gore on his face with the sleeve of his jacket it took some work but gradually his vision cleared im okay thanks to you he whispered im sorry about your cousin i cant believe this has happened we gotta find him hes not dead i know my cousin welcome hes not dead well look for him as soon as we can lou said knowing in his heart what they would find weve got to get back to the car we can call for help provided theres any reception how many you estimate are out there not countin him im guessing four could be five stay low george and try not to fire that thing anymore unless someones about to kill me again crouching low lou moved ahead pushing the densely packed rows of corn aside george followed closely they found the road again and after a careful walk along the edge saw georges car the overhead spotlights had been shut off there was no sign of cap or notso cap george cried out anxiously where you at man notso cap george keep it quiet lou whispered harshly but his warning came too late gunfire erupted from across the road forcing them back into the corn bullets streaked past them from several directions but their cover held sticking close together they pressed deeper into the corn at that instant the silence was pierced by a low rumbling coming from the direction in which they were headed shoulder to shoulder they ducked down in a furrow the noise built steadily until it seemed like a jet engine had fired up and was heading toward them what the hell is that george asked lou stood up on his tiptoes and peered over the corn instantly his blood turned cold chapter advancing rapidly toward them through the darkness looking like an attacking spaceship its bank of headlights blazing engine roaring was a massive combine harvester attached to the front end of the harvester whirling at a blurring speed was a cylindrical threshing reel at least twenty feet wide the machine with tires taller than lou was shearing stalks off at ground level wind generated by the rotating blades sprayed dirt toward lou and rushed ahead with enough force to throw him off balance in the brightly lit cab he could see the silhouette of the driver and wondered what george and he must have looked like to the man helpless was the only word that came to mind most frightening to him about the thresher was its speed for several precious seconds he was frozenalmost literally a deer in the headlights of the powerful beast the gap between him and the machine seemed to be closing rapidly finally with no specific plan in mind he whirled to his right nimbly the combine responded moments later lou tripped and fell pitching facefirst onto the rugged ground george run get out of here he shouted stumbling to his feet he could barely hear himself over the roaring engine and knew there was no way george could hear him the screech of the razorlike blades was deafening and the skill of the driver had him persistently locked between the headlights slivered stalks flew out from the base of the apparatus like daggers a shot rang out from the right then another bullets sparked off the metal framework of the cab a third shot seemed to spiderweb the windshield lou saw the muzzle flashes and located george thrashing ahead through the corn firing over his shoulder like a sharpshooter in a wild west show for the moment at least he seemed to be well beyond the far end of the screeching rotors lou was dead center george got off three more rapid shots then it seemed he was out of ammunition it didnt matter the bullets had done nothing to stop or even slow the combine still lou was concerned that there was space for the thresher to swing from him to george still fixed between the headlights he began jumping up and down hollering and frantically waving his arms above his head the move sealed his fate the thresher made an adjustment and he quickly became the chosen one fifteen feet ten the noise was deafening now in seconds it would be over five lou spun to his left and tripped on a root rolling his left ankle he pitched forward like a baseball player diving headfirst into a base unlike the rest of the cornfield the soil he landed on was muddy and dense he flattened himself out hands stretched over his head jaws clenched waiting for the blades to tear him apart but there was no impact he had fallen into a trough he realizednot a furrow between rows but something deeper an irrigation ditch the roar and wind as the harvester passed over him were like a tornado the ground shook violently and the blades actually swept across his back a millimeter or two more and he would have been shredded as soon as the harvester had passed over him lou scrambled from the ditch and hobbled toward where he reckoned the road was feeling every step in his ankle just as he was losing confidence in his sense of direction the densely packed stalks fell away he stumbled out into the roadway torn and completely covered in blood and dirt some distance away he could hear the combine swinging about for another run at him headlights appeared up ahead flashed twice and went out a car came skidding toward him through the darkness lou tensed ready to dive back into the corn the headlights urgently flashed again and the approaching car slowed cap leaned out the driversside window quick get in the car lou he cried lou clambered into the backseat relieved to see george sitting up front and immediately grasping the significance that there were only three of them cap spun the car degrees sending a pillar of dust swirling into the night sky the car fishtailed several times on the dirt road before finally catching traction lou looked behind him and saw the bank of lights from the harvester fading in the distance unable to stop shaking now he kept on looking until the machine had vanished from view chapter at one oclock in the morning beneath a densely overcast sky the vast cornfields all looked the same each turn lou directed chief gilbert stone to take led them to another narrow dirt road that cut through another field with a gentle breeze fanning the tall stalks it all seemed so peacefulso far removed from the guns and the combine harvester and the blood and the death but the nightmare had been real and notso brite had apparently paid for someones paranoia with his life it had taken most of an hour before the call from caps cell phone had directed a cruiser from the kings ridge police station to where the three of them were waiting in georges car the officer on orders from stone had led lou and the others to the station and after photographing lou fixed him up with a shower and a set of clothes even after washing off the blood and caked soil he looked beaten and totally spent his face had half a dozen gouges and his knuckles throbbed nasty crimson bruises encircled his neck like a clerics collar worst of all his ankle was quite swollen and was monitoring every heartbeat the small motorcade consisted of two cruisers stone drove lead with lou riding shotgun and cap and george seated quietly in back behind a wire mesh screen two officers occupied the second car even staying under fifteen nothing lou or the others described was of any help in leading stone to the spot where they were ambushed thirty minutes passed then another thirty several times lou thought they were on the right track his pulse spiked only to quickly settle down at the sight of a road sign or a house or outbuilding that told him they were still in the wrong place stone was patient and understanding but several times suggested that they might do better to suspend their search until daylight lou was adamant they continue look at my neck he insisted i didnt do this to myself there are at least two bodies out thereone of the men who was trying to kill us and our friend anthony brite cap saw him get shot he glanced back at his stoical friend and wondered what gilbert stone was thinking about him and george turn here cap said suddenly turn here lou nodded and stone made the right the other police car followed them onto yet another narrow dirt road both drivers cut to their fog lights and slowed to five there were no distinctive tire tracks on the dirt road but there was something about the interface between the road and the stalks that seemed familiar cap you sensing something lou asked maybe duncan do you really think you killed somebody too stone asked well first of all while one of them was shootin at me like wild bill hickok another one charged me i hit him with a right cross to the throat that would have stopped an elephant i didnt have time to stick around and check the guys pulse but he didnt seem to be doin much moving three dead and no bodies stone murmured thoughtfully not your everyday case theyre out there lou said gazing out the window and trying not to feel hopeless we should have left a breadcrumb trail george added well find him george lou said somewhat buoyed that they hadnt seen anything that meant this could not be the road well find him wait stone up there up ahead stone slammed on the brakes twenty feet ahead on the right was a gnarl of tread marks lou clambered out of the cruiser cringing when his ankle bore weight what do you have stone asked as he and the others approached lou pointed at the disrupted ground ahead this is it we were here you sure could just be farm machinery stone said climbing out with the others and panning the area with his flashlight mighty small machine george said i wish we had brought my car out here with us so we could compare but these tracks are bald in the same places my tires are bald he got low to the ground and felt around the depressions in the road then nodded authoritatively as if he actually could tell with renewed tension the group climbed back into the cruisers the fog lights were turned off and they slowly rolled ahead they had gone a quarter mile or so when lou exclaimed look look at the corn over there the fields on both sides of the road for as far ahead as they could see were mown flat the six of them stepped out into the cool early morning and listened nothing but the heavy white noise of humming insects and swishing stalks of corn where such stalks remained this has been threshed lou said what does that mean stone asked it means someone flattened these fields stone scanned the area with his flashlight it looked like the model of a nuclear winter this is where these gunmen attacked you he said id bet on it lou said excited at last we didnt pass any other fields that had been cut down like this its a huge coverup i agree cap said lou limped into the field was it possible this wasnt the place he inhaled deeply tasting the air and then inspected a handful of choppedup stalks and leaves this field looks like it was very recently cut he said these plants havent decayed any and you can still smell diesel in the air stone shook his head i want to believe you welcome he said i really do but i still have trouble wrapping my brain around the extent these killers went to in order cover up what you say happened here he took his powerful flashlight out again and shone it at one of the overhead spotlightsthen at another none of them was lit but all the bulbs appeared intact i thought you said you shot out the lights stone said for the first time there was a note of cynicism in his voice they could have been replaced george said and we could be in the wrong place you guys havent spent much time out here in corn country if youve spent any at all its sort of like another planet to you you could be feeding off one another we see that sort of group dynamic from time to time its like a form of hysteria or mass hypnosis you start following some suspicious thugs out of the city and get yourselves doublecrossed and ambushed no ones attention to details is all that sharp the stories get twisted on one another cap strode up to the police chief and hands on hips glared down at him it was as if michelangelos david had decided to confront the tourists who were gawking at him do i look hysterical he asked lou who was kneeling nearby inspecting the soil glanced back at his chisled friend and grinned duncan dont get me wrong stone was saying i just think we should go at this in the morning with a lot more men and some dogs cap took a step back what about notso george insisted notsos dead cap said i saw him get shot i dont give a damn what you saw im not leaving my cousin out here in this stinkin field to get eaten by animals we dont even know if this is the right field stone said lou felt the situation getting tense he did not know george well enough to predict his actions or whether cap would be able to control him he imagined him facedown in the dirt with his hands cuffed behind him and gilbert stones knee in the small of his back at that moment lous hand brushed over another clump of dirt this one had something hard embedded in itsomething hard and sharp so sharp that it took a few seconds for him to realize that he had been cut he inspected the side of his palm blood was oozing out of a halfinchlong slice carefully lou worked his fingers around the edges of the object that had cut him he scraped the dirt away and was left with a large shard of glassthick textured glass whats that stone asked inspecting the object with his flashlight broken spotlight glass if im not mistaken lou said id guarantee it told you george chirped stone fingered the glass well lou asked stone shrugged well i think its time we go pay a visit to william chester whos that asked lou the guy who owns these fields thats who chapter a twelvefoothigh vinecovered stone wall enclosed cross winds the chester estate stone left his two officers to continue patrolling the fields and then drove lou cap and george to the far western part of kings ridge and up a broad circular drive lined with trees a security guard posted at the gated entrance checked everyones id before calling inside and granting the group passage mounted security cameras monitored their arrival ah the joys of big bucks lou thought sardonically cross winds was a resplendent twostory neoclassical mansion featuring large gently arched windows and stone chimneys the windows were dark from within save for one on the first floor even in the darkness it was obvious the grounds were a source of pride to the owner the grass cut to the height of a putting green and tastefully illuminated by a series of inground lights glowed the color of a polished emerald while the hedges were pruned with a carpenters precision sprawling rock gardens and flower beds completed the remarkable landscape protruding past the corner of the main house was a portion of a large dimly lit greenhouse the odd quartet proceeded up a short flight of stairs and onto a wide veranda that featured a dozen classic rocking chairs lous ankle challenged him with every step stone used a huge bronze wolfshead knocker to confirm their arrival and in seconds a cast iron lantern dangling overhead bathed them in a diffuse incandescent glow the massive front door opened revealing a roundfaced man in his midsixtiesswarthy and fit in a weight lifters sort of way he had narrow eastern european eyes and thick silver hair combed in a sideways part as straight as the hedge trim outside despite the early hour it seemed as if he had not been sleeping william chester he said shaking each mans hand as he directed the group into the elegant foyer inside his hands were thick and powerful and lou wondered if he might be putting something extra into each squeezean immediate message as to who was in charge and not to be trifled with the gesture was understandable on their drive over lou had used his smartphone to research the man chesters rise to industry dominance would have sent horatio alger scurrying for his typewriter chester age five along with his father mother and a sister immigrated illegally to the united states from poland as stowaways onboard a cargo ship having spent their life savings to secure safe passage the family changed their name from chudnofsky to chester and settled down in a single room in the heart of manhattans hells kitchen chester would later say the rundown building where his family lived would have been condemned had it not been needed by the city to house the rats eventually bernard chester found employment in the garment district however the familys good fortune proved shortlived carlo gambino of the gambino crime family assumed control over the district and bernard became a leader among those opposed to him william had just turned eleven when his father along with several others was gunned down penniless chester supported his family by sweeping floors in a plant wholesaler within a year he had shown an unusual aptitude for stimulating plant health and growth and was hired away by the barlow seed companyfirst as a salesman then as an assistant manager to donald barlow who subsequently became his mentor by the time william was thirty he was managing the barlow company which was by then among the twenty topgrossing operations of its kind when barlow died suddenly and without family his company passed to chester the subsequent growth of chester seed and fertilizer soon to be chester enterprises put the company among the top ten in the industry worldwide barlow died suddenly the phrase from the wikipedia article on william chester resonated in lous mind over the final mile to the chester mansion he searched donald barlow on google then yahoo and finally bing the third try was the charm a small article in a thirtythreeyearold issue of the miami herald reported the accidental death of seed giant donald barlow who was washed overboard during a surprise squall while sailing aboard his fiftytwofoot yacht green thumb the only other one on board at the time was barlow company executive william chester who immediately radioed the coast guard and followed their instructions despite chesters efforts and an extensive sea and air search barlows body was not recovered police say that a cause of death hearing routine in such deaths at sea will be held in the near future william chester impeccably dressed in deck shoes chinos and a turquoise knit shirt led the quartet to a conference room just off his study offered them soft drinks and water and motioned them to take any seats they wished around what looked to lou like a mahogany table that might have cost the total of all the furniture he had ever owned well gentlemen chester said in a calm authoritative voice i confess that i am rather shocked at the story as chief stone has related it to me suppose each of you give me your version and please take your time how far back would you like us to go lou asked why back to the beginning of course dr welcome why dont we begin with you and then mr duncan and finally mr kozak here lou noted how smoothly chester demonstrated that he knew their names after just a single introduction another wellmastered display of control lou began with the retelling of joey aldersons injury and the subsequent drive home with him from eisenhower memorial i dont know when these two thugs started following me he said it could have been several days before that but this past afternoon george and his cousin anthony brite noticed them checking out my building and we followed them back out here anthony brite is the man whom you say was gunned down chester asked thats right man george exclaimed he was my cousin and those dudes of yours burned him bastards for several moments there was absolute silence then chester nodded minutely at george his expression was placid but his narrow eyes were ice and fixed on george like an infrared sight young man he said finally you are a guest in my house and as long as i treat you with civility and respect you will honor me with the same courtesy is that clear i said is that clear lou felt the mans power he also sensed strongly that the word boy had barely gone unsaid george seemed unable to respond got it he finally managed eyes to the floor his usual bravado gone chief stone chester said my orchids are a source of calm and balance for me i think i would prefer to continue this discussion in my greenhouse or if you prefer sometime tomorrowperhaps out where these gentlemen say they were attacked i can ask my field manager to meet us there and perhaps one or two of my attorneys as well stone silently polled the others its your house bill he said lets take this meeting outside the group stood and parted like the red sea as chester strode past them through a set of french doors then down a long corridor to a rear door that opened on one end of a magnificent fragrant greenhouse perhaps the size of a hockey rink with the touch of a button the subdued lighting brightened and soft classical musicbeethoven lou guessedflowed through speakers that seemed to be everywhere the entourage followed chester into densely humid air that was rich with the aromas of flowers and ripe fruit lou picked up the scent of chocolate raspberry and citrus the most strongly the flowering plants he realized might all be orchids chester paused perhaps to appreciate his visitors collective awe he then lifted a specialized gauge and began testing a nearby flower bed which seemed to consist of an earthy mix of moss and bark it is a common misconception that orchids are difficult to grow chester said while sprinkling water here and there but the truth is you just have to be aware of their needs i think of orchids not as plants but as a civilizationa culture whose customs i have come to know intimately do you enjoy gardening dr welcome mr chester forgive my impatience but we have a very serious situation here lou said men have been killed in a field that you own our friend among them chester stopped taking measurements settled himself with a breath and gave lou a curious stare dr welcome i did not become a person of influence possession and power by not knowing precisely what was going on around me as i told chief stone when he called i have received no reports of any disturbances in any of my fields lou began to bristle i dont care what reports you received or did not receive mr chester he said our injuries can tell you what happened out there our stories coincide we were ambushed and attacked with fists with guns and with a combine harvester the area where it took place has been mown clear and the bodies including anthony brites have been removed stone positioned himself between lou and chester perhaps sensing the simmering exchange might boil over bill stone said clearly wishing he were anyplace but there dr welcome believes he has evidence that the spotlights they claim to have shot out were replaced i cant believe it chester snapped if such a thing transpired i can assure you none of my employees was involved funny that these nonemployees knew how to drive your combine harvester cap said chesters eyes flashed lou almost cracked a smile imagining what the man was thinking being spoken to in such a way by someone he probably considered so far beneath his status chester brushed the comment aside with a wave of his hand believe me he said operating farming machinery is not nearly as difficult as growing these orchids especially when the keys are left in the ignition slot as is often the case here ive warned my people against such practices but alas they dont always listen show him the glass cap said to lou lou handed the jagged piece of broken glass to chester who inspected the heavy shard like a gemologist and what do we think this is chester asked floodlight glass lou said as you know the lights are on poles twenty feet above the ground i found this at the base of one of the poles who besides one of your employees would and could repair the floodlight that george shot out george broke in and why would your field be threshed after we left it ill tell you why he pointed his finger at chester a coverup thats why stone gripped george by the wrist and forcefully lowered his arm son he said youd best watch how you speak to mr chesterespecially in his home hes agreed to help us and your accusations arent helping anybody got it george nodded glumly its all right gilbert chester said obviously these men have experienced some sort of trauma and quite possibly on my land any idea who might have been involved stone asked no but i can assure you it was no one in my employ ill be happy to make my employee records available to you i appreciate that chester turned his attention back to lou is it possible that in all the confusion youve described dr welcome you merely thought a floodlight that had shattered some time ago had been shot out floodlights do break from time to time kids and rocks and thermal changes you know perhaps the piece youve found is an old one thats not possible lou said coolly i know what i saw a man died next to me i saw him get shot then are you sure you were in the right spot the fields can become quite disorienting especially at night we strongly believe that was the spot lou said my my chester said this is certainly quite distressing gilbert ill phone stewart right away who is stewart lou asked his patience walking the edge he manages all my fields chester said im not denying some version of what you have said actually occurred but i will strongly contest that any of my people were involved i assure you gilbert youll have my full cooperation thank you stone said looking satisfied were going to bring a k unit out to the fields later this morning and start searching for their friend that sounds like a fine idea chester replied is there anything else you think we should be doing well lou said i do have a question about your corn go on your plants seem quite high for this time of year and one other thing cap said go ahead mr duncan i thought each stalk produced one ear one of the stalks i checked had four the other had five chester chuckled im pleased to meet an amateur agrarian he said some kinds of corn still make one ear per stalk but many others are hybridized and produce two and even three still our corn is special ill show you why chester led them over to a row of baskets filled with flowers of a stunningly iridescent blue weve been experimenting with a new type of fertilizer in our fields its the same formula that ive used to help grow these magnificent blue phalaenopses this type of orchid is often extremely difficult to grow especially with color this brilliant but thanks to our breakthrough fertilizer the task has been made remarkably easy id tell you more about it sometime after our patent issues are dealt with but for now i must pay homage to a busy day ahead by getting some sleep at that moment the greenhouse door flew open and in stepped a wellgroomed nattily dressed man of slight stature perhaps fivefootseven in his early forties he was quite handsome with chiseled features raven hair gelled straight back and dark piercing eyes whats going on here the new arrival asked sharply moving so that he stood shoulder to shoulder next to chester and eyeing lou cap and george as if they had dropped in from mars ah edwin chester said it appears we have had a disturbance in one of our fields then what are you doing even talking to these people without our attorney chester actually seemed somewhat cowed next to the man i just didnt feel it was necessary he said sometimes i wonder how youve made it this far father gentlemen william chester said id like you to meet edwin chester my son chapter edwin chester stood motionless beside his father at the center of the magnificent greenhouse lou introduced himself by name but the scion made no attempt to shake his hand cap and george received the same chilly greeting edwins gaze turned first to stone then back to chester what sort of disturbance he asked gesturing toward lou and the other two what happened to these men we were attacked cap said ambushed thats what happened and in your fathers cornfield whats my fathers is mine edwin said ambushed by whom what are you talking about lou paid close attention to edwins reaction his surprise appeared to be genuine as did his indignation about having to deal with this situation at all these three are from dc chester said they say they followed two men out here whom they believed were following them they claim there was an ambush and gunfire and that at least two men were killed one of them was their friend my cousin george corrected chief stone is here to investigate and ive offered our complete cooperation that makes no sense edwin said why would somebody attack these men in our cornfield have you contacted someone from hensleys theyre on call to us twentyfourseven thats why you pay them that ridiculous retainer lou took a step forward i believe i know exactly why we were attacked he said addressing both chester men and who the hell are you edwin dr welcome here is an emergency physician at eisenhower memorial stone said lou was unable to ignore the fact that william was concerned as to why the ambush could have happened while his son seemed interested only in absolving them of any responsibility go on edwin said as if he expected lou wouldnt speak without his permission ive noticed an unusual pattern of behavior among people in kings ridge lou began it seems that my observations may have attracted the attention of the people who ambushed usor else of the people who hired them what sort of behavior edwin asked for me it all started with the john meacham shootings lou said meacham william exclaimed what in the hell could that crazy murderer have to do with your being ambushed in our field it was the first crack in the mans composure continuing to select each word with care lou reviewed his job with the pwo his relationship with meacham and the reason for his trip to the hospital in kings ridge i dont think john knew what he was doing when he shot those people lou summarized his judgment was impaired and of course his judgment was impaired edwin cut in he was deranged he had proven that before but apparently you werent paying attention then now youre consumed with guilt and willing to pin the blame on anyone and anything except your bad evaluation of the man up until the day he killed those people meacham had been doing fine stone asked as if he expected edwin to jump down his throat perfect from all i can tell lou replied then what happened thats what id like to find out lou said you see i think meacham is the tip of an iceberg explain edwin said curtly from what i can tell he wasnt deranged in the sense that he had gone crazy lou replied it seems more as if he was profoundly confusedas if his logic and reasoning deserted him lou went on to review the police report of the woman who survived long enough to describe meachams repeated muttering of the phrase no witnesses during his rampage even though the most important witness of all roberta jennings had long since departed the office that does sound strange edwin said lou sensed that he had now lost the older chester completely and knew that he had never made a dent in gilbert stone but there seemed to be at least a glimmer of interest from edwin lou decided it was worth pushing his theories and theres more he said he recounted the baffling and at times risky medicine being practiced by several of the staff at deland regional carolyn meachams dangerous car chase and finally his observations surrounding joey aldersons near amputation and the young chefs admission that he had no idea why he chose to reach beneath the deadly blade when he did in each instance he concluded it appeared that there was a temporary loss of judgmenta gap in thinking or if you will a lapse of reason oh jesus edwin muttered when lou had finished this is absolute rubbish it is preposterous to think that youd be the target of a deadly ambush like you claim happened just because of your theories which are utterly baseless lous patience with the man was wearing thin baseless chief stone how many residents are there in kings ridge seven thousand ten stone grumbled clearly wishing they could all call it quits ten lou echoed even allowing for the fact that not everyone working at the hospital is from kings ridge ive just identified roughly ten people who have exhibited these symptoms and that was without even searching for them now i was never a biostatistics whiz in med school but i did pass i imagine that someone who knew what they were doing and crunched the numbers would tell us there is no coincidence at work here ridiculous edwin said please gilbert tell me youre not buying in to this nonsense were investigating all possibilities edwin stone said well cooperate in the morning when our attorneys are present but for now i ask that you all leave these premises immediately so that my father and i might attempt to get some sleep of course stone said without reaction william stalked from the greenhouse and gilbert stone led the others through a door leading to the front lawn lou was the last of the group to leave edwin was standing by the door and as lou passed edwin seized him tightly by the arm what in the hell is really going on welcome the man whispered harshly despite the difference in their height he fixed lou with an icy glare i thought i just told you lou said pulling his arm free and not backing off a step there is something deadly wrong going on in kings ridge chapter darlene wore a brunet wig in addition to the same whiteframed tinted glasses she had on the evening she met with double m the disguise worked well in her tightfitting jeans and studded leather jacket darlene blended in perfectly with the other nighthawks enjoying an earlymorning meal at chef chens no one in the eatery seemed to recognize the first lady of the united states seated alone in a back booth not far from the kitchen victor ochoa on high alert was at a lacquered table directly across from her he sipped absently at his tea while constantly scanning the roomespecially the main entrance the girls werent going to show darlene made the briefest eye contact with the man committed to protecting her at all costs and shrugged her pulse had been racing since she met him by the exit in the basement below the white house pantry ochoa was driving his private car and his composure kept her reasonably grounded i need your help finding this girl she had said to him on the ride from the movie theater back to the white house she handed him the stack of photographs that double m had given to her ochoa studied the images and set them facedown on his lap is she a prostitute he asked darlene was stunned how did you just a lucky guess secret service agents like to think were a special breed of law enforcement but underneath the dark suits and shades were really all just cops at heart this her fingerprint yes and thats a sample of her voice her name may be margo thats all i have thats a lot ive got a few friends working with dc vice if its all right with you ill let them look these over and see what they come up with what they came up with was the name margo spencer a doeeyed sixteenyearold seasoned call girl who disappeared shortly after russ evans resigned but before his case was prosecuted in fact without access to their star witness the us attorneys office in dc opted not to bring the case to trial at all evanss disgrace the head of the office begrudgingly decided would have to be punishment enough the police and fbi could not explain why margo had disappeared because of her age shed been spared the limelight that had shone on other women who played a part in the downfall of other wellknown public figures i would imagine shes laying low until the noise surrounding evans dies down ochoa said i dont think so victor darlene replied i think shes afraid of the people who hired her ochoas contacts gave him the names and photographs of three women who they believed might have been friends with margo the three known to vice as jewel monicabelle and debbi were still holding on to their looks and worked for various highend escort services they also periodically fed information to vice in exchange for being left alone ochoa had been tipped that they often met at chef chens after finishing an evening of work the best he could do was to get a message to the one named jewel that there would be easy money to be made should the three of them stop by chens at two darlene did not sip her wonton soup so much as she kept stirring it with her plastic ladle the meetings first with evans at the bar none then with double m in the alley had her on edge and she had been eating very little victor might be able to sneak her out of the white house once he told her perhaps twice more should the girls be noshows this morning but each such departure carried with it increasing risks most notably with martin his tension as he stepped more and more out onto a rocky campaign trail was becoming almost palpable and darlene felt increasingly uneasy around him kim had actually and earnestly suggested they find a way to get some counseling but darlene laughed off the notion replying that trying to do so would be like asking her husband to deal with his fear of heights through a set of skydiving lessons she was settling herself down by playing through a number of the more wonderful memories of the early years of their marriage when at the front door swung open and three striking women strode into the restaurant darlene looked over at ochoa and he confirmed her suspicions with a nod the women did not look exactly as they did in their photographs monicabelle a redhead was now a platinum blonde with her hair tied back jewel wore glasses and debbi had morphed from a pixiecut brunette to shoulder length they wore elegant stilettoheeled boots and skintight designer jeans that darlene put at three hundred a pair minimum their gold jewelry jangled like wind chimes and she caught the aroma of perfume mixed with the odor of cigarettes as they passed a closer look and she upped her initial estimate of their ages to thirty or even somewhere north of that monicabelle and debbi slid in across from jewel two booths away before too much longer darlene found herself thinking life was going to start getting harder for the trio ochoa waited for the women to place their orders before he approached oh handsome debbi said curling her lower lip in a pout im afraid our meters stopped running a while ago the three burst out laughing ochoa joined in at a reduced level this is easy money he said you dont even have to get up oooh kinky jewel said and the trio exploded again ochoa waited until their mirth had drifted off then he swung a chair over from the table behind him made sure no one was watching and slid three hundreds in front of each of them im not here for that he said i just want to talk jewel flipped the bills with the edge of her thumb this wont even get us through five minutes at nordstroms makeup counter she said sorry im low budget fed sort of yes or no the women took a silent poll and nodded quickly the nine hundred vanished im not alone he said motioning for darlene to join them oh you are a kinky one debbi murmured her accent hispanic darlene took the space next to jewel so whos your cute friend monicabelle asked ochoa my names brenda darlene said jewels pale blue eyes fixed on her and for a moment darlene thought her disguise had failed then the call girl simply smiled nodded and said howre you doin brenda ochoa was on his feet hands on darlenes shoulders ready to move out the door if necessary but the scattered patrons in chef chens seem to be paying little if any attention to them darlene motioned him back into his seat ladies this handsome guy is victor his job is to keep me safe and thankfully hes very good at it hes the one who sent that note to me at the agency right jewel asked you got it ochoa said my kind of man monicabelle said great hands thats how i judge a guyby his hands darlene moved the group closer listen we need your help locating a girl whom we think you know can victor show you some pictures monicabelle appeared suspicious you gonna try and take back the cash if we dont know her because no darlene said the money is yours regardless the girls took another quick poll then shrugged their agreement okay jewel said show us what you got ochoa brought out a stack of police photographs he and darlene chose to avoid any of the ones double m had taken with his cell phone he spread the pictures across the table arranging them so that each woman had some images to examine debbi and jewel looked them over but their expressions revealed nothing monicabelle on the other hand connected with the girl right away this is angela she said darlene tried to conceal her disappointment im sorry i should have told you she said the girls name is margo yeah and my names queen latifah if the price is right monicabelle answered what are you saying ochoa leaned across the table to ask i mean she might have said her name is margo or fargo or whatever the woman said but i know this girl well we used to work for the same service she was younger than me so i kind of looked out for her a real looker in my opinionnatural if you know what i mean didnt need no makeupat least not yet girls name was sylvia sylvia winger but she went by angela was darlene and ochoa exchanged tightlipped glances well angela or margo was coerced by somebody into framing a good friend of mine darlene said we promise that we mean her no harm we just want to talk to her thats impossible monicabelle replied almost anything is possible im pretty well connected you could be the pope for all it matters but nobody can keep angela safe now shes dead the words though no longer totally unexpected fell like hammer strikes oh thats terrible darlene said her voice breaking do you know what happened to her she moved to tampa to be with her mom a few months ago i got a postcard from her do you know how she died without margo martin would never believe double ms recording was real she drowned monicabelle said simply washed up on a beach after shed gone missing from a party her mother found my number in her things and called to tell me you can imagine how she was feeling angela was a baby im so sad would it upset you if victor tried to learn the details of her death we dont mind the woman said you really seem like a nice person so are youall of you darlene didnt have to force the sincerity in her voice she extended her hands and the three escorts covered them with theirs darlene nodded to ochoa who pulled a blackberry from his jacket pocket as she looked over his shoulder watching him key the name sylvia winger and the word tampa into the google search box margos photopossibly from high school appeared in a search result set that included the girls obituary they read through the short paragraph and then an earlier account in the tampa tribune of her death it says here that the toxicology was positive for alcohol three times the legal limit no one seemed to know or care where she was partying accidental drowning darlene said to the women it makes sense the police here didnt know about her death it wasnt suspicious so the tampa cops had no reason to publish her picture on any of the law enforcement databases i never knew her to be that heavy of a drinker monicabelle said but then again i didnt know her all that well victor darlene said her voice strained i need to make a call ill be in my booth ill be right back ladies this would be a good time to have the waiter bring your food back at her booth she retrieved the cell phone double m had given her accessed the preentered contact number and then pressed send double m answered on the second ring you found her he asked excitedly shes dead darlene said softly close to tears over the hardness of the world for so many like sylvia winger we may be at a dead end ourselves my husband has forbidden me to discuss the russ evans case with him or even to mention his name i believe you when you say the risk involved if we cant get russ evans back to work is substantial but without the girls testimony theres nothing i can do to help thats not entirely true double m said i think i have another idea chapter cap pulled off the road and onto the gravel shoulder about a mile from the kings ridge police station the heavy sense of loss among them had taken over george who had done a remarkable job of maintaining his composure stumbled out of the car dropped to his knees and pounded the ground sobbing then he vomited afterwards he washed out his mouth from a bottle of water that lou had accepted from william chester and cried some more they shot him he sobbed they fuckin shot him and now notsos gone forever lou crouched down and set a comforting hand on the young mans shoulder then he helped him back to the prizm we dont know for sure that hes gone lou said maybe they took him somewhere he could be a prisonera hostage whos they george shouted well if you believe chester its somebody who doesnt work for him yeah well i dont believe chester at all george said that guys a liar he wouldnt last five minutes on the street without all that money to protect him people would see through him in a second daybreak was approaching scudding clouds concealed the bright moonlight only the drone of nighttime insects broke the otherwise heavy silence lou thought about his own family he and graham were not that closecertainly not the kind of friends george and his cousin notso were he wondered how he would react if graham had violently died he would certainly demand answers and would likely stop at nothing to get them lou and george might have come from different worlds but for them at least the language of family was a constant headlights from an approaching car illuminated the roadway behind them reflexively the three of them dropped down beside the prizm lou tensed while cap reached for a rock to use as weapon the car rumbled past them without slowing lou felt his tension ease he took out his smartphone and went straight to google wish you didnt turn that gun over to chief stone cap said to george dropping the rock he asked for it and hes a friggin cop what in the hell was i supposed to do you did right sorry pal im a little short on sleep when did stone want us back here cap asked lou he said eight do you guys want to go home and shower then come back thats only a few hours from now cap said checking his watch i can call someone to open stick and move what do you say we go back to those fields and do some more searching on our own im in lou said stifling a yawn i dont have to be at the er until tomorrow what are you looking up corn learning anything maybe back at the house you asked chester about the number of ears on a stalk it says here one or twothree at the very most but i cant find anyplace that says four or five and look theres a five right there they look like torpedoes cap said lou broke off an ear from the top of a stalk stripped it and snapped it in two at the center then he started counting kernels this is incredible he said it says in this article here that because of the way an ear develops there are always an even number of rows of kernelsusually fourteen or sixteen this one has twentyfour multiply the number of rows by the number of kernels per row and you get how much corn there is per ear this article says between four hundred and six hundred depending on whether the ear has fourteen or sixteen rows well this monster has about fourteen hundred plus all those extra ears per stalk cap said exactly thats a powerful lot of corn its more than that george said its frankencorn what frankencorn i did a paper on the genetic modifications in the fishing industry and they used the term frankenfish to describe these genetically engineered humongous salmon so thats what you think these ears are george snapped off an ear peeled the leaves and held it up turning it from one side to another thats it exactly he said im sayin its frankencorn freaky corn im sayin it aint natural gmo baby genetically modified organism george flipped the ear aside disdainfully lou went back to his smartphone it says gmo is pretty common now in the corn business in fact its the rule more than the exception but mostly because the ears have engineered resistance to the pesticides that are sprayed on them same for most agricultural plants whatever it is it certainly seems as if this frankencorn isnt the result of some superfertilizer like chester claims but if gmo is so common george asked why would chester lie about it thats what im asking myself lou said why would he lie chapter sebastian bachmeier donned a pair of safety glasses then released the top button of his meticulously pressed lab coat his unshaven face was sunken from lack of sleep but his ice blue eyes sparked with excitement though he was a strapping german standing sixfootthree or four sebastian looked pocket sized when compared to the massive array of scientific equipment crammed inside his laboratory he was standing in front of a long conveyor belt that at first glance appeared to be painted gold but a closer inspection would show it to be covered with kernels of corn the belt zigzagged like an amusement park ride throughout the enclosure when sebastian spoke his deep accented voice reverberated off the steel walls of the underground facility like the cries of a lost spelunker this is experiment number seventhirtyeight in our efforts to create an effective biolistic delivery mechanism to transfect gold particles coated with the dna plasmid we have codenamed mbr directly into the corn seed this represents the final set of experiments before certifying the process we have dubbed rapture for commercial readiness though the outcome of rapture will obviate the timeconsuming and resourceintensive sexual process for creating hybrid corn seed rest assured this transformative technology cannot be extended to human reproduction sebastian chuckled at his own humor his giddy mood resulted from years of seventyhour workweeks that were about to pay off to the tune of a multibilliondollar technologic breakthrough sebastian paused here mesmerized by the significance of the moment soon farmers the world over will be able to customorder corn seed with the unmatched yield potential of our trugrow genetics i am now going to demonstrate the process used to make the trugrow corn seed this technique not only delivers the holy grail mark of three hundred bushels per acre but also dramatically speeds up the time to market by using actual kernels instead of the widely accepted tissueculture process sebastian approached a gleaming stainless steel apparatus suspended directly above a section of the conveyor belt a long bazookalike tube extended downward from the apparatus its muzzle about an inch above the corn kernels i have increased the psi of the helium powering our gene gun ensuring low transfection efficiency to obtain the optimum number of transfected neurons in the kernels targeted cells to save time i have preloaded the gun with pellets coated with a mix of positively charged gold particles and the mbr dna plasmid in ten minutes time the guns selfloading mechanism will transfect enough corn seed to plant a thousand acres it would take six months to replicate this process using hybrid corn and tissue cultures with substantially lower yield sebastian reached for a tablet pc that was secured to a concrete support post with several strips of velcro as he was tapping on the computers display a series of machines instantly thrummed to life the conveyor belt groaned and shook as the roller mechanisms became engaged the corn needed to travel fifteen feet before the first batch could be blasted by the gene guns massive barrel sebastian put on his protective earphones anticipating the loud boom to come the conveyor belt stopped in the expected location however the gun failed to fire seated feet up on his desk across from his builtin fortyeightinch television edwin chester watched the informational video made three months before for perhaps the twentieth time each time his research assistant behaved as stupidly as the last edwin held his thumb on the button of the dvd remote and considered shutting off what he knew was to follow sebastian removed his earphones and rubbed his chin perplexed hmmmm he said as he ruminated on the problem he sauntered over to the gene gun where he inspected the barrel in search of the malfunction stop edwin urged silently for gods sake you stupid bastard stop the scene moved on with the inexorableness of a glacier sebastian could not discern the nature of the problem from an upright position so he knelt on the concrete floor using a penlight he peered into the dark aperture power down jesus sebastian cut off the fucking helium and power down sebastian turned toward the camera and smiled the contact points in the firing mechanism are off by a millimeter or so he said i should have it fixed in no time sebastian pulled down on a lever which raised the barrel of the gun two feet the repositioning allowed him access to the gun barrels internal mechanics corn seed scattered onto the floor as sebastian wriggled himself into a supine position on the conveyor belt then he reached one hand into the gun barrel and began to fiddle with the connection until there was a satisfying click you stupid bastard edwin said out loud you know better than to do this as always there was nothing he could do sebastian again used his penlight to peer into the muzzle a thin smile creased the corners of his mouth success a second passed edwin cringed and sank farther down in his chair his eyes refused to close the deafening pop from the huge gene gun seemed louder every timelike the backfiring of an eighteenwheeler the sound was followed immediately by a faint discharge of smoke from the barrel sebastian cried out and rolled off the conveyor belt in obvious agony clutching his face blood instantly seeped out from between his fingers and spewed through multiple punctures in his neck he lay on his back on the corn kernels his body jerking spasmodically as jets of scarlet sprayed the equipment and soaked the floor beneath him then he lowered his hands and pressed futilely against the skin over his carotid arteries as if knowing that was where the wounds were mortal the thousands of gold pellets embedded in his face were like an obscene seurat painting shrieking in pain sebastian began picking at the pieces of searingly hot gold microshot the pellets used for inserting the dna plasmid into the kernels were cooking him alive blood continued spurting from his neck while his goldpockmarked face smoked from the embedded metal he writhed on the floor screaming and pleading for help gurgling on blood that had seeped inside his mouth and down his throat the handsome german an obsessive weight lifter was already a corpse whose head and neck were virtually the same golden color as the corn surrounding him edwin snapped off the video playback sebastians gruesome remains for a moment frozen on the screen faded into black he had seen enough of the scientists bizarre deathespecially now that he had the first inklings of an explanation for the mans behavioran explanation provided unknowingly by dr lou welcome chapter lou and the others spent an endless day searching for notso in the cornfields the dogs stone had brought in barked excitedly a couple of times but then quickly fell silent rabbits their handler said after three hours georges spirit was broken his plea for a chopper was brushed off as being fruitless with the corn being as dense as it was he continued going through the motions of a search scuffing through the tall stalks and grumbling about frankencorn but it was clear he was spent and in great despair about having to report his cousins probable death to his aunt not unexpectedly cap was a giant forging ahead tirelessly over ground they knew they had covered before lou found himself wondering how different the mans life would have been had he simply been allowed to live it still over the years the two of them had been to countless aa and na meetings together and not once had he heard cap complain about his lot a power of example he was called by most of those who knew him were not done looking stone said to the trio when they got back to the dirt road where their vehicles were parked but the dogs are beat well call in the staties and resume searching in the morning what the fuck for george muttered notsos dead and you know it were still viewing this as a searchandrescue mission son stone said in his soothing drawl if your friend is wounded and somewhere out in this cornfield well find him i promise you well find him cap could no longer hold back his irritation and what about the guys who tried to kill us he snapped you still viewing this as a crime scene for that as well stone showed no outward signs of losing his cool this whole investigation is going to take some time he said youve got to give us a chance to do our jobs none of the three from dc bothered to respond instead they climbed into the prizm and headed east back to the district cap dropped lou off at home only after getting assurances that he would call at the first hint of a return engagement from the muscle who had started it all lou trudged up the staircase to his apartment then fumbled to unlock his door between extended shifts on his feet in the er and sessions at the gym he was in better than decent shape this fatigue he knew was something elsea combination of frustration bewilderment and anger mixed with a goodsized dose of fearfear not so much for himself as for emily renee and steve as well as his father and graham it was hard to believe the thugs who had followed him home and later ambushed the four of them were through with him it was also hard to believe they would stop at anything to achieve whatever it was they were being paid to do one of the most interesting things to come of all that had happened were lous thoughts of his brother for reasons that were never completely clear probably grahams shame over lous addiction and months in rehab the two of them had drifted apart over the years since graham entered college and lous life began its gradual deterioration what graham would never know lou hoped was that the two occurrences were connected soon before graham was to enter georgetown their father buried himself beneath yet another financial avalanchethis one an absolute crusher that left the man virtually penniless and without hope of recovery unwilling to deprive his second son of a college education dennis had turned to lou who was already generating a salary as a resident dennis assumed without blinking that lou could and would help him out after all he contended he had been there as much as he could when it was lous college and med school tuition at stake surely graham the stronger student of the two deserved nothing less in the beginning lou managed and graham excelled then marriage and emily forced lou to add more moonlighting shifts until sleep became a major problem enter the friendly neighborhood amphetamine dealer and still more hours of work it was something like the socalled death spiral that figure skating pairs performedthe woman stretched out almost completely supine being spun faster and faster by her partner and closer and closer to the unyielding surface of the ice by the time the world and the dea came crashing in around lou graham had his mba and was excelling as a businessman and the distance between the two brothers could be measured in lightyears the first thing lou did after a walkthrough of his apartment and a glance into his closets was to check his email thinking that he might have received something from filstrup at the pwo nothing lou leaned back and stared at the ceiling consumed by a heavy melancholy he was disconnected from the thing in life outside of his family that meant the most to himbeing able to help sick docs who more often than not had very few people if anyone on their side now for the second time in his life he was one of them working through the stack of spam and email from clients who had chosen to ignore his status at the pwo further darkened lous mood in fact the only thought that appealed in the least was flopping facedown on his pillow and lying there until sleep brought him some relief it was then he realized that there was another unread email lost in the remaining spamthis one marked urgent the subject line read regarding events in kings ridge lous mouth went dry dr lou welcome for reasons that cannot be revealed i have become aware of your investigation into the peculiar behaviors exhibited by some residents of kings ridge virginia like yourself i believe these odd incidents may be connected your help is required to prevent what may be a looming disaster at precisely ten oclock on the date of this message your apartment door buzzer will ring when it does you are to go downstairs where you will find a waiting car and driver you must then do as he asks guaranteed you will not be harmed but if you want answers to your questions then you will comply with this request do not try to determine the source of this message i have taken the necessary precautions to safeguard my anonymity if you are willing to do as i request please respond to this email with the word wilco in the message body please you must help the message was unsigned lou knew that wilco was a military term meaning will comply but that did not mean the message sender was government he looked up the web site anonymousspeechcom from which the email had been sent according to the site which emily would probably understand better than he did the service provided the message sender with guaranteed anonymity by constantly moving its web servers which were located outside the united states to different countries while ignoring all government requests for subscriber information lou felt more curious than apprehensive a trap of some sort seemed possible but if so it was a clumsy one you will not be harmed at least whoever had written him admitted knowing that there had been trouble the people who had followed him before the nightmare in kings ridge knew his name and where he lived they were resourceful and violent if they were set on harming him warning him to the contrary made little sense no lou concluded as he sent the wilco message and then headed off to shower this was not a trap at he toweled off and changed into comfortable jeans and a tan canvas ll bean polo shirt then he folded some turkey sliced tomato and horseradish mustard in a wrap and finished it with a handful of chips a can of diet coke and a kosher dill at he called emily he wanted her to hear his voice as much as he needed to hear hers their conversation was nothing out of the ordinary for themschool weekend plans and life at home it pleased him to learn that the tension with steve had lessened and that a conversation with him one on one had resulted in his agreeing to allow her to use her computer in her room im really proud of the way youre handling this honey he said thanks i was a little surprised when he caved in it turns out he was just trying to help mom who was worried about a report from ms sternweiss that i wasnt checking over my math homework but youre doing better at it starting to thats great em just great dad yeah are you okay lou nearly stumbled on his reply of course i am why would you ask nothing just a weird little chill i had well im fine everythings fine i love you honey i know i love you too daddy you be good to your mom okay i will you sure youre all right tired but otherwise fine and ready for a monopoly rematch ill see you saturday okay there was another missed beat from emilys end then okay daddy bye lou set the phone back in its cradle and braced his arms against the end table his knees were putty and the fullness in his chest felt like a balloon what in hell have i gotten myself into he asked once then again he was still leaning against the end table when his apartment buzzer startled him he glanced at his timex a fathers day gift from emily ten oclock on the nose lou considered grabbing a kitchen knife but decided against it the email made him believe that whoever was waiting for him downstairs wanted his helpfor what exactly hed find out soon still not completely trusting his knees lou held on to the railing on the way downstairs breakthrough or danger despite having showered he was starting to sweat his body was pulsating with a nervous energy youre going to see your daughter on saturday he said to himself youre going to be fine at the foot of the stairs lou peered out through the front doors sidelight window at a large sedanpossibly a town car a man graying hair sharp looking in a dark blazer tie and khaki pants waited beneath the porch bulb lou opened the door to accompany him to the car but the visitor stepped inside the tiny foyer lou judged him to be a lightheavyweight and in shape still his eyes were kind and lou felt no threat dr welcome thats right turn around please and put your hands on the wall ive got to frisk you no introduction and lou didnt ask for one this was a driverprofessional muscle and judging by his notoverwhelming size a tough one at that william chester lou thought the bodyguard had to be working for the seed magnate lou spread his legs and set his palms on the wall grateful that he had left the knife in the kitchen when the driver finished he escorted lou down the outside stairs to the town car idling by the curb the cars tinted rear window slid down as they approached lou was surprised to see a striking wellgroomed woman sitting alone in the backseat she looked out at him smiled thinly and nodded lou caught his breath as recognition took hold he had seen darlene mallory on television in the papers and in magazines but this was the first time he had seen her in person his initial impression was that none of the photos or video footage had done her even remote justice chapter darlene opened the car door and slid over halfway to make room lou stayed where he was scanning the street is there a problem she asked that depends on on whether there are any thickwaisted badtempered neckless men watching us and whether your driver can handle himself the way i think he can victor is secret service and very protective he shoots anyone who even looks at me crosseyed then he asks questions later good thing i cant cross my eyes lou said through the window nice to meet you victor and you doctor not to worry about the other thing i have an agent at the end of the street covering our back besides i hear youre a decent boxer only when the other guy isnt hitting back lou climbed in next to the first lady ive been looking forward to meeting you dr welcome darlene said lous throat went dry as he struggled to find his voice in the er he knew he was sometimes known as dr cool for the way he kept it together even in the worst emergencies in fact over the years he had treated a number of prominent politicians and even a couple of wellknown celebrities without losing his objectivity except once when he asked for a photo signed to emily from the previous years winner of american idol but in the presence of this woman he felt extremely unsettled please call me lou he managed ive found that being called doctor often carries with it heightened expectations ive noticed the same thing she said her grip on his hand warm and confident darlene works fine for me thats right youre a doc do you miss it only every day im not surprised even after all these years and a gazillion patients i still love it each time i step into the hospital its the one place in the universe where i actually feel like i know what im doing her smile canceled out his selfconsciousness same here she said my office was my sanctuary i still think i could tell you something special about every single one of my patients pardon me for asking but are you okay you look a little pale sorry if im out of place but once a doctor always a doctor and a perceptive one at that youre the second woman who asked me that question in the last hour my thirteenyearold daughter emily the sorceress diagnosed me over the phone as not being my usual bubbly positive self forgive me darlene i didnt tell em but just a day ago i was being chased through a cornfield by some professional killers who when they werent shooting at me were trying to run me down with a combine harvester ouch as the daughter of a wheat farmer i know those harvesters thank goodness theyre not too maneuverable actually i was sixfootnine before this one got me well no wonder you look a little peaked lou loved her laugh under normal circumstances im a certified duespaying nonsleeper he said but theres no sleep and theres running for your life from people who want to shoot you or chop you up no sleep ill look less chalky soon im working on a pretty endless day myself i promise we wont be long but i want to hear about everything no no take as long as you like lou found his inner voice saying take all night dont worry about that he said im tough my daughter lisa is locked into me like a patriot missile just like emily is to you she has a tougher time getting a read on her father but as you might have discerned if youre at all political not many people do if any darlenes expression was enigmatic and lou wondered if the statement was calculated or had just slipped out he suspected it was spontaneous this was not a woman who measured her words i vote he said does that count as being political it counts more than everything else put together good answer hey victor this guy comes as advertised i like him lets go to plan b you got it keyed by victor the window between the front and backseats glided shut as the lincoln eased away from the curb lou turned to look behind them but never made it past darlene he was stunned to realize that the first lady was staring at him as well she made no attempt to look away he could not remember ever being so immediately attracted to a woman who was not renee and warned himself to remember he was compromised by stress and exhaustion and she was more than compromised by the obvious he felt a slight burning in his cheeks and suspected he no longer looked pale darlene spoke first do you need anything to drink she asked water soda im fine thanks he wondered if she knew that he didnt drink alcohol he could see the car had a small wellstocked bar she could have offered him a cocktail victor knew about his boxing had she been studying up on other aspects of his life she said he came as advertised they had to have done some homework on him before we begin she said her directness not at all surprising you should know if you dont already that my chief of staff and i did a little research on you when i knew we two might meet nothing too elaboratemostly a little background checking some phone calls and google and yahoo plus a dab of lexisnexis you wouldnt be the first what did you learn lets see from several sources we learned that you dont get along all that well with the head of the physician wellness office we also learned that the poor doctor who went crazy in virginia was back at work because you felt he was ready that about summarizes it anything else from google i learned that you dug yourself out of a hell of a hole about nine years ago and have helped a lot of other troubled doctors over the years since then from google images i learned that you dont photograph well and that your eyes are your best feature my dentist dr moskowitz would say it was my teeth except he worries that i grind when smart terrificlooking women say nice things to me thanks are you grinding now down to the nubs that smile i wont say stuff like that again lou she said sorry i can be a little flip and flirty at times and i have a tendency im not proud of to fish for compliments not to worry i have dental insurance so you checked me out you emailed me im here what can i do for you well first of all i wasnt the one who emailed you no it was a man my chief of staff kim hajjar and i call double m its short for mystery man and who is your mysterious double m lou asked and more importantly whats his connection to kings ridge virginia believe it or not i dont know our guy is either extremely cautious or absolutely paranoid he has made it clear to me that his life may be in danger if his identity becomes known he contacted me because of my friendship with russell evans the secretary of agriculture former he and i played in the kansas dirt together when we were children it was through me that he became friends with martin im sure you heard about the scandal involving him and a young woman and his subsequent resignation of course im glad to hear that hes not guilty but i tend not to judge people so i hadnt formed any opinion that doesnt surprise me double m wants me to convince my husband to reinstate russ and get him back to work he said the secretary was framed because of certain of his policies but he didnt say which ones do you have any thoughts about that i had heard that the fda and the department of agriculture were at war over lots of things because the food manufacturers dont have to tell people precisely what goes into the food theyre eating for example the way the current legislation is set up most products that are gmos are exempt from the label saying theyre a genetically modified product their argument is that foods developed using new genetic methods dont differ from the realdeal foods in any meaningful way for instance cows that are fed on gmo grainare they gmo cows or not the problem is that the government hasnt made it clear who is in charge of what go on ive recently been given new information from double m its that information ive come here to discuss with you do you trust him darlene sighed alas my best quality and worst shortcoming are the same i trust everyoneat least until theyve given me serious reason not to in that case i cant think of a worse game for you to be in than politics lou said amen to that but dont forget i didnt choose politics i chose martin lucky martin the thought popped uninvited into lous head and began to nest i voted for your husband lou said partly because i have the same problem you do with trust and i read more about you as a doc than i did about him as a politician well then youll want to listen to this victor continued driving as darlene handed lou an envelope containing the materials double m had compiled regarding the call girl he knew only as margo using a set of headphones darlene provided lou listened to the audio of the girl prepping to entrap russell evans and being obliquely threatened should she fail to perform up to expectations the mans voice whoever it is is digitally altered lou said pulling the headphones away as if they were burning his ears whoever your double m is he is an expert in electronics or has one on his payroll for a time they rode on in silence tough stuff darlene said finally she sounds awfully young i cant help thinking about emily same with me and lisa when i first heard it do you know whats become of this girl darlenes expression grew strained supposedly accidental drowning while staying with her mother in florida lots of alcohol in her system damn victor cruised past american university then down arizona avenue and finally to a parking spot just off the palisades playground you okay she asked a little shaken but im anxious to hear how this all connects with kings ridge in that case lets walk a bit they stepped out of the car into heavy damp air and headed down a narrow paved bike trail deserted this time of night lights from the city reflected off the rippling water of the potomac victor followed a good distance behind i took emily here when she was younger lou said i like to ride here when i have time with the president that would happen only if it would help him in the polls plan b was for victor to come here unless i gave him a signal that i wasnt interested in talking to you lets hear it for plan b lou said chapter martin absolutely deplores russell evans for humiliating him at a time when the polls have him at an alltime low russs father was a farmer like my dad but russ got a masters degree and ended up going into academics i always felt close to him he and i are mutually interested in kids nutrition martin has forbidden me even to mention his name thats got to be hard lou said walking slowly through the dense night the two physicians shared information along with bits about each others lives their conversation was easy and animated except for lous account of the almostcertain death of anthony brite which was obviously painful for her to hear after a while it was as if he and darlene mallory had been longtime friends still the tension that had brought them together was never far from the surface lou sensed another feeling building inside him as wellthe excitement of merely being close to her assuming those killers are connected with russ evans and double m she said anthonys death only underscores the importance of our figuring out whats going on according to double m she went on gretchen rose whose name the president had submitted to congress as evanss successor had strong views on states rights and limitation of federal involvement in setting agriculture policy evans was close to her polar opposite and that horrible tape lou asked martin is quite the skeptic and is already extremely prejudiced against russ i needed to find the girl on that recording to convince him that someone was manipulating his administration sadly thats not going to happen now but double m has another plansomething that hes asked me to make happen thats where you come in tell me darlene tucked her hands into the pockets of her windbreaker its all about corn she said thats about as far as i had gotten in kings ridge lou replied before the well ran dry i feel like the six blind men each trying to describe an elephant he described the findings that led him cap and george to refer to william chesters crop as frankencorn double m has never mentioned anything about this to me until today darlene said but he called and said that rather than try to get russ evans reinstated when the president wont even allow his name to be spoken i should concentrate on stopping a shipment of corn thats loaded on a cargo train scheduled to head west i dont know who supplied this corn or precisely where its going or when but ive been told that this shipment must be stopped darlene lou said is there any way any way at all that you can tell me something about this man that would help to figure out who he is it may be very important darlene sighed deeply ive met him but it was pretty dark and he had on glasses with heavy black frames and a baseball capa nationals cap i think he spoke to me using an electrolarynx even though there was nothing that i could see wrong with his neck probably just distorting his voice lou said go on please well hes a big manprobably taller than you im almost sixone when i dont slouch okay sixone and a little on the husky side he had a full beard but i thought it might be fake i promised i wouldnt push him to tell me who he was he said he would be in great danger if his identity became known i wont ask again he wants the corn shipment stopped by the president what could be wrong with it i dont know darlene said according to double m you might have the answer to that me i dont know anything about any shipments no but double m says you know a lot about the residents of kings ridge exhibiting very strange behavior apparently he believes theres a connection lou flipped through the people he had spoken to since meachams killing spree focusing on those who were above average height and huskygilbert stone employees at deland regional members of the police department farmers he had met at the grange hallwhere he also posted a notice asking for any information surrounding shootings in the chester enterprises fields or any stories of severe lapses in reason or judgment then there were the politicians he had yet to meet and others who might have feelings pro or con regarding russell evans the list was already daunting in fact lou realized double m could easily be an actor hired by russ evans and the tape could be bogus lou stopped as though he had just walked into a wall hey what if its the corn itself he asked the corn the frankencorn what if its somehow toxic for people meaning that this shipment of corn and john meacham are connected well i didnt think the killings had anything to do with corn until just now lou said but i can see the possibility then he related what he had observed about the cornthe unusual size and growth when we spoke with william chester he tried to convince us that the corn was just the byproduct of a new type of fertilizer chester enterprises is patenting genetically modified organism darlene whispered so do you think that double m works for william chester i dont know lou said there could be hundreds of corn shipments headed west even if we narrow it down to a specific company double m is concerned about only one specific cargo train filled with corn so where does that leave us lou asked he realized he was intentionally avoiding too much eye contact with the woman fearing she would feel correctly that he was staring my instructions were to get you and martin together i guess double m wants you to tell martin what youve just told me why if double ms not going to tell us which train weve got to stop what good will that do maybe hell give us that information after you talk to martin darlene offered maybe from what youve told me about your husband i dont think hes going to do anything without demanding to know who double m is if thats the case i will tell martin what i know i certainly understand there may be lives at stake but i cant begin to tell you the measures this man has taken to keep his identity a secret martins out of town right now theres no way i can get you a meeting with him until he gets back lou if it is the corn how do you think its affecting people lou shook his head i just dont feel like i know enough unless go on please from what we could tell there are hundreds probably thousands of acres of that gmo corn growing in kings ridge and and what if the problem is something airborne he said pollen sure lou said pollen the tassels on the ears produce pollen that gets dispersed by the wind airborne thats how people could be getting exposed they could be inhaling the pollen and be allergic to it that would certainly explain some things i havent been able to understand explain what things darlene asked the termites lou glanced back to ensure that his sudden enthusiasm hadnt brought victor any closer termites darlene echoed what on earth do lou put one foot up on a bench leaned on his knee and recounted the astounding setup at joey aldersons small apartment and the piranhalike efficiency with which his termites had totally dispatched a mouse darlene listened wideeyed occasionally brushing her hands down the length of her arms as though the termites lou was describing were crawling there as he expected darlene gleaned the significance of the tale immediately you think this airborne toxin causes mutation in the insects darlene asked i think along with a number of other questions its one worth answering and how do you propose to go about doing that dr oliver humphries lou said who one of the worlds leading experts on termites my smartphone and i are sort of joined at the hip i found him while i was googling flesheating termites after my visit to joeys i certainly hadnt connected the little beasties to corn but i was running out of paths to follow in investigating john meachams rampage so you had already planned to speak with this bug man about these termites yes i have an appointment with him the day after tomorrow now i have more questions to ask him such as whether some sort of airborne mutagen might be at work and if perhaps the effect on people is different from that on the termites but caused by the pollen nonetheless she said with new excitement where is he based he teaches entomology at temple university in philly darlene turned and beckoned victor over an exchange lou could not hear followed with victor doing a lot of head nodding and darlene a lot of talking victor ended the conversation with another quick nod then retreated back to where he was darlene returned to lous side so lou said did you tell him i was delusional and needed to be closely watched darlene smiled no i dont think youre delusional at all what i told victor was to make arrangements arrangements for what ive decided that were going to speak with your dr humphries together chapter roberta jennings was through being fat for the third time this week she had overeaten at millies and vomited up much of her meal it was her ninth or tenth unintentional purge for the month even that would not have been so bad if she had just dropped a pound one lousy pound instead though she had gained three its time for a change roberta had survived a lifetime of obesity by internalizing her struggles she endured endless taunts during her school years and later had learned to ignore the snickering at the office and whispers at restaurants her selfesteem was all but gone by the time she finished middle school she chose the persona of a giggly cheery friend to all but in truth the horrible ache inside her never abated if not for meeting and marrying terry there was no telling what she might have done now with him gone even the simple joys of life were lost to her magazines shed once loved depressed her she detested those emaciated waifs called models so thin theyd blow off the page in a strong wind still though it sickened her even to inhale the aroma of fast food or to gorge herself at millies she could not stop this is it if terry were alive perhaps hed have been an inspiration to cut back even though it never seemed to be a big deal to him he always told her to mind her weight which she had failed to do to the tune of thirty new pounds since his passing several reassuring friends convinced her that she suffered from an addiction like an alcohol or drug problem she appreciated their opinions because addiction meant disease and disease meant her weight problem was not entirely her fault but her plunges into weight watchers and overeaters anonymous were utter failures as was the drawer of halfempty pill bottles from various tv infomercials and blaming her condition on bad genetics was like blaming her parents whom she loved and who werent even alive to defend themselves making matters even worse john meacham that sorry excuse for a doctor had blown his top over her failure to lose weight people who once were supportive and sympathetic to her now eyed her with contempt she had actually gotten several notesanonymous of course and simply left in her mailboxblaming her for his death if you could have kept to your diet those people would still have their lives one had actually written she simply could not stand being overweight another day liposuction was clearly the answer roberta had arrived at this decision after extensive research and before the insurance company arrived at theirs by the time her request was denied by them she wanted liposuction more than she wanted air but fighting terrys illness had taken all their savings and the price tag of twelve to twenty thousand dollars was more than she could handle she could sell all her figurines and still cover only a fraction of the cost then what sell all her furniture too take out a third mortgage on the house fortunately there was another way she could quite literally cut out the fat without incurring any of the expense she had found the answer on the internet during her hours of research terry would have been so proud of her resourcefulness he would never have approved of such an expenditure never but free was a different story roberta returned to the kitchen and the checklist she had meticulously put together she then covered a portion of the linoleum floor with a faded bedsheet she was not feeling the least bit nervous the commitment to alter her life in dramatic fashion had replaced any fear and trepidation with euphoric waves of adrenaline after meticulously centering the sheet she crossed over to the granitetopped islandthe home improvement she and terry had scrimped and saved for over five years ago there carefully laid out on a freshly laundered white towel were long and short carving blades from her butcher block holder and a gleaming xacto knife she had bought expressly for this procedure beside them were three of terrys percocets and a glass with three fingers of brandy there was also a bottle of rubbing alcohol a cigarette lighter several ice packs and a pile of gauze pads smiling excitedly she set the pills on her tongue and washed them down with the brandy this is it the knife she selected for starters had a thick and meaty blade it was deeply curved her excited expression reflected off its shiny surface she grabbed the sterilization kit a lighter and some rubbing alcohol im going to be thin she sang testing the sharpness of the huge knife against the pad of her thumb the tremor usually present in her hands actually seemed less than usual still she applied only the slightest pressure and opened a thin sliver that promptly began oozing blood im gonna be the biggest loser the biggest loser is what im gonna be roberta sucked the blood from her thumb liposuction she sang the word in her mind as she admired herself again in the knifes gleaming blade the brandy and percocets were kicking in faster than she had anticipated and she realized she was having trouble controlling her tongue best to hurry she placed a kitchen chair on the bedsheet grabbed a blue rubbermaid bucket and set it at the foot of the chair be prepared for something of a mess one set of internet instructions had warned a few towels and some gauze and she was all set on the towel beside the xacto knife were several threaded needles ready oh i wish terry could see me roberta lamented as she set a bath towel across her lap unbuttoned her blouse and pressed an ice pack against her belly to numb up the skin and constrict the blood vessels getting ready roberta announced though her speech now was quite thick and slurred she sat down on the chair and picked up the knife i can do this she said pressing the knife against her massive belly i can make it all go away the huge blade easily sliced through skin it hurtmore than she expected it to and she cried out at the pain but then just as quickly it went away roberta pressed on her eyes rolled back she cried out again as she forced the blade through half a foot of saffroncolored fat blood began to spray out onto the towel the floor and into the blue bucket im getting thinner already she thought she dug the knife in deeper and began slicing away huge chunks of fatty tissue and dropping them to the floor and into the bucket her hands and arms were slimy with a shimmering mix of blood and grease the terrible hurt accompanying each jab gave way to a dreamy lightheadedness barely looking down at what she was doing roberta widened the incision and continued carving away fistfuls of fat her dizziness intensified the floor around her chair was awash in the slick mix of blood and adipose tissue terry jennings wait until you see me im going to be so beautiful so thin and so beautiful her vision began to blur still she could make out the massive incision and the intestines that had now slid out onto the bloodsoaked towel she felt confusedlost and uncertain what she had done or why the large knife clattered to the floor that was the problem she realized she had forgotten to sterilize the knife oh terry what have i done roberta thought as the darkness enveloped her what have i done to myself moaning she lost her strength and tipped over with her chair then abruptly her moaning stopped chapter darlene instructed victor to pull into a largely deserted area of fairmount parks verdant belmont plateau and asked that he keep as far away from the other parked cars as possible another secret service transport vehicle part of her usual escort group parked on the opposite side of the lot to avoid attracting unwanted attention victor shut off the engine and opened the moonroof ill wait outside he said keep an eye on things check for photographers thank you my friend darlene replied we wont be long it was the second time victor had driven her and lou welcome to a park after peak hours she knew it was the agents job to protect her with his life but she also knew that ultimately his responsibilityeveryones responsibility for that matter was to her husband if he reported to the president on her growing friendship with lou and on their trip together outside of washington the tension that had been developing between her and martin might well explode but she felt a connection with lou and wanted to get to know him better and that was that it said a lot for the status of her marriage that she had given precious little thought to asking martins permission for the trip after all he had made the decision to start his reelection campaign without discussing it with her with victor gone she and lou spent a quiet couple of minutes gazing out the town cars bulletproof front windshield at the twinkling skyline of downtown philadelphia in the distance she sighed deeply are you all right lou asked darlene nodded emphatically but sensed she wasnt convincing good doctors and lou certainly seemed to be one of those often possessed the ability to get more out of a facial expression than they could out of lab tests martin though a lawyer had a knack for reading faces as well lately though his concerns seemed more global than with any individual including her and lisa darlene knew she was enjoying lou too much to try to be an enigma i used to come here with martin whenever we had a campaign stop in philadelphia she said i fell in the love with the view i think the philadelphia skyline is one of the most beautiful anywhere im glad you brought me to see it lou said youre right its spectacular i probably shouldnt have done this she said nonsense weve got an hour to kill before our meeting with humphries thats not what i meant and you know it she thought its silly really she said but ive never come to philadelphia without stopping here martin and i would look out at the skyline and each make a wish so its a tradition it started off as that but its morphed into more of a superstitionlike a chain letter that warns you of a curse unless you continue it if you dont wish upon the philadelphia skyline something bad is going to happen pass it on lou laughed what surprised her was not the warmth of his laugh so much as how much she enjoyed hearing it she could barely believe it but dr darlene mallory caretaker of thousands of children over the years first lady of the united states woman of the year in countless magazines around the globe was feeling giddyschoolgirl giddy well he said i see this as a hell of a lot healthier superstition than coming up here to eat a philly cheesesteak sandwich mmmmm now me want cheesesteak sandwich she said in the imitation of grover from sesame street that her patients loved to hear her use she added lous grin to the things she liked about him and tried to remember the last time she and martin had sat alone together laughing at anything so what did you wish for lou asked i cant tell you that she said with indignation have you not ever studied anything about the art of wishing the farthest ive gone was when i was in my second month of rehab writing four pages of wishing for dummies i must have learned something from it because after the third month i got out from what i have learned a lot of people have benefited because you did she wondered what lou would say if he knew she had wished that martin could have his warmth and connection to people there was something about him a serenity and sense of place that put her instantly at ease if she were injured or ill in an er she decided the best thing that could happen would be lying on a gurney and having him show up at her bedside maybe it was just the way a good doc made people feel whatever the explanation spending time with lou welcome was reminding her of things that she and martin had lost on their nonstop path to the white house i keep promising emily that ill take her to see the liberty bell one of these days lou said darlene smiled grateful to be distracted from her thoughts your daughters never been no he admitted folding his lower lip down shes also got her heart set on running up the steps of the philadelphia museum of art and doing the rocky dance thirteen is such a great age darlene said wistfully she had been warned by friends early on that after lisa hit first grade the years would fly by instead of crawl now her baby was a busy college sophomore moving ahead with her own life and all darlene had of those early years were photographs and memories the divorce has made me miss time with em lou said thats the hardest thing in my life you said the divorce wasnt your idea i would imagine theres some guilt roiling around that her mothers a really good egg who just ran out of gas after a couple of selfdestructive years on my part shes married to a decentenough guy now and is as happy for my recovery as i am whatever guilt i still feel toward em i make up for by allowing her to drink diet coke when were together the beverage industry loves my husband but they sure dont like what i have to say about their products is it hard for you lou asked the spotlight the constant scrutiny darlene tried to shrug off the question its gets tiring she confessed ill bet we cant be normal for starters most couples can have a slight argument without making the front page of the tabloids we cant risk a cross word or look outside of our bedroom when we began this journey martin made me a promise he said the responsibilities of the country wouldnt eclipse his responsibilities as a father and husband i never questioned his resolve but now ive realized my own naivety in what way darlene found herself liking the way lou was looking at hersteady but relaxed eye contact with no hidden agenda or preoccupying thoughts she tried reminding herself that he had the advantage of not having to compartmentalize his life the way martin did but in the end she felt unwilling to fight her attraction to the man before martin took the oath of office she said i read everything i could about being a first lady theres no provision in the constitution for the presidents wife no formal job description either you were a doctor it must have been hard for you to go from having a very clear set of guidelines to none at all maybe you could start doing some version of medical practice believe it or not i never even considered that well like you said theres no job description for what you do a pleasant silence followed which became prolonged enough to begin to feel edgy well its time she said clearing her throat and checking her movadoa wedding present from martin how about we go visit dr humphries and see what he has to offer to untangle this conundrum great idea lou paused a beat can you make another wish on the philadelphia skyline he asked eyes fixed ahead sure darlene said nothing in the rules of wishing says i cant then how about just wishing that everything becomes clear on every level chapter lou had imagined dr oliver humphries would be a smallframed skittish fellow with oversized glassessomething akin to some of the arthropod phylum he studied to his great surprise humphries looked nothing like a bug but rather possessed an uncanny resemblance to the rock star sting the entomologists twotoned hairdo was cut short on top with dyedblond spikes held straight by a vigorous application of gel one of humphriess ears was pierced a silver dragonfly dangling from a small chain and a silver stud could be seen depressed into the side of his left nostril even more distinctive were his muscular arms which featured an array of brilliantly drawn tattoos incorporating insects of all typesflying crawling stinging and praying they were in humphriess modest office on the second floor of the biolife building photographs of the scientist on expedition to every conceivable climate adorned the walls along with half a dozen framed degrees and testimonials including a doctorate from uc davis well humphries said i guess your friends from the secret service found me no threat actually they were quite interested in you and wanted to stay and hear what you had to say darlene replied humphries pushed aside a stack of papers and several magnifying lenses and slid a spiralbound notebook in front of him lous immediate sense of the man was completely positive so then lets talk termites humphries said as he studied what lou assumed to be notes taken from their phone conversation were you able to find any documented examples of flesheating termites since we spoke last lou began humphries drummed his fingers on the desk and pursed his lips despite the gold band on the professors wedding finger lou imagined his offbeat good looks acting like pheromones on the coeds in his classes to be honest dr welcome lou please and darlene im a pediatrician so i should be able to understand anything the er doc over here understands to be honest dr lou and dr darlene humphries said i didnt look very hard because you found one she asked because they dont exist at least not naturally could they have been another sort of flesheating insect lou asked an unusual species of the dermestid beetle perhaps humphriess eyes brightened i admire anyone who comes to my office prepared the skin beetle is a good guess but unfortunately all known species are scavengers by that you mean they dont live off live flesh darlene interjected thats correct the dermestid beetle is often used in taxidermy and some natural history museums to clean animal skeletons theres also a medicolegal aspect to the beasties handiwork helping forensic investigators determine time of death but ive never come across any accounts of this particular beetle consuming live flesh besides they dont fit the description of the insects you saw lou the adult beetles have ovalshaped bodies concealed beneath hard scales what about mutation lou asked humphries pondered the question darlene caught lous sidelong glance and nodded her excitement a mutation that transforms a detritivore into an omnivore his voice trailed away in thought detritivore asked darlene like detritus precisely your latin hasnt deserted you doctor organisms that obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter garbage eaters it appears that everything i read about your intelligence is accurate why thanks oliver she replied with her ice creammelting smile im afraid im much more used to reading about my waistline or makeup or wardrobe than my intellect humphries took a moment to compose himself and continued in any event i cant fathom an environmental factor that would cause such a mutation ive studied entomology for most of my life and have been to every continent except antarctica studying bugstermites especially ive discovered at least two new species but never encountered anything close to what youve described its one of the reasons i was so eager to meet with you if such an insect were naturally occurring well it would certainly generate a lot of buzz in the industry the entomologist chuckled nicely done darlene said picking up on the play on words before lou but you just said naturally occurring what about a nonnatural environmental shift of some sort something manmade yes lou said perking up at the thought a manmade airborne contagion of sorts humphries slipped back into his contemplative mode theres certainly evidence of insect behavioral shifts as a result of lets say light pollution or thermal factors or air pollution or various forms of radiation have you followed whats been happening to the honeybee population i have darlene said while lou was shaking his head colony collapse disorder right on maam the explanation for ccd is still widely disputed the number of western honeybee colonies have been declining quite impressively for a couple of decades but more rapidly over recent years some of my colleagues are blaming biotic factors such as viruses or mites but others purport that environmental shiftscell phone radiation pesticides even genetically modified crops are to blame lous face lit up so its possible that gmo crops caused the bees colony collapse evidence for that is slim and certainly not proven as far as i know its still a controversial subject at best could the pollen from gmo crops be a contributing factor darlene asked humphries shook his heada firm warning not to jump to any conclusions its almost impossible to say if that were the case with your termites id expect there would have been a corresponding mass kill event or perhaps a dramatic reduction in the termite population a fullon mutation would be something quite startling but assuming what i observed is fact how would you explain it lou asked he felt like he was feeling his way down an endless pitchblack corridor i couldnt humphries replied thats my point not by nature anyway or by mutation darlene added or by mutation so what now she asked unable to mask her disappointment id say the best thing for us to do now is have a look at those bugs humphries was saying apparently unaware of the subtext going on between his visitors dr lou you promised to bring me some samples lou nodded and he hoisted his briefcase from the carpeted floor darlenes eyes widened you had those flesheating bugs with you this entire time lou grinned sheepishly i didnt want you to get creeped out before the expert was around to assure you that these guys cant eat through glass lou handed humphries two large covered baby food jars in one of them the bottom was nearly coated with termites the other contained a single gigantic bug pumpkin in color with a segmented body long scimitarshaped pincers and pure white disks where its eyes might have been joey the collector i spoke to you about assured me that the huge puffedup one is a queen darlene shivered and hunched her shoulders perhaps again imagining the bugs were crawling up her arms she glared at lou but could not hold the reproving look very long no secrets next time she said her eyes glinting no secrets pal lou replied next time im carrying carnivorous termites youll be the first to know oh shes the queen all right humphries was saying the queen of queens my lab is next door lets go there and have ourselves a closer inspection humphries took great care to maximize the limited space in his windowless lab a coriancovered counter extending out from the far wall provided enough surface area for three distinct workstations there were microscopes centrifuges and other lab equipment resting on a table glassfronted cabinets contained shelving stocked with glass beakers jars flasks and coils of plastic tubing dozens of scientific tomes were neatly arranged in a bookcase on one wall at least three of them lou noted were written or coauthored by humphries himself on the opposite wall stood several specimen cabinets holding containers with various insects inside them some living and some not again darlene caught lous eye and shivered humphries crossed to the cabinets where he retrieved a jar containing a small battalion of fairly large live ants after slipping on a pair of latex gloves he transferred the termites lou had brought to a large flask and closed the opening with a rubber stopper next he skillfully used a large dropper to remove half a dozen ants and deposited them into the flask there was an instant rush of activity as the termites amber bodies swarmed the ants which were nearly the size they were the attack was as ferocious as the one on the mouse in joeys bizarre terrarium within seconds there were no remnants of the ants whatsoever it took lou most of a minute to realize hed been holding his breath he let the air out slowly a glance at darlene told him she had been doing the same thing using a large magnifying glass humphries silently studied the termites with a childs wideeyed enthusiasm just what i thought from the pictures you texted to me humphries said macrotermes bellicosus thats their name darlene asked its almost as scary as they are macro means large and bellicosus means warlike lou and darlene said in unison you got it m bellicosus is an african breed but these were found in virginia thats right lou said in a town named kings ridge well obviously somebody imported them illegally i suspect or i guess accidentally macrotermes are buildersarchitectural masters humphries put a stopper on the flask and set it back down on the table the african sun is a brutal force which the bellicosus termite has managed to tame their mounds are the largest nonmanmade structures in the world they build thermoregulated chambers inside them that maintain a temperature of precisely eightyeight to eightynine degrees with ventilation ducts that continuously refresh their air supply the temperature is critical because their primary food source a fungus wont grow in any other temperature i spent six months in africa studying these critters marvels really absolute marvels ever see them eat a lion lou asked because the swarm i witnessed could probably do just that no humphries said dismissively their primary food source is that fungus or else they chew up wood and digest whatever nutrients they can so how do you explain what you just saw thats just it humphries exclaimed with youthful exuberance i cant lou and darlene exchanged excited looks so whats next lou asked im going to dissect her majesty if you dont mind i need to look at the queen within minutes humphries had the queen termite under a microscope his fingers moved with remarkable delicacy and economy of motion on occasion he would pause to wipe sweat from his brow a move that made the tattooed insects on his arm appear to come alive lou and darlene huddled close by and watched in silence this is odd humphries said mostly to himself what whats odd lou asked he and darlene had moved in closer their arms were touching but neither attempted to pull away humphries looked up from his microscope his expression bewildered this queen is about twice as large as the average m bellicosus queen this one here is more than ten centimeters her egglaying capacity seems to have been doubled as well maybe tripled what does that mean darlene asked it means that if these insects exist in the natural world they would probably have more egglaying capacity than any creature on the planet the fecundity of these termites suggests they could cause a very serious environmental imbalance so do you think its a mutation lou asked no i dont humphries stated if this were a naturally occurring mutation at some point i or one of my colleagues would have seen these insects in the wild their breeding would be massive and impossible to contain were talking a major shift to mother natures already tenuous balance i think these insects were engineered in a controlled environment engineered how darlene asked my guess is radiation humphries said id have to run some tests on the samples you brought but my bet is ill find high levels of ionizing radiation that produced an abundance of free radicals within the termites cell structures you think somebody mutated these termites to increase their size and egglaying capacity humphries nodded i do and i further suspect that the radiation and hybridized breeding resulted in the mutation that altered the termites natural diet i think thats how these herbivores became flesheaters why would anybody want to breed a termite that produces more eggs lou wondered aloud he looked over at darlene and saw that she had turned pale lou she said the corn you told me it was bigger than a normal ear and had a lot more kernels on it too she pointed to the jar of termites what if thats how theyre growing corn like that lou understood immediately oliver he said could the dna from this termite be inserted into the nucleus of a corn seed of course humphries said the dna transfection process would allow crossbreeding with any number of species what would you call corn that was crossbred to include the dna of a mutated termite the entomologist laughed at the notion i dont know what id call it he answered but i know what it isnt whats that darlene asked it isnt corn he said chapter while waiting for joey to emerge from the staff entrance to millies lou checked over the large piece of equipment oliver humphries had lent him the groundpenetrating radar system looked like a joggers stroller minus the canvas seat where the infant would go it had a twentyinch front wheel and two twentyfourinch rear wheels making the contraption reasonably easy to transport the megahertz antenna was encased inside a bread boxsized container and secured to the underside of the carriage the antenna was capable of broadcasting subsurface images to an eightinch display screen mounted between the handlebars perfect for locating termite tunnels humphries felt confident that a single termite tower did not preclude the possibility of there being others nearby in fact the tattooed entomologist thought it strange that only a single tower existed in a given area if these termites had escaped from a lab where theyd been radiated as humphries believed to be the case then there should be a ventilation shaft connecting the isolated mound to the rest of the colony the macrotermes bellicosus species were strange almost mystical creatures their huge towers humphries had explained did not provide habitation for the colony instead scientists believed the elaborate tolkeinesque structures were built for the thermoregulation vital for growing the fungus essential to their diet the groundpenetrating radar might not provide answers to any perplexing questions but it would help to find other mounds by detecting the subsurface ventilation shafts joining one colony to another lou was leaning against the machine rereading the manual when joey slammed open the screen door and blinking against the glare bounded into the bright early afternoon sun he looked dressed for a safaritan khaki shorts kneehigh socks and a widebrimmed sun hat lou was pleased to see that he had been taking good care of his surgically repaired hand hey big guy lou said that wound dressing looks great joeys freckled face crinkled in a broad grin millie and tommy the head chef drove me back yesterday to have the thumb checked again it looks really scary all black and blue and greenish but dr kurdi says its doing terrific and that its going to work as good as my other one so whats that thing its a device to help me locate other termite mounds lou said pausing before adding if there are any others well i hope you pumped up the tires real good because its a few miles walk from here to the moundmaybe four lou sighed pulled off his nationals cap to wipe sweat from his brow and looked out at the shimmering heat rising up off the road four miles eh cant we just drive there i only know how to get there by walking joey said do we need a map wouldnt know where to look on it the directions are all up here he tapped his forehead with his good hand one of the things i really enjoy doing is exploring the cornfields and you think you can find the mound by walking lou grunted as he pushed the cart hard enough to build up some momentum joey marched ahead as they passed the dorm and then left the vinylsided apartments behind i spent two years walking every bit of the cornfields joey said loud enough not to have to turn his head acres and acres and acres thats how i found my special termites i know these fields like the back of my hand he held up his heavily bandaged arm and laughed lou imagined how difficult it was going to be pushing the contraption through the deeply furrowed fields so much for aas golden admonition not to project he recalled joeys obsession with knot tying and millies acknowledgment that he got fixated on certain things as lou trudged along grateful for all the hours he spent training in the ring and on the bags he hoped joeys navigation obsession also included the shortest and easiest route to get to where they wanted to be fortyfive minutes later lous sweatdrenched tshirt was plastered to his chest like a second skin of all the cornfields joey took him through this one was proving especially difficult to negotiate loose soil and tall stocks from chester enterprises genetically modified corn crop made for extremely slow going joey offered to help push but there was no way lou would risk anything happening to the thumb he had helped to save if there was a positive aspect to the difficult and dusty passage it was that his attention was largely fixated on moving ahead still thoughts of darlene were never far from the surface between reestablishing himself in the er demonstrating his work ethic at physician wellness spending time with emily getting to meetings and working out with cap he had precious little opportunity to meet women aa was famous among its members for having a saying to fit every situation or occasion the one he liked to fall back on when it came to having a social life was time is natures way of keeping everything from happening at once unfortunately there was no saying that applied to what was happening between him and the presidents wife as much as darlene dared she had decided to confront her husband when he returned from his campaign trip later in the day regarding double m russell evans william chester the bellicosus termites and the elusive trainload of corn her goal was to set up a meeting between the president and lou to review the bizarre and sometimes deadly pattern of behavior that lou had observed among the citizens of kings ridge lou felt embarrassed about his near obsession with the woman but decided that so long as he could keep his fantasies and projections from getting the best of him he could only do what he could do another useful saying eventually he and joey emerged onto a narrow dirt road lou paused and scanned the track and the surrounding fields i know this place he said well the mound i found is in the woods off the end of this road not far now this is near where i was attacked attacked never mind lou said quickly he remained on high alert the rest of the way if chesters corn was the source of all the troubles in kings ridge it was likely that the moguls henchmen would be stationed someplace close by the afternoon was virtually windless and he kept a cautious lookout for any movement of the stalks while at the same time scanning the dense rows in a futile attempt to spot anthony brites body at the end of the dirt road joey veered into the woods to their left and lou followed several paces behind the carts bicyclelike tires were designed to traverse difficult terrain making it fairly easy for him to maneuver over the grounds exposed roots and rocks the two of them bushwhacked their way another quarter mile or so although joey seemed confident lou now grimy and soaked in sweat was beginning to have doubts gratefully his ankle was not aching badly bingo the young chef cried out from some distance ahead lou took a moment to settle down the burning in his chest then headed toward joeys voice the packedmud bellicosus castle rose from the forest floor like a rocket on its launching pad there were hundreds of large termites scattered along its length and dozens more of them flying around like an air force fighter squadron whoa he whispered marveling at the staggering height and geometry of the thing its awesome dont i know it joey said awesome is the word the jagged conical tower two or three feet taller than lou was peppered with impressively large termites it looked like a decaying tree trunk sculpted with spires and crevices from about two feet away lou cautiously circumvented the spectacular construction amazing was all he could say absolutely amazing well ive got to go joey said with singsong nonchalance go what are you talking about where are you going concern crept into lous voice why back to work of course joey said i did tell you i had to work a double didnt i actually no you didnt lou replied laughing nervously joey what if i cant find my way out of here oh the trail behind us is pretty well marked now you can follow the dirt road back there and skip the cornfields entirely itll only add two or three miles to your return trip two or three miles joey i dont even know where this gizmo is going to take me let alone how to get back from there the notion of being back in these fields in the dark of night was not the least bit appealing one look at joey and lous distress quickly began to ebb the kid had done his best lou had read two historical accounts of the louis and clark expedition if they could accomplish their remarkable uncharted journey he could find his way back to the restaurant still somewhat apprehensive he thanked his young guide if you find a queen let me know joey said even though they can make a new one the colony is struggling without a leader they need a purpose will do lou said holding up one of the specimen jars he had brought and thanks for sacrificing your lady to the greater good i was just kidding doc dont try to find one shed be deep within the colony before you got to her youd be hamburger joey tipped his hat waved goodbye with his heavily bandaged hand and was gone lou listened until joeys footfalls had disappeared into the dense woods finally when the only sound in the still afternoon was the continuous scraping and scratching from the bellicosus termites he powered up the radar machine despite the bug repellent he had swathed on himself he wondered at what distance the insects would sense the presence of live flesh and organize themselves for an attack the ground radar system whirred softly as it came to life the carts handlebars vibrated causing lous forearms to tingle the display screen went from deep gray to varying lighter shades the background colors were of no interest to him they represented natural soils not the organized hyperbolic reflections of air tunnels within the ground which were black lou maneuvered the radar closer to the tower fearing that the ground beneath him might cave in the first subsurface ventilation shaft came into clear focus a foot from the conical structure the markings on the radars display screen looked like flickering serpentine shapesblack projected onto a gray background as lou moved the antenna away from the ventilation shaft the change in reception altered the subsurface reflection causing the curved shape to disappear from the screen by trial and error he learned that so long as he had the black patterns on his radar display he was standing over one of the ventilation shafts using a pad and pencil lou mapped a number of the largest shafts keeping a careful log of the orientation and length of each on graph paper humphries had provided each of the tunnels led to a small hole in the surface topography along with a baseballsized depression in the soil that contributed ventilation to the remarkably constructed tower sweaty and aching lou mapped the entire area until one quadrant which he had labeled sesoutheastcaught his attention it contained a thicker curved black shadow than the othersa dark snake that went to the edge of the screen and did not seem to have an end lou wheeled his apparatus ahead and followed the winding shape on his display as it led him away from the huge structure and deeper into the forest one hundred yards two hundred three the shaft was still beneath his feet running parallel to the surface about two feet deep eventually lou emerged into a broad clearing about the size of a football field with a singlestory windowless brick structure at the far west end there was a narrow unpaved access road just opposite from where he stood which opened into a small dirt parking area there was a single empty car standing in the lota large black mercedes fourdoor with virginia plates the ventilation shaft remained at the center of the screen although the depth seemed to have increasedperhaps three feet now maybe even a bit more lou followed the shadow until it came to an abrupt end at the southfacing side of the building at that point the depth of the serpentine ventilation tunnel increased sharply and moments later the radar display screen turned totally gray lou checked his machine which seemed to be functioning all right the shaft appeared to have disappeared into something much largera subterranean chamber of some sort lou sensed there might be something underneath him he flipped through the instruction manual but it was quite technical and there was no explanation for something like the phenomenon he was observing the one thing he felt fairly certain of was that the fearsome bellicosus termites in the forest and subsequently in joeys lucite terrarium were originating here scanning the surroundings for cameras he walked the radar around the building there was a slight crack in the foundation and he wondered if farther down the bugs had escaped that way there was a green metal door by the east corner lou carefully tried to open it but it was locked he backed away and wheeled the radar machine into the woods given his experience with the gunmen the deserted mercedes was unnerving still lou felt desperate to get inside the blockhouselike building a possible solution he decided was among the contacts in his cell phonechief gilbert stone three rings and stone answered stone here chief stone its lou welcome welcome everything okay what can i do for you do you know anything about a windowless brick building in a clearing not too far from where we got attacked allegedly got attacked stone corrected sounds like the old power and water transfer station why whats up im in the woods outside of it right now do you think you could get over here i may have found the source of the kings ridge problem you stay put welcome and keep out of sight stone said ill be right there the doors locked no problem stone replied i have a key soon lou thought excitedly soon its going to be over starting to chill from the evaporation of his own sweat he slid down to the base of a white ash clasped his arms around his knees and waited soon chapter the crunch of gilbert stones cruiser on gravel startled lou from an exhausted dreamless sleep he wiped salt and perspiration from his eyes rose blearily to his feet and reentered the clearing wheeling the ground radar system ahead of him stone parked near the mercedes emerged from the cruiser hoisted his heavy utility belt above his ample belly and then settled a campaign hat over his mop of graying hair lou met him at the blockhouse outside the green door anybody else coming lou asked glancing down the road ive got two teams on standby stone answered tell me everything whats that contraption youve got there its portable radar i think the corn chester is growing is poisonous poisonous i know it may be hard for you to believe but i think william chester is producing vast amounts of corn genetically modified to grow larger and faster by combining it with the genes of a large african termite called macrotermes bellicosusperhaps the most reproductively proficient animal on the planet and you think this corn is somehow poisoning the citizens of my town i do stone made the same highpitch whistle that lou remembered from the first night they met so what on earth brought you way out here stone asked gesturing to the woods surrounding them you remember joey the cook at millies who nearly got his thumb sliced off of course well a couple of years ago joey found these huge mutated termites in the woods and made them his pets mutated termites lou repeated how are they mutated well first of all theyre bigger than other termites of the species and secondly they eat flesh in addition to their usual diet holy gravy stone said making that whistle again so what do these bugs have to do with corn well initially i thought it was airborne contagioninhaling pollen from chesters modified cornthat caused the odd behaviors taking place around town i went to see a bug expert in philadelphia to see if that was even possible turns out that the termites joey found are an african species clearly imported here by someone this piece of equipment lou tapped the carts handlebars can be used to track their underground ventilation shafts and you tracked one of these shafts all the way to this building thats right lou said proudly the bugs must have flown out and started another colony or else they escaped through a crack in the foundation the expert and i arent sure but we dont think its an airborne contagion anymore we think the termites are being intentionally mutatedradiated most likelyand then their dna is being combined with the corn to get this huge rapidly growing genetically modified monster vegetable frankencorn ive been calling it stone looked at lou queerly but if its not airborne hows it making the people sick he asked i dont know well weve got to find out i got some more troublin news to share with you more proof i guess that something really wrong is happening here in kings ridge stone pulled a kerchief from his pocket and used it to mop his brow roberta jennings accidentally killed herself yesterday what poor dear took some painkillers and alcohol then sliced open her belly with a kitchen knife apparently she was trying to lose some weight the quick way the me says she cut a couple of arteries and bled to death oh god lou muttered he swallowed hard roberta jennings had completed the pathetic circle john meacham had begun another terrible decision another violent death lou considered disclosing then and there what he knew of darlene mallory double m and a huge shipment of corn maybe chesters corn headed someplace by train but he needed to clear things with her first can we get inside he asked pointing to the green door do we need a warrant or anything im fairly certain that the source of whatever is going on here is behind that door stones eyes flashed of course we can get in im the damn chief of police do you know what this building is used for stone nodded dully then said sure i do heck i authorized it lou looked up at the man bewildered well what is it he asked it doesnt look like much stone snorted a mirthless laugh and pointed down thats because its all belowground he said what is william chesters research laboratory stone said a note of impatience creeping into his voice we excavated it years ago he already owned the land and wanted a place where he could conduct research without attracting much attention hardly anybody even knows about this access road stone pointed to the dirt road behind them the seed business is very competitive you see chester was worried about trade secrets being stolenindustrial espionage and such we gave him the permits to build an underground lab because well chester seed company is what makes kings ridge a viable community so do you know what they do down there not really the security system feeds to a room in the basement of the chester mansionthe place you and your friends visited as far as i know these people have been complying with all our permits and regulations we never gave them permission to radiate bugs though and turn em into mutants if thats what youre wondering do you know whose car that is actually i think its one of bill chesters hes here lou said maybe he can finally provide some answers how do we get in well we can pound all night on this door or we can use this looking somewhat puffed stone held up a key like i said im the chief of police with a turn of stones key the green metal door swung open on welloiled hinges brushed steel wall scones illuminated the cinder block entrance and a staircase with a metal handrail stone removed his gun from its holster and started down with lou following should we send for backup lou asked stone turned for the first time his expression had darkened i saw what roberta did to herself he said if the cause of what happened to her is down these stairs i intend to uncover it here and now lou nodded as stone cautiously resumed his descent they came to another locked steel door at the bottom of the stairwell a keypad secured access to whatever was behind it without hesitating stone punched in a short series of numbers then after a soft click the red led light on the pad turned green and the lock responded what now lou asked somewhat surprised by stones familiarity with the place now we go in the cop said simply remembering chesters thugs lou glanced up the stairwell behind them wishing at least that reinforcements were on the way at the same time he wondered again about precisely how tight stone was with the mogul at the center of kings ridges prosperity the cop pulled open the door without first peering inside either he had no reason to believe any threat existed or in his zeal to get to the bottom of robertas death and the rest of the troubles in his town he had become reckless or maybe lou found himself wondering its the corn at work he fell into step behind stone and followed him down a short corridor that deadended at another windowless metal door with another keypad better stay back stone said not sure what were going to find behind this door at least hes finally being cautious lou thought again stone keyed a number sequence and again the access panels red light gave way to green i hope youre right about forging ahead like this gilbert lou said ive had just about enough strange things happening in my town pistol at the ready stone went in with lou following the space ahead of them was brightly lit just inside the threshold lou stopped abruptly his mouth agape at what he was seeing a series of conveyor belts snaked throughout a large area corn seed lit by banks of powerful overhead lights covered every inch of the conveyor belts in a golden river that seemed to have no beginning or end suspended above the conveyor belt was a thick metal tube four feet long with gauges control knobs along the side and smaller tubes running down its length it appeared to be a ray gun of sorts with a short sixinch muzzle half the diameter of the main tube the rest of the space reminded lou of oliver humphriess lab on steroidsstainless steel tables centrifuges multiple microscopes glass cabinets stocked with flasks beakers plastic tubing pipettes and other scientific materials lou composed himself and quickly covered the gap between him and stone my radar machine picked up some sort of expanse down here he said i suppose this is it do you have any idea whats going on instead of responding stone surveyed the crowded underground laboratory training his gun wherever he looked with a nod he motioned lou down a central corridor toward another door it was stainless steel like the others but this one had no keypad lou moved up beside the cop i think youll want to see whats behind this stone said arent we being a bit cavalier not sending for backup lou asked stone did not reply still training his gun ahead of him he opened the door it seemed to lou as if the man knew precisely what he would find and was not at all concerned from where lou stood the space ahead was dark stone disappeared through doorway reached to his left and flipped on highpowered fluorescent lights moments later he motioned with his gun for lou to follow lou hesitated feeling increasingly uneasy oh well he thought in for a penny one step through the door and he froze the space warm and humid was at least the same size as the laboratory echoing off the stainless steel walls was the machinerylike humming of insectsmany many insects he stepped forward onto a grated steel walkway with heavy metal pipe railings and three or fourfoot chainlink sidewalls that crossed a pit at least twenty feet deep the whole space just below the walkway was covered with a dense metal screen with the overheads reflecting off the fine mesh it was difficult to see what was in the pit but lou had no doubt stone reached over to the wall next to him and depressed a large red plastic button smoothly gears engaged and the vast screen slid back on tracks and rolled up on a reel at the far end revealed below was a terrible surreal landscape the sides of the massive pit were lined with brushed stainless steel gleaming beneath the overheads the surface of the space looked like an alien moonscape formed by at least a hundred termite mounds of various heights and sizes some of which reached upward to within ten or fifteen feet of the walkway the chilling diorama was swarming with macrotermes bellicosi like the mound in the forest more insects were humming about through the airsome actually flying above the steel catwalk for a time lou remained transfixed on the bugs below as they moved with blind purpose in and out of the mounds this was their citytheir home the clicking of thousands of feet and jaws made his fillings ache the walkways were three feet wide crossing at right angles to one another over the precise center of the pit thick metal rods descending from the ceiling held the walks firmly suspended in place there was a door ending the walk to their left and a third door painted red directly across from them that door featured a large decal with the yellow symbol for a biohazard even from where he stood he could read the words below the symbol caution radiation area lou batted at a huge termite that buzzed past his face behind that door is where they must be mutating the termites lou said as much to himself as to stone and the conveyor belt in the lab we just passed through is where they fire the termite reproductive genes into the corn seeds he had been so astonished by what he was seeing that it took some time for him to register that the police chief was not stone nudged the toe of his boot against a sturdy metal pole resting by his foot the pole had what looked like several extension segments and the head of it had a rotating claw for grabbing and gripping lou wondered if it was used for feeding im guessing these are your bugs stone said too nonchalantly lou looked over at the heavy service revolver and felt himself shudder no ladders theres a reason people dont want to go down into that pit the termites must not be able to scale that surface stone appeared somewhat troubled and you think the bugs little joey adopted slipped out of a crack somewhere in the foundation here i do or else enough of them flew out and escaped this place to start a colony lets see if we can find where that leak might have happened that infernal clicking and grinding can really get to you cant hardly hear your own footsteps sometimes its like theyre constantly eating but eating what stone stepped out onto the catwalk until he was standing above one of the larger mounds now with his senses electrified lou followed stones haphazard approach to investigating the lab and observing the termite metropolis continued to gnaw at him even without firsthand knowledge of police departmental procedure lou assumed that stone had violated many safety measures in this investigation if hes so familiar with this place lou wondered why did he even let me come down here if anything happens to me it would be stones responsibility lou glanced down into the pit again something between two mounds directly beneath him caught his eyea glint of gold he strained to get a better look then his body tensed and he broke into a chilling sweat the golden object was a necklace with a handcuff pendant attachednotso brites necklace it was at that moment lou knew exactly why the chief had let him tag along chapter lou had no doubt that any moment he was going to die and most likely die horribly another thing he had no doubt about was that he was not going to go down without a hell of a fight he took a single step back to size up his situation and the potbellied lawman who he was certain was about to kill him the first thing he warned himself of was that under no circumstance was he going to underestimate the man despite his bulk stone carried himself with the balance grace and confidence of a fighterprobably a brawler at the moment though he appeared totally at ease almost blissful holding his pistol loosely in front of him he looked like anything other than a man who was preparing to kill lou wondered if stone was aware that his target had figured out what was coming more than likely he decided desperately lou searched for a move any move that would shorten the odds against him his advantage was his quickness his skill as a boxer and the surprise if he managed to make his play before stone made his trying to run would result only in a bullet between the shoulder blades lou did not know when stone intended to strike only that it would happen and happen soon the pit made for the perfect human disposal receptacle if the man was trained in martial arts he might try to gain leverage to flip lou over the rail the bugs would devour his clothes while they were mulching his flesh his bones would be last more likely stone would neutralize him first with a single shot possibly to a nonvital spot from where the policeman was cradling his gun lou would have a second or so before he could raise it and fire cap would have shown him the move he should go topossibly a jabuppercut combination he would have more confidence if he could connect with a weapon of some sort then he realized that he had one in his pants pocketthe pencil he had been using to graph the termites ventilation shafts stone was gesturing below them and commenting on the setup easy lou warned himself as he turned away an inch or so and slid his hand into his pocket the pencil was there complete with point perfect lou gestured into the pit look he said look there stone kept a wary distance and peered below i dont see anything the termites clicking seemed to have gotten louder as if they sensed a meal was on the way with thoughts of emily and their last too brief conversation lou slipped the pencil out of his pocket then held it under his wrist and concealed it against the top of the catwalk railing leaning forward hoping stone would react to his vulnerability he gestured down at the golden necklace lous grip on the handrail was tight his feet were well spaced and his knees wedged up against the sidewall make your move stone make your move make your move sweat slickened lous grip he wanted to wipe his hands dry to strengthen his hold but feared letting go of the handrail for even a moment below him he watched the bugs scamper about he imagined their jaws sinking into his fleshdigesting him one small piece at a time come on one second two three maybe im wrong about the man lou found himself thinking the loss of concentration was only momentary but it was enough stone grabbed lou by the back of the shirt and slammed the muzzle across the back of his head lou was still prepared enough to twist away reducing the force of the blow still his vision blurred and his knees buckled he would have gone down had he not been wedged against the sidewall you should have stayed out of kings ridge stone said raising his gun for another blow lou released his grip on the railing ducked as if he were avoiding a vicious right hook and brought the pencil up behind his shoulder still bleary he approximated where stones neck would be and stabbed at it with a broad sweeping motion the pencil sank into the muscle beside the mans throat lou hoped to tear into the jugular vein but sensed right away that hadnt happened stone cried out and stumbled backwards raising his gun lou parried the pistol with his left forearm and rammed his fist into stones abdomen with as much force as he had ever hit a man stone splayed backwards crashing into the railing and teetering perilously over the edge for a moment before righting himself the pencil stuck out from his neck like a bloodied yellow dart bellowing like an enraged bull stone hunched over and drove his head into the center of lous chest intense pain exploded from the spot and lous initial fear was that the bone had shattered his vision dimmed then went dark moments later when he regained his senses he was kneeling on the catwalk stone was looming above him clawing at the pencil as the pencil came free followed by a jet of blood lou dived for the mans ankles got ahold of the right one and twisted it sharply stone fell backwards landing with a force that shook the entire catwalk lou straddled him grabbed his head on each side and slammed it onto the catwalkonce then again and again stone grunted with each blow and finally went limp lou gasping for breath and feeling as if his sternum might have been broken slumped over onto the catwalk then painfully pulled himself to his feet at that moment from beyond stones prostrate motionless body lou saw the radiation room door swing open a man dressed in a bright yellow biocontainment suit emerged from the shadows of the room beyond groaning with each breath lou steeled himself to turn and run but the suited man held up a hand in a nonthreatening gesture then he lifted the hood away from his face jesus lou whispered he stepped over the fallen police chief and met edwin chester halfway past the convergence of the catwalks below them the clicking had grown more intense i was involved in an experiment and didnt hear anything that was going on edwin said for as long as i can remember gilbert stone has been owned by my father he can be one of the most heartless frightening men i have ever met he brought me down here to kill me lou said i dont think youd be the first he does a lot of my fathers dirty work edwin this whole business has gotten out of hand i didnt want any of this to happen i told my father the corn wasnt ready but he just wouldnt listen i thought you were his protector i am but that doesnt keep me from trying to cancel out some of the things he does thats why i contacted darlene mallory in the first place you youre double m edwin grinned you expected someone a little taller and heavier i have boots with six and seveninch lifts and specially padded jackets in my world trust can be a very expensive commodity i tend to stand out because of my lack of height so when i need to i just do something about it but why the charade why didnt you just come forward and tell what you knew had happened you dont know my father edwin said hes really a very wonderful manby far the most important person in my his eyes widened lou behind you lou whirled stone had unsteadily pushed himself to his knees and eyes glazed was fumbling for his gun which had been on the catwalk underneath him there were no choices available this timeno strategies the distance between him and stone was ten yards ignoring the pain in his chest and keeping as low as he could manage lou charged stone rattled off two wild shots that clanged off the steel walls the third one fired from no more than six feet away tore through the outside edge of lous left thigh lou cried out as he dropped to one knee but his momentum carried him flailing into stone who was bowled over backwards the pistol went clattering across the catwalk and slid under the railing lou pounded the cop in the face again and again blood gushing from stones nostrils flowed into blood streaming from the hole in his neck still the man was able to shove lou off and make it to his feet pulling lou up by the shirt and squeezing the air and life out of him with the strength of a python quickly lous strength began to fail stone swung his hips to the right lifting lous feet off the catwalk and slamming him against the railing lou now nearly helpless tried and failed to drop down to avoid being thrown over the edge the pressure of stones thick arms was unbearable his face teeth gritted was a bloody mask lou pushed against stones chest with all his strength but failed to put any distance between them he was now aware of a burning pain from the muscle where the bullet had torn through at that instant lous knees went slack and he experienced the horrific sensation of his feet leaving the catwalk before he could make another move he was over the top of the railing frantically he forced his fingers through the steel chain link of the catwalk wall and gripped it as tightly as he could every breath was an agonizing effort his feet dangled down precariously close to the hordes of termites milling below him his palms stretched until they burned his arms quivered from exertion and utter fatigue grateful for the hours of training under caps tutelage lou managed to stretch up with his right foot and slip it over a support beam beneath the walk at that instant stone appeared above him his face a hideous mask of gore blood dripping down into the pit below lou sent the colony clicking and scurrying about grinning ferociously stone tapped the toe of his heavy boot against lous fingers sending electric pain shooting down his arm fast or slow stone asked your choice he emphasized his question with another light tap though he tried lou failed to keep himself from crying out his left hand fumbled to improve his grip on the metal the tightness in his palm intensified emmy im so sorry baby so sorry lou tried to will himself to hold on but felt his grip starting to release perspiration was stinging his eyes his left hand was about to let go when he heard a scream from above followed by the sound of running footsteps that shook the catwalk no edwin shouted as he charged the police chief buoyed by the attack lou managed to tighten his grip he craned his neck and looked upward just in time to see edwin swing the metal extension pipe connecting heavily with stones temple a second blow landed on the side of the mans neck stone staggered back from the sidewall swinging his weapon wildly edwin charged after him stumbling against his broad chest the two men grappled on the catwalk spinning in circles with stone screaming in both rage and pain lou tried to pull himself up but his arms were shaking from fatigue emily come on you idiot do it for your kid he gained a little more purchase with his foot and then finally was able to adjust the position of his hands overhead he could see stone beginning to maul the much slighter edwin he had to get up to help at that moment edwin made a move almost certainly unexpected that spun stone around and rammed his back into the upper railing of the catwalk in an instant locked in each others arms the two of them went over brushing past lou as they fell the heavy thud beneath him was dreadful and was quickly followed by the unremitting shrieks of gilbert stone but lou was too weak to turn and look he hoped that the lack of sound from edwin meant that the man had been knocked unconscious the clicking and cracking from the termite jaws reverberating off the steel walls became deafening inch by painful inch lou advanced upward along the outside of the catwalk wall using his foot to push and his fingers to pull finally he was upright hanging on to the wall fearing what he was going to see he finally had the strength to look down the two adversaries lay supine a foot from each other their hands nearly touching edwin was motionless a pool of insectcovered crimson expanding from beneath his head stone was moaning and squirming with pain his eye sockets were already filled with termites and dozens if not hundreds of them seemed to be forcing their way into his mouth his lips were moving as if he were trying to speak but no recognizable words were emerging lou hung on until his wind had somewhat returned then he swung his legs over the top railing of the catwalk wall and dropped to his side on the metal grate his chest heaving with exhaustion the bullet wound to his thigh burned but he knew that with time the scar would be a memento of what had been the worst day of a life that had experienced more than its share of them below him the clicking and grinding of thousands of macrotermes bellicosi had built into a turbinelike crescendo still laboring for each breath lou stumbled to his feet and grabbed the extension pole edwin had used to save his life by the time he returned to the spot where he might have had a chance to reach the man it was way too late the bugs were busily eating and the scion of chester enterprises was already dead chapter it took eight minutes for the macrotermes bellicosi to finish most of their meal exhausted and battling pain in his sternum thigh and a dozen other areas lou sat on the catwalk and averted his eyes from his days on the streets and in the er of a tough city he had seen more than his share of death in its various forms the images never sat well with him and never would when he did manage a glance down what might have been hundreds of thousands of insects were done the sounds of the carnage of human bones being pulverized by insect jaws would never leave him aside from a few shreds all that remained of the two men below were metalbelt buckles edwins brace stones badge and gun and two sets of car keys lou was thinking about retrieving the keys when another sound set his heartbeat racing an alarm buzzer began throbbing from somewhere beyond the laboratory somehow stone had managed to avoid the alarm but whoever had just entered did not know how or hadnt bothered a light fixture encased in a metal cage and mounted just above the entrance to the catwalk began to flash not good lou ran through his various escape options quickly ruling out going back the way hed come in there was a door at the end of the other arm of the catwalk but if it was locked he would essentially be trapped the only other door in the termite lair would bring him into the radiation area hed have no time to don a protective suit but the risk was unavoidable there had to be an emergency exit someplace and the radiation lab seemed a good bet first though he had to get through the door and then get away from whoever had just entered the lab running was not an option he needed wheels using the extension pole lou considered going for stones gun but went fishing for edwins car keys instead if it seemed there was time after snagging the keys he might take a crack at the pistol the choice proved to be a good one the heavy pole was cumbersome to use and was probably intended to grasp much larger objects prodding the bloodstained ground near to where edwins body once had been lou struggled to grasp his keys the drone of the alarm seemed to be getting more urgent come on welcome focus dammit focus after two futile attempts lou hooked the keys but deflated an instant later when the grip he had secured failed to hold lou inhaled deeply he needed to slow his heart in order to steady his hands just imagine youre sewing up a squirming little kid dont get flustered just another routine procedure one more try and he was going to give up and bolt whether he loathed them or not he wished he had gone for the gun the pulsating alarm was unnerving there was no way to tell precisely where the intruder was or how many of them were out there he began considering going for an ambushhiding behind the door onto the catwalk and using the extension pole as edwin had used it the necessity to make that decision never came one more deep breath and he hooked the keys he hoisted them up thought a second about going for stones gun but decided against it looking over his shoulder he limped across the catwalk then disappeared into the radiation room whoever was about to enter the termite lair was in for a hell of a surprise as the steel door closed behind him lou thought he heard the door open at the far end of the catwalk he slid a dead bolt into place and finally allowed himself to exhale he had to get out and get out soon but there had to be confusion on the other side of the door so he probably had a bit of time to compose himself the radiation room was bathed in red light lous eyes were immediately drawn to what looked like a holding tank it was a massive glassfronted structure five feet high and four or five feet deep occupying most of one wall inside the tank were thousands upon thousands of termites almost certainly lou guessed macrotermes a long plastic tube rose up five feet from the center of the tank made a ninetydegree right angle bend paralleled the floor for fifteen feet or so and then dropped down into a plastic box the size of a small refrigerator the box rested on top of a conveyor belt which would lou observed carry the contents inside a piece of machinery that looked like the xray machines found at airport security points the purpose of the setup was apparent a vacuum would suck the termites into the tube then deposit them inside the box afterwards the box would be conveyed into the apparatus where the insects would be radiated on the far side of the machine was a door marked simply extraction extraction probably the removal of the dna from the termites lou decided incredible how far the technology had comeabsolutely incredible and absolutely terrifying he was overtaken by an image of him and people in his lifecap emily renee darlene steve filstrup brian graham bunched together at some sort of cookout grinning broadly as they each held out a huge ear of steaming sweet corn swathed in butter and salt here have a bite bon appetit mutation he knew was the alteration of the pattern of nucleotide bases in a plant or animal by natural accident radiation chemicals or other stressors resulting in changesoften massive onesin the properties of the organism edwin was radiating the macrotermes bellicosi as humphries had suspected causing them to mutate into insects with greatly enhanced fecundity and the secondary ability to consume flesh here have a bite bon appetit now with the finding of the huge tube in the lab on the other side of the termites habitat the cycle from two organisms to one was complete the mutated bugs were placed inside the steel holding pen where edwin stone and anthony brite had all perished when their dna was needed somebody would gather up the carnivorous insects and bring them to the extraction room there they would be pulverized and their dna extracted using large centrifuges lou now felt certain the long tube he saw in the other lab was a mammoth gene gun literally capable of blasting the mutated termite dna into large numbers of corn kernels at that moment lous exhausted reverie was cut short by pounding on the door the nightmare was hardly over on the far side of the lab was another door this one with a glowing exit sign above it the door at first seemed stuck but lou yanked harder figuring the room was being kept under negative pressure as a precaution against radiation leaks with a loud rush of air the door swung open into a cinder block anteroom with another door again marked exit just opposite him from behind he could hear the pounding intensify now with some sort of metal implement he went through the exit then up a short flight of metal stairs the gunshot wound to his thigh probably responding to a constant surge of adrenaline was quite bearable at the top of the stairs was a steel storm door that opened into the floor of a utility shed after he closed that door behind him lou dragged as much weight as he could onto it and exited the shed squinting against the late afternoon light he was at the edge of the woods bordering the clearing through the tree line he could see edwins mercedesbenz stones cruiser and another car a black cadillacalmost certainly the car that had followed him into the city what seemed like eons ago it appeared empty humphriess radar cart was where lou had left it but there it would have to stay his priority at the moment was survival keeping his eyes fixed on the blockhouse lou took a couple of tentative steps into the clearing and then ran as best he could to the mercedes fired up the engine and skidded from the parking lot he had never been much of a car aficionado figuring that the lust to drive highend vehicles should be commensurate with ones ability to afford them but the benzthe first he had driven in many yearswas a car to dream about with only the slightest punch to the accelerator it sped ahead sending a rooster tail of sand and gravel swirling into the still air any confidence he felt about his improving situation was short lived a hundred or so yards down the road he risked a glance into the rearview mirror trouble the cadillac emerging like an enraged phoenix from a dense swirling cloud of dust was on the move it looked as if there were two men in the front but it was impossible to see behind them into the rear seat the power of the mercedes was more than he could easily handle and he skidded several times from one side of the narrow road to another when he finally got the hang of the car lou jammed down the accelerator again and the mercedes shot ahead with a force that felt like several gs the caddy kept pace and actually seemed to be inching closer lous palms were soaked with tensiondriven sweat he was trying to remain composed but he knew he was hyperventilating it seemed like only a second or two since he had checked behind him but when he looked again the caddy seemed to fill the rearview mirror moments later it slammed into his rear end snapping lous head forward like a whip the mercedes fishtailed several times before lou was able to regain control jarred and disoriented he failed to notice the mentwo of them he could see nowhad drifted to his left and were attempting to pull alongside him he skidded in and out of a shallow drainage ditch and when he looked back they had taken over the road the bullnecked man in the passenger seat was grinning as he opened his window and raised his gun instead of ramming into the side of the caddy which was lous first instinct he slammed on the brakes the other car surged past him and the bullets from several shots vanished harmlessly into the corn clenching his jaws tighter than seemed possible lou spun the wheel to the right instantly he was flying through a dense forest of tall stalks he punched the accelerator and jounced violently ahead tall green frankenstalks lashed at the windshield like the brushes in a car wash the soft dirt stole much of the cars traction but miraculously the tires navigated the uneven loose terrain somewhere out there had to be another road behind him the stalks were flattened like the wake of an ocean linerno problem for the caddy to follow lou couldnt see it at the moment but he had no doubt it was coming the man at the wheel seemed to be a much better driver than he was and the car surprisingly was at least as fast as the benz the slashing stalks were blinding from behind he thought he could see the caddy again bouncing through heavy dust there was a loud crack and his rear window shattered faster dammit faster instinctively lou ducked to avoid the spray of dirt and debris now being sucked into the mercedes more gunshots the caddy again closed through the sandstorm behind him then over the roar of the benz he heard another soundthe howl of a powerful engine something big a combine harvester he realized through the stalks he could see the top of the glass cab moving toward him and closing fast he was in the er now and things were unraveling rapidly for the patient on the gurney blood pressure was plummeting heart rhythm was wild and irregular no time to reason or plan only time to react slamming down on his horn lou hoped to drown out the engines sound anything to keep the driver behind him from realizing the harvester was there he intentionally let up on the accelerator beckoning the caddy to close in dust was filling the benz and choking him corn continued to lash against the windshield lou could see just enough to gauge the distance between him and the harvester maybe twenty seconds to impact ten tons barreling at him probably more the caddy was on his tail now exploding through his wake like number two in a cigarette speedboat race the driver had to be flying blind the mercedes was going fifty the caddy was close on his tail at last an advantage blood pressure zero pulse zero no more time go for it it was rebel without a cause and he was james dean playing chicken with a tenton harvester through the windshield lou saw only green the caddy hit himonce then again fifteen seconds the harvester was green he could tell nowgreen with half a dozen bright orange torpedolike protrusions shearing off the ears at ground level and sucking them up the driver was a dark shadow in the glass tower of the machine any moment he would realize what was happening but by then hopefully it would be too late for the cadillac and the men inside number twenty blade please chest cutters rib spreaders come on everyone no time no time the gunman in the caddy fired again the bullet passed through the opening where lous rear window had been and spiderwebbed the front one another shot more spiderwebbing ten seconds lou ducked low in his seat the orange torpedo scoops began turning toward lous right time still crouched as low as he could manage lou swung the wheel of the benz sharply to his left scraping the outermost tube the driver behind him had no time to react lou sat up just as the men slammed with ferocious force into the front of the oncoming harvester the caddy rose up onto its nose and flipped over onto its roof lou accelerated now following the trail of harvested frankencorn that hopefully would bring him to a road when he finally broke free onto yet another narrow dirt and gravel track he pulled over coughing gasping for breath and then laughing out loud throughout the chase he had forced himself to think by reenacting the cracking of a patients chest in the er even though he had never actually done the procedure on anyone it was a game he had played off and on over his career to sharpen his thinkingthe emergency specialists version of a kid counting down the last seconds on his driveway court before taking the final shot in the championship game lou exited the benz long enough to brush himself off spit out a mouthful of dust and stretch he was safe for the moment but he knew william chester was vindictive and deadly it was only a matter of timepossibly very little timebefore the man who had risen to wealth and power on the suspicious death of his mentor went after renee and emily chapter darlene waited in the sitting room outside the oval office for the chance to speak with her husband she had hoped to pop in on him unannounced but understood that at times even the presidents wife was not extended that liberty today it was a call oval office operations director cynthia cuthbert described as very important cuthbert fiftyish single and as devoted to martin as anyone on his staff oversaw who was granted access to the president she prided herself on being meticulous serious and efficient although she preferred to work in the shadows no one in washington who mattered or wanted to matter misjudged her power darlene and she shared a mutual respect though nothing approaching a friendship and a very important phone call was a very important phone call darlene hadnt gotten near the oval office yet but already she felt off balance and uncomfortable how will martin react how much should i tell him everything she had decided he must know everything that she had learned from double m the situation was far too grave for her to hold anything back unfortunately even without mentioning her connection with lou there was a strong chance her overstressed husband would erupt gratefully the oval office walls were soundproof may i get you something to drink while youre waiting for the president cuthbert asked the president darlene thought sighing inwardly how about martin or better still your husband protocol was invaluable for maintaining order but darlene never grew accustomed to how it dehumanized her twentyfiveyear marriage here in cuthberts realm darlene was no longer the mans wife she was merely another guest someone with approved access to the president through the same rigors applied to any prospective visitor more and more she found herself longing to return to their former life together with the privacy true intimacy and yes the fun so increasingly lacking in their marriage granted lou wasnt the president of the united states but he did have intense stresses in his life and he had managed to overcome them and continue active devotion to his daughter and even to his exwife darlene felt some guilt at harboring the feelings that she did but she was nothing if not a woman and a deeply emotional woman at that whether it was guilt or longing joy or shame her feelings were her feelings and she would always own them cuthberts phone rang and a brief exchange followed the president will see you now she said rising from her chair darlene smoothed out her skirt thank you cynthia i shouldnt be too long had she just said that cynically martin smiled warmly as soon as darlene entered his office he came out from behind his expansive desk took hold of her hands and gave her a brief perhaps obligatory kiss on the lips you look nice he said though his eyes barely stayed on her darlene sucked in a deep and nervous breath this wasnt going to be pleasant marty theres something i need to discuss with you martins gaze became more probing as if he had begun sizing up a diplomatic adversary how about we go to the sitting area coffee tea the effervescent miss cuthbert already offered ah cynthiaalways and ever the right thing martin said favoring her with the boyish grin she liked most darlene sat at the center of one of a pair of peppermintstriped sofas and was not totally surprised when he took the seat across from her thanks for making time to see me she said nonsense honey whats wrong you look upset she inhaled deeply and let her breath out slowly its about russ evans she said she could see martin tense his back became rigid and the beginnings of a glare materialized in his killer blue eyes i thought we had decided that subject would be taboo he said still maintaining control darlene had hoped to keep victor ochoa out of this discussion but now she could see that unless martin simply threw her out of his office it wasnt going to be possible she pressed on ignoring his tightlipped reminder of their agreement and extracted an unmarked envelope from her purse the girl who framed russ is dead darlene said handing martin angelas photos martin began flipping through the articles notes and snapshots darlene watched him for any reaction she had expected more okay whats this all about darlene told him about double m from his first contact with kim to the horrible recording of threats made to a young prostitute to their meeting at the movie theater and finally to the arrangement for darlene to meet with dr lou welcome she also recounted double ms warnings about a dangerous shipment of corn lous concerns over william chesters fields experimental work with dna taken from mutated termites and finally lous suspicion that the john meacham mass slayings and other tragedies and near tragedies were somehow connected to chester enterprises gmo corn what she left out was her trip to philadelphia with lou at the moment there was no predicting how martin would react now he craned his neck back and stared up at the ceiling processing what was clearly a lot of information the creases across his forehead deepened his lower lip bulged as he ran his tongue across his bottom teetha nervous tic predating the days when the two of them first started going out together does he believe me abruptly martin rose from the couch and walked to a window overlooking the rose garden several tense minutes passed when he turned back to her his expression appeared to have softened hes seeing me she thought i feel him finally seeing me he returned to the sitting area but this time took a seat next to her after twentyfive years there wasnt a posture or body position she couldnt read this one his face tight and his weight pulled back from her she did not like at all okay okay lets talk he said he leaned back more his leg crossed his elbow on his knee one hand nearly concealing his mouth for the briefest moment darlene felt guilt for having burdened her already overtaxed husband but like martin she too possessed a love of country and a responsibility to protect americans from harm go on martin she said i want to help you out here honey i really do but im flat out of ideas so why dont you tell me exactly what i can do she hated his tone and blank look it was as if she had become an intrusion on his day ignore me if you wish martin but please dont patronize me you know exactly what im talking about and what i want you to do about it martin then nodded it seems youre asking me to issue some sort of presidential edict i really have no authority to do and stop a shipment of corn precisely and even if i could even if i had that sort of legal clout why should i because there is strong evidence to suggest the corn on that train isnt safe darlene answered strong evidence oh please give me a break dar youre being naive this is all about someones petty attempt at inconveniencing a competitor i happen to know about this corna good deal about it for that matter i know that it has been thoroughly tested and found to be perfectly safe for crying out loud dar your friend russell evans is the one who signed off on it darlene felt as if she had been punched in the gut it was half a minute before she could speak why hadnt double m told her what is it you know about this corn martin she managed forcing a modicum of calm back into her voice that makes it so easy for you to discount what im saying martin stood and turned his back to her hands resting on his hips for those few prolonged seconds it felt like he was her president and not her husband eventually he turned back with new resolve on his facethe look of a man about to compromise what im about to tell you darlene martin said in a stern voice cannot ever be repeated it cannot leave this room is that agreed darlene felt her chest tighten as her pulse began hammering im your wife martin you can tell me anything you wish in confidence that corn is going to save my presidency and id feed it to our family for thanksgiving dinner its that safe darlene sat silent and breathless the economy is killing us martin continued americans need jobs and as things stand i have no way to come up with them its as simple as that forget about democrats or republicans when it comes to employment were all independents if i cant get americans back to work my presidencyand everything i stand for and was elected foris over one term and im through if im lucky history will paint me as a failure more likely i wont be painted at all and i am no failure darlene im not about to let the american people down darlene felt herself beginning to shake martin what have you done she asked his gaze at her was level his jaw set i cut a deal with the chinese he said matteroffactly theyre on the precipice of a major food crisis and they know it the wealthier chinese are demanding more meat in their diets which requires more corn to feed the livestock the new chinese wealth is spiking food demands all over the country corn has become the key commodity feeding the world its in all our processed foods feeding corn to livestock that was built by evolution to eat grass is what allows us to eat meat any moment of the day that we want it forget the foreign oil debate were more dependent on corn for our survival than on any single commodity the chinese government realized they simply cannot meet the growing demand using traditional agriculture practices but why this corn why not just increase exports because we cant grow enough of the stuff martin replied as though the answer were obvious genetic engineering is the only way to make truly highyield corn to meet future global food demand farmers need to grow corn at a rate of three hundred bushels an acre thats almost a two hundred percent increase from current yields the chinese see the longterm value in what were proposing to trade this revolutionary cornthe corn on your trainwill virtually guarantee chinas food security through the next millennium ours too the chinese government understands that the fastest way to lose control over their citizens is to allow them to starve and it will happen unless the food demand is curbed or met darlene felt ill her husband was not only in bed with the chinese government but he was in bed with chester enterprises as well she opened a bottle of water and drank without using a glass what are you trading she asked her voice breaking nevertheless the technology to make this corn answered martin the corn shipment youre so concerned about is the first of many planned exchanges with the chinese were giving them enough corn to meet the food demands of a city the size of beijing along with the technology to produce highyield corn on their own you mean the tools to mutate termites and create potentially dangerous food darlene snapped martin began pacing the tic below his lip grew more intense what is with you darlene martin fired back there is nothing wrong with this corn why do you think i have the usda they have tested it it was approved by my personally chosen secretary of agriculture for human consumption dont be so quick to discount me martin darlene said anger making her voice shake im not discounting you im trying to make you understand theres a difference and how are the chinese going to save your presidency exports support us jobs and imports displace them martin said the chinese control what and how much they import if they ease up on the throttle just a few clicks our economists have predicted two hundred thousand new us jobs in half a year that number is more than enough to change the publics perception of our economy it will bolster confidence increase consumer spending and create even more us jobs ultimately with the tentative agreements we have in place this corn is going to create two million new jobs thats how its going to win me the election or maybe you dont understand how politics really works darlene averted her eyes she hated being belittled and was incensed at how easy it was for her husband to make her feel that way youre the president she said her voice hoarse with emotion i trust you to do whats best for the american people and the citizens of the world im glad you have confidence in me but what if lou welcome is right about john meacham and the other messedup people in kings ridge martin sighed are we back to that do you know how many chinese there are of course i do dont insult me then dont play politics with this make sure its safe stop that train martin went red i already told you that the corn is safe this isnt just about an election darlene retorted believe it or not there are more important things in life than winning elections or your precious legacy like what like me martin seemed not to have heard her but he did uncross his arms and softened his expression once more honey lets not do this he pleaded im sorry for what i said about you not understanding politics i just hate seeing people take advantage of you darlene pulled away what is that supposed to mean martin sighed again it means this double m whoever he is clearly knows your weakness and your commitment to good nutrition for all bottom line is this guy is a radical hes a crackpot using you to get to me and you just bought into it darlenes bubble of selfcontrol burst i saw those mutated bugs martin she shouted no longer caring whether the oval office was soundproof or not theyre monsters they cant be considered food finally martin looked as if he were listening where did you see them darlene sucked in a breath and regretted making the disclosure victor drove dr welcome and me to philadelphia we met with an entomologist there thats how i knew the insects had to have been mutated victor drove you and some strange man to philadelphia martins rage could be felt i swear im going to have that fucker run out of the service dont you dare then dont you dare go behind my back again darlene you dont know what youre screwing around with you are way and i mean way out of your league here i want you to talk with lou welcome darlene said martin reddened even more ill do no such thing you just told me he was a drug addict and an emergency doctor not a nutritionist the only arrangements im going to make are for you to leave town to have a visit with lisa until this whole train thing is over and the corn is where it should bein the ground and on the dishes in china you need to get some perspective on things darlene leave the politics to me i want you out of this no more investigating no more talk about russell evans lou welcome or your jaunts to philadelphia is that understood darlene moved as far away from her husband as she could without actually leaving or what she demanded or i promise you that victor ochoa will need to find a new career and itll be your fault when it happens and if your doctor friend gets in my way ill have him hounded until he melts like hot butter you wouldnt dare darlene said in a near growl dont test me darlene and martin locked eyes with neither yielding in many ways darlene knew martin better than he knew himself although they often disagreed darlene had never known the president to lie to her his threat to fire victor she believed was not veiled or lacking teeth he meant what he had said and would do as he had promised darlene felt certain that was true but at some point during their argument his eyes had betrayed him at some point he hadnt told the truth if only she knew what lie he had told just do yourself a favor president mallory she said whats that when they ask for someone to write your legacy dont recommend me chapter who is this kim could barely hear the caller above the din of rush hour noise she blocked her ear with one hand and moved away from the traffic and closer to the buildings it had been a brutal day at work and she had chosen takehome salad from panera bread over dinner with a potentially interesting congressman from california kim its doug from bar none the caller said the bartender yeah doug the bartender kim became hyperfocused why would he be calling how did he even know her phone number whats up she asked some guy in the bar wants to buy you a drink he gave me your number and paid me a hundred bucks to call you sorry to bug you but the truth is i can always use that kind of cash kim tensed is it the same guy from before she asked look youve come in here lots of times with a bunch of greatlooking women and im not sure i could pick any of you out of a crowd people buy people drinks all the time here im just a messenger could you tell me what the guy looks like there was a pause well actually i can hes old old can you see him not at the moment its pretty busy right now he said hell be sticking around for another fifteen minutes longer if you promise to show up okay i got to go okay kim replied to a dead line ill be there not double m she thought no longer feeling exhausted kim called darlene hey there darlene said answering her phone on the first ring with an unusually somber voice something was wrong you okay kim asked already headed toward the bar none actually no im not want to talk actually weve got to talk she told darlene about the bartenders call if its not double m darlene said its probably someone with a message from him youve got to go there right now im already on my way what about you ill call or else meet you there as soon as i can and kim she added catching her chief of staff just before she ended the call yes you be careful when kim arrived bar none was enjoying another packed night of deeppocketed patrons spotting an opening at the bar near where doug was serving at mach speed she wormed her way onto the stool and waved for the bartenders attention when he finally came over he seemed unaware that he had just minutes ago called her cell phone he just stood there waiting impatiently to take her order the jukebox was blasting a song from the country trio lady antebellum and a dozen young and beautifuls were vying for his attention what can i get you he called out im the woman you just phoned recognition dawned oh yeah he said nodding vigorously here you go he handed kim an open amstel light along with a cardboard coaster she left the beer on the bar and flipped over the coaster to her surprise there was no writing on the bottom her heartbeat began to accelerate edwin told me youd do that said a gravelly voice at her elbow kim snapped her head right and saw a cadaverouslooking man in a nicely tailored suit and striped bow tie tall and stoop shouldered the man well into his seventies she guessed extended a bony hand he had a road map of narrow veins covering his sunken cheeks and bushy white eyebrows hovering above a set of intelligent chestnut eyes who are you kim asked my name is shank norman shank he said i am a friend of mr edwin chester and also his attorney no business card kim doubted she would find a norman shank in any listing of area lawyers go on she said my instructions were to contact you precisely in the manner i am doing regrettably i am afraid that something terrible has befallen edwin edwin edwin chester the son of william chester of chester enterprises the seed giant yes shank said he is also the man you know as double m can we go somewhere and talk kim asked glancing around for anyone who seemed interested in them according to my understanding everything that edwin has to say is contained in here shank handed over a large sealed manila envelope you see for some time now edwin has instructed me to phone him every day at three oclock in the afternoon sharp if he failed to answer my phone call i was to send him a text message difficult thing teaching an old man like me how to text in any event if edwin failed to respond to my text within an hour i was to assume that he was either dead or incapacitated in that event i was to contact you via doug here at bar none and handdeliver this envelope double m is dead kim asked struggling to remain composed the lawyer smiled sadly the likelihood is that the most dire misfortune has in fact befallen him once i have done as he requested here i will set about to learn what has happened but we must think the worst kim clutched the envelope thank you her thoughts swirled through the implications of double ms deatheither murder or suicide it seemed shank bowed his head slightly i must be going now please do not try to contact me those are edwins wishes if i learn anything you need to know i will get back to you he turned and shambled from the restaurant kim never losing contact with the envelope drank half her amstel in two gulps and again scanned the patrons for anyone paying too much attention to her the game had changed to serious hardball fifteen minutes later she was considering another beer when her cell phone rang im parked right outside darlene said chapter kim paid her tab left a twenty under the coaster and hurried to darlenes limo she was surprised when another agent not victor opened the door for her darlene instructed the man and the agent with him to get onto the capital beltway and drive until she asked them to return to the white house as they pulled away she requested that the privacy window behind the front seat be closed then she settled back next to her friend wheres victor kim asked as soon as they were moving i told him to take a few days off for his own good martin wants to fire him for taking us to philadelphia her hands were tightly clenched talk to me kim said gently loosening darlenes fists darlene described her fight with martin the threats he made against victor and what he revealed about trading gmo corn seed and technology to the chinese for american jobs kim listened in stunned silence the envelope from double m resting on her lap have you told lou about all this she asked no i gave martin my word that i wouldnt tell anyone but im really poed at him the choice was between sharing with you what happened and broadcasting his pigheadedness on cnn i guess i really shouldnt have put you in the line of martins fire by telling you nonsense i can handle it im just sorry i cant do anything about his deplorable behavior so what now darlene sighed i dont know she said i need martin to meet with lou thats the only way he can possibly be convinced the corn isnt safe but that just isnt going to happen lou has joined the ranks of russ evanspeople i am forbidden to mention in martins presence i swear kim i have never seen such change in a man you dont have to explain babe i remember how he was the night we won floating right up there overhead with the red white and blue balloons alas becoming the most powerful person on earth can cause some pretty heavy changeslike the bite of that radioactive spider did to peter parker darlene you dont have to answer this but is there something going on between you and lou why would you even wonder about such a thing she replied not trying too hard to suppress the glint in her eyes i knew it i swear dar you have all the guile of a newborn i dont even know whats happening lou is the only man ive had these sort of feelings for since i met martin kim squeezed her hand have you kissed him no no darlene replied emphatically but that doesnt mean i havent thought about it especially after that circus today with martin careful about doing anything when youre angry its someones rule i understand whatever you do im behind you all the way the women hugged so tell me darlene asked whats going on with double m kim handed over the envelope having nearly forgotten it was there its bad she said real bad she recounted the upsetting exchange with the man calling himself norman shank you should open it kim said softly read it to yourself or if you want feel free to read it out loud the pages several of them were neatly singlespaced with a double space between paragraphs as darlene scanned the first few words she covered her mouth in horror then read aloud dear madam first lady if you are reading this letter then i am dead my name is edwin chester and i am the son of william chester chairman and ceo of the chester seed company this letter is a confession of sorts it does in my death what i could not bring myself to do while i was alivefinally to tell the truth about my fathers lies and misdeeds darlene gasped lou was right she whispered before continuing i apologize for all the subterfuge my reasons for not being more forthcoming were the direct result of my steadfast unyielding love for william chester you can research his most remarkable life but accounts will paint a very incomplete picture of the caring loving man whom i have been blessed to call my father i write this even though i believe he will be found at least partially responsible for my death i was born with severe clubfoot deformities and was the source of much ridicule even as a young child my father refused to accept my condition he took me to the best surgeons in the world and sat beside me for many hours and many procedures as they reshaped my bones he also pushed me to rise to my potential darlene stopped reading i cant believe hes dead she said shaking and im terrified that martin is somehow involved please keep reading kim urged darlene continued my father was nurturing he was also quite forceful in his beliefs and ways most important he was a constant presence in my very chaotic and inconsistent world when my mother and sister passed away it was my father who stepped in fulfilling the role of parent to such a degree as to earn my unyielding devotion he was the first to see my potential as a scientist and encouraged me to study plant genetics and to continue through to my phd william chester is a true visionary he foresaw the looming food crisis long before it was even a whisper in the halls of the department of agriculture he saw that the corn yield was the lock keeping us from achieving global food security and he knew that rdna would be the key whats rdna kim asked it says right here darlene said recombinant dna opens the door for the creating of limitless new species each designed for a specific function and all created from transplanting the genes from one organism into the genetic makeup of another corn is the single most important crop in the global food economy it is fed to cattle which in turn provides us with beef corn is a key ingredient in almost all processed foods and a mainstay in most diets without a sufficient supply of corn it can be argued a country would fail to provide their citizens with the resources necessary for them to live without hunger or fear of starvation in the global agricultural economy corn is the king queen and most of the court to meet the growing demand our competitors have tried various hybridization techniques averaging a yield increase of roughly percent per year but genetic engineering has changed the game dramatically yields have been increasing up to an average of bushels per acre however that is not nearly enough as a result of the looming corn shortage in the coming years americans will need to decrease their consumption of meat to under pounds per year from an average of pounds per person population growth more industrialized countries more meateating populations higher demand for convenient processed foods ethanolbased fuel these are all factors contributing to a dramatic increase in corn demand meanwhile the supply side is under increasing pressure singlehandedly i have developed a solution to this pending crisis three hundred bushels per acre of corn is now possible with the technology i have created however this technology requires significant genetic manipulation firstly with a radiationinduced mutation of the african termite species macrotermes bellicosus and secondly using rdna techniques to embed the mutated termite dna into common corn i stumbled onto this discovery when i became curious to see how one of the insect worlds most fecund creatures could be used to engineer corn genetically to have more kernels per ear and more ears per acre this represents a dramatic shift from the current yield projection reported by our competitors which requires engineering corn with builtin pest and pesticide resistance the technology i have created in my opinion calls for years of testing before it can be safely sanctioned for human consumption secretary of agriculture russell evans shared my concerns about this new product he believed that transgenic corn that is to say corn created using the dna of a noncorn species technically is not corn in a report filed by the doa and now apparently lost secretary evans insisted on the formation of a study commission that would have kept our new corn product out of the food supply for a minimum of five years i am afraid that delay translated into too much lost profit and lost acclaim for my father to bear for this reason he had secretary evans removed from office as you know i tried to warn the president about my fathers wrongdoings without having to betray the man i love secretary evans was rightthe corn needs to be tested further even though my father insists that intensive human use of our corn and products derived from our corn has already disclosed no adverse health effects but my father is wrong and dr lou welcome is right this corn is not safe there is a train being loaded with our gmo corn for shipment by air and sea to cargo planes and tankers bound for china i believe there are other trains being readied as well i am sorry now that i did not do more to stop these shipments please understand that i did what i thought was best but now it is up to you and president mallory to do what is right i am sorry i will not be there to help you sincerely edwin chester my god darlene whispered dabbing at her tears the poor man she then extracted another piece of paper from inside the envelope whats that kim asked its the copy of the train manifest darlene said the train carrying the corn shipment she folded the letter and manifest then slipped them back inside the envelope what now kim asked now i call victor victor why not martin if im going to speak to martin again i want lou beside me and victor is going to help me with that i told you that during our fight i knew martin was lying to me about something now thanks to this letter i know exactly what lie he was telling chapter youre not making any sense renee said handing lou a cup of the darjeeling tea that was his favorite youve got to slow down and catch your breath can you get into the shower she had cleaned off some of the filth and the worst of his scrapes and cuts but a glance at himself in the mirror was still frightening the gunshot wound to his leg burned but he could tell no serious damage had been done he took a long sip of tea gradually his hands stopped shaking he was in the living room of renee and steves comfortable fourbedroom colonial in arlington emily was in her upstairs room ushered there by renee but only after lou assured the girl he was okay and got her filthy with a prolonged bear hug lou suspected she was near the stairway eavesdropping on their conversation but neither parent had the time nor inclination to prevent it renee emily steve all of them had to leave townand tonight william chester is a powerful resourceful vindictive man lou said now his son is dead and his whole operation is about to be exposed hes going to do anything he can to get back at me anything until we get the police involved and he gets put away were all in danger believe it or not today is the second time his people have tried to kill me i need you to get away and find someplace safe until i can straighten all this out renee took a seat next to him on the sofa that was the only piece of furniture he recognized from their years together this isnt the first time theyve tried to kill you she asked why havent you told me lou filled her in on the events following john meachams murderous spree her eyes widened at his description of the bellicosus termites you actually saw a man get eaten alive two of them as a matter of fact after that two more guys tried to kill me if you want proof the mercedes i was driving is parked outside absolutely riddled with the front and rear windshields both blown out lou lifted the bath towel renee had laid across his lap exposing the gash on his thigh from stones bullet she rose from the sofa went to the bottom of the stairs and called up to emily what is it emily yelled back without materializing pack a suitcase sweetie were going to spend a few days with nana what the teen bounded down the stairs as if teleported what are you talking about going to nanas for how long i have plans this weekend cancel them and pack renee said more sternly no arguments emilys expression immediately became one of deep concern were gonna be okay right she asked lou hugged her again thanks for not putting up a fuss kiddo were going to be fine i just need time to straighten some things out after exchanging anxious looks with each parent emily whirled and raced back up the stairs as soon as they heard her bedroom door slam renee asked softly why do you think were in danger gilbert stone lou said clenching his battered hands he did a lot of research on me my arrest our divorce my reinstatement by the medical board i have no reason to believe all that information hasnt found its way to chester its not your fault renee said this is the information age and stone iswasthe police and chester has boatloads of money if they want us theyll find us eventually eventually isnt now you cant go to nanas though why not for all the reasons you just said if they can get to you they can get to your mother what about steve what about him does his company have a retreatsomeplace youve never been renee thought a moment no but a partner at his law firm has a place in the adirondacks that he keeps offering to steve a fishing cabin i think perfect call steve now tell him you all need to go there right away make him believe you lou watched the color drain from renees face im sorry lou i really am no casting blame no poor us this was a hell of a woman those thoughts segued into images of darlene was it possible he found himself wondering was there any way it could happen between them given their situation given his predicament at the moment all he could do was smile inwardly the answers to any questions about him and darlene mallory were more than clear not in this lifetime first things first cap would remind him first things first and the first thing here was to survive william chester and find a way to bring him down lou dont let anything happen to em renee said sobbing now he held her tightly while he tried to quell his own fears then he rocked her in his arms stroking her hair in the way that was still familiar after so many years nothings going to happen to her he said once then again nothings going to happen to her or you or steve lou closed his eyes and whispered the word hush over and over again until her sobbing subsided when renee pulled away the anxiety in her eyes had been replaced by resolve go shower off she said ill call steve and then ill get you some clothes she took a few steps toward the kitchen phone then stopped lou how are these people in kings ridge being infected by the corn if its not an airborne contagion like you originally thought then how lou bit at his lip i cant figure it out he said ive about torn my brain in half and i just cant figure it out renee returned to the living room after calling her husband hes on his way she said he didnt doubt the urgency for a second he trusts you lou that says a lot ill help you pack as soon as i wash off he said renee paused who are the people you know of who have been affected she asked lou listed off the names now what do they have in common nothing except the obvious as far as i can tell he said no if the symptoms arent the result of something airborne then theres got be a physical factor linking them she said youre just too close to it thats all maybe maybe so listen renee you need to pack chester has enough money to get at you unless we make it nearly impossible okay okay just think about it though her voice trailed off lou followed her upstairs and showered in the guest bathroom renee was right there had to be a connection lou couldnt dwell long on the possibilities steve worked in dc and would be home soon renee had her suitcase at the top of the stairs the sooner they were on their way the better and even then he wouldnt feel safe until he heard they had arrived at the cabin without incident he went to emilys room and helped her gather her things whats really going on dad she asked her eyes moist lou patted the edge of her twin bed and she sat down beside him the nearness of her comforted him and calmed him more than any medication ever could have like i said there is a very bad man who wants to hurt me and anyone close to me hes angry because i can prove the corn hes selling is responsible for that doctor who shot all those people dr meacham your client from the wellness office she said lou reminded himself never to underestimate or talk down to his daughter thirteen going on thirty exactly he said im going to go speak to the police and were going to do what we can to put a stop to this and put him in jail where he belongs you can help by doing what mom tells you okay dad im scared i understand he said im a little scared myself but once youre away and safe no one can hurt you and ill have time to go and talk to the police it wont be long i promise emily wrapped her arms around him and he allowed her to cry until she was able to stop he was still holding her when an incongruous image popped into his head it was the image of pathetic roberta jennings seated in her living room swollen ankles folded over the tops of her shoes tell me mrs jennings did you have any interactions with dr meacham outside of the clinic were you involved in any clubs together community organizations church groups anything like that and at that instant the missing piece fell into place and he knew together he and emily moved the suitcases downstairs lou was getting a glass of water in the kitchen when he felt his cell phone vibrating in the pocket of the sweatpants renee had given him it was a text message from an unfamiliar number darlene lou clicked the message icon and a photo appeared his breathing stopped the picture was of cap and george both men were blindfolded with their hands bound and suspended above their heads by chains they were imprisoned inside what appeared to be the boxcar of a train he could make out the trains open side door as well as some spraypainted writing on the interior wall a message accompanied the photograph come to the chester enterprises grain silo in monroe west virginia by eight oclock sharp or the next picture i send will have your friends throats slit open tip off the police or anyone else and ill kill both of them as slowly and painfully as possible and then your wife renee and your daughter yo emily we need to talk damn whats going on renee asked from the living room what was that cap he said it was cap he averted his eyes but not too much like their daughter renee was a smart bomb for the truth anything important not really lou said unable to keep himself from shaking he just wants to get together is all listen can you all take steves car and let me have yours the mercedes is virtually undrivable no problem just put your shotup one in the driveway the neighbors dont take kindly to folks who let such things happen to a mercedes here are the keys to my bmw you bring it back with the windshields all busted out and youre going to have to open up a lemonade stand to pay for it you have maps in your car a terrific gps and a whole road atlas why just some thoughts i want to check on he said his eyes averted again from what lou remembered monroe was about twenty minutes south of wardensville and a good two hours drive from renees house in arlington he checked the time he could make it at the designated hour but only if he left soon at that moment the house phone rang that was steve renee said after a moments conversation hes about ten minutes away im going to head off because cap doesnt have much time lou said before realizing that he had spoken the grisly terrifying truth keep your doors locked and the phone handy until steves here call me when he arrives and then as soon as youre settled in you be careful renee insisted i love you daddy emily said throwing her arms around him i love you too kiddo this will all be over soon im coming cap he was thinking you stay strong im coming chapter lou was a few miles from the grain silo before allowing himself to feel nervous throughout the ride he tried to formulate a planany sort of plan as to what he might do once he arrived at william chesters rural lair the highest card he had to play appeared at the end of chesters text message we need to talk talking meant there might be some wiggle room chesters son and only child was dead it was a given that the man wasnt going to allow lou to live but there was information he wanted that lou might be able to use to barter for caps and georges livesmost likely the identity of those whom he had spoken to about what he knew in earlier simpler days he had hiked the appalachian trail through west virginia a number of times the lush forests and churning rivers were just what john denver had written in the song almost heaven he had actually driven through the hamlets of wardensville and monroe once although he could not remember the circumstances the towns were somewhere around the junction of state routes and the gps showed only one major eastwest rail line in the area and his smartphone one corn silo near the intersection of the two roads it was owned by chester enterprises obstacle one albeit a small one compared to those ahead had been negotiated jaw clenched he located the tracka pair of parallel tracks actuallyas well as the twolane roadway that ran alongside them unless he came up with something soon he was going to show up at the rendezvous with chester less prepared than emily had probably been for her most recent math test although if he recalled correctly she had reported getting an a on it nevertheless lou had considered and rejected bringing a weapon of some sort to this showdown perhaps a kitchen knife given the manpower chester was sure to have a slingshot like the one david had used against goliath would have done him more good he had decided that going to the authorities was a nogo as well cap and george had essentially no time left even so twice on the drive to monroe he grabbed his cell phone to call but could not get past chesters bloodchilling warning ill kill both of them as slowly and painfully as possible and then your wife renee and your daughter lou needed only to glance at the horrifying picture of the two men hands secured by chains faces beaten to pulps to convince himself that bringing help would be a death sentence lou took in a deep breath and vowed he would not let them die it was his fault that their lives were on the line cap had been there for him since the day the two of them had met george had already pulled himself out of a situation that had buried many others he was a role modelan important role model to kids from the inner city his future was full of productivity and serviceif he lived at this point it seemed like the best lou could hope for was to find a weakness in william chestersome miracle negotiation that would save their lives no matter what he wasnt going to go down easily the twohour drive to monroe felt interminable his mind wandered through the frankencorn transmission conundrum and the solution that had to be right the quiet treelined streets of the village with its clapboard houses white picket fences and old town general store glided past and vanished in his rearview william chester was nearby now waiting lou followed the twin rail beds out of town the trees thinned out and then disappeared altogether dusk settled into twilight as the gps in renees car instructed him to turn onto a rutted singlelane road lou kept the bmws speed down just in case a police cruiser lurked behind a billboard it was nineteen minutes until eight oclock still no plan outside of monroe the terrain became flat the two sets of tracks were on his left perhaps thirty yards away in the distance through the deepening gloom he could see the silos brightly illuminated by spots rising like a mystical metropolis from the tableland on the far track the one that he guessed handled westbound traffic was a trainalmost certainly the train it was a colossus stretching toward the horizon as far as he could see perhaps a mile or more long with what seemed an infinite number of cars as lou rolled past the caboose he could see two men inside they were at a table drinking or playing cards or perhaps both he chose not to cut his lights there was no need to call any unwanted attention to himself and he was far enough away from the train on the opposite side of the other track that he could have been any traveler heading west lou drove until he was five or six cars past the caboose then slowed almost to a stop the behemoth shook as its rusted wheels struggled to inch forward then it stopped for a time before inching forward again is it loading lous heart sank he had no idea how enormous chesters train was going to be even if he were able to sneak aboard it would be nearly impossible to locate the car where cap and george were being held then he remembered the number clearly visible in the photograph fiftyeight he checked the picture to be sure the number was stenciled on the wall behind his two battered friends lou looked carefully at the cars as he drove past each one was numbered although in no particular sequence that he could discern some of them were standard boxcars and some were grain cars they represented several different rail lines and were probably rentals but a majority of them particularly the boxcars belonged to chester rail systems and had stenciled black numbers at the center of their side similar to the numbers inside the car holding cap and george lou had planned simply to walk up to chesters storage facility turn himself over to william and negotiateessentially winging it from moment one now he increased his speed searching for car number fiftyeight and just as important a way to get onto it to his left the train lurched forward again another load lou drove a quarter mile no fiftyeight chesters silos were approaching in the distance the massive structure was composed of four cylinders maybe twenty stories high rising up like medieval turrets toward the base of each silo he could now see long metal chuteshalf pipes extending out for loading the corn through hatches in the roofs of the cars at that moment the train stopped again and in the distance he could actually see and hear the death kernels rumbling like golden hail down a chute into an empty car where was this corn headed lou asked himself who would be eating it how many more lives would be ruined or lost because of it he accelerated slightly seven fifty time was running out the towering grain silos drew closer it was then lou saw something ahead in the distancethe starlike headlight of an oncoming eastbound train from what he could tell it appeared to be moving slowly the way to get onto chesters train may have just arrived but only if he could find car fiftyeight without hesitating he floored the accelerator still searching to his left as the headlights of renees bmw played across the sides of the corn cars the approaching train a totally black phantom from what lou could tell seemed to be crawling ahead perhaps trying not to disrupt the loading process by sending kernels flying everywhere he sped past chesters silos without slowing the corn train seemed unending still no fiftyeight perhaps he had missed it no matter if his plan worked and if fiftyeight was part of the train he would find it finally he passed the enginesthree in all the head of the dragon he kept on driving the black phantom was now a slowmoving eastbound snake with a yellow csx insignia painted on its two ebony engines ahead the horizon glowed like the remnants of a settling fire its red orange hues being nudged into oblivion by the descending night sky seven fiftyfive here the road curved bringing lou even closer to the train tracks now some ten feet to his left he cut his speed then confident he had driven far enough braked to a stop and exited the beemer he took the car keys with him hoping against hope that once cap and george were freed all three would be able to make their way back to this spot undetected lou took one other item from the car as well a tire iron it would probably be that against guns and killers who knew how to use them but better a tire iron than just his wits the huge eastbound freight train lumbered along at about the pace of a brisk walker lou jogged up to it ignoring painful messages from both his wounded thigh and stiff ankle down the track to his left the lone headlight on the lead engine of chesters train glowed like a cyclops in the deepening night following alongside the csx cars lou checked out the steel ladders on two of them from a distance jumping hobostyle onto such a slowmoving train did not strike him as too perilous however from up close and somewhat hobbled he wasnt so confident seven fiftyeight he had to move cradling the tire iron in his hand lou caught his breath and jumped at a chesthigh rung on the next passing ladder the tire iron clanged as he got a hold of the painted metal an instant later the hand with his weapon lost its grip on the rung lou swung away from the side of the car like an opening door the tire iron fell to the gravel beside the squealing wheels gripping tightly with the other hand he shifted his weight to counter the momentum then swung back hitting his nose hard against the ladder instantly his eyes teared up and his vision blurred with his hand now freed he managed to regain his hold with tears still cascading and now nearly breathless he climbed at the top he flattened out on the roof and peered across at the trio of engines on chesters train as the phantom rolled slowly past them next came the unending line of corn cars and boxcars one by one he scanned the numbers painted on each the massive csx train groaned and shuddered as it passed no more than two feet from the other onethirtyone twentyseven sixty lou said each number aloud his heart was racing as the cars glided past the car he had chosen to jump on was past the silo now the sound of corn kernels rumbling down the loading tubes was lost in the grinding of the wheels oneohseven sixtytwo it was just after eight be strong cap you be strong thirtysix eighteen he looked ahead at the number of the next car he would pass there it was fiftyeight right after eighteen lou shifted into a crouch and inched across toward the other train he would go for the roof of car number eighteen to avoid alerting any guards who might be in fiftyeight time had run out for cap and george the fear that was choking his confidence gave way as he readied himself to make the leap even though the black phantom was moving slowly the ground between the two trains was a blur one two three with all the force he had lou launched himself across the gap between trains he traveled much less distance than he had expected or intended and landed hard on the roof of number eighteen however he hadnt appreciated a slight slope to both sides from the center of the car and without traction he immediately began to slip backwards unable to arrest his slide lou went over the roof feetfirst at the last possible instant he caught hold of a rib running along the roof edge and his arms held uttering a soft thanks to cap for the upper body training he hoisted himself back onto the car in an awkward chinupthe second time in eight hours or so his arms had been tested like that eightohseven please dont let me be too late with his body as flat as he could manage lou crawled marinestyle along the length of car eighteen up in a crouch again he was about to dive above the platform joining it to car fiftyeight when the train lurched forward to receive another load of frankencorn lou was thrown hard onto his back air burst from his lungs and his head snapped backwards against the unyielding metal no time dazed he again scrambled into a crouch and leapt headfirst from eighteen to fiftyeight his bellyflop landing was surprisingly easy and silent maybe another prayer is in order he thought if he was rightand he simply had to becap and george were just below him the train stopped moving glancing ahead lou heard the rumble and saw a rush of yellow corn seed as one of the silos emptied some of its load about four cars ahead at the center of the roof of car fiftyeight was a closed hatch the doors rusted hinges creaked slightly as lou lifted it open but the sound of the corn rushing down the loading chute appeared to mask it flattened against the metal he peered into the gloom below the sliding door on the left side was open bathing the inside in a dim light from the spots on the silo he could make out a lone guardjacket off gun in his shoulder holster unaware of the changes above him there might be other guards down there out of lous line of sight but no matter the flames of his determination were fanned by what he saw just in front of the man below him cap and george neither of them moving were dangling from a ceiling support on thick chains their feet barely touching the floor even in the dim light it was easy to see that they had been viciously beaten their heads hung down lifelessly at that moment the gunman tall and blond with a squareset jaw glanced up he moved directly beneath the opening of the hatch blinking to clear his vision lou clenched his teeth he said a silent prayer for god to watch over emily then he jumped chapter falling prey to his own disbelief the guard was late in reacting to the movement above him silently arms flailing lou plunged fifteen feet chest first like a skyjumper in free fall below him he could see the confusion and hesitation in the young mans face just before they collided he thought he recognized him from chesters cornfield what the the guards words were cut short when lou head turned to one side hit him like a cannonball lous knees slammed into his midchest an older man might have had his sternum or collarbones snap but the blond was solid and fit he went crashing over backwards with lou on top his hefty pistol clattered away lous breath exploded out of him and his right elbow hit with numbing force his body momentarily went limp from the pain and he rolled to his side he was relieved to see there were no other guards from where he lay it seemed as if his sudden appearance hadnt registered with either cap or george in fact he wasnt even certain george was breathing cap can you hear me he said in a harsh whisper its lou a moan and movement of the fighters head were the response the men were suspended from a beam by a single heavy chain secured by a padlock to lous right the stunned guard was groaning and struggling to roll over he kept pressing against his ears with his huge hands perhaps trying to muffle the continued explosions in his head with any luck the man was out of commission lou crawled to his friends and cringed caps eyes were nearly lost within mounds of swollen bruises there were cuts on his cheeks and arms and his lips were split and caked with dried blood chesters thugs had accomplished what no opponent in the ring had ever been able to do what took you so long cap rasped his words thick and barely discernible im going to get you guys out of here lou said just hang in there very funny cap managed lou was on his feet now checking george gratefully he was breathing albeit shallowly and slowly lou lifted his head and checked his pupils as best he could wide but equal in size better than they might have been georges hands were pitifully swollen and folded over like rags lou wondered if there was any function left in them lou he was scanning the dark corners of the car for the guards gun when cap grunted a frantic warning and kicked his feet to get lous attention the guard was on his knees propping himself up with a hand on each side he was a beast lou realizedhuge hands broad shoulders and the neck of a linebacker his platinum blond hair was smeared with blood probably from a gash at the back of his head still he looked far more lucid now lou scanned the boxcar once more searching for the gun or some other sort of weapon the walls and grimy floor beneath him seemed bare where in the hell was the gun the guard was quickly regaining his senses and had to be dealt with if he woke up much more it would be like being trapped inside a metal box with an angry tiger lou had never kicked anyone in the face but this seemed like the time he took two steps and swung his right leg up toward the mans chin as viciously as he could the guard reacted much quicker than lou had anticipated batting lous foot aside with the swipe of a meaty arm and the kick barely connected enough to throw the man off balance trouble lou knew he had only seconds to act another kick was probably not the answer his eyes were drawn to a large amount of excess chain dangling from george and looped loosely on the floor the guard was wobbly but readying himself to stand lous only hope was that the mans concussion was still slowing him down diving headfirst lou grabbed the chain about four feet from the end and swung it with all his might at the guards face connecting with much more force than he had with the kick the blond reeled as lou was wrapping the end of the chain around his own fist creating in effect a set of brass knuckles a right hook connected solidly enough to send the man spinning onto his face lou leapt on his back and in an instant had the chain wrapped around his throat kicking frantically the guard rolled over forcing lou onto his back but lou now beneath him was still able to keep maximum tension on the chain the man on top facing upward was thrashing wildly trying to break free of lous hold lou responded by pulling even tighter on the chain stop fighting he said through tightly clenched teeth youre only going to make it worse for emphasis he used up what felt like his remaining strength to increase the tension the guard continued to thrash lou kept the chain taut but the task was getting harder his own muscles were battered and burning and he doubted he could hold on much longer the beast had to black out turning his head for better leverage lou held on at that moment where the floor met the wall in the darkest corner of the car he spotted the gun there was no way the guard could have seen it there yet was the man losing consciousness getting foggy it certainly didnt feel like it could lou beat him to the gun and get set to shoot it close call lous arms were on fire now if anything the guards struggles seemed to be intensifying his weight pressing down was making it hard for lou to take in a full breath he felt his strength beginning to go this was it somehow he had to get the beast off him and go for the gun at that moment desperation took over and with absolutely no idea what he was about to do lou tilted his chin down released the chain and with all his might bit the man at the base of his neck at the same moment he shoved upward as forcefully as he could the guard wrestling with the chain and now in intense pain where his shoulder joined his neck offered no resistance lou shoved him aside and scrambled for the gun the guard actually managed to grab him by the ankle but it was too late lou spun around and leveled the pistol at the mans chest one more move and youre dead lou snapped the guard the chain loose around his neck and blood flowing freely from the deep bite lou had inflicted sank back exhausted and beaten painfully gasping for air lou struggled to his feet the key now the guard unwound the chain and let it fall i dont have the key he said barely able to be heard over his hoarseness mr chester has the key hes the only one stand up and pull your pockets out the man did as he was ordered nothing but a wallet next lou warily retrieved his jacket from where it had been laid over a folding chair nothing in the pockets but what seemed like a full magazine of ammunition lou flipped open the wallet dolph that your name you fucking bit me you bastard ill look for some soap to wash out my mouth okay dolph wheres chester i said where in the fuck is chester tell me now or i swear im going to shoot you in the knees he should be at the silo waiting for you lou turned the man around and jammed the muzzle hard up against his spine noting with some satisfaction the continued bleeding from the deep gouge he had created nice going doc cap managed im proud of you just be strong george no response an idea had begun to take shape where to the guard asked on your face dolph right here dammit im in a very bad mood and i wont hesitate to shoot now on your face the guard complied lou wrapped the jacket around the pistol and closing his eyes tightly shot the padlock twiceonce on the bottom and once on the side the jacket did a lousy job of muffling the sound and the lock fell in two beside the prostrate gunman lou undid the chain and kicked it aside as both george and cap crumpled to the floor groaning cap can you stand if my arms dont fall off you are a piece of work doc an absolute piece of work i think now you just been carrying me in the gym aw shucks lou said helping his friend up while keeping the gun leveled at dolph okay cap can you get down from here good just stand close to the car and keep your eyes out for trouble now dolph this guys name is george if he doesnt make it you dont make it got that i said got that you bit lou swiped the muzzle hard across the back of the mans neck up lets go glaring at lou dolph pulled george to the doorway jumped down and hoisted the young botanist onto his shoulders as if he were a doll then lou followed knelt down and peered beneath the train the last of the cars of the black csx train had picked up speed and were just rolling off toward the east almost home cap he said kneel down and tell me if you think you can make it across piece of cake cap said okay then were going to slide underneath this car and across the tracks dolph you do exactly as i say and none of those pretty women out there will have to go looking for another guy my friend here looks like he can handle george and that makes you expendable no youre the one whos expendable lou whirled to the voice william chester was standing beside an empty grain car shielded by a wall of half a dozen beefy men each with a gun trained on lou drop it welcome chester continued and get inside this car we need to have a chat let these men go and ill chat all you want lou said you had your chance chester said i only give one company policy before lou could respond pain exploded from the back of his skull and his world went dark chapter lou could hear himself groaning but did not have the strength to open his eyes there was an intense throbbing from the back of his skull gradually he was able to blink his surroundings were blurred the smell a dusty heavy farm odor was much stronger than the one inside the boxcar where cap and george were being held maybe some sort of grain car he thought he brushed his hand over a huge knot on his scalp stupid he had let one of chesters goons get behind him things came into focus and he rolled onto his side the cars interior was alarmingly dim directly overhead twenty feet or so a round hatchway in the roof not totally sealed let in the only light lou pushed himself upright and walked his hands around the metal walls no steps no ladder no way out the rectangular space was not the full size of one of the cars it was half as large maybe a thirda fullsized car partitioned off he guessed from nearby he heard moaning and crawled toward the noise trying to ignore the shell bursts from the back of his head as a doctor he would often ask his patients to measure their discomfort on a scale of zero to ten with zero being none and ten being the worst pain imaginable taken as individual injuries his head and the bullet wound in his thigh hovered around a seven each bearable when he finally located the source of the moaning his own discomfort all but vanished cap and george lay huddled together on the floor of the grain car hidden by shadows and propped up against one of the walls hey pal cap said weakly you okay typical of the man lous vision adjusted even more neither of the two was restraineda bad sign he stood shakily crossed to cap and gave him a hand up caps grip was all but gone he had absorbed more beating aside from swollen eyes and a freshly split lip lou saw that he was also missing two front teeth oh cap lous anguished whisper echoed in the empty chamber two on one id bet on me any day four on one its still gonna to be close but five or six bad odds brother youre a lion buddy lou said they really did a number on you cap shrugged hey like they say after those horror stories at meetings at least im sober george had absorbed another pounding as well but he actually seemed more conscious he cried out when they tried to move him i think they busted him up inside cap said maybe some ribs instinctively lou checked george over he was battered but his pulse was holding weve got to find a way out of here lou said theres nothing resembling a ladder what about this hatch cap asked tapping his foot on a spot on the floor lou felt around the edges of a square hatch in the floor three by three that lay directly beneath the round portal above them he was looking for a handle or lever of some sort but it appeared the hatch opened only from the outside fill from the top empty from right here he said a giant steel coffin cap replied i think chesters not taking any chances lou sighed heavily im sorry about this cap its my fault youre here nonsense i dont remember you forcing me into tailing those guys to kings ridge thanks for saying that and dont you start thinking youre not going to see emily again because thats not going to happen not on my watch it aint well think of something before lou could respond the portal above fully opened and artificial light from the mammoth granary brightened the space well hello down there chester called out lou could see the man backlit from above let us go chester he yelled up to him its over echoing in the chamber lous punchless order made him feel infinitesimally small first things first doctor chester replied who knows who knows what dont play me for the fool chester said who knows there might be trouble with our corn who have you told i havent told anyone lou called out thats bullshit lou knew their situation was hopeless desperately he searched his thoughts for somethinganythinghe could say to change matters okay he tried every major newspaper and network is going to run stories about you and chester enterprises mutating termites and engineering poisonous corn and then shipping it off for sale before testing it properly if i dont get out of here to recant my story and explain that you arent responsible you and your company are finished you did no such thing chester yelled down i know precisely when you killed my son and when i text messaged you that photo of your friends there you didnt have the time to do anything nice try though i didnt kill your son chester your flunky gilbert stone did edwin saved my life when stone was trying to kill me now what do you want i told you chester said i want to know who youve told nobody thats the truth youre lying lou hesitated youre right he said i did tell somebody somebody very important who will destroy you agree to let us go and ill tell you everything no chester said let me show you what im going to do if you continue to mess with me he reached beside him a mechanical whirring heralded a grain chute being lowered into the mouth of the porthole chester dont do this lou screamed tell me who you told chester pulled on a lever next to his shoulder there was a thunderous whoosh accompanying a storm of corn kernels instantly dust filled the compartment blocking out much of the light and sucking up nearly all the air lou managed a small breath and then held it the dust thickened as corn continuing pouring down lou had rafted the powerful new and gauley rivers in southern west virginia the roar of the corn was like riding down a class v rapid the kernels struck like bbs all at once the rush of corn seed stopped lou and the others were gagging and coughing for a few moments it seemed as if george had stopped breathing altogether lous eyes were afire dust continued billowing filling the steel coffin which now seemed oppressively small some of the dust but not nearly enough swirled upward and flowed through the open portal like an emphysemic lou put his hands on his knees to assist his breathing dust covered his face and hair the back of his throat felt raw and dry in what seemed no time the level of corn had already reached his ankles cap he wheezed weve got to get george the two men stumbled and slipped as they worked over to where george lay in half a foot of kernels on three they hoisted him to his feet george cried out in pain who did you tell chester called down again the three prisoners were standing on the hatchgeorge unable to lift his head lou and cap peering up at chesters silhouette the swirling dust made the man appear to be hovering within a cloud the president lou said president mallory knows but i dont think he believes me you have my word let us go and ill tell him i was wrong chester jeered of course the president knows he said this is his corn as much as it is mine lou and cap exchanged bewildered looks chester lou called up trying another tack you dont want to do this this isnt what edwin would have wanted you have no right even speaking my sons name chester said spitting in disgust i told you i didnt kill him stone did bullshit you know what i really dont care who you told you killed my son thats enough your son was trying to stop you from sending this shipment he was trying to get russell evans reinstated and have him make you test this poison more carefully the seed barons silence brought lou a jet of hope then without warning chester pulled the lever again more deafening noise more spattering corn more dust more choking more stinging breathing again became virtually impossible lous chest constricted his throat closed altogether they were suffocatingdrowning in dust together he and cap were forced to their knees they sucked air through their dustcoated shirts but the maneuver was of little help then again as quickly as it began the rush of corn ceased the two of them coughed and gagged probably mercifully george had again drifted into unconsciousness somehow lou and cap had managed to hold on to him now they hoisted him upright between them the corn was above their knees had enough chester yelled down ill give you one last chance to tell me the truth and make me believe you who else did you tell about my corn nobody knows about it lou replied with no force behind the words chester waved down to them this is it he said its the truth lou managed youve got to believe me he could see chester reaching again for the lever but there was no noise no waterfall of corn and dust no suffocating air instead there was what sounded like the crackling of gunfire lots of gunfire lou closed his eyes flinching with each crack in anticipation of being shot the gunfire continued in rapid spurts but to lous growing surprise no bullets struck the inside of the grain car whats happening cap shouted to lou i dont know someones shooting i thought they were shooting at ussome sort of a revenge game more gunfire erupted followed by explosions that shook the train then there were helicopters swooping overhead one of them hovered above the portal men caught in the spotlights from the silos seemed to be fastroping down toward them more gunfire more explosions through the din lou heard chester cry out the silhouette above lou clutched his shoulder and pitched forward still holding the lever on the chute again the corn kernels and dust poured down but this time william chester became part of the deadly cataract twisting in the air as he fell he landed heavily on his back not five feet away from where lou and the others were struggling to stay upright and breathe corn pelted chesters body and face he struggled to sit up but his efforts only drove him deeper into the feather bed of kernels the mans mouth contorted in a silent scream within seconds corn had completely buried him briefly chester worked his head free and craned his nose and mouth toward the portal but the level continued to rise with the corn already at lous chest there was no way he could even move help me he thought he heard over the rush of seeds help me corn had covered chesters nose and eyes his mouth seemed to suck in one final breath a moment later he vanished the flow of corn was nearing lous shoulders the pressure against his body was enormous and he reflexively began reviewing the physiology of crush injuries muscle death swelling loss of function renal shutdown and all sorts of cardiac and pulmonary problems how would dying that way compare to suffocating in corn the horrible din was diminishing as well lou no longer heard what he thought was gunfire maybe the noise had been something mechanical he looked over at cap the rising corn was at the level of the mans upper chest george wedged between them mumbled incoherently he was buried to his throat lou tried to reach over for caps hand but was immobilized within a cocoon of kernels still through the intense dust they could see each other well enough to exchange looks of helplessness got any ideas lou asked surprised at how calm he was feeling next to the man who had been such a perfect friend yeah cap said the serenity prayer this is going to be tough on emily shes a strong girl lou shell be all right lou lifted his chin no use the corn was already nearing his mouth his ears and nose were filled with dust kernels continued to sting them like angry hornets i wish you had my two inches cap said noting lous struggles to keep his head up lou spitting corn seed out of his mouth glanced glassyeyed over at his friend he could read caps lips the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference lou said the last words out loud clenched his jaws closed his eyes tightly and inhaled one deep final time corn slid up and over his mouth there was no way he could hold his breath any longer i love you em i love you her beautiful face was there with him smiling all became silent then with another rush of sound and a sense of movement the darkness turned to a dim light im looking for dr lou welcome is dr lou welcome here disoriented and confused lou opened his eyes he was on his back alongside the track spotlights were shining down on him from the chester enterprises silos he had an oxygen mask on everyplace around him was cornpiles and piles of golden kernels frankencorn sitting beside him brushing dirt and corn from his face was cap hey there boss cap said welcome to the land of the living theres a guy calling out your name i think he wants to talk with you lou pulled the oxygen off he had to clear his throat and spit out a gob of thick mud in order to speak george medics took him away cap said one of them gave me a thumbsup so i think hes not in any big trouble medics lous head cleared rapidly he rolled over onto his side gagging and coughing then with caps help he sat up and looked around in every direction were crumpledup parachutes there were dead bodies tooa row of them being dragged away from the train and lined up by soldiers in black greasepaint lou recognized chesters man dolph as two soldiers set his body down next to the others he was bloodied and it appeared he had been shot many times the landscape was complete and total carnage to lous left was the grain car its hatch was open and the contents of the bin had been emptied out onto the ground chester the medics took him too im no expert on dead but he sure looked it to me a soldier approached his face also blackened lieutenant brad taylor united states army second ranger battalion are either of you dr lou welcome i am lou responded weakly do you need your oxygen mask sir if i have trouble breathing ill put it back on very well im glad youre okay sir i have been instructed to tell you that president and mrs mallory send their regards chapter millie neuland unlocked the front door of her restaurant and motioned for lou to come inside she had on what he had come to believe was her standard uniforma light blue gingham dress and frilly half apron her broad smile upon seeing him rivaled the brightness of the midmorning sun dr lou she said wrapping him in her arms what a pleasant surprise im so glad to see you are you all right your face looks a little bruised im fine millie fine wonderful behind millie across the vast restaurant lou could see half a dozen cooks and an equal number of waitstaff all getting ready for what was sure to be another busy day everybody eats at millies he was thinking business as usual he said business as usual millie echoed come in come in millie seized lou tightly by the arm and guided him into the expansive foyer so what brings you out here so early she said you know you dont have to beat the crowd to get served first lou grinned if the truth be known he said i came here to talk to you is there a private place we can sit down why of course dear my office is on the second floor she gestured to a staircase off the right side of the foyer and undid a velvet rope so they could ascend shuttered office doors lined one side of a long carpeted corridor that was interspersed with foldout tables on which there were several fax machines a printer and reams of copy paper there was also a water bubbler and mailbox cubby system in addition to numerous employee notices on bulletin boardsoshatype stuff taped to the wall was a poster announcing an upcoming softball game against a rival restaurant lots of excitement in the news today lou said as millie unlocked a door at the end of the hall i should say soldiers dropping out of the sky in the middle of nowhere to subdue a drug kingthat certainly is exciting can i get you some tea coffee eggs were going to begin our breakfast experiment in another month thanks but no thanks lou said millies office a modest windowless space with a ceiling that was peaked like the roof above it was surprisingly uninviting there were no framed pictures about no motivational posters adorning the walls not a single cookbook either there was just a simple desk two chairs several filing cabinets and a lot of papers all business lou closed the door behind him as he entered this used to be a supply closet millie said gesturing him to the classic hardbacked maple kitchen chair on the guest side of her desk and taking what looked like a highend orthopedic desk chair on the other so whyd you make it your office he asked oh i didnt want to be tempted to spend too much time in here you cant understand your customer if youre not with your customer know what i mean i dont think theres a restaurateur who knows their customers like you do lou said everybody eats at millies she replied cheerfully picking up a menu off her fairly cluttered desk to show lou the saying printed below her rainbow that commando raid in west virginia lou said actually thats what i came out here to talk with you about now what a strange thing for you to do she said her blue eyes narrowing slightly and surrendering some of their sparkle not so strange he said im not sure what your news source was but the raid had nothing to do with drugs now how would you know that because i was there lou said millie tried for a quizzical look but her eyes had grown hard and if the raid had nothing to do with drugs she asked exactly what did it have to do with corn it had to do with corn oh millie crinkled her nose and smiled at him benignly im afraid im not following renee lou said who my exwife renee shes the one who really figured it out for me figured what out dear youre not really making any sense you see once i realized that william chesters corn was the cause of all these people periodically losing their judgment and doing crazy sometimes dangerous things i was looking for a common threadsomething that would tie john and carolyn meacham roberta jennings joey alderson and the staff at deland hospital together i kept thinking it had to be airborne or how else could those people have become affected as they did millie neufeld was granite now im afraid i still dont get you doctor perhaps youd better come back another time but then it hit me on the helicopter ride back from west virginia we actually flew somewhere near your place by then i already knew just as you said everybody eats at millies millie her smallish hands gripping the edge of her desk glared across at him why dont you stand up lou he did as she asked will you take your shirt off dear wire i just want to make sure our conversation stays private if you know what i mean lou took off his shirt and millie gasped at the extent of his cuts and scrapes he pulled up his pant legs too then put his shirt back on i dont have a wire he said and you dont have any proof either my friend merely allegations the fbi could seize your invoices i bet theyll find you have a very limited number of food suppliers i bet theyll also find that each of your suppliers can be traced to a food processing plant owned by chester enterprises and its subsidiaries like i said its all about cornspecifically chester corn interesting concept the trouble is i wouldnt be so foolish as to keep any invoices around what percentage of the food you serve is processed from that stuff i couldnt say yes you could how about millies cola who makes that you mean the fructose in it i think you already know the answer to that question and your beef all of it corn fed millie said chicken the same chicken turkey taco shells cola all my pasta customers almost never complain either my cereal my frying oil my biscuits and grits cookies chocolate potato chips yogurt mayonnaise margarine ketchup salad dressings syrup even our wheat bread has some corn baked in it forget amazing grace were talking amazing grain you asked what percentage the answer is almost everything on my menu millie why did you do it do what feed your customers chesters corn a wistful look overcame her do you have any idea how hard it is to survive in the restaurant business these days she asked the economy was tanking and it was taking my customers down with it food prices were going up high and fast but the bigger chains could keep their prices low because of volume i didnt have that luxury the only way i could have stayed profitable was to raise my prices and lose my customers then mr chester came along mr chester is the one those commandos were after hes dead millie stiffened momentarily then quickly regained her composure im sorry she said what kind of deal did he offer you he needed a place to test his products for allergenicity and other health effects and he needed it fast all i had to do was buy my food from his processors i tasted everything first of course it was good highquality stuff no problem there plus he funded my retirement by just a little bit whats a little millie what was selling out like this worth to you enough to let an old lady leave it all someday and stone he was paid to keep an eye on things he did whatever william asked him to if there was trouble with any of the deliverers he would take care of that little things that i guess added up to a lot you sure williams dead sure as sugar lou said he shook his head in dismay did you know what chester was doing why he needed to get that corn of his into the marketplace so rapidly a retirement fund buys a lot of silence i didnt really ask so you had no way of knowing that his experimental corn could dangerously diminish the decisionmaking capacity of your consumers millie shrugged i just knew that they were loyal and regular customers but chief stone did ask me to keep a close lookout for anything unusual in any of themallergic reactions skin problems and such and as i said there were none what you were looking for was only the tip of the icebergthe things you can see if you say so why hasnt everyone who ate here over the last eighteen months suffered these lapses maybe they have to a greater or lesser degree we may never know if the problems were related to how much people ate here or just an allergic idiosyncratic reaction but i am positive that your food is the cause and regardless millie what you did was illegal wrong you knowingly fed your customers food products that were not fda approved or even tested you have no proof of that im just a businesswoman running a business i bought my food from the supplier that gave me the best deal proof doctor you have no proof that i did anything wrong lou sighed aloud why dont you come with me millie she followed lou out into the corridor do any of these offices have windows overlooking the loading zone out back by the kitchen millie nodded all of them except of course for mine lou opened the door to the next office he came to letting millie enter first he watched her walk over to the large picture window then saw her shoulders sag when she looked outside lou came over to stand beside her the loading zone was a beehive of activity outside were police cars and several official vehicles from the fda dea and epa they were taking food out of the kitchen and loading it into fbi vans the agents closed this place until they can get statements from your employees theyre downstairs doing that now they have a court order but i told them they could wait to give it to you why arent you the foxy little fellow lou welcome too bad im not a big fan of chicanery the fbi doesnt need invoices when your food can be tested for the dna of mutated termites is that what chester used to make his food bugs millies insouciance made lou boil theres a lot at stake here millie lives have been lost and destroyed because you closed your eyes to what was going on youre going to be found guiltyeither by the law or the irs well you should know something yourself doctor whats that i may not be getting everything william was going to pay me but there are plenty of topoftheline defense attorneys who love to eat at millies chapter i cant make myself be happy lou often liked to say to anyone who would listen but i can always make myself not be miserable he sat alone in his modest living room imagining what a shot of jack daniels would taste like right about then not that he was about to dash off to the bar but he knew he was making the conscious decision to spend some time wallowing in his own melancholy on the surface it didnt make much sense he had friends family a job that mattered hopefully as soon as he sat down with the pwo board and walter filstrup two jobs he had helped save the health and lives of countless people and had at least brought some closure and understanding to those poor folks killed in john meachams office as well as to carolyn meacham and her children cap and their young friend george were going to be okay and in another day emily renee and steve would be headed home in addition last night lou had driven to the white house to participate in one of the most momentous decisions in the history of american politicsthe decision of a sitting president whether or not to resign therein he knew lay the source of the gloom engulfing him at the moment he didnt know for certain but he strongly suspected that martin mallory was going to leave office and return home to kansas as penance for dealing untested genetically modified chester enterprises corn to the chinese in exchange for jobs lou also felt fairly certain that first lady darlene mallory would be going with him it was nearly nine at night just over two days since lou had hugged emily and renee and set off for what he honestly believed were going to be his last hours on earth now messages had maxed out his answering machine and calls were flooding his cell phone as well the newspapers were gradually piecing together the story and his name was beginning to pop up it would he knew get worseundoubtedly much worse already several reporters had found their way to his front door to the physician wellness office and even to caps stick and move gym across the street lou saw none of them nor had he turned on his tv falling for darlene as he had was stupid he knewchildishly dumb especially after knowing her for such a short time it was easily the most unlou thing he had done in longer than he could remember and oh yes she was married although she had never said anything outright he sensed her feelings for him were growing as well but that only made things harder at least he decided now he was being forced to come to grips with something that had gotten lost amidst all the gratitude he felt for having gotten straight and sober having a great relationship with his ex and his daughter and having his medical license restored now without restrictions he was lonely fantasizing that darlene might fill that void had been where he went off the track so to speak smiling at the irony of the image lou padded to the kitchen for some cold cranberry juice and a fourpack of snackwells vanilla cookies there was nothing that could happen in his life that the combination of the two wouldnt help he had just returned the ocean spray to the fridge when his doorbell buzzer went off nine thirty a little brazen of this reporterno a lot brazen ready to dismiss whoever it was with a lesson in civility he stalked to the intercom youre way out of line coming here at this hour he snapped now go home and write a story about consideration for others lou its darlene her voice said softly can i come up of course you can come up lou said well after he had buzzed her in moments later she was there beside him and all the work he had done reeling in his feelings crumbled she was wearing jeans and a windbreaker as she had when they first met and just as then she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen i figured you came to my house last night she said the least i could do was come to yours the summons to attend a critical meeting at the white house had come from martin mallorys chief of staff leonard santoro lou was ushered into the cabinet room where most of the cabinet as well as the vice president and speaker of the house questioned him politely about what they called the chester affair the president showed up toward the end of lous testimony and the first lady arrived just as lou was about to leave aside from shaking his hand and a moment of eye contact there was no obvious connection between them when the session was over for him lou was escorted without comment to his car he drove home with the strong sense that mallorys presidency was about to come to an end i like your place darlene said taking a spot on the couch without waiting for lou to offer her one he took the other end knee on a cushion hands folded in his lap thanks he said next to some other places ive lived its the taj mahal emily likes it here and thats what really counts and i love being right across the street from the gym do you want something milk juice cookies darlene shook her head i wont stay long is emily okay doing fine hopefully shell never know how close she came to being fatherless i know martin and i listened to your testimony last night from his office what you and your friends went through was so damn horrible you were terrific by the way thanks i probably wouldnt have been able to speak if i had known you were listening you do know that sending in the rangers was martins idea yes lou nodded his man santoro told me santoro didnt say so and maybe he didnt know but i was pretty sure you had something to do with it when i found out about the deal with china i pushed and shouted for that train to be stopped i spoke about what you and i had learned about kings ridge i even pleaded with marty that there were more important things in life than being president if it came to that for the first time he didnt simply dismiss me out of hand he just got real quiet and still and then asked to be alone when he called me back into his office he told me he had spoken with william chester and told him he was going to cancel the deal with the chinese he demanded the train be stopped immediately but chester refused exactly there was a lot of money at stake not just for the corn but for the technology billions i think i wouldnt be surprised lou said chester said the cargo ships and planes were waiting and the shipments were going to happen no matter what he also said that you were totally wrong and the corn had been proved safe through thousands of trials in humans martin mentioned the communication you and i had with edwin and chester went ballistic if he had to he said he would divert one of the trains to one of his distribution centers here in the states and give the corn away then he would just make a deal with the chinese himself martin decided that chester had gone over the edge he sent in a reconnaissance flight and got the report that there were armed guards and that men were being held at gunpoint beside the train guess who lou said i know well martin tried one last time to reason with chester but apparently the guy actually hung up on him thats when martin sent in the rangers their instructions were to avoid bloodshed at all costs and take chester and his men prisoner but before they could do that some of chesters goons started shooting you know the rest id like to say im sorry but you your husband and the rangers saved our lives lou chewed on his lip for a time then reluctantly asked so what happens next he could see the answer in her eyes martin met with his people and discussed if there was a spin they could put on things that would at least get him through to the election if he just stayed in the race there was no predicting what might happen they considered telling the world that a large shipment of drugs was involved but in the end they decided that there were too many ways things could break down and they would end up with another watergate on their hands so hes just going to go with the truth it came down to being guilty of a colossal lapse of judgment or trying to get away with an equally grand lie you and lisa should be proud of him darlenes eyes had begun to well lou before he went out to tell his advisers his decision he asked me if i would stay with him if he resigned i wasnt surprised that i told him i would what i was surprised about was that i found myself thinking about you when i did weird because weve known each other such a short time believe me ive been thinking the same sort of thing i felt pretty sure that was the case darlene shrugged what can you do but her expression said much more i think the announcement is going to come tomorrow its a shame martins not a bad man he just made a bad mistake is victor outside lou asked nope he gave me his car when i asked i came alone wasnt sure id remember how to drive i didnt even know if youd be home its silly i know given our situations but i i just wanted to be sure you knew that when martin leaves ill be going with him why wouldnt you lou asked swallowing against the sudden appearance of a softball in his throat as i told you he and i were on shaky ground before all this happened i was seriously starting to think about a separation even before i met you that would have been hard i dont care after you and i met those thoughts intensified i dont believe ive ever met a man as genuine and caring as you are if martin hadnt made the call to chester i really think i would have left him lou flashed on the corn rising past his mouth and nose and actually managed a grim smile i dont think we would have benefited much as a couple if thats the way it had come down he said i suppose not she said her expression bittersweet lou i know its not fair but please come and sit by me here lou hesitated and then did as she asked she set her hand on his and made no attempt to stem a gentle flow of tears i cant leave martin she said not now not after the choice he made not after he saved you i understand it wont be right for me to contact you once were gone but if theres ever anything you need anything i can do for you please get ahold of me i understand lou said again do you think you would ever go back into medicine i dont know i hope so so do i lou yes ill never forget you he started to speak but she silenced him with a finger to his lips their kiss began as a gentle touch when it ended she stood but motioned him to stay where he was then she smiled wiped her tears with the back of her hand and headed downstairs softly closing the door behind her
