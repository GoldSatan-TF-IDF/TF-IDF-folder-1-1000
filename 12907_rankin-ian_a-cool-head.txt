ian rankin a cool head quick reads to richard havers who took me to the beach boys concert where i got the idea for this story they were singing a song about always keeping a cool head and a warm heart i started to wonder about the opposite a hot head and a heart as cold as stone chapter one gravys story my dad used to say to me try to keep a cool head and a warm heart at least i think it was my dad i dont really remember him ive got a shoebox with photos in it and in those photos hes always showing his teeth ive rubbed my thumb over his face so much hes become blurry and that seems to be whats happened to my memories too theyre fuzzy at the edges and sometimes even fuzzy in the middle if i went back to see dr murray hed tell me to start taking the pills again but i dont like the pills they make my head hot my dad wouldnt like that if hes still alive hell be fifty or sixty im thirty or something like that sometimes i stick my hand under my shirt just to check that my heart is still warm cool head warm heart i remembered those words when i saw benjy staggering towards me he was holding a hand to his chest his tshirt was white mostly but with a lot of red the red looked sticky and dark there was a bag in his other hand the kind you get at the grocers shop made of blue plastic i didnt recognise benjy at first what i saw was a car it came in through the graveyard gates there wasnt supposed to be a burial today so i was a bit surprised visitors usually park on the gravel outside the gates theres a big sign parking for visitors that was where visitors were supposed to park but this car drove through the open gates i wondered if i would get in trouble for leaving them open i wondered who was in the car it was a black car nice and shiny maybe it belonged to someone official the driver wasnt a good driver he nearly hit one of the gravestones the car kept hopping forwards kangaroo petrol they call it that meant the driver was a learner but i couldnt see any lplates the car stopped and the door opened nobody got out at first but then i saw a leg and then another leg and then the driver managed to get out of the car he made a groaning sound and thats when he pressed his hand to his chest he left the door open and started walking towards me i was collecting leaves and twigs and bunches of dead flowers they would all go on my bonfire i had a wheelbarrow and a rake and i was wearing my thick gloves gravy it was when he said my name that i knew i was supposed to know him his face and hair were covered in sweat he had a denim jacket and his jeans had splashes on them he was wearing an old pair of trainers i was surprised to recognise benjy benjy always wears a black leather coat he always wears cowboy boots and tight black trousers and a black tshirt today was different for some reason gravy everyone calls me gravy its got nothing to do with food i cant really cook just microwave meals and things from the chip shop toast i can make toast and beans and fried eggs but not lasagne or that sort of thing gravy no thats not why i got the name its short for graveyard because thats where i work and before i even worked here i would come for walks here i would read the peoples stories on all the headstones when they were born where they lived and what their jobs were i like all that stuff and the bits of poems and prayers and sometimes a carving or a photo those photos always get damp though even when theyre in plastic they rot or they fade like thoughts and memories and people in the ground wheres your coat i asked benjy he was near me now only ten feet away or maybe twelve feet hed stopped walking and was bent over at the waist as though tired never mind that he said then he tried to spit but it was all gloopy and just hung there until he wiped it away with the bag hand the hand carrying the bag there was something heavy in the bag small but heavy thats a good way of telling you about benjy too hes small but heavy he used to say he was a boxer his punches would just miss my chin when he showed me he wasnt really a boxer but he knew about boxing he went to matches and he watched videos of fights when he stopped bending over he looked around as if making sure there was no one else in the graveyard got something you want me to hide i asked id hidden things for him before sometimes weeks or months later he asked for them back other times he didnt that was how i met him the first time he was hiding a bag behind a gravestone yeah benjy said now me for a start i didnt say anything he made another of those groaning noises and tipped his head back then he said a swear word and that made me a bit embarrassed i looked away leaning with one hand on my rake the man who worked with me my boss had gone home ages ago like most days he told me what to do and then went and sat in his hut with a newspaper or book his radio a flask of tea and some food he usually threw away the sandwiches his wife made him and went to a bakers instead he never gave the sandwiches to me and never brought back anything for me from the shops i waited until he went home then i picked the sandwiches up off the compost heap i always checked them to make sure there were no bugs or bits of leaf so anyway it was just me and benjy in the graveyard the sun had left the sky so maybe it was time for me to go home too i cant tell the time so i have to guess these things i do have a home though its a room in a house there are other people in the house and if i lose track of time one of them comes and fetches me if they remember gravy you paying attention yes you need to pay attention yes benjy i need to hide somewhere how about your bosss hut did he say it was all right sure he did i just spoke to him thats fine then is it locked he always locks it but youve got a key i shook my head i used to have a key but then my boss found me sleeping in the hut one morning id been there all night it was so peaceful and quiet benjy was making a hissing sound then he started coughing and the spit that came out of his mouth was pink like hed been eating sweets he tried wiping it away again but the bag was too heavy i need to hide he repeated didnt he give you the key no thats a shame i thought for a moment how about hiding behind the hedge i pointed to it thats where the bonfires happen its where the compost is kept and the digger not a big digger but big enough for a hole six feet deep benjy didnt seem to be listening he fell to his knees and i thought maybe he was going to pray tired was all he said yes i told him you must be he managed to look up at me nothing gets past you gravy then he shoved the bag forward it was sitting on the ground in front of him hide this for me sure will you be wanting it back not a chance his head slumped forward again i could see his chest and shoulders rise and fall he really was tired so i left him there and tiptoed to a different part of the graveyard and did some more raking it was almost dark by the time i got back to him my wheelbarrow was empty id left it with the rake next to the digger i kept my gloves with me they would go home with me they were good gloves benjy ive got to lock the gates now i said boss doesnt like them left open people come in at night they leave things lying around sometimes they paint things on the headstones or try to start fires theres a big chain for the gates do you want me to move your car benjy his shoulders werent moving he still looked like he was praying my mum used to pray she would be on her knees at the side of her bed hands pressed together i did the same thing and sometimes i still do but i always whisper the prayer so the other people in the house dont hear me benjy i placed my hand on his shoulder and watched as he fell forwards until he was face down on the pathway i knew what that meant and when i turned him over his eyes were closed his mouth wide open i pulled up his shirt and saw the hole in his chest blood had stopped coming out of it his skin was cold to the touch bad i said it was the first word that came into my head bad bad bad bad five times for luck there was a dog barking somewhere dogs like the graveyard so do cats and foxes and rabbits birds too in the daylight id never seen or heard an owl or a bat or a rat or a mouse one old lady from the estate told me there were badgers nearby but she couldnt tell me where she said she could smell them sometimes i always wish id asked her what they smelled like then id know bad badger badger bad i said liking the sound of it four more times for luck then i looked inside the blue bag it was a gun it looked like a real gun there was blood on the inside of the bag the gun smelled of oil or grease id hidden a knife for benjy in the past but never a gun first time for everything i thought to myself then i noticed the car there was a light on inside it and that gave me a shock but the door was open and that had to be the reason when you opened your door a little light came on i walked over to the car and looked inside more sticky blood on the seat and the steering wheel and a balaclava on the floor the key was in the ignition the car smelled of leather and there was a little green tree hanging below the mirror benjy had forgotten his other bag it was the kind people carried when they were going to play football or visit the pool it was red and shiny and when i opened it it was full of bits of paper i lifted out one of the bundles and held it up to the little light in the cars ceiling it was money the notes all had on them that meant each one was worth twenty pounds i put the bundle back in the bag and looked through the windscreen benjy was still there so was the blue bag with the gun inside he wanted me to hide the gun but what about the car what about the red bag and what about benjy chapter two george renshaws scrapyard im not happy gorgeous george said this was true but then he wasnt gorgeous either as don empson stared at his employer he wondered how george had ended up with the nickname maybe it was ironic a sort of joke like calling a glum bloke in the pub smiler gorgeous george was as wide as he was tall and he wasnt exactly short he always wore his shirtsleeves rolled up his arms were hairy with a lot of tattoos the tattoos were from his days in the royal navy there were thistles and pipers and naked women george was completely bald his scalp gleamed there were nicks and scars on it and more scars on his face and neck he wore a large gold ring on each and every finger right hand and left plus a heavy gold id bracelet on one wrist and a gold rolex watch on the other when he laughed which didnt happen very often you could see a couple of gold teeth towards the back of his mouth his eyes were small almost childlike and he had no eyebrows his nose was red and pulpy like an overripe strawberry he sat behind his desk and drummed its surface with his jewelled fingers not happy at all he said youre not the only one don told him how do you think i feel nice easy job you said a simple delivery i mean someone sticks a gun in my face im not happy either okay so it had been his stomach rather than his face but don reckoned face would sound better time was george muttered youd have taken that gun away from him and slapped him about a bit time was don agreed it was true he was getting old hed worked for georges dad for the best part of thirty years when albert had died and george had taken over the business don had reckoned hed be put out to pasture but george had wanted him around a link to the old days don hadnt been keen not that hed said anything and now this you sure you didnt recognise him george asked again he was wearing a mask and he was on his own as far as i could see and there were three of you three against one looked to me like he was the only one holding a shooter don paused are you sure we should be discussing this here he meant bugs george was worried the cops had planted bugs in his office george scowled at dons question but then thought about it and nodded lets take a walk he said rising to his feet the office was a portakabin and the portakabin stood in the middle of a scrapyard don was wary he knew what those words could mean lets take a walk didnt always end well for people the walks they took in this scrapyard walks they took with gorgeous george dons shoulders and arms were tensed as they stepped outdoors the crane the one with the big magnet swinging from its arm had finished work for the day the compactor sat in silence in the past it had crushed its fair share of cars sometimes those cars had contained evidence and sometimes body parts ive told you don said to his boss im getting too old for this worlds changing too fast its younger guys like sam and eddie you should be relying on but it comes down to trust in the end don george replied and i wouldnt trust either of them the way i trust you my dad always told me dons the guy any problems donll sort things out all in the past george george had slung an arm around dons shoulders they were walking past the german shepherds the two huge dogs stared at them tongues lolling from their mouths but they didnt bark they knew better than to bark at george if don was on his own theyd be straining at the leash keen to sink their teeth into a leg or an arm but right now george was protecting him the two men were heading into the heart of the scrapyard cars and other vehicles were piled on top of each other many had been hauled here from the scenes of accidents people would have died in those accidents people would have lost limbs and loved ones so tell me again george said tell me how it all happened don thought for a moment and took a deep breath well he said i drove into the garage like you told me hanley wasnt there yet so it was just me and raymond raymond was working on a bentley polishing the dashboard really doing a thorough job hes a car valetthats what he does not any more george managed a sympathetic look not any more he agreed so anyway i was talking to him just the usual stuff and then hanley arrives he drives on to the forecourt but leaves his car there keeps the engine running he wasnt planning on sticking around the bag was in the front seat of my car should only have taken us two minutes so when did the bandit arrive he came out of nowhere balaclava pulled down over his face just a couple of holes for the eyes and one for the mouth he was carrying a pistol funny thing is what well i had this wild thought when i saw him i wondered if youd sent him me that way youd get your money back and hanley couldnt complain hed still have to keep his side of the deal george was shaking his head but he was thinking too don reckoned he knew what he was thinking wish id thought of that and you just handed the cash over to him george asked im not a martyr george the gun was real so how did the shooting start there were the three of us me hanley and the mask nobody was paying attention to raymond he must have had the gun tucked away somewhere he shot twice it was deafening and he got the guy first bullet went wide second one hit him in the chest don paused for a moment it was painful for him remembering this he made a show of clearing his throat but by then hed fired back at raymond went straight into his skull and he dropped the money was still in my car so the mask got into the drivers seat and backed out of the garage headed across the forecourt and was gone before you could pick up raymonds gun don just shrugged what did hanley do besides wetting himself i mean he ran back to his car and hightailed it same direction the bandit took don shook his head you reckon hanley but he was going to get the money anyway george thought about this and nodded he folded his arms this isnt good don how did you get out of there well the bentley had its keys in where is it now parked up behind the portakabin reckon it needs to go in the compactor of course it does shame raymond did a beautiful job of cleaning it well raymond was a pro wasnt he george gave don a look as if to say and i thought you were too ive never shot anyone in my life george in the old days fists were enough maybe a bottle or a knife now and again these arent the old days george thought for another moment i need to talk to hanley make sure hes okay meantime you need to find your car and theres still that other little matter to be taken care of don nodded what about our bandit friend hes wounded maybe badly wounded hes got to have ended up in hospital george jabbed a finger at don so start making some calls then we pay him a visit george just nodded was raymond married is there someone we should send flowers to i dont know find out will you before or after the other matter george glowered at him what do you think no never mind what you think whoever was wearing that mask they knew the cash was being handed over that means its someone we know or someone hanley knows it means someone somewhere has blabbed or else got greedy it means theyre close don and if theyre close were going to have no trouble finding them don nodded his agreement thing is george he thought to himself you dont know how close when do we tell stewart he asked when im ready george snarled marching back towards his dogs and the portakabin don waited for another minute then headed in the same direction the german shepherds snarled and spat baring their teeth they were up on their back legs front legs off the ground and pawing at the air willing their studded collars to break don ignored them and headed for the bentley he didnt know whose car it was there was some dust on the windows and a bit of mud on the tyres plus some of raymonds blood and brain matter on the rightside wing a wipe would get rid of it or a hose if you wanted to be really careful but the inside of the car was clean immaculate in fact he considered his options but if he kept it it would be noted as missing and the cops would assume raymonds killer had taken it no gorgeous george was right it had to be turned into scrap shame though but don had plenty of other problems he knew he should be angry but all he really felt was sorrow there was no way out that was the truth of it no happy ending chapter three gravys story it took me a while to find her house i dont know that part of the city benjys car had one of those little mapreaders but i didnt know how to work it i can drive a car though not much different from dodgems benjys was an automatic those are the cars i can drive so i drove to her address the piece of paper was in the glove box why is it called that a glove box i tried it with my own gloves but they wouldnt fit without squashing them and i didnt want to do that but i found the piece of paper and it had her name on it plus her address she was called celine watts i stopped the car beside some kids on bikes and showed them her address they shook their heads then i tried at a bus stop and a man pointed up the road so then i got lost a few times but a woman on her way home from the shops told me exactly what to do right and right again i write with my right hand thats a good way to remember left from right ten merchant crescent was a council house on a council estate but there wasnt too much graffiti and no supermarket trolleys or burnedout cars it was quite nice really i parked the car by the kerb and had to work out how to use the hand brake then i walked up her path and pushed the bell i didnt hear any noise from inside so i tried again then i knocked instead and a voice called out from behind the door whos there it was a womans voice im gravy i called back ive come about benjy see the thing was i needed to tell someone i needed someone to know what i knew who benjy your friend benjy i dont have a friend called benjy i looked at the piece of paper it says celine watts its pronounced seleen she called out then the door opened an inch and i could see a bit of her face and one of her eyes who are you im gravy a pal of benjys look i held the paper up so she could read it it was in his car and now hes hes had a bit of an accident she stared hard at the piece of paper and then her eyes met mine who sent you she asked she sounded scared nobody sent me are you going to kill me no i think i sounded properly shocked you dont look like you are im not but i dont know anyone called benjy he had your name in his car i pushed the piece of paper closer to her so i see the door had opened another couple of inches i could see more of her now her hair was brown and short her face was round and shiny her eyes were green so this friend of yours called benjy he had my name and address in his car i nodded and she looked over my shoulder is that his car or yours she asked his i suppose you suppose well its not his usual car his usual car is green a bit like your eyes she almost smiled and whats happened to benjy the door was all the way open now hes not very well who is he whats his last name i dont know his last name do you work with him no i paused while i had a think i dont know where he works but he must have a job because he always has money then i corrected myself always had money i mean her eyes narrowed are you saying hes dead i sniffed and rubbed my nose i suppose so i said celine watts lifted the piece of paper from my fingers and you found this in his car yes but its not the car he usually drives she was looking over my shoulder again how did he die i dont know i think she could see that i was lying do you mind if i take a look a look at what a look at the car she squeezed past me leaving her door wide open i wanted to tell her that all the heat would escape it was the sort of thing my mum would say but instead i followed her she opened the passenger door area like this you should have locked it she said she was opening the glove box my gloves wouldnt fit i explained but she wasnt listening she took out a book and started turning its pages it had drawings of all the parts of the car but at the back there was another piece of paper folded in four she opened it up its a bill she said for fixing the car then she stopped speaking there was a gurgling sound in her throat her mouth stayed open gravy she said do you know a man called donald empson i shook my head is this his car i think so she said its his name on the bill and you know him she placed a hand to her chest as if to check her heartbeat warm heart cool head i know who he is she said quietly are you sure you dont know how your friend benjy died i think someone killed him tears were coming into my eyes i wiped them away he was a friend of yours yes i repeated it four more times for luck she seemed to be thinking about things staring into the distance then she turned her attention to the open door of her house police told me id be safe she said she shook her head slowly we stood together in silence for a minute and then she asked me what was in the bag it was on the floor in front of the passenger seat its not mine i said she was already unzipping it when she looked inside she saw my gloves first but then she saw what was beneath them and she placed the hand to her chest again its benjys money i explained i dont know what to do with it i was hoping youd be a friend of his she looked at me and then smiled it was a big beaming smile and it was followed by a laugh i am a friend of benjys she said taking my arm and squeezing it this was supposed to be my surprise she nodded towards the bag and now youve delivered it thank you gravy i was a bit confused the bags for you its money for my holiday i thought about it but it still wasnt clear it seemed all fuzzy in the middle i need to be going she was saying quite soon gravy she was looking at the open door again i just need to pack a few no maybe not i can buy whatever i need no passport though she bit her bottom lip passports at my flat is this not your house my cousins police called it a safe house fat lot they know ive only been here two days and don empsons got the address she looked around us suddenly fearful need to get out of here gravy she decided somewhere safe can you drive she realised what shed said and laughed a short laugh what am i saying you drove here didnt you i did i said so maybe you can give me a lift the bus stop i guessed but she shook her head edinburgh thats miles we could run out of petrol weve got money she said grabbing my arm again plenty of money remember my holiday money and with that she lifted out the bag then got into the car resting it on her lap are you going to leave the door open i asked pointing towards the house the heat will get out let it she snapped but she could see i wasnt happy the rooms need airing she explained place gets stuffy otherwise now come on she patted the driving seat i want your best jeremy clarkson impression who she sighed and rolled her eyes just get in and drive gravy i dont know edinburgh ive never been there well take the motorway dont worry you wont get lost her face went sad again unless you dont want to help a friend of benjys if you dont want to help me just say so but i did want to help her i wanted to see her smile again it was a good smile a smile like my mums okay i said chapter four don empson is hunting jim gardner was benjys best friend when don empson left him he was bleeding and weeping don didnt think jim knew anything about anything but hed asked him questions all the same who else did benjy know who might he go to for help and jim had done a lot of talking don felt bad about it felt hed worked out a lot of his own anger on gardner that was hardly professional don had been busy since leaving the scrapyard hed borrowed one of the cars it made noises that warned him it was dying you and me both hed told it in his case this was certainly true six months the hospital had told him maybe a year with treatment but his quality of life would suffer hed spend half his time on a trolley in the hospital corridor no thanks hed said just give me painkillers lots of painkillers there were some in his pocket right now but the only things that hurt were his knuckles jim gardner had told him there was this graveyard out by the old blocks of flats some bloke there benjy said he was useful he would hide things for him all sorts of things gardner didnt know the mans name but that didnt matter on his way to the graveyard don called his friend in the police for the price of a few drinks his friend would put out a call to all patrol cars they would keep their eyes open for dons car the one benjy had taken for another few drinks this same friend would ask all the hospitals in the area if anyone had been brought in wounded wounded the cop had asked dont worry don had told him its not anyone who didnt deserve it he didnt want to spook the cop but when don called from the car there was no news he reached the graveyard in twenty minutes it was even closer to raymonds garage maybe twelve or fifteen minutes no distance at all the gates were closed he got out and checked them they were held shut by a chain don peered through the bars but couldnt see any signs of life just signs of death he said to himself he had already planned his own funeral a cremation with music by johnny cash if he lived that long he thought of the compactor and had to shake the image away he looked around him there were some kids further up the hill gathered around a couple of bikes by a lamp post don drove towards them and stopped the car he got out again twenty pounds a fiver for each kid and he had some more information the guy who worked in the graveyard was called gravy he was not all there don listened and then described his own car there were nods then he described benjy more nods did you see the car leave the boys couldnt really remember until another twenty had changed hands never seen anything as funny in my life one of them said the others were smiling at the memory gravy trying to drive he burst out laughing and his friends joined in any idea where he was going they shook their heads and no sign of the other guy they shook their heads again don just nodded slowly and wondered if another twenty might help probably not so he saved his money and got back into the dying car could the money be in the graveyard could benjy be in the graveyard don turned the car around the boys were walking away they gave him a wave he waved back and pressed his foot a little harder on the pedal the car hit the gates and snapped the chain the gates flew open don kept driving aware that somewhere behind him the boys were cheering and clapping he did a circuit of the graveyard but couldnt see anything unusual he stopped the car and got out there was a hut but it was padlocked shut it had a window with wire mesh covering it he looked inside but there was no sign of life behind a hedge he found a digger and a wheelbarrow but nothing else he stood there in the darkness scratching his head and that was what he was doing when the police car arrived it took him an hour to talk his way out of it they took him to the police station the desk sergeant knew who he was and didnt believe his story some kids joyriders smashing their way through the gates and then running off don empson concerned citizen completely innocent checking the scene i wanted to make sure they hadnt damaged anything so the cars not yours sir never seen it in my life when they let him go he breathed the cold night air and took his phone out of his pocket nothing else for it he would have to bring in sam and eddie they always travelled together theyd been best pals since primary school nutters the pair of them but that wasnt really the problem problem was he couldnt let them know what he knew he couldnt let them know benjy was the shooter because benjy was family he was dons family his nephew and if don didnt get to him first the lad was as good as dead always supposing he wasnt dead already don felt a stabbing pain in his stomach he rubbed at it for all the good that would do benjy you bloody idiot no happy ending he thought back to the garage how it had taken him a couple of seconds to recognise benjys build and voice hed been on the point of saying something when the first shot had rung out and afterwards just for a moment benjys wide scared eyes had met his then hed screwed his eyes shut chest wound should don have stopped him driving off should he have called out let me get you to a doctor probably the question now was had benjy known it would be his uncle in charge of the cash if so hed gambled either that he wouldnt be recognised or that don wouldnt grass him up big gamble it came down to that moment of eye contact there had been no surprise there so benjy had expected don and furthermore had expected to be clocked by him happy to land his uncle in the mire cuts both ways lad don said to the night air rubbing his stomach again chapter five stewart renshaws casino stewart renshaw was in one of his casinos when he got a call from his brother george he said into the phone did everything go as planned the silence on the other end of the line was enough of an answer stewarts face tightened and he decided the gaming floor was too public there were only a few punters in but it was still early not quite midnight he pushed open a door marked private and entered a hallway used by the staff there was nobody around talk to me george he said there was a bit of trouble gorgeous george finally owned up someone came in with a gun shot raymond and took the cash is raymond all right funeral job stewart leaned against the door and closed his eyes what about hanley nobody else got hurt except the shooter is he dead too raymond shot him in the chest he wont get far but hes got my money yes and you told me it was a piece of cake stewart hissed dont tell me you sent sam and eddie don empson hes well past his sellby date dad always liked him dads in the past george all of thats in the past stewart ran a hand through his hair trying to think he was tall and thin and didnt look at all like george this had led him to wonder had their mum had an affair george looked like their dad but not stewart bit late to do anything about it but all the same it might explain a few things so what are you going to do he asked check the hospitals shooter took dons car so were looking for that too but can you talk to hanley see how hes doing ill talk to him but dont forget its my money george someones got to pay okay stewart is the club busy tonight dead itll get better stewart wanted to slap his brother wanted to punch him in his soft fat face but he wouldnt he was a proper businessman these days he had to keep his distance from everything in his past he had to stay clean he ended the call and gave the nearest wall a couple of butts with his head what did he do now phone hanley or visit him in person how could he visit him when his driver hadnt turned up for work yet and besides the whole point of using georges guys for the handover was so he himself could steer clear of hanley it was cleaner that way if a job needs doing he muttered to himself he went to the main office and asked if anyone had seen benjy flowers there were shrugs and shakes of the head as useless as his bloody uncle don then to the room soon as he gets here send him along leaving the room stewart reached into his pocket for his phone the home of councillor andrew hanley andrew hanley was back home seated in a chair in his darkened study with a glass of whisky in one hand he still had the shakes his wife was downstairs when hed come home shed called to him from the kitchen hed called back but made his way up the stairs and into his study closing the door after him when the door was closed she wouldnt come in it meant he was working the only light came from the lamp post directly outside the window he could see his desk covered with paperwork his degree was framed on the wall so were photos of him meeting important people people from sports and tv and business as a city dignitary he got to meet lots of people but he wished now that hed never met stewart renshaw it had all been very friendly at first very sociable he accepted an invite to dinner at one of stewarts casinos he accepted some free gaming chips then there was another visit and more chips the place seemed well run it wasnt full of gangsters or lowlifes it was respectable okay so stewart was albert renshaws son and alberts nickname had been the godfather but stewart had washed his hands clean of all that he never saw his kid brother george spoke to him twice a year stewart was above board or seemed so at first there had been a day at the races again as stewarts guest bring the wife hed been told but hed lied and said she was busy he wanted an adventure all of his own he met goodlooking women he met friendly and powerful men he had a good time once he was offered drugs a snort of cocaine in the toilets but he refused champagne was quite enough for him back then it had all seemed enough his phone started to vibrate he lifted it from his pocket and looked at the screen it was stewart hanley decided not to answer what was he going to say to the man it had crossed his mind that the whole thing was a setup some sort of play being acted out so as to cheat him out of the money but the guns and the blood had seemed real the fear and the anger had seemed real not just special effects but blood and smoke and the flash from the two guns and such loud bangs three of them hed run to his car hitting another vehicle as he reversed at speed he had fled the scene of a crime the scene of a murder him councillor andrew hanley head of planning and now this no he would not answer his phone he would not speak to stewart renshaw he would drink his whisky and stare at the wall then his wife called to him from the bottom of the stairs andrew he didnt answer andrew but then that might make her suspicious andrew what is it your shoes yes his shoes he had left them just inside the front door it was one of lornas rules no shoes in the house what about them did you step in something some red stuff red stuff yes red stuff blood blood blood its paint he called out to her thats all just some paint shall i try cleaning it off no ill do it ill do it later there was silence from downstairs then do you want any supper i just want to be left alone is that too much to ask this time the silence had no end hanley tried to lift the remains of the whisky to his mouth but his hand was shaking too much chapter six don empson is still hunting sam was driving eddie was in the seat next to him don sat in the back not saying much he had explained that he wanted to visit raymonds garage well not visit it exactly just cruise past it as they turned into the narrow back street eddie cleared his throat and said a single word cops three patrol cars had formed a roadblock tape was being strung between lamp posts a couple of white vans were parked a team emerging from them they wore overalls and carried face masks the forensics crew a uniformed cop was making signals with his hand sam nodded and did a uturn what do you want to do he asked lets check some of the other streets don told him what happened at raymonds eddie asked somebody shot him don explained eddie whistled but didnt say anything sam met dons eyes in the rearview mirror but didnt say anything either they drove in silence cruising up one street and down another workshops and offices then some tenements with shops below there was no one about but don knew that soon the police would be knocking on doors armed with their questions shots had been heard someone had rung he remembered that he had another piece of business the middle of the night might be a good time for it but first he had to keep his eyes open he was looking for a car a green sports car benjys car and eventually he saw it it was parked two streets away from the garage there was a halffilled skip next to it he managed not to look too interested he didnt want sam and eddie knowing more than they needed to know benjys plan grab the money and run back to the car benjys plan hadnt worked out don knew that the police would spot the car eventually or someone would draw it to their attention after which they could run a quick check and come up with the name benjamin flowers they would ask benjys mother dons sister what benjy did for a living and she would tell them he works for stewart renshaw stewart brother of george and then george would know and he would blame it all on don giving benjy a job had been a favour to don someone would have to pay for that don would have to pay he had gone through a whole range of emotions anger at benjy then sadness and finally acceptance stuff happened you just had to deal with it as best you could but right now he didnt know what would count as best as sam took a right turn don leaned forward and told him there was a new destination merchant crescent im going to have a word with someone he added guess what her name is sam was the first to twig celine watts got it in one are we going to whack her eddie asked would that be wise don snapped back and besides you are going nowhere near her like i said im going to have a quiet word thats all see if i can persuade her to change her story sam was looking at him in the mirror again thanks mr empson he said the one you should be thanking is gorgeous george sam nodded slowly he knew the score the pair of them had been spotted in a car park next to woodland on the edge of the city there had been another man in the car with them and hed been crying according to the witness the witness was celine watts the crying man was a smalltime pusher whod been warned before his body had been found in the woods in too shallow a grave leaving gorgeous george three options option one hang sam and eddie out to dry option two get them off the hook option three bump them off so far it had been option two the streets were quiet it only took them half an hour eddie stopped the car next to the kerb and don started to get out do you need us eddie asked not on your life don pulled on a pair of black leather gloves and walked up the path when he got to the front door he noticed that it was open a couple of inches there were lights on inside he pushed at the door and stepped into the narrow hallway the first door led to the living room music was playing and he could smell smoke a woman was lying on the sofa her feet bare she was moving her toes in time to the music there was an empty bottle of lemonade on the floor next to a bottle of vodka she was flicking ash from her cigarette into the palm of her hand she was not celine watts youre not celine he said she showed no surprise at his arrival her eyes were glassy she blew some smoke towards him her cousin she explained sofas supposed to be where she sleeps there was a sleeping bag rolled up under the womans head only shes done a runner left the front door wide open and everything lucky nobody nicked my stereo maybe shes with the police don said are you not the police she watched him shake his head then concentrated on her cigarette again neighbour saw her driving away in a flash car a black shiny car looked official what did the driver look like the woman shrugged dons bmw the one benjy had taken was black and some people would call it flash it was a series and this address was in the glove box had benjy come here to warn celine watts unlikely the state hed have been in and anyway the kids on the street had told him it was the guy called gravy gravy panicking at the sight of benjy covered in blood gravy finding the address and assuming it to be a safe house of sorts finding celine watts instead gravy with dons car with celine watts with stewarts money where would she go he asked the cousin her eyelids were drooping far away from here if shes got any sense don knew he would have to call his pal at the cop shop again and ask him to widen the search did she take all her stuff he asked the cousin she shook her head didnt take anything her bag purse phone toothbrush theyre all still here this is even her vodka im drinking as she reached down for her glass the little collection of cigarette ash fell from her hand cheers she said then she lost her balance rolled off the sofa and landed on the floor laughing don ignored her and opened the shoulder bag on the coffee table celine watts purse was inside along with aspirin and paper hankies and a phone why hadnt she taken anything because shed been scared and besides she had everything she needed in the car a driver and a small mountain of cash the cousin was still chuckling quietly to herself eyes closed he knew that if he beat her up it would send a message to celine watts the sort of message gorgeous george would thank him for all the same don didnt have the heart for it he pocketed celines purse and phone and walked back to the waiting car chapter seven the detective jane harris had been a detective inspector for all of three weeks and here she was standing in a garage with pools of blood at her feet pools plural the cold dead victim was called raymond masters it was his garage he cleaned cars for a living or had done until about four hours ago that was how long it had taken them to locate the source of the gunshots a gun had been found in the dead mans hand and it had been fired it wasnt suicide though two shots had been fired by masters one bullet had already been located stuck in the wall to the lefthand side of the doors one had done some damage to another human if the bloodstains were to be believed there were big dollops of the stuff masters had suffered a shot to the head there should have been a spray of blood and brain matter but cars had been parked here probably two of them judging by the tyre marks jane harris had asked one of her team to look in masters office he would have bookings she wanted to know which car or cars he had been working on maybe someone had wanted them cars got stolen all the time didnt they but carjackers didnt normally resort to guns and why had the garage owner carried a gun of his own her colleague bob sanders had a different theory bob had been on the force for almost as long as jane had been alive she trusted him when he mentioned the name george renshaw explain was all she said folding her arms raymond might look clean these days but in the past he was a bit of a lad ran with albert renshaws crew albert was georges dad raymonds done time inside word is that hes still friends with gorgeous george and i can see why hed be useful george might sometimes have a car that needs cleaning i thought he got rid of them at his scrapyard maybe bob left her to think about it he knew she would think about it the guy whod been wounded someone would know a doctor or hospital an allnight supermarket where he could buy compresses and bandages someone would know or he could be nearby hiding biding his time maybe in a garden or a flat he could have burst his way in jane knew that the first few hours were crucial knew that the trail started to go cold after that she needed people to go knocking on doors she needed at least a couple of sniffer dogs one member of the forensic team was taking a photo of a footprint the footprint was bloody it got fainter as it neared the garage doors the wounded man no because hed been twelve feet further away but the pool of blood vanished too there were no signs that it led outside so one man heading outside one man taking a car had they been partners or was one a bystander might be a car theft after all another detective said emerging from the office full valet this afternoon on a big bentley they cost a hundred grand plus owners numbers in the diary ive just talked to him he was picking the car up in the morning put out a call jane said let everyone know the registration box of chocolates for the first one who spots it and a hug and a kiss from yourself jane bob joked unless youre the winner she told him another officer had appeared from the forecourt parked car recently damaged maybe by the getaway vehicle get forensics on to it jane said an hour later she was heading back to hq her boss had been woken up and was on his way there from his home he would want a report she would ask him for more officers he would start doing the sums everything cost money and even murder came with a budget attached jane parked in an empty bay just as a police van was drawing up people were singing inside drunks probably on their way to a night in the cells she pushed open the door to the police station and went in the desk sergeant nodded and waved busy night he guessed you heard about the shooting he nodded thought it was funny actually she stared at him funny odd i mean you know that ray masters has links to george renshaw bob told me the desk sergeant smiled well bob knows everything doesnt he meaning i dont youre a quick learner though maam so tell me this whos don empson she walked towards him no idea she confessed only we had him in here a few hours back patrol car picked him up in a graveyard he spun them a story and we had to let him go so who is he then jane asked hes george renshaws righthand man thats who jane at the graveyard as soon as it was daylight jane drove to the graveyard the gates had been broken open a chain and padlock lay on the ground next to them the car was parked over towards a workmans hut empson had said it wasnt his fair enough if he was telling the truth his fingerprints wouldnt be all over the inside shed got the licence plate number from the officers whod found empson the computer had come up with an owners name and address but the car had been sold by this man for spare parts sold to george renshaw now wasnt that a coincidence it wasnt much of a car the paintwork was the only thing holding it together she pushed a finger against an area of rust and the finger went straight through she wiped the finger clean and took a walk around the graveyard the grass was damp with dew birds were singing she could count the number of clouds in the sky she checked her watch she had woken up someone from the council and asked them who would be in charge of the graveyard he would meet her here by now he should have been here she kept walking behind a hedge she found a compost heap there was a digger too and a wheelbarrow with a rake in it the wheelbarrow had stains on it not rust this time but something more like blood jane made a note to herself get forensics down here they could check the car at the same time maybe thered be blood there too as she continued her walk she saw that back towards the gates the grass was stained she crouched down again it looked like blood someone had dripped blood along here someone wounded she retraced her steps taking more care this time she was looking for evidence she was looking for something like a fresh grave a sniffer dog might help then she saw the man standing at the gates he was examining them and shaking his head he saw her and started walking towards her hands in pockets there was a bag on his shoulder maybe it contained his work clothes and packed lunch jane introduced herself paul mason he said shaking her hand a carjacking was it boy racers a man in his late fifties actually at least thats what we think can i take a look inside your shed mason nodded and led the way he unlocked the shed and pulled open the door nothings missing he said what time did you leave work yesterday mr mason usual time five oclock do you work here alone ive got an assistant i call him gravy gravy short for graveyard he was always hanging around this place never seen someone so pleased to be offered a job was he here when you left mason nodded again its his job to tidy up and lock the gates so what time would he finish work mason laughed hed be here all hours if you let him gravy lives in a hostel they sometimes have to come and fetch him time doesnt seem to mean anything to him mason paused hes not in trouble is he ill need to talk to him can you give me his address hell be here in an hour or so hes mad keen to get started in the morning ill still need his address it was in a folder in the hut along with a telephone number jane punched the number into her phone it took a while before anyone answered she realised she didnt know gravys real name can i talk to gravy please she asked the sleepysounding man went away but was back within thirty seconds his beds not been slept in he said ending the call jane stared at her phone mason asked if she was all right fine she assured him she wasnt so sure about gravy though whats his real name she asked mason jimmy gray gray and gravy not so very different when you think about it he didnt go home last night she watched to see what kind of reaction she would get mason just made an o shape with his lips do you know a man called donald empson she asked mason shook his head how about george renshaw everyone knows him at least by reputation she nodded and wandered back in the direction of the car it didnt belong to empson so why had he been driving it and what kind of car did he usually drive jane reckoned it was time she had a word with mr donald empson when she drove out to his home however the place was empty the curtains looking as if they hadnt been shut the previous night no sign of a car it was a nice house detached modern husbands in suits were passing in the road just starting to go to work they must have wondered what she was up to but none bothered to ask jane got back into her own car and decided on her next stop renshaws scrapyard jane at the scrapyard a trailer was delivering two cars when she arrived they had been involved in a crash of some kind bonnets crumpled radiator grilles smashed windscreens shattered she had been to plenty of accidents in her time it was one of the worst things about the job she gave a little shiver as she followed the convoy into the yard there were a couple of dogs barking nearby but she couldnt see them all she could see were dead cars but then a man emerged from one of the buildings he was chewing on a cigar there was a scowl on his face as he neared the car he had a shaved head and gold rings on his fingers jane got out to meet him i can smell bacon a mile off he growled you must be mr renshaw havent seen you before im di harris bit young he looked her up and down another man had emerged from the same building he wore torn jeans and a red tartan shirt he gave jane a little whistle as he walked towards a nearby crane i wonder if i can talk to donald empson she told renshaw hes not here do you know where i could find him at home maybe ive just come from there jane was staring at him the nickname gorgeous was obviously a joke he was one of the ugliest customers shed ever met whats this all about he asked he had moved the cigar to a corner of his mouth and bit down hard on it a routine inquiry renshaw rolled his eyes how many times had he heard the same line the cranes motor was coughing into life will he be here later jane shouted over the noise renshaw just shrugged can i ask you what kind of car he drives isnt that the sort of thing your computers can tell you easier if i ask you thats what you think renshaw gave a grin jane could feel that her phone was vibrating in her pocket she took it out and held it to her ear pushing a finger into her other ear to block out the noise it was bob got some news he said go ahead doortodoor got lucky they were talking to one of the neighbours and he asked them if they could do anything about the car that was blocking his skip hes got a lorry coming this morning and it needs space so it can haul the skip away with you so far jane had turned away from renshaw so she could concentrate on the call well the neighbour doesnt recognise the car its bright green some sort of sports model its legally parked and most times we wouldnt bother but this particular team is sharper than most they ran a check car belongs to mr benjamin flowers dont tell me you know him im better than any computer jane and im looking forward to that box of chocolates soft centres only please im on my way to buy them just as soon as you tell me who he is hes known as benjy hes don empsons nephew and he works for stewart renshaw guess whose brother he is jane raised her eyes towards the sky it was hard to take it all in she saw that george renshaw was looking up too there was a huge magnet hanging from the arm of the crane a large car swung from it and though she could see mostly its underside and wheels she thought she recognised the make ignoring renshaw and still holding her phone to her ear she marched towards the crane shut it off she yelled the driver ignored her she stuffed her phone back in her pocket and lifted out her warrant card opening it and holding it up in front of the crane im ordering you to shut it off she yelled then turning towards renshaw tell him renshaw hesitated then waved a hand the crane driver saw him and stopped the arm jane had just turned back to renshaw when there was an explosion next to her the car had landed not five feet from her dust and stones flew up the cars windows blew out its tyres burst on impact with the ground her eyes blazed as she turned towards the crane operator thought thats what you wanted he yelled her hand was shaking a little as she took out her phone again she hadnt ended the call and bob was asking what all the noise was i need a forensics team at renshaws scrapyard she told him as she circled what remained of the car quite a lot of it remained actually they made bentleys to last she was relieved that shed idd it correctly and now that she could see it the licence plate matched the car taken from raymond masters the murdered mans garage she wondered whose prints would be inside she wondered what else might be in there nothing that she could see but there was always the boot so thats one forensics team still busy at the garage bob was saying another wanted at the graveyard and a third at the scrapyard tall order jane and while youre at it how about checking the whereabouts of mr flowers is that my quota for the day jane didnt answer she was just realising that renshaw had disappeared back into his office she headed after him walking into a single chaotic room at the far end of which was another door the door was open it led out into the scrapyard when she went through it a couple of guard dogs started snarling and straining against their leashes they hadnt barked for their owner they knew him too well george renshaw was gone she cursed under her breath and started to search the scrapyard he could be hiding anywhere but she reckoned he wasnt that stupid he was on foot though so she could follow in her car but she couldnt leave the scene the bentley might vanish into thin air just like renshaw had done or prints could be wiped clean evidence removed she got bob on the phone again donald empsons car she told him i need its details hang on ill start a fresh list she could hear bob sighing as he made a note to himself will that be all not quite george renshaw has just done a runner on me ill put the word out seems to me we might need some extra help ill take it up with the boss you think gorgeous george had raymond killed im beginning to wonder with don empson pointing the gun or the nephew maybe jane didnt answer she had reached in through a broken window and removed the bentleys ignition key walking to the back of the car she took a deep breath before unlocking the boot it was empty no visible traces of blood and none that she could see on the steering wheel or either of the front seats in fact recent damage aside it was pristine yet the shooter had lost blood hadnt he and empson had sported no injuries when hed been taken to the police station then there was the graveyard the man called gravy and his bed not slept in it didnt add up just tell forensics to get a move on she said into the phone chapter eight gravys story i liked the room it was so clean i almost didnt want to touch anything after all none of it really belonged to me celine was different she was wearing the white robe from the bathroom and a pair of white slippers shed used the shower and opened the minibar not that we were sharing a room mind separate rooms but with a door between them adjoining rooms the woman on the desk downstairs had said this was one of the capitals most deluxe hotels it had a swimming pool and something called a spa it had big televisions and a kettle and an iron and ironing board it had magazines and a bowl of fruit on the table id fallen asleep on my sofa hadnt even managed to make it as far as the bed when i woke up celine had been out shopping shed bought a clean shirt and trousers for me the trousers were a bit too long but fine at the waist the shirt was fine too she told me i could stay for a day or two just until i make my plans but i wasnt to speak to anyone or phone anyone or go outside or anything just pretend youre on holiday the view from my window was like something from a film a big street and then edinburgh castle there was a bar and a restaurant downstairs but celine said i was to phone room service meals in your room gravy dont want anyone seeing you i got the feeling that was why she kept the door between our rooms open she was keeping an eye on me she told me not to get any funny ideas okay i said id already drunk all the tea and coffee in my room she let me take some of hers the red bag was in the wardrobe in her room she said she would give me some money before we split up benjys car was in the hotel garage one of the hotel people had asked if i wanted it cleaned id shaken my head sure i was definitely sure sure sure sure sure five times for luck celine was lying along her sofa drinking another of the tiny bottles from her minibar it was still morning i wondered what my boss would be thinking i wondered about the people i shared my house with i had jobs that needed doing i would lose a days pay my gloves were still in the car what if someone broke in and stole them i didnt even have the keys one of the hotel people had kept them that was bad now that i thought about it i stood in the doorway staring at celine she was watching tv people were in a room and they were shouting at each other there was a man with a microphone who didnt seem to be helping i need to fetch something from the car i told her what my gloves theyre on the seat in the back what do you need them for i just do no you dont i do she looked at me then sighed ill come with you you dont need to give me five minutes to get dressed there were half a dozen big bags on the bed all the clothes shed bought i nodded and went back into my room in fact it took her more like fifteen minutes she had put on some makeup and some perfume she looked and smelled nice make sure you bring your key she said on our way down in the lift she told me she wanted me to know something just in case anything happens to me whats going to happen nothing i hope train to london but theyll be watching the stations wont they theres a boat from rosyth to the continent but id need a passport im not sure yet gravy theres got to be some place hasnt there lots of places i agreed somewhere ill be safe people want to hurt me gravy what people well maybe not hurt me maybe just scare me the lift doors opened and we got out she didnt say anything else she asked the man behind the desk for the car key well bring the car round madam no we just need to get something so he went off and came back with the key bay twelve madam we started walking again out of the hotel and across a sort of courtyard the car park was on the other side of this it was concrete several storeys high celine started talking again i saw something i shouldnt have gravy i was out walking by brigham woods do you know where that is edge of the city i was trying to clear my head a boyfriend had dumped me fair enough it happens but hed taken up with someone i knew someone i thought was a pal and how could i ask them ask them what how long it had been going on a walk is good when you want to think i agreed bad timing though there was a car see three men in it i got a good look at them couple of days later its in the papers body found in brigham woods so i went to the cops i was just i dunno i just thought how amazing to be part of that to know something that could change everything do you know what i mean maybe we were walking up the slope into the car park it was dim in there there were numbers on the floor bay twelve we wanted i could id the men you see and it turns out one of them was the victim and the other two work for a man called george renshaw hes a villain gravy and his secondincommand is called don empson the police showed me their photographs it was sort of too late by then even though i knew i was in deep i tried telling them i couldnt be sure not a hundred per cent sure i said i wasnt going to testify in court but they kept on at me then they told me it might be best if i moved out of my flat for a while i knew what that meant it meant they were on to me who renshaw and empson plus the other two the ones id idd and the thing is theres no way im going to go to court cops would have to drag me there screaming well then i said trying to comfort her thats all right then just tell them that right she said giving me another of her looks then she pointed heres the car don empsons car i still cant work out how your pal benjy got hold of it he was your pal too i reminded her she gave a little twitch of the mouth go get your precious gloves she said clicking the button to make the locks snap open shed turned her back arms folded head bowed i think she was feeling sorry for herself i could see my gloves but when i reached into the car i felt beneath the drivers seat until i found what i was really looking for the blue plastic bag the balaclava came out too but i pushed it back into hiding i placed my gloves in the bag and closed the door after me happy now she asked happy i agreed she had her mind on other things all the way back to our rooms not once did she ask where the blue bag had come from chapter nine bob sanders meets a bent cop bob sanders didnt like visiting other cop shops he always felt he was being judged by his fellow officers he knew what they might be seeing a guy close to retirement a guy on his way to the scrapheap a guy who should have done better but bob knew he was good at his job the only reason he hadnt been promoted was that he had made enemies if he didnt like you he told you so to your face if he didnt like your way of running things he told you to your face not everybody was happy with that hed been on the force for years so was well known if not always well liked he pushed open the door of the cop shop and walked up to the desk pressed the bell to let someone know he was there when they arrived he showed them his warrant card and asked to speak to detective sergeant connolly ds connolly didnt invite him up to the cid office he came downstairs to meet him instead connolly was in his early thirties and looked tough but jaded the sort of officer who should have found himself a different job being a cop had become too easy connolly shook bobs hand and asked him what the problem was youre assuming its a problem bob said with a thin smile when isnt it connolly asked if they could move outside the day was bright and windy on the pavement he lit a cigarette bob had turned down the offer of one bob stood there waiting for connolly to get comfortable but that wasnt going to happen im interested in a bmw bob said i asked the comms centre to send out the licence number and guess what they told me they said it had already been done i found that a bit odd so i asked them when why and who last night it turns out and the one asking was you ds connolly connolly inhaled some smoke and held it there releasing it down his nostrils he gave a shrug by way of an answer im assuming you know bob went on that the car in question is owned by a man called donald empson it might tie him to a shooting at a garage yesterday but the team only just got hold of that while you seem to have a crystal ball tucked away somewhere bob paused but connolly was still concentrating on the cigarette now unless you want me going higher up with this and by higher up i mean all the way to the top i want to hear your side of the story might be we can keep it between ourselves might be you wont lose your job and your pension it was the sort of threat bob knew connolly would react to the man puffed out his cheeks before speaking it was a favour who for don empson bob watched as connolly nodded so someones taken his car and he wants it back did he mention the shooting he said there might be someone wounded the guy in the garage is dead i think he meant whoever has his car and you kept this to yourself bob got right into connollys face youre worse than they are do you know that connolly met the stare ive known it for years he said flicking away the remains of the cigarette and heading back into the cop shop bob took out his phone and called jane with the news councillor hanleys house lorna hanley had woken up that morning at seven her husband andrew wasnt in the bed putting on her dressing gown she opened the door of his study a couple of inches and found him in his chair asleep in his clothes his mobile phone was beeping telling him he had messages his neck was at an awkward angle and she knew he would be stiff when he woke up downstairs she made tea for herself and unloaded the dishwasher there were only two weetabix left so she made a note to buy more then dumped the empty packet in the bin the bin was nearly full so she hauled out the bag and tied it in a knot replacing it with a fresh one this was supposed to be andrews job and like so many of andrews jobs she always ended up doing it herself she had the radio playing as she ate breakfast there was a report about another shooting there were so many of them these days in the city a garage owner was dead the report stated that one or more assailants might be on the run and injured she tutted and unlocked the kitchen door taking the bin bag with her when she opened the garden bin she saw that there was a pair of shoes inside they were andrews shoes his perfectly good shoes well perfect apart from the paint but paint could be removed she had shopping to do and reckoned she could find a shoe repair shop maybe theyd be able to help she placed the shoes in a carrier bag and decided to put them in the car so she wouldnt forget she had started to forget things which was why lists were such a good idea youve too much on your plate girl she told herself but when she went out front to the car she saw that there was a dent to the back bumper no wonder andrew had been in a mood last night someone had banged into his beloved jaguar she tutted again and unlocked the doors yesterdays newspaper was on the passenger seat she swapped it for the shoes and took it into the house with her ready for recycling but andrew had scrawled something in the margin of the front page maybe it was important she placed her glasses on her nose and read the message raymonds garage pm empsoncash lorna hanley stared at the words as though they were written in some foreign language she heard a noise in the doorway andrew was standing there rubbing at his face you were there she told him her voice trembling you were at that garage the one where the man was shot he blinked at her his mouth opened and then closed itself again husband and wife locked eyes for a few moments she was ready to hear his denial but instead he turned and ran leaving the front door wide open she watched him go she even stepped outside to see where he might be heading but he was gone back indoors she finished her cup of tea staring at nothing in particular then she lifted the telephone other wives might not do it but shed been brought up differently she knew it was the right thing hello she said into the receiver police chapter ten gorgeous george phones his brother stewart is that you who else would it be whats the matter gorgeous george renshaw was out of breath hed managed to flee the scrapyard and disappear into the maze of streets nearby he knew he had to talk to his lawyer but for some reason hed called his brother instead he was heading towards a café he knew it was only two blocks further up the hill are you walking stewart sounded amazed a cop came to see me so so she recognised one of the cars don took it from raymonds i was just getting rid of it so it ties don to the scene of the shooting and me with him all you have to say is that you dont know anything about it don empson came to you with a car he wanted turned into scrap you know him of old so you felt you had to oblige thats good george said quietly he knew now why he had called stewart stewart was always the one with the ideas so now ive done you a favour maybe you can do one for me and get my money back from whoever took it dons on the case of course he is until the cops pull him in george had reached the café its door opened with a little ping of a bell the owner knew him nodded and smiled george took the table by the window phone still pressed to his ear where is he anyway stewart was asking his nephews still not turned up for work there was the sound of another phone ringing at stewarts end he told george to hang on while he took it george stared out of the window wondering how the world could look the same as always when his own personal universe was exploding it was less than a minute before stewart came on again that was the cops he said they want to know where they can find benjy hes not turned up yet no stewart fell silent until george began to fear the connection had been lost but then he heard his brother exhale loudly hold on a second stewart said how did the cops find you george how come they put two and two together so fast i dont know don left the car with you next thing you know the cops are on to it meantime nobodys seen benjy since yesterday lunchtime do you see what im getting at its don what is the cash a little retirement present to himself hes been wanting out of the firm ever since the old man died so he sets the whole thing up goes to hand over the cash but has benjy waiting in the wings don wouldnt do that georges head was spinning a mug of strong tea had appeared on the table and he ladled sugar into it more ended up on the table than in the mug come on george think about it stewart was saying george was trying to think it wasnt easy there was a hissing noise in his ears and his heart was pumping don hadnt tried stopping the shooter don hadnt gone after him don had left the bentley for george to get rid of don was out there somewhere with sam and eddie you really think oh yes stewart really thought do you have any idea where he is now going after celine watts hes got sam and eddie with him and who are they working for george you or don theyre my guys then tell them to bring don in well have a few words with him see what he has to

again youll get your money back stewart i know i will little brother i know i will bob sanders has news for jane bob sanders was on the phone to jane again where are you he asked her just leaving the scrapyard so a team turned up then at long last yes any news on empson and his bmw no but listen to this a woman decided to call that is strange her husband is andrew hanley hes on the council in fact

appearance maybe mr hanley can fill us in where is he now well according to his wife he fled the house when she confronted him im guessing it may tie in with some other calls weve been getting about a man no jacket and no shoes running hell for leather through murison park is a patrol car on its way there yes what would i do without you bob save a fortune on confectionery he answered don empson is in trouble sam and eddie were hungry they were almost always hungry that was why theyd pulled into a layby on the ring road there was a snack van parked there don empson could smell fried onions best burgers in the city eddie had said despite which don had said he wasnt hungry he swallowed another three pills instead washing them down with water from a bottle his stomach was on fire try to keep your stress levels down at work the doctors had advised some chance hed bought the water when theyd stopped for petrol he had tried phoning his police contact again but connolly hadnt picked up dead ends everywhere he looked he hoped benjy was holed up somewhere and being looked after it was dons own fault the boy had never been right for the job there had always been little plans and notions quickmoney schemes more than once don had covered his nephews backside there were gambling debts poker games gone wrong and expensive girlfriends to go with that flash car he drove weekends in fivestar hotels wrong all of it dons own fault the best he could hope for was to get the money back pronto then try to smuggle benjy out of the country that was the only option or else he was dead meat this was what don was thinking as he stared out through the windscreen sam and eddie were chomping their way through the burgers kicking at stones laughing about something not a care in the world so it seemed when dons phone rang he reached into his pocket for it he was wrong not his phone hers he reached into his other pocket he didnt recognise the number on the screen he knew better than to answer his voice might scare off whoever was on the other end instead he let the phone ring and when it stopped he waited until the screen told him he had missed call followed a few moments later by new message don punched the numbers and pressed the phone to his ear it was celine watts voice she was calling her own phone donna she began meaning her cousin obviously look i hope you get this your own phones out of credit sorry i ran off like that but i just want you to know im all right ive got to get away for a bit thats all came into some cash too but relax ill see you get some dons fingers tightened around the phone he knew whose money it was anyway just wanted you to know ill call you again once i know where im going take care an electronic voice replaced celines message ends don stared at the phones screen and then punched some numbers in the same numbers that had come up when celine made the call a switchboard answered mansion park hotel how may i direct your call don thought about that question for a second then he decided i just need your address he said slapping his hand against the horn letting sam and eddie know playtime was over but sam was holding up one finger he had a call of his own and needed to answer it he spoke a couple of words then did a lot of listening not that don empson noticed he was too busy jotting down the details of the hotel when sam got back into the driving seat first thing he said was weve got to head back to base no way don argued ive just got celine watts address really yes really and it means were going to edinburgh sam seemed to hesitate boss wants us back home don was shaking his head he took out his own phone and punched in gorgeous georges number started talking as soon as the call was answered george i know where celine watts is and i think shes got the bag there was silence for a moment is that a fact don george didnt sound right somehow don found himself frowning whats the matter he asked youre coming back here don few questions that need answering dons heart sank look george i can fix this really i can so wheres the money mansion park hotel in edinburgh celine watts has it have you been drinking don her name and address were in my car guy called gravy ended up with it and thought watts had to be a friend of don choked back the final word friend of benjys george said yes don muttered the truth was finally out you saying this was his idea and not yours george was asking its nothing to do with me the boys will bring you back here don and we can sort it all out don didnt know what to say to that george was asking him to pass the phone to sam he did as he was told he could hear what george was saying they were to take don to a pub george owned put him in the cellar keep an eye on him george would be along later just as soon as ive checked out his story sam started the car something you want to tell us he asked don passing his phone back to him don pocketed it not your business lads but celine watts most definitely is i thought youd want her stopped shes on the run with a wedge of cash if we dont set off after her right now thats not what the boss wants don he isnt always right you know sam nodded slowly all the same all the same don knew which way the car would go they were heading back towards glasgow and a showdown chapter eleven jane and bob share information patrol cars were on the hunt for george renshaw his usual lawyer had been told that the police wanted a word but jane knew that if renshaw wanted to disappear he would find it easy in the short term at least she was back at the station andrew hanley was in an interview room hed been reluctant to say anything until told about the bloodstained shoes and the damage to his car it would be a simple enough matter to match any flecks of paint to the car hed reversed into on the garage forecourt then there was the newspaper with the meeting jotted down on it i want to talk to my solicitor hanley had stated head in hands a cold cup of coffee on the table in front of him your wifes in the next room mr hanley do you want a word with her too bob and jane met in the corridor they had big smiles for one another im going to be willy wonka by the end of this bob said jane patted his arm were not out of the woods yet no but were getting there he held up a slip of paper the list of tasks she had given him initial forensic report same fingerprints on the bentley and the car in the graveyard probably don empsons but thatll take a bit longer to confirm blood and brain matter on one wing of the bentley raymonds im pretty sure and by the way the bentleys owners not too happy with the valet job jane smiled and folded her arms knowing there was more to come bob checked his list again blood in the graveyard is the same group as one of the pools in the garage again were waiting for a dna match but no blood in the graveyard car no and none inside either the bentley or benjamin flowers abandoned sportster bob shook his head but benjys employer says hes gone awol our wounded gunman missing along with some cash and empsons bmw find one and we probably find all three what about this guy who works at the graveyard how does he fit in bob shrugged maybe he doesnt but a pound to a penny says it comes down to stewart renshaw janes eyes narrowed how so word is hes got a new casino looking for planning permission has he now jane thought for a moment but hes on the straight and narrow isnt he weve never had proof to the contrary if thats what you mean bob pursed his lips well well jane folded her arms deep in thought hanley goes to the garage to pick up a bribe it goes wrong somehow somebody got greedy benjamin flowers she nodded slowly id still like to get my hands on don empson she said you need to be patient she stared at him meaning what meaning putting the team to work stake out anywhere george renshaw or don empson might turn up at least one of thems got to be on the hunt for benjy and my guess would be empson hunting his own nephew it was bobs turn to nod so all we can do is wait she asked all we can do is wait bob confirmed gorgeous george needs a taxi it was a short walk from the café to the taxi office george didnt go there much even though he owned the place owned all the taxis too he had someone else fronting the operation for him but it was his money behind it and him raking in the profits taxis his dad had told him were useful you could use them for ferrying merchandise and people around the city and further afield nobody looked twice at a taxi george was there because he needed a bit of ferrying himself his car was at the scrapyard there was no way he could go back for it he had two more cars in the garage at his house but he reckoned police would be waiting for him there too so instead he would use a taxi as he walked into the office the three drivers stood up so did the woman who was working the telephone magazines and newspapers hit the floor mugs of tea trembled in their hands one thing they all knew somebody was in trouble easy george reassured them holding his palms up nothing to worry about i just need a lift somewhere all three were willing pretended to be eager even george pointed to the nearest one youll do he said out at the taxi the driver unlocked the doors and asked where they were going edinburgh he was told he nodded trying to hide his surprise that was the rest of his shift taken care of having climbed into the back george was already busy with his phone he wanted to talk to sam and eddie wanted to make sure they were getting things right for once he saw the driver fiddling with something and leaned forward in his seat am i seeing things he growled or did you just put the meter on force of habit the driver said switching it off again so busy were driver and passenger that as the taxi roared out of the parking lot neither noticed the unmarked police car as it reversed into a tight parking space the two detectives in the car looked at one another was that him one asked his partner replied with a nod their car did a uturn and got ready to follow the black cab at a distance chapter twelve gravys story i was going to miss celine ive only just learned to say your name the right way i told her she was emptying the red bag into a suitcase it was one of those posh ones with wheels and a handle when she came back from the shops with it she brought me a present one of celine dions cds that who youre named after i asked suppose so she said busy with the suitcase again she was going to go on a train it was a special train that left edinburgh last thing at night and arrived in london next morning shed explained that you got a bed and you could sleep all the way there sounds nice celine why cant i come but she shook her head safer for you if you stay here you said theyd be watching the stations thats a chance ive got to take theres always the car its don empsons car gravy do you think they wont be looking for it then she folded some of the money and stuck it in my trouser pocket youve been a good friend gravy she said and that made me blush shed paid for another night at the hotel both rooms it meant she wouldnt be noticed as missing she wanted me to stay the night and in the morning i could do anything i wanted breakfasts included she told me and after that i can go home i watched her nod you think i should leave the car here up to you she looked up at me time you started taking some decisions gravy i will i said the tv in her room had a clock on it your trains not for hours i know but youre leaving just now she nodded im fed up hanging around we could go to a film i blurted out she gave me a look and a smile ive got a taxi coming i could run you to the station but she shook her head again better this way she said why why is it better it just is she was beginning to sound irritated i know that happens with people it happens with the people in my house i ask one question too many and they sound like that how does the moon shine what happens when we die celine i said but she was zipping the case shut got to go she told me she slipped into her jacket it was brand new everything about her looked new she tucked her hair into a beret im trying for the foreign tourist look she explained ive never been to london ill send you my address promise promise and then she kissed me on the cheek and i went redder than ever i could see myself in the mirror my face was on fire not exactly a cool head gravy the door clicked after her the room was silent but i could still smell her perfume it took me a minute to realise that she didnt have my address i opened the door but she wasnt in the corridor well id told her about the graveyard a letter would always find me there i lay on her bed for a while staring at myself in the tv screen she had taken all the stuff from the minibar and her bathroom supplies for the journey shed said there was a price list for the minibar it was on the bedside table would i have to pay for it in the morning maybe that was why shed given me the money i took the notes out of my pocket and tried counting them fifteen or nearly fifteen times twenty that was a lot the red bag was on the carpet empty now in my own room i had the blue carrier bag it was on the top shelf in the wardrobe i could put the celine dion cd in there so that was what i did then i made myself a cup of tea using the last of the tea bags and milk i lay on my own bed one foot crossed over the other three big pillows behind my head there wasnt much on the tv on one of the channels they all spoke a language i didnt know but i recognised the show i was sure id seen it in english the minutes crept by maybe she would come back maybe she would miss me or miss her train maybe shed forgotten something i looked again in her room but didnt find anything i knew where her cousin lived and that was a start she would phone her cousin blood was blood my mum used to say she would phone her cousin and id be there visiting and the cousin would hand the phone over to me and that would be us friends again the phone in her room rang and i ran through to pick it up who else could it be but her hello but then the phone went dead i listened for a while longer but it stayed dead well at least shed tried calling i stared out of the window at the evening the castle was lit up there were people on the street they looked like they were having fun life was all about fun wasnt it that was when i realised i was bored never mind the breakfast i said to myself on the other hand what if she did come back and i wasnt there see i was thinking about heading home but id promised i would stay just one last night yes but i was bored and i needed some fresh air i could go for a drive and still come back or a walk i could walk same as the people outside were doing celine had teased me that there were bars on the street where naked girls danced but i wouldnt go there i looked around her room and then mine and decided to take my blue carrier bag what else did i have oh my room key i couldnt forget that when i went into the corridor there was a man standing there he was standing outside celines door he looked at me hello i said he just nodded do you work here thats right sir he said with a smile shes not in he stared at me and how do you know that sir connecting rooms i explained and your name is everyone calls me gravy thats because i work at the graveyard and youre here with celine shes named after celine dion the man nodded he was coming towards me he stopped just short well don was telling the truth for once do you know when shes coming back ive got a message for her i can take it if you like i offered its really for her sir i looked him up and down he didnt look like he worked for the hotel everyone wore a kind of uniform and a name badge and hed used the name don id heard that name just recently he had leaned forward so his face was right next to mine wheres my money he hissed i stared at him i dont know i think you do gravy the red bag its empty so shes got the cash the money belongs to benjy and benjy wanted her to have it shes nice he glared at me im going to ask you one last time wheres benjy wheres the car and wheres that tart gone with my money i managed not to blink everything was blurry at the edges but then it wasnt it was really sharp instead the car park i said take me he gave me a little shove in the direction of the lifts well what else could i do he wanted me to so i took him chapter thirteen jane is in edinburgh the mansion park hotel jane said into her phone she was parked outside the taxi was about twenty yards away the driver chatting away on his own phone paying no mind to anything else in edinburgh bobs voice asked thats the one his idea of hiding out who knows jane shifted in the drivers seat as soon as shed got word that george renshaw was on the move shed set off after him and as soon as she had caught up with the car tailing him shed radioed to tell the other car it could pull back a twocar tail was perfect meant you could keep swapping meaning less chance of the car you were following spotting you the two cid men were parked around the other side of the hotel just in case is andrew hanley talking he is bob confirmed remember what i said about stewart renshaws casino you were right she guessed only one hundred per cent yet im the one who got the promotion jane was smiling bit more good news if youre up for it days like this dont happen nearly often enough bob two of gorgeous georges boys the two weve been after for the brigham woods murder turned up about forty minutes ago yes they marched donald empson into one of georges pubs when our stakeout team sauntered in pretending to be customers there was no sign of any of them the cellar looks a good bet empson screwed up and hes about to pay the price i dont want to go charging in until were sure jane nodded to herself i agree maybe its something i can talk to renshaw about she saw movement at the hotel doors two men making their exit hold on she said into the phone somethings happening ill have to call you back jane bob was telling her as she ended the call remember look after number one gravy and gorgeous george the two men crossed the tarmac heading for the multistorey car park gravy was taller than george renshaw by a couple of inches thinner too he carried the blue carrier bag renshaw signalled to the driver of his taxi everythings going to plan keep the engine running this wont take long on the way down in the lift he had pulled on a pair of tight leather gloves an idea borrowed from don empson he flexed his hands as he walked so youre a mate of benjys renshaw was asking hows he doing gravy just shrugged how did he ever think hed get away with it another shrug and don you do know don dont you a shake of the head you dont know don i know its his car so how exactly do you fit in mr gravy its just gravy not mr gravy whatever which floor are we going to they were entering the car park this one gravy said the level was only half full and renshaw spotted don empsons bmw straight away he gave a low whistle almost jogging towards it i tried cleaning up the blood gravy was explaining i did my best sure you did kid renshaw said he rubbed a gloved hand over the car and peered inside then he turned to gravy so the boot gravy said got the key gravy nodded give it here then the key changed hands renshaw pressed the button and the boot clicked open half an inch he yanked it all the way up and stood there mouth hanging open benjys body was curled into a ball it was swelling and leaking and starting to smell renshaw began to cough he took a step back then turned towards gravy gravy was holding the blue bag he was pointing it at renshaw then he pulled the trigger and the bag exploded the kick sent the gun flying from gravys hand renshaw winced and went down on one knee then fell backwards clutching his right leg the bullet had gone into his upper thigh blood was pumping out renshaws face was screwed up in pain gravy knelt down and touched the mans forehead warm he said warm warm warm warm five times for luck then curious he touched the mans chest stood to reason if the head was warm then the heart should be cold stone cold but it wasnt people were coming a woman and two men running gravy didnt know them he stood up and one of the men shouted for him to step away from the vehicle gravy was happy to do that the woman was walking slowly towards him the other man was phoning for an ambulance the woman glanced inside the boot of the car then she locked eyes with gravy my names detective inspector harris she said mines gravy yes i know what are you doing here gravy youre a long way from home gravy nodded his agreement with this are you working for don empson she asked gravy shook his head im just benjys pal thats all im guessing this is benjy she meant the body in the boot instead of answering gravy looked over towards george renshaw renshaw was clutching his wounded leg cursing and swearing and making pained noises as he rolled around on the floor i dont like swearing gravy stated my mum told me its not clever your mum was quite right di harris was studying the car this belongs to don empson doesnt it gravy nodded again but i thought it was benjys can i go back to work now he asked harris didnt answer straight away she had her own phone out and was telling someone on the other end of it that they should enter the bar and check the cellar flicking the phone shut she asked gravy if he was sure he was all right im fine he said i didnt want to shoot him i just didnt know what else to do benjy wanted me to hide the gun he looked at her ill get into trouble wont i i didnt do what he wanted he took a deep breath and gave a long loud sigh is there any money gravy im thinking there should be money but gravy was shaking his head if youre looking for celine he told the detective shes not here i dont know where she went so theres no use asking is there celine for the first time the detective looked confused gravy pointed to the ground where the remains of the blue bag had landed there was a cd lying there my fingers feel funny he said studying them i dont think i want to do any more shooting im glad to hear it harris had crouched down to pick up the cd gravy was pressing the palm of one hand against his chest warm heart he told the detective thats got to be a good thing hasnt it jane harris nodded but she was still left wondering what on earth did celine dion have to do with any of this ian rankin
