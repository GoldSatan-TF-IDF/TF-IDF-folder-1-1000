after midnight the author woke up knowing that she was not alone simply opening her eyes proved that her instinctive feeling was correct the bed was enveloped in a seafoamcolored glowing mist surrounding the bed were dozens of people all were costumed moreorless outlandishly some looked irritated some angry but none were happy all were familiar oh awake at last are you asked a handsome man with silverstreaked hair and silver eyes who just happened to be the spitting image of actor michael praed its about time we have a few bones to pick with you the author scooted herself up into the headboard trying to get as far away from the mob as possible and addressed the speaker umvanyelbefore you say or do anything rash i think you should know that youre probably one of the most popular characters in my books vanyel snorted popular popular and thats supposed to make up for what you did to me its not enough to give me the family from hell its not enough to make me gay in a hostile redneck society oh no youve got to kill off my first love in the first book and make me go an entire trilogy pining after him like some kind of medieval soap opera and then you write me dialogue that sounds like a morrissey record someone in the background snickered and chanted to the tune of london bridgesim depressed and so i whine so i whine all the time im depressed and so i whine my names vanyel vanyel spun around and glowered at the offending party and another speaker took advantage of the momentary distraction to step forward like hes got problems said diana tregarde a young woman dressed in jeans and a leotard whose long dark hair managed to look as if it had come straight from the hands of an uberstylist you give me a vampire for a boyfriend you end the third book on a cliffhanger and then what you drop me like a hot potato at least you got a third book mumbled jennifer talldeer who could easily have been dianas native american twin sister yeah well none of you had to spend a few centuries as a forest vanyel countered a forest i ask you you think athletes foot is bad ever tried root rot hah you had stefan and yfandes with you the author ventured timidly oh great so how exactly am i supposed to get it on with my true love when were both a bunch of trees vanyel snarled crosspollinating someone offered from the back at least you got a true loveand a whole life complained lavan firestorm i get whata talking horse and a nice tombstone thank you so very friggin much his tone turned mocking and then you brag about it the lackey patented formula for successmake your audience identify with and care deeply for a character then drop a mountain on him a tall blond woman snorted teenagers what would you know i have a perfectly reasonable life as a mercenaryhellfires i have my own company its looking like comfortable retirementcity then ms whitehorsesonthecover rips it all up and turns me into some kind of dogooder in a uniform like a walking target and inflicts me with crap that talks in my head im ready for menopause and she starts with this nonsense well if youre going to start in on that line of thought interrupted another woman this one in black armor and silver hair who had a face like an axeblade let me tell you it was no picnic being saddled with arthritis and teaching you and your little buddy and thanks so much for turning me from a heroine into the prime bitchslut of the millennium called a young woman in the rather idealized costume of a russian czarina who stood on tiptoe at the back of the room you didnt deserve ivan anyway snapped another in a gown of glowing feathers all you ever do in the ballet is stand around and wait for rescue speaking of ballet prince siegfried interrupted i know you had to do something with the character but did you have to make me into such a selfish bastard selfish fine bastard all right but both at once and if you ask me you really didnt pull off my socalled redemption very convincingly nobody asked you murmured odile who earned a glare from odette dont tell me youve got a complaint the author exclaimed indignantly you got the title and a happy ending not bad for someone whos best known for thirtytwo fouettes in the last act but did it have to be benno odile countered the guy who never does anything but lift odette so the prince wont put his back out hey said siegfried indignantly the author glanced quickly around i dont see maya or peter scott she murmured with relief oh i say lord peter almsley waved from the back of the crowd you still havent planned a book for me you just cant leave me dangling as a hangeron she left me dangling after three books countered diana tregarde look its not her fault that some nutcases decided you were real my knee hurts whose dream sequence is this anyway my knee shouldnt hurt in my own dream sequence shar said tannim plaintively a graying indomitable figure in heralds whites stepped forward and the rest of the group stepped back a pace as she placed herself between the author and the mob she put her hands on her hips and took a deep breath to begin an oration uh oh kerowyn groaned i know that look have any of you ever bothered to think about an authors responsibilities asked heraldchronicler myste they arent just to you the charactersface it if that were the case every one of you would have wonderful lives full of adventures that never got you into trouble a black gryphon in the back put up a talon and rumbled yes please id like that myste glared at the offending party and ended so happily that people would gag right there arose a murmur from the crowd tones that sounded to the authors ears like grudging agreement furthermore myste continued if that was what she wrote nobody would ever bother to read it a tiny woman with curly chestnut hair also in heralds whites nodded agreement i hate to say this folks but myste is right i started out that wayand if that was the way id stayed none of us would ever have been published she spared a slightly sour glance for the author i could have done without the crushed feet though oh sure crushed feet thats a limp through the park compared to root rot vanyel murmured indignantly im not even going to start on how japanese beetles and dutch elm disease feel the author winced sorry talia id just read this book on medieval torturesand you were in my first book i hadnt figured out where to stop with the research yet all right all right myste interrupted before anyone else could start lodging complaints again thatll do the point is the author hasnt got much in the way of responsibility towards you the characters except to make you interesting enough that people will want to read about you her responsibility is always towards the audience the readers i would have preferred the black gryphon began to rumble all of you would have preferred something else myste said cutting him off think about this while youre preferring look at the kind of job shes got in front of her shes got to juggle reallife problems some of them just as grim as the ones she put you through somehow manage to get books written and turned in on time mostly on time interrupted a blue dragon from beside the black gryphon all right mostly and shes got to figure out how to do things with you that she hasnt done before so the readers dont get bored now do you think any of you could do that myste crossed her arms over her chest and glared at them and give you happy endings as well mostly said lavan firestorm but without much anger tragedy myste countered with great dignity is generally considered to be more compelling than any other dramatic force i could have done with being a little less compelling several male leads said in unison then looked at each other oh lavan replied is compelling supposed to make up for getting dead before i ever got laid teenagers myste and the author mumbled together and exchanged a knowing glance and do you think she doesnt suffer as much as you do in all of this myste continued the amount of facialtissue this woman goes throughnot to mention cola the long nights the frenzied sessions at the keyboard van she didnt have a life when she was writing youyou were her life everything you people feel she feels oh maybe not the physical torture i did work for american airlines the author murmured but she goes through the same emotions or she couldnt write all of yours so well did you ever think of that yeah but lavan started another objection then looked around but the rest of the crowd seemed to be talking it over among themselves and even vanyel tapped lavan on the shoulder and drew him into a fourway colloquy with stefan and talia a line of limping scorched arrowpincushioned or just plain exhausted blueeyed white horses just sighed from the sidelines the author began to relax as one by one the characters turned away from the bed and its contents and wandered off into the green haze eventually there was no one left but myste and the author the author heaved an enormous sigh of relief my god you saved my ass she said sincerely but rather without the grace she usually showed in her prose well i am you myste shrugged lucky for me they havent caught on yet on the whole youve done rather well at not putting yourself in your books though thats pretty admirable the author shrugged and blushed a little is there anything i can do to thank you she asked myste raised one eyebrow an expression cloned straight from the authors own face welli dont suppose i could get a walkon in the next book could i she asked the author considered it i dont see why not she said cautiously theres room but id have to figure out why youre permanently at the collegium not another missing leg in the tedrel wars myste snapped youve done that twice er replied the author guiltily because shed been considering it then she brightened i know and every fankid in glasses would love it youre myopic nearsighted cant that be healed myste asked dubiously the author shook her head in triumph nope established canon healers cant heal genetic defects they work on the existing pattern of the dna and enough myste interrupted holding up her hand thats the stuff the readers dont need to know but youve got the artificers surely theyd have come up with glasses by now youve got good optics established canonically in the field the author countered welltheyd probably have to have big wooden frames and straps that went around the back of the headtheyd look like dorky sportsgoggles but theyd work the author frowned true enough then her expression changed to one of glee but not after you went into bifocals my dear eh myste said puzzled benjamin franklin had them and youre into steamtech by now oh noyoure me remember thats why i had lasercorrection bifocals made me dizzy the author sat back with an air of triumph point taken cant have dizzy heralds at least not in the field myste nodded her satisfaction with the solution one other thing thoughthink you could get me a boyfriend too a loveinterest the author asked whatever she frowned im not sure i want to bring in too many incidental characters you know how they try and take over a book look at almsley oi objected a voice from deep in the haze use an existing one myste suggested the author looked thoughtful how about alberich alberich myste considered that good body facial scars arent that bad a handicap sexy in a bruce campbells evil twin sort of way yeah kind of monofocused though isnt he arent you all the author countered that kind of goes with the white suit along with the periodic severe bodily injuries point taken myste nodded cool alberich it is she frowned as a thought occurred to her dont go giving me the hobby of raising fancy chickens though but i like fancy chickens the author said weakly i know and so will everyone else if you put it in myste replied she walked off into the green haze herself which began to close in around her most excellent i get a walkon a fleshingout and a boyfriend loveinterest whatever the green haze closed down to a pinpoint and vanished and once i make her really likable i can drop a mountain on her mercedes lackey tulsa oklahoma
