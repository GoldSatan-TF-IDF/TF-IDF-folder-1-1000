laurell k hamilton blue moon v book of the anita blake vampire hunter series i was dreaming of cool flesh and sheets the color of fresh blood the phone shattered the dream leaving only fragments a glimpse of midnight blue eyes hands gliding down my body his hair flung across my face in a sweet scented cloud i woke in my own house miles from jeanclaude with the feel of his body clinging to me i fumbled the phone from the bedside table and mumbled hello anita is that you it was daniel zeeman richards baby brother daniel was twentyfour and cute as a bugs ear baby didnt really cover it richard had been my fianc–π once upon a time until i chose jeanclaude over him sleeping with the other man put a real crimp in our social plans not that i blamed richard no i blamed myself it was one of the few things richard and i still shared i squinted at the glowing dial of the bedside clock am daniel whats wrong no one calls at ten after the witching hour with good news he took a deep breath as if preparing himself for the next line richards in jail i sat up sheets sliding in a bundle to my lap what did you say i was suddenly wide awake heart thudding adrenaline pumping richard is in jail he repeated i didnt make him say it again though i wanted to what for i asked attempted rape he said what i said daniel repeated it it didnt make any more sense the second time i heard it richard is like the ultimate boy scout i said id believe murder before id believe rape i guess thats a compliment he said you know what i meant daniel richard wouldnt do something like that i agree he said is he in saint louis i asked no hes still in tennessee he finished up his requirements for his masters degree and got arrested that night tell me what happened i dont exactly know he said what do you mean i asked they wont let me see him daniel said why not mom got in to see him but they wouldnt let all of us in has he got a lawyer i asked he says he doesnt need one he says he didnt do it prison is full of people who didnt do it daniel he needs a lawyer its his word against the womans if shes local and he isnt hes in trouble hes in trouble daniel said shit i said theres more bad news he said i threw the covers back and stood clutching the phone tell me theres going to be a blue moon this month he said it very quietly no explanation but i understood richard was an alpha werewolf he was head of the local pack it was his only serious flaw wed broken up after id seen him eat somebody what id seen had sent me running to jeanclaudes arms id run from the werewolf to the vampire jeanclaude was master of the city of saint louis he was definitely not the more human of the two i know there isnt a lot to choose from between a bloodsucker and a flesheater but at least after jeanclaude finished feeding there werent chunks between his fangs a small distinction but a real one a blue moon meant a second full moon this month the moon doesnt actually turn blue most of the time but it is where the old saying comes from once in a blue moon it happens about every three years or so it was august and the second full moon was only five days away richards control was very good but id never heard of any werewolf even an ulfric a pack leader who could fight the change on the night of the full moon no matter what flavor of animal you changed into a lycanthrope was a lycanthrope the full moon ruled them we have to get him out of jail before the full moon daniel said yeah i said richard was hiding what he was he taught junior high science if they found out he was a werewolf hed lose his job it was illegal to discriminate on the basis of a disease especially one as difficult to catch as lycanthropy but theyd do it no one wanted a monster teaching their kiddies not to mention that the only person in richards family who knew his secret was daniel mom and pop zeeman didnt know give me a number to contact you at i said he did youll come down then he said yeah he sighed thanks mom is raising hell but its not helping we need someone here who understands the legal system ill have a friend call you with the name of a good local lawyer before i get there you may be able to arrange bail by the time i arrive if hell see the lawyer daniel said is he being stupid i asked he thinks that having the truth on his side is enough it sounded like something richard would say there was more than one reason why wed broken up he clung to ideals that hadnt even worked when they were in vogue truth justice and the american way certainly didnt work within the legal system money power and luck were what worked or having someone on your side that was part of the system i was a vampire executioner i was licensed to hunt and kill vampires once a court order of execution had been issued i was licensed in three states tennessee was not one of them but cops as a general rule would treat an executioner better than a civilian we risked our lives and usually had a higher kill count than they did of course the kills being vamps some people didnt count them as real kills had to be human for it to count when can you get here daniel asked ive got some things to clear up here but ill see you today before noon i hope you can talk some sense into richard id met their mother more than once so i said im surprised that charlotte cant talk sense to him where do you think he gets this truth will set you free bit daniel asked great i said ill be there daniel ive got to go he hung up suddenly as if afraid of being caught his mom had probably come into the room the zeemans had four sons and a daughter the sons were all six feet or above the daughter was five nine they were all over twentyone and they were all scared of their mother not literally scared but charlotte zeeman wore the pants in the family one family dinner and i knew that i hung up the phone turned on the lamp and started to pack it occurred to me while i was throwing things into a suitcase to wonder why the hell i was doing this i could say that it was because richard was the other third of a triumvirate of power that jeanclaude had forged between the three of us master vampire ulfric or wolf king and necromancer i was the necromancer we were bound so tightly together that sometimes we invaded each others dreams by accident sometimes not so accidentally but i wasnt riding to the rescue because richard was our third i could admit to myself if to no one else that i still loved richard not the same way i loved jeanclaude but it was just as real he was in trouble and i would help him if i could simple complicated hurtful i wondered what jeanclaude would think of me dropping everything to go rescue richard it didnt really matter i was going and that was that but i did spare a thought for how that might make my vampire lover feel his heart didnt always beat but it could still break love sucks sometimes it feels good sometimes its just another way to bleed i made phone calls my friend catherine maisongillette was an attorney shed been with me on more than one occasion when i had to make a statement to the police about a dead body that i helped make dead so far no jail time hell no trial how did i accomplish this i lied bob catherines husband answered on the fifth ring voice so heavy with sleep it was almost unintelligible only the bass growl let me know which of them it was neither of them woke gracefully bob this is anita i need to speak with catherine its business you at a police station he asked see bob knew me no i dont need a lawyer for me this time he didnt ask questions he just said heres catherine if you think i have no curiosity at all youre wrong but catherine will fill me in after you hang up thanks bob i said anita whats wrong catherines voice sounded normal she was a criminal attorney with a private firm she was wakened a lot at odd hours she didnt like it but she recovered well i told her the bad news she knew richard liked him a lot didnt understand why in hell id dumped him for jeanclaude since i couldnt tell her about richard being a werewolf it was sort of hard to explain heck even if i could have mentioned the werewolf part it was hard to explain carl belisarius she said when i was finished hes one of the best criminal attorneys in that state i know him personally hes not as careful about his clients as i am hes got some clients that are known criminal figures but hes good can you contact him and get him started i asked you need richards permission for this anita i cant talk richard into taking on a new attorney until i see him times always precious on a crime catherine can belisarius at least start the wheels in motion do you know if richard has an attorney now daniel mentioned something about him refusing to see his lawyer so i assume so give me daniels number and ill see what i can do she said thanks catherine really she sighed i know youd go to this much trouble for any of your friends youre just that loyal but are you sure your motives are just friendly in this what are you asking me you still love him dont you no comment i said catherine gave a soft laugh no comment youre not the one under suspicion here says you i said fine ill do what i can on this end let me know when you get there will do i said i hung up and called my main job vampire killing was only a sideline i raised the dead for animators inc the first animating firm in the country we were also the most profitable part of that was due to our boss bert vaughn he could make a dollar sit up and sing he didnt like that my helping the police on preternatural crimes was taking more and more of my time he wouldnt like me going out of town for an indefinite period of time on personal business i was glad it was the wee hours and he wouldnt be there to yell at me in person if bert kept pushing me i was going to have to quit and i didnt want to i had to raise zombies it wasnt like a muscle that would wither if you didnt use it it was an innate ability for me if i didnt use it the power would leak out on its own in college there had been a professor who committed suicide no one had found the body for the three days that it usually takes for the soul to leave the area one night the shambling corpse had come to my dorm room my roommate got a room switch next day she had no sense of adventure i would raise the dead one way or another i had no choice but i had enough reputation that i could go freelance id need a business manager but it would work trouble is i didnt want to leave some of the people who worked at animators inc were among my best friends besides i had had about as much change as i could handle for one year i anita blake scourge of the undead the human with more vampire kills than any other vampire executioner in the country was dating a vampire it was almost poetically ironic the doorbell rang the sound made my heart pulse in my throat it was an ordinary sound but not at in the morning i left my partially packed suitcase on the unmade bed and walked into the living room my white furniture sat on top of a brilliant oriental rug cushions that caught the bright colors were placed casually on the couch and chair the furniture was mine the rug and cushions had been gifts from jeanclaude his sense of style would always be better than mine why argue the doorbell rang again it made me jump for no good reason except it was insistent and it was an odd hour and i was already keyed up from the news about richard i went to the door with my favorite gun a browning hipower mm in hand safety off pointed at the floor i was almost at the door when i realized i was wearing nothing but my nightgown a gun but no robe i had my priorities in order i stood there barefoot on the elegant rug debating whether to go back for the robe or a pair of jeans something if id been wearing one of my usual extralarge tshirts id have just answered the door but i was wearing a black satin nightie with spaghetti straps it hung almost to my knees one size does not fit all it covered everything but wasnt exactly answeringthedoor attire screw it i called who is it bad guys usually didnt ring the doorbell it is jeanclaude ma petite my mouth dropped open i couldnt have been more surprised if it had been a bad guy what was he doing here i clicked the safety on the gun and opened the door the satin nightie had been a gift from jeanclaude hed seen me in less we didnt need the robe i opened the door and there he was it was like i was a magician and had thrown aside the curtain to show my lovely assistant the sight of him caught my breath in my throat his shirt was a conservative business cut with fastened cuffs and a simple collar it was red with the collar and cuffs a solid almost satiny scarlet the rest of the shirt was some sheer fabric so that his arms chest and waist were bare behind a sheen of red cloth his black hair curled below his shoulders darker richer somehow against the red of the shirt even his midnight blue eyes seemed bluer framed by red it was one of my favorite colors for him to wear and he knew it hed threaded a red cord through the belt loops of his black jeans the cord fell in knots down one side of his hip the black boots came almost to the tops of his legs encasing his long slender legs in leather from toe to nearly groin when i was away from jeanclaude away from his body his voice i could be embarrassed scratchy with discomfort that i was dating him when i was away from him i could talk myself out of him almost but never when i was with him when i was with him my stomach dropped to my feet and i had to fight very hard not to say things like golly i settled for you look spectacular as always what are you doing here on a night that i told you not to come what i wanted to do was to throw myself around him like a coat and have him carry me over the threshold clinging to him like a monkey but i wasnt going to do that it lacked a certain dignity besides it sort of scared me how much i wanted him and how often he was like a new drug it wasnt vampire powers it was good oldfashioned lust but it was still scary so i had set up some parameters rules he followed them most of the time he smiled and it was the smile id grown to both love and dread the smile said he was thinking wicked thoughts things that two or more could do in darkened rooms where the sheets smelled of expensive perfume sweat and other bodily fluids the smile had never made me blush until we started having sex sometimes all he had to do was smile and heat rushed up my skin like i was thirteen and he was my first crush he thought it was charming it embarrassed me you son of a bitch i said softly the smile widened our dream was interrupted ma petite i knew it wasnt an accident that you were in my dreams i said it came out hostile and i was pleased because the hot summer wind was blowing the scent of his cologne against my face exotic with an undercurrent of flowers and spice i almost hated to wash my sheets for fear of losing the scent of him sometimes i asked you to wear my gift so i could dream of you you knew what i meant to do if you say other then you are lying may i come in hed been invited in often enough that he could have crossed my threshold without the invitation but it had become a game with him a formal acknowledgment every time he crossed that i wanted him it irritated me and pleased me like so much about jeanclaude you might as well come in he walked past me i noticed the black boots were laced up the back from heel to top the back of his black jeans fit smooth and tight so there was no need to guess what he wasnt wearing under them he spoke without turning around do not sound so grumpy ma petite you have the ability to bar me from your dreams he turned then and his eyes were full of a dark light that had nothing to do with vampire powers you welcomed me with more than open arms i blushed for the second time in less than five minutes richard is in jail in tennessee i said i know he said you know i said how the local master of the city called to tell me he was very much afraid that i would think it was his doing his way of destroying our triumvirate if he was going to destroy us it would be a murder charge not attempted rape i said true jeanclaude said then laughed the laughter trailed over my bare skin like a small private wind whoever framed our richard did not know him well i would believe murder of richard before rape it was almost exactly what id said why was that unnerving are you going down to tennessee the master colin has forbidden me to enter his lands to do so now would be an act of aggression if not outright war why should he care i asked he fears my power ma petite he fears our power which is why he has made you persona non grata in his territory as well i stared at him you are kidding i hope hes forbidden either of us to help richard jeanclaude nodded and he expects us to believe its not his doing i said i believe him ma petite you could tell he wasnt lying over the phone i asked some master vampires can lie to other master vampires though i do not think colin is such a power but that is not why i believe him why then the last time you and i traveled to another vampires lands we slew her she was trying to kill us i said technically he said she had set all of us free save you you she wished to make a vampire like i said she was trying to kill me he smiled oh ma petite you wound me cut the crap this colin cant really believe that we are just going to leave richard to rot he has the right to deny us safe passage jeanclaude said because we killed another master in her own territory i asked he doesnt need grounds for his refusal ma petite he merely has to refuse how do you vampires get anything accomplished slowly jeanclaude said but remember ma petite we have the time to be patient well i dont and richard doesnt you could have eternity if you would both accept the fourth mark he said voice quiet neutral i shook my head richard and i both value what little is left of our humanity besides eternity my ass the fourth mark wouldnt make us immortal it just means that we live as long as you do youre harder to kill than we are but not that much harder he sat down on the couch folding his legs under him it wasnt an easy position wearing that much leather maybe the boots were softer than they looked naw he rested his elbows on the couch arm leaning his chest outward the sheer red cloth covered his chest completely and left nothing to the imagination his nipples pressed against the thin fabric the red haze of cloth made the crossshaped burn scar look almost bloody he raised himself upward with his hands propped on the couch arm like a mermaid on a rock i expected him to tease or say something sexual instead he said i came to tell you of richards imprisonment in person he watched my face very closely i thought it might upset you of course it upsets me this colin guy vampire whatever the hell he is is crazy if he thinks hes going to keep us from helping richard jeanclaude smiled asher is negotiating even as we speak to try and allow you to enter colins territory asher was his second banana his vampire lieutenant i frowned why me and not you because you are much better with police matters than i am he threw one long leatherclad leg over the couch arm and slithered over it to his feet it was like watching a lap dance without a lap to my knowledge jeanclaude had never stripped at guilty pleasures the vampire strip club he owned but he could have he had a way of making even the smallest movement sexual and vaguely obscene you always felt like he was thinking wicked thoughts things you couldnt say in mixed company why didnt you just call and tell me all this i said i knew the answer or at least part of it he seemed to be as enamored of my body as i was of his good sex cuts both ways the seducer can become the seduced with the right victim he glided towards me i thought this was news to be delivered facetoface he stopped just in front of me so close that the slightly full hem of my nightie brushed his thighs he gave a small movement of his body and the satin edge of the nightie moved gently against my bare legs most men would have had to use their hands to get that kind of movement of course jeanclaude had had four hundred years to perfect his technique practice makes perfect why facetoface i asked my voice a little breathy a smile curled his lips you know why he said i want to hear you say it i said his beautiful face fell into blank careful lines only his eyes held the heat like a banked fire i could not let you leave without touching you one last time i want to do the wicked dance before you leave i laughed but it was tense nervous my mouth was suddenly dry i was having trouble not staring at his chest the wicked dance was his pet euphemism for sex i wanted to touch him but if i did i wasnt sure where it would stop richard was in trouble id betrayed him once with jeanclaude i wouldnt let him down again i need to pack i said i turned abruptly and started walking towards the bedroom he followed me i put my gun on the bedside table beside the phone got socks out of the drawer and started tossing them into the suitcase trying to ignore jeanclaude he doesnt ignore easily he lay on the bed beside the suitcase propped on one elbow long legs stretched the length of the bed he looked fearfully overdressed against my white sheets he watched me move around the room moving just his eyes he reminded me of a cat watchful perfectly at ease i went into the nearby bathroom to get toiletries i had a mans shaving kit bag that i kept all the small stuff in i was traveling out of town more and more lately might as well be organized about it jeanclaude was lying on his back long black hair spilling like a dark dream on my white pillow he gave a slight smile as i entered the room he held a hand out to me join me ma petite i shook my head if i join you well get distracted im going to pack and get dressed we dont have time for anything else he crawled towards me over the bed moving in a rolling glide like he had muscles in places he wasnt supposed to have them am i so unappealing ma petite or is your concern for richard so overwhelming you know exactly how appealing you are to me and yes i am worried about richard he slid off the bed following at my heels he glided in a sort of graceful slow motion while i hurried to and fro but he paced me matching each of my quick steps with his easy ones it was like being chased by a very slow predator one that had all the time in the world but knew in the end it would catch you the second time i almost ran into him i finally said what is your problem quit following me around youre making me nervous truth was his body being so close made my skin jump he sat down on the edge of the bed and sighed i dont want you to go that stopped me in my tracks i turned and stared at him why for heavens sake for centuries i have dreamed of having enough power to be safe enough power to hold my lands and finally at long last have some sense of peace now i fear the very man who could make my ambitions come true what are you talking about i came to stand in front of him arms full of shirts and hangers richard i fear richard there was a look in his eyes that id seldom seen he was unsure of himself it was a very normal human expression it looked totally at odds with the elegant man in his peekaboo shirt why would you be afraid of richard i asked if you love richard more than you love me i fear you will leave me for him if you havent noticed richard hates me right now he talks more to you than to me he does not hate you ma petite he hates that you are with me there is a great difference between the two hatreds jeanclaude stared up at me almost mournfully i sighed are you jealous of richard he looked down at the toes of his expensive boots i would be a fool if i were not i transferred the blouses to one arm and touched his face i turned his face up to mine im sleeping with you not richard remember yet here i am ma petite i am dressed for your dreams and you do not even offer me a kiss his reaction surprised me just when i thought i knew him are you hurt that i didnt give you a hello kiss perhaps he said very softly i shook my head and tossed the blouses in the general direction of the suitcase i bumped his knees with my legs until he opened his legs and let me stand pressing my body the length of his i put my hands on his shoulders the sheer red cloth was rougher textured than it looked not soft how can anyone as gorgeous as you are be insecure he wrapped his arms around my waist snuggling me against him he squeezed his legs against me the leather of the boots was softer than it looked more supple with his arms around me and his legs squeezing against me i was effectively trapped but i was a willing captive so it was okay what i want to do is go down on my knees and lick the front of this nifty shirt i want to know just how much of you i can suck through the cloth i raised my eyebrows at him he laughed soft and low the sound raised goose bumps up and down my body tightening my nipples and other places his laughter was a touchable intrusive thing he could do things with his voice that most men couldnt do with their hands yet he was afraid id leave him for richard he rested his face on my chest cradled between my breasts he rubbed his cheeks softly back and forth against me making the satin slide against me until my breath came faster i sighed and leaned my face over him folding our bodies together i dont plan to leave you for richard but hes in trouble and that comes before sex jeanclaude raised his face to me our arms so entangled that he almost couldnt move kiss me ma petite that is all just a kiss to tell me that you love me i laid my lips against his forehead i thought you were more secure than this i am he said with everyone but you i pulled back enough to study his face love should make you feel more secure not less yes he said quietly it should but you love richard too you try not to love him and he tries not to love you but love is not so easily slain or so easily aroused i bent over him the first kiss was a mere brush of lips like satin rubbing against my mouth the second kiss was harder i bit lightly along his upper lip and he made a small sound he kissed me back hands sliding to either side of my face he kissed me as if he were drinking me down trying to lick the last drops from the bottle of some fine wine tender eager hungry i collapsed against him hands sliding over him as if even my hands were hungry for the feel of him i felt his fangs sharp bruising against my lips and tongue there was a quick sharp pain and the sweet copper taste of blood he made a small inarticulate sound and rolled over me i was suddenly on the bed with him above me his eyes were one solid glowing blue the pupils gone in a rush of desire he tried to turn my head to one side nuzzling at my neck i turned my face into his blocking him no blood jeanclaude he went almost limp on top of me face buried in the rumpled sheets please ma petite i pushed at his shoulder get off of me he rolled onto his back staring at the ceiling carefully not looking at me i can enter every orifice of your body with every part of me but you refuse me the last bit of yourself i got off the bed carefully not sure my knees were steady i am not food i said it is so much more than mere feeding ma petite if only you would allow me to show you how very much more i grabbed the pile of blouses and started taking them off the hanger and folding them in the suitcase no blood that is the rule he rolled onto his side i have offered you all that i am ma petite yet you withhold yourself from me how can i not be jealous of richard youre getting sex hes not even getting dates you are mine but you are not mine not completely im not a pet jeanclaude people arent supposed to belong to other people if you could find a way to love richards beast you would not hold back from him him you would give yourself to i folded the last blouse damn it jeanclaude this is stupid i chose you all right its a done deal why are you so worried because the moment he was in trouble you dropped everything to run to his side id do the same for you i said exactly he said i have no doubt that you love me in your way but you love him too i zipped up the suitcase we are not having this argument im sleeping with you i am not going to donate blood just to make you feel more secure the phone rang ashers cultured voice so like jeanclaudes anita how are you this fine summer evening im fine asher whats up may i speak with jeanclaude he asked i almost argued but jeanclaude had his hand out for the phone i gave the phone to him jeanclaude spoke in french which he and asher had a habit of doing i was glad that he had someone to speak his native tongue with but my french just wasnt up to following the conversation i suspected strongly that sometimes the vampires spoke in front of me like you would speak in front of a child that doesnt have enough grownup talk to follow the conversation it was rude and condescending but they were centuriesold vampires and sometimes they just couldnt help themselves he switched to english talking directly to me colin has refused you entrance to his territory he has refused entrance to any of my people can he do that i asked jeanclaude nodded oui i am going down there to help richard arrange it jeanclaude or ill go down there without arrangements being made even if its war he asked shit i said call the little son of a bitch and let me talk to him jeanclaude raised his eyebrows but nodded he hung up on asher then dialed a number he said colin this is jeanclaude yes asher told me what you have decided my human servant anita blake wishes to speak with you he listened for a moment no i do not know what she wishes to say to you he handed me the phone and settled back against the headboard of the bed as if watching a show hello colin this is he his accent was pure middle american it made him sound less exotic than some of them my names anita blake i know who you are he said youre the executioner yeah but im not coming down there for an execution my friend is in trouble i just want to help him he is your third if you enter my lands then two of your triumvirate will be within my territory you are too powerful to be allowed entrance asher said you also denied access to any of our people is that true yes he said why for gods sake the council the rulers of all vampire kind itself fears jeanclaude i will not have you in my lands colin look i dont want your power base i dont want your lands i have no designs upon you whatsoever youre a master vampire you can taste the truth in my words you mean what you say but you are the servant jeanclaude is the master dont take this wrong colin but why would jeanclaude want your lands even if he was planning some sort of genghis kahn invasion your lands are three territories away from us if he was going to try conquering someone hed pick land next door maybe theres something here he wants colin said and i could hear the fear in his voice that was rare with a master vamp they were usually better at hiding their emotions colin ill swear any oath you want that we dont want anything from you we just need for me to come down there and get richard out of jail okay no he said if you come down here uninvited it is war between us and i will kill you look colin i know youre afraid as soon as i said it i knew i shouldnt have how do you know what i feel the fear rose a notch but the anger rose faster a human servant that can taste a master vampires fear and you wonder why i dont want you in my lands i cant taste your fear colin i heard it in your voice liar my shoulders were beginning to tighten it doesnt usually take much to piss me off and he was working at it how are we supposed to help richard if you wont let us send anyone down there my voice was calm but i could feel my throat tightening my voice going just a little lower with the effort not to yell what happens to your third is not my concern protecting my lands and my people that is my concern if anything happens to richard because of this delay i can make it your concern i said voice still quiet see already the threats begin the tightness in my shoulders spilled up my neck and came out my mouth listen you little pipsqueak i am coming down there i am not letting your paranoia hurt richard we will kill you then he said look colin stay out of my way and ill stay out of yours you fuck with me and i will destroy you do you understand me its only war if you start it but if you start something by god i will finish it jeanclaude was motioning for the phone rather desperately we wrestled for the receiver for a few seconds while i called colin an antiquated politician and worse jeanclaude apologized to the empty buzzing phone he hung the phone up and looked at me the look was eloquent i would say i am speechless ma petite or that i dont believe that you just did that but i do believe it the question is do you understand what you have just done i am going to rescue richard i can go around colin or over him its his choice jeanclaude sighed he is within his rights to see it as the beginning of a war but colin is very cautious he will do one of two things he will either wait and see if you initiate hostilities or he will try and kill you as soon as you set foot on his lands i shook my head what was i supposed to do it doesnt matter now whats done is done but it changes the travel arrangements you can still take my private jet but you will have company are you coming i asked no if i arrived with you colin would be certain that we had come to kill him no i will stay here but you will have an entourage of guards now wait a minute i said he held up his hand no ma petite you have been very rash remember if you die richard and i may die as well the binding that makes us a triumvirate gives power but it does not come without a price it is not merely your own life that you are risking that stopped me i hadnt thought of it that way i said you will need an entourage now that befits a human servant of mine and an entourage that is strong enough to fight colins people if need be who do you have in mind i asked suddenly suspicious leave that to me i dont think so i said he stood and his anger lashed through the room like a scalding wind you have endangered yourself and me and richard you have endangered everything we have or hope to have with your temper it would have come down to an ultimatum in the end jeanclaude i know vampires you would have argued and bargained for a day or two but in the end it would have come down to this are you so sure he asked yeah i said i heard the fear in colins voice hes scared shitless of you hed have never agreed to us coming down it is not just me he fears ma petite you are the executioner young vampires are told if they are foolish you will come and slay them in their coffins youre making that up i said he shook his head no ma petite you are the bogeyman of vampirekind if i see colin ill try not to scare him more than i already have you will see him ma petite one way or the other he will either arrange a meeting when he sees you mean him no harm or he will be there when they attack we have to get richard out before the full moon weve only got five days we didnt have time to do this slowly who are you trying to convince ma petite me or yourself i had lost my temper it had been stupid inexcusable i had a temper but i was usually better at controlling it than that im sorry i said jeanclaude gave a very inelegant snort now shes sorry he dialed the phone i will have asher and the others pack asher i said hes not going with me yes he is i opened my mouth to protest he pointed one long pale finger at me i know colin and his people you need an entourage that is impressive without being too frightening and yet if the worst happens they must be able to defend you and themselves i will pick who goes and who stays thats not fair there is no time for fairness ma petite your precious richard sits behind bars and the full moon is approaching he let his hand fall to his lap if you wish to take some of your wereleopards with you that would be welcome asher and damian will need food while they are away they cannot hunt within colins territory that would be taken as an act of hostility you want me to volunteer some of the wereleopards as walking provisions i am going to supply some werewolves as well he said im lupa for the pack as well as nimirra for the leopards you need to run the wolves by me too richard had made me lupa of the werewolves when we were dating lupa is often just another word for the head wolfs girlfriend though usually its another werewolf not a human the wereleopards came to me by default i killed their last leader and found out that everyone else was pretty much beating the hell out of them weak shapeshifters without a dominant to protect them end up as anyones meat it was my fault sort of that they were being hurt so i extended my protection over them my protection since i wasnt a wereleopard consisted of my threat my threat was that id kill anyone who messed with them the monsters in town must have believed it because they left the leopards alone use enough silver bullets on enough monsters and you get a reputation jeanclaude put the receiver up to his ear it is getting so that a person cannot insult a monster in saint louis without answering to you ma petite if i hadnt known better id say jeanclaude was angry with me i guess this once i couldnt blame him the private jet was like a long white egg with fins okay it was longer than an egg and more pointy at the ends but it seemed just as fragile have i mentioned i have this little phobia about flying i sat in my comfy fully swivel fully reclinable chair very upright seatbelted in fingernails digging into the cushioned arms i had purposefully turned the seat away from one of the many round windows so i couldnt see out the side nearest me unfortunately the plane was so narrow that i caught glimpses on the opposite side windows of fluffy clouds and clear blue sky hard to forget youre thousands of feet above the ground with only a thin sheet of metal between you and eternity when clouds keep floating past the window jason plopped down in the seat next to me and i let out a little yip he laughed i cant believe youre this scared of flying he pushed his chair with his feet making it spin around slowly like a kid with daddys office chair his thin blond hair was cut just above his shoulders no bangs his eyes were the same pale blue as the sky we were flying through he was exactly my height five three which made him short especially for a man he never seemed to mind he wore an oversized tshirt and a pair of jeans so faded they were almost white he wore two hundred dollar jogging shoes though i knew for a fact he never jogged hed turned twentyone this summer hed informed me that he was a gemini and he was now legal for everything everything could cover a lot of ground for jason he was a werewolf but he currently lived with jeanclaude and played morning appetizer or evening snack for the vampire shapeshifter blood has a bigger kick to it more power you can drink less of it than human blood and feel a hell of a lot better or so ive observed he flung himself up from the chair and fell to his knees in front of me come on anita whats to worry leave me alone jason its a phobia it has no logic you cant talk me out of it so just go away he sprang to his feet so fast it was almost magical were perfectly safe he started jumping up and down on the floor on the plane see solid i yelled zane zane appeared beside me he was about six feet tall stretched long and thin as if there wasnt enough flesh to cover his bones his hair had been dyed a shocking yellow like neon buttercups shaved on the sides and gelled into small stiff spikes on top he wore black vinyl pants like a slick second skin and a matching vest no shirt shiny black boots completed the outfit you rang he asked in a voice that was almost painfully deep if a shapeshifter spends too much time in animal form some of the physical changes can be permanent zanes gravelly voice and the dainty upper and lower fangs in his human mouth said hed spent a little too much time as a leopard the voice could have passed for human but the fangs the fangs gave it away get jason away from me please i said through gritted teeth zane looked down at the smaller man jason stood his ground zane moved those last two steps to close the distance between them they stood there pressed chest to chest eyes locked you could suddenly feel that skincrawling energy that let you know that human was not what they were shit i hadnt meant to start a fight zane lowered his face toward the shorter man a low growl trickling out of his closed lips no fighting boys i said zane planted a big wet kiss on jasons mouth jason jerked back laughing you bisexual son of a bitch now if that isnt the pot calling the kettle black zane said jason just grinned and wandered off though there wasnt a lot of room to wander anywhere i also have a touch of claustrophobia i got it from a diving accident but ive noticed its worse since i woke up one morning trapped in a coffin with a vampire i didnt like i got away but i like enclosed spaces less and less zane slid into the seat beside me the shiny black vest gaped over his thin pale chest giving a glimpse of a silver nipple ring zane patted my knee and i let him he was always touching people nothing personal a lot of shapeshifters were touchyfeely as if they were animals instead of people and had fewer physical boundaries but zane had turned to casual touch into an art form i finally realized that he touched others as a sort of security blanket he tried to play the dominant predator but he wasnt underneath the show of teasing confidence he knew it he got really tense if he was in a social situation where he had to stand alone literally without the touch of other flesh so i let him touch me when id have bitched at anyone else well be on the ground soon he said the hand left my knee he understood the rules i let him touch me when he had no business doing it but no long lingering caresses i was his touchstone when he was nervous not his girlfriend i know i said he smiled but you dont believe me lets just say ill relax when we actually land cherry joined us she was tall and slender with straight naturally blond hair cut very very short and close to a strong triangular face the eye shadow was gray the eyeliner so black it looked like crayon the lipstick was black the makeup wasnt the colors id have chosen for her but it did match her clothes black fishnet stockings vinyl miniskirt black gogo boots and a black lace bra underneath a fishnet shirt shed added the bra for my benefit left to her own devices when she wasnt working as a nurse she went pretty much topless shed been a nurse until they found out she was a wereleopard then shed been the victim of budget cuts maybe it was budget cuts but then again maybe it wasnt it was illegal to discriminate against someone because they had a disease but no one wants a wereanything treating the sick people seem to think lycanthropes cant control themselves around freshly spilled blood some of the newer shapeshifters would be in trouble but cherry wasnt new shed been a good nurse and now shed never be a nurse again she was bitter about it and had turned herself into the slut bride from planet x as if even in human form she wanted people to know what she was now different other trouble was she looked like a thousand other teens and early twenties who also wanted to be different and stand out what happens once we land cherry asked in a purring contralto voice id thought her voice had been the product of too much fur time like zanes teeth but nope cherry just had this wonderful deep sexy voice shed have done good phone sex she sat on the ground at our feet knees out ankles crossed making the short skirt ride up enough to show the hose were thigh high but still managing to cover the rest though in a skirt that short i was hoping she was wearing undies id have never have been able to wear something that short and not flash i contact richards brother and go to the jail i said what do you want us to do zane asked jeanclaude said that he made arrangements for rooms so you guys go to the rooms they exchanged a glance it was more than an ordinary glance what i asked one of us will need to go with you zane said no im going to go in there flashing my executioners license im better off on my own what if the master of this city has his people waiting for you in town zane asked hell know youre going to the jail today cherry nodded it could be an ambush they had a point but look nothing personal guys but you look like the top half of an s and m wedding cake cops dont like people who look sort of i wasnt sure how to say it without being insulting cops were meatandpotatoes people they werent impressed by the exotic theyd seen it all and cleaned up the mess most of the exotic that they saw were bad guys after a while policemen seem to think anything exotic is a bad guy just saves time if i walked into the police station with tweedlepunk and tweedleslut it was going to raise the cops antennae theyd know i wasnt exactly what i was claiming to be and that would complicate things we needed to make things easier not harder i was dressed in vampire executioner casual new black jeans not faded crimson shortsleeved dress shirt black suit jacket black nikes black belt so the loops of my shoulder holster had something to hang on the browning hipower sat under my left arm a familiar tightness i was carrying three blades a silver knife in a wrist sheath on each arm and a blade in a sheath down my spine the handle stuck up high enough that my hair had to hide it but my hair was thick and dark enough to do the job the last blade was like a small sword id used it only once for real to pin a wereleopard through the heart the tip had pushed out his back a silver cross under the blouse for true emergencies and i was packed for werebear or almost anything else i had a spare clip of normal bullets in my fanny pack just in case i met up with a rogue fairie silver didnt work against them ill go with you nathaniel slid in behind cherry pressing himself against the wall of the plane and my legs one broad shoulder rested against my jeans in a nice solid weight there was actually no way for him to sit there and not touch me he was always trying to touch me and he was good enough at it that i couldnt always bitch about it like now i dont think so nathaniel i said he hugged his knees to his chest and asked why not he was dressed normally enough in jeans and a tuckedin tshirt but the rest of him his hair was a deep nearly mahogany auburn hed tied it back in a loose ponytail but the hair fell like silken water to his knees nathaniel gazed up at me with eyes the pale purple of easter egg grass even if he cut the hair the eyes would have given him trouble he was short for a man and was also the youngest of us nineteen i suspected strongly that he was in the middle of a growth spurt someday that short body was going to match his shoulders which were broad and very masculine he was a stripper at guilty pleasures a wereleopard and once hed been a male prostitute id put a stop to that if youre going to be leopard queen you might as well rule the rule was that none of the leopards were whores gabriel their old alpha had pimped them out shapeshifters can take a lot of damage and survive gabriel had figured out a way to make that pay he pimped his kitties out to the s and m set people who liked to give pain had paid a lot of money for nathaniel once upon a time the first time id ever seen him was in the hospital after a client had gotten carried away and nearly killed him admittedly this was after gabriel had been killed the wereleopards had tried to keep up the client list without anyone to protect them from the clients zane had tried to take gabriels place as pimp and badass kitty but he hadnt been strong enough to fill the bill hed let nathaniel nearly die and hadnt been able to protect him nathaniel could benchpress a grand piano but he was a victim he liked pain and wanted someone to be in charge of him he wanted a master and was trying very hard for me to take the job we might have worked something out but being his master or mistress seemed to include sex and that i was not up for ill go jason said he sat down beside cherry and laid his head on her shoulder snuggling cherry moved away from him cuddling closer to nathaniel it wasnt sex exactly it was that the wereanimals tended to get up close and personal with their own kind it was considered something of a social gaffe to cuddle up to a different sort of animal but jason didnt care cherry was female and he flirted with anything that was female nothing personal just habit jason wiggled his butt until cherry was pressed between him and nathaniel ive got a suit in my luggage a nice normal blue suit ill even wear a tie cherry growled at him it sounded all wrong coming from that pretty face i am not one of those women who wants to redo other women i dont care much for makeup or clothes but cherry made me want to give her hints if she was pretty in the bride of frankenstein makeup shed have been a knockout in something that matched her skin tone i smiled thanks jason now give cherry some breathing room he pressed himself even closer zane gave me a kiss to make me move move or ill bite your nose off she gave an expression that was halfsnarl halfsmile a threatening flash of teeth i think she means it i said jason laughed and stood in one of those lightningfast movements that they were all capable of he went to stand behind my seat leaning his forearms on it ill hide behind you until its safe he said get off the back of my seat i said he moved his arms but stayed standing behind me jeanclaude thought you might have to take some of us into police situations we cant all look like college students and porn stars the porn star comment was sadly accurate for all three of the wereleopards another good idea of gabriels had been to star his people in porno films gabriel did his own share of starring roles he was never one to ask of his kitties what he wasnt willing nay eager to do himself hed been a sick son of a bitch and hed made sure that his wereleopards were as sick as he was nathaniel had given me a gift box of three of his movies he suggested we watch them together i said thanks but no thanks i kept the tapes mainly because i wasnt sure what to do with them i mean hed given me a gift i was raised not to be rude they were way in the back of my video cabinet hidden behind a stack of disney tapes and no i had not watched them once i was alone the air slapped against the plane making it shudder turbulence just turbulence youre actually pale cherry said yeah i said jason kissed the top of my head you know youre actually cute when youre scared i turned very slowly in the seat and stared at him i would have liked to say i stared at him until his smile faded away but we didnt have that kind of time jason would grin on his way into hell dont touch me the grin widened his eyes sparkled with it who me i sighed and settled back into the seat it was going to be a very long couple of days portaby airfield is small i guess thats why its called an airfield instead of an airport there were two small runways and a cluster of buildings if three could be called a cluster but it was clean and neat as a pin and the setting was postcard perfect the airfield sat in the middle of a wide green valley surrounded on three sides by the gentle slopes of the smokey mountains on the fourth side behind the buildings was the rest of the valley it sloped sharply down letting us know that the valley we were standing in was still part of the mountains the town of myerton tennessee stretched below us in air so clean it sparkled like someone had dusted the clouds with ground diamonds words came to mind like pristine crystalline that was the main reason one of the last remaining wild bands of lesser smokey mountain trolls lived in the area richard was finishing up his masters degree in biology hed been studying the trolls every summer for four years between teaching full time takes longer to get your masters degree part time i took a deep breath of the clean clean air i could see why richard would want to spend his summers here it was exactly the kind of place hed enjoy he was into outdoorsy stuff in a big way rock climbing hiking fishing camping canoeing birdwatching pretty much anything you could do outside was his idea of fun oh caving too though i guess technically youre not outside if youre inside a cave when i said that richard was a boy scout i didnt mean just his moral fiber a man walked towards us he was almost perfectly round in the middle wearing a pair of coveralls with oil on the knees white hair stuck out from underneath a billed cap his glasses were blackrimmed and square he wiped his hands on a rag as he walked the look on his face was polite curious his eyes flicked from me to the rest of the guys as they filed out of the plane then his eyes flicked to the coffins that were being unloaded from the storage compartment asher was in one damian was in the other asher was the more powerful of the two but he was several hundred years younger damian had been a viking when he was alive and i dont mean the football team hed been a cardcarrying swordwielding marauding raider one night hed raided the wrong castle and she took him if she had a name ive never heard it she was a master vampire and ruler of her lands the equivalent to master of the city when there is no city in a hundred miles she took damian on a summer night over a thousand years ago and she kept him a thousand years and he felt no more powerful in my head than a vampire half his age id underestimated his age by hundreds of years because part of me just couldnt accept that you could exist that long and not be more powerful scarier damian was scary but not a millennium worth of scary hed never be more than he was a third or fourth banana for all eternity jeanclaude bargained for damians freedom when he came to be master of the city he ransomed damian i never knew what it cost jeanclaude but i knew that it hadnt been cheap she had not wanted to give up her favorite whipping boy the man said id shake your hand but ive been working on the planes mr nileys man is waiting in the building i frowned mr niley he frowned then arent you mr nileys people milo said youd be coming in today he looked back and a tall man stepped out of the building his skin was the color of coffee two creams his hair was cut in a wedge leaving his elegant sculpted face bare and unadorned he was wearing a suit that cost more than most cars he stared at me and even from a distance i felt the dead weight of his eyes all he needed was a sign over his head that said muscle no were not mr nileys people that hed made the mistake made me wonder who mr niley was a voice called these are the people ive been expecting ed it was jamil one of richards enforcers the enforcers were sk—Üll and hati after the wolves that chase the sun and moon in norse mythology when they catch them it will be the end of the world tells you something about werewolf society that their enforcers were named after creatures that would bring about the end of everything jamil was sk—Üll for richards pack which meant he was head enforcer he was tall and slender in the way a dancer is slender all muscles and shoulders planed down to a smooth graceful machine of flesh he was wearing a white sleeveless mens undershirt and loose tailored white pants with a very sharp cuff rolled at the end of the pants legs black suspenders graced his upper body and matched the highly polished black shoes a white linen jacket was thrown over one shoulder his dark skin gleamed against the whiteness of his clothes his hair was nearly waist length in cornrows with white beads woven through the braids last time id seen him the beads had been multicolored ed flicked a look back at jamil if you say so he said he went back to the main building leaving us to ourselves probably just as well i didnt know you were here jamil i said im richards bodyguard where else would i be he had a point where were you the night his body was supposedly attacking this woman her name is betty schaffer have you talked to her his eyes widened shes already cried rape once on a fine upstanding white boy no i havent talked to her you could try and blend in a little im one of only two black men for about miles he said theres no way for me to blend in anita so i dont try there was an undercurrent of real anger there i wondered if jamil had been having trouble with the locals it seemed likely he wasnt just african american he was tall handsome and athletic looking that alone would have gotten him on the redneck hit parade the long cornrow hair and the killer fashion sense raised the question that he might violate the last white male bastion of homophobia i knew that jamil liked girls but i was almost willing to bet some of the locals hadnt believed that i assume that is the other african american guy i was careful not to point at milo he was watching us face expressionless but too intense muscle recognizes muscle and he was probably wondering about jamil just as we were wondering about him what was professional muscle doing out here in the boonies jamil nodded yeah thats the other one he doesnt blend in either i said who is he his name is milo hart he works for a guy named frank niley who is supposed to arrive today you and he sit down and have a talk no but ed is just full of news why does frank niley need a bodyguard hes rich jamil said as if that explained it and maybe it did hes down here doing some land speculation ed the plane mechanic tell you all this jamil nodded he likes to talk even to me gee and i thought you were just another pretty face jamil smiled ill do my job when richard lets me whats that supposed to mean it means if hed let me watch over him like a good sk—Üll is supposed to this rape charge would never have happened id have been a witness and it wouldnt be just her word against his maybe i should talk to ms schaffer i said babe you just read my mind you know jamil youre the only person who ever calls me babe theres a reason for that his smile widened ill try to remember that what happened to richard jamil you mean did he do it i shook my head no i know he didnt do it he did date her jamil said i looked at him what are you saying richards been trying to find a replacement for you so so hes been dating anything that moves just dating i asked jamil swirled his jacket from his shoulder to one arm smoothing the cloth and not looking at me answer the question jamil he looked at me almost smiling then sighed no not just dating i had to ask hes been sleeping around jamil nodded i stood there thinking about that for a second or two richard and i had each been celibate for years separate decisions id certainly changed my lifestyle did i really think hed stay chaste when i hadnt was it any of my business what he did no no it wasnt i finally shrugged hes not my boyfriend anymore jamil and hes a big boy i shrugged again not really sure how i felt about richard sleeping around trying very hard not to feel anything about it because it didnt matter how i felt richard had his own life to live and it didnt include me not in that way im not here to police richards sex life jamil nodded almost to himself good i was worried what you thought id throw a fit and storm off leaving him to his just desserts something like that he said did he have sex with the woman whos made the accusation if you mean intercourse no shes human he said richard doesnt do humans hes afraid theyre too fragile i thought you just said hed been sleeping with ms schaffer having sex but not doing the dirty deed i wasnt a virgin i knew there were alternatives but why alternative methods with humans why not just do it doing the wild thing can release our beast early you dont want to know what happens when youre with a human who doesnt know what you are and you shift on top of them inside them a shadow crossed his face and he looked away you sound like the voice of experience i said he looked slowly back at me and there was something in his face that was suddenly frightening like looking up and realizing that the bars between you and the lion at the zoo arent there anymore that is none of your business i nodded sorry youre right youre absolutely right it was too personal but it was interesting information there had been a point where id pretty much begged richard to stay the night to have sex with me hed said no because it wouldnt be fair until i saw him change into werewolf form i needed to be able to accept the whole package i hadnt been able to do that once the package bled and writhed all over me but now i wondered if part of his hesitation had been simply fear of hurting me maybe i shook my head it didnt matter business if i concentrated really hard maybe i could stay on track we were here to get him out of jail not to worry about why we broke up we could use a little help here with the luggage jason called he had two suitcases under each arm zane and cherry were carrying one coffin they looked like pallbearer bookends nathaniel was lying on his back on the other coffin hed taken off his shirt and unbound his hair his hands were folded across his stomach eyes closed i didnt know whether he was playing dead or trying to get a tan a little help here jason said kicking his foot towards the rest of the luggage two suitcases and a huge trunk still sat unclaimed i walked towards them jesus only one of those suitcases is mine whos the clotheshorse zane and cherry put the coffin gently on the tarmac just one suitcase is mine zane said three of them are mine cherry said she sounded vaguely embarrassed who brought the trunk jeanclaude sent it jason said just in case we do meet with the local master he wanted us to make a good show of it i frowned at the trunk please tell me theres nothing in there that jeanclaude plans on me wearing jason grinned i shook my head i dont want to see it maybe youll get lucky jason said maybe theyll try to kill you instead i frowned at him youre just full of happy thoughts my speciality he said nathaniel turned his head and looked at me hands clasped across his bare stomach i can lift the coffin but its not balanced right for carrying i need help you certainly do i said he blinked up at me one hand raised to block the sun i moved until my body blocked the sun and he could look at me without squinting he smiled up at me whats with the coffin sunbathing i asked the smile wilted around the edges then faded completely its the scene in the crypt he said as if that explained everything it didnt i dont know what youre talking about he raised just his shoulders and head off the coffin like he was doing stomach crunches his abs bunched nicely with the effort you really havent watched my movies have you sorry i said he sat up the rest of the way smoothing his hair back with both hands in a practiced gesture he slipped a silver clasp around the hair and flipped the tail of auburn hair behind his back i thought silver jewelry burned when it touched a lycanthropes skin i said he wiggled his hair settling the silver clasp securely against his neck it does he said a little pain makes the world go round i guess he just stared at me with his strange eyes he was only nineteen but the look on his face was older much older there were no lines on that smooth skin but there were shadows in those eyes that nothing would ever erase cosmetic surgery for the soul was what he needed something to take the terrible burden of knowledge that had made him what he was jason limped over to us loaded with suitcases one of his movies is about a vampire who falls in love with an innocent young human youve seen it i said he nodded i shook my head and picked up a suitcase you got a car for us i asked jamil a van he said great pick up a suitcase and show me the way i dont do luggage if we all help we can load the van in half the time i want to see richard as soon as possible so grab something and stop being such a freaking prima donna jamil stared at me for a long slow count then said when richard replaces you as lupa i wont have to take shit from you fine but until then hop to it besides this isnt giving you shit jamil when i give you shit youll know it he gave a low chuckle he slipped his jacket back on and picked up the trunk it should have taken two strong men to lift it he carried it like it weighed nothing he walked off without a backward glance leaving me to get the last suitcase zane and cherry picked the coffin back up and walked after him jason shuffled after them what about me nathaniel said put your shirt back on and stay with the coffin wouldnt do to have someone make off with damian i know women who would pay me to take the shirt off he said too bad im not one of them i said yeah he said too bad he picked his shirt up off the ground i left him sitting on the coffin in the middle of the tarmac shirt wadded in his hands he looked sort of forlorn in a strange macabre way i felt very sorry for nathaniel hed had a rough life but it wasnt my fault i was paying for his apartment so he didnt have to turn tricks to make ends meet though i knew other strippers at guilty pleasures who managed to make ends meet on their salary maybe nathaniel wasnt good with money big surprise there the van was large black and looked sinister the sort of thing serial killers drive in madefortv movies serial killers did drive vans in real life but they tended to be pale colors with rust spots jamil drove cherry and i rode up front with him the luggage and everyone else went in the back i expected cherry to ask me to sit in the middle because i was at least five inches shorter than she was but she didnt she just crawled into the van in the middle with those long legs tucked up in front of the dashboard the road was well paved almost no potholes and if you held your breath two cars could pass each other without scraping paint trees hugged the road on either side but on one side you caught glimpses of an amazing dropoff and on the other side there was just rocky dirt i preferred the dirt the trees were thick enough that the illusion of safety was there but the trees fell away like a great green curtain and you could suddenly see for miles the illusion was gone and you realized just how high up we were okay it wasnt like rocky mountain high but it would do the job if the van went over the edge falling from high places is one of my least favorite things to do i dont clutch the upholstery like in the airplane but im a flatlander at heart and would be glad to be in the lower valley do you want me to drop you at the police station or take you to the cabins first jamil asked police did you say cabins he nodded cabins rustic living i asked no thank god he said indoor plumbing beds electricity the works if you arent too particular about the decor not a fashion plate not hardly he said cherry sat very still between us hands folded in her lap i realized she wasnt wearing her seat belt my mother would be alive today if shed been wearing hers so im picky about it youre not wearing your seat belt i said cherry looked at me im squashed enough without the seat belt she said i know you could survive a trip through the windshield i said but having you heal that much damage would sort of blow your cover am i supposed to be playing human she asked it was a good question for the townsfolk yeah she fastened her seat belt without any more arguing the wereleopards had taken me to heart as their nimirra they were so glad to have someone act as protector even if it was just a human that they didnt bitch much you should have told me we were trying to blend in id have dressed differently youre right i should have said something truthfully it hadnt occurred to me until just that moment the road spilled down into what passed for flatland here the trees were so thick that it was almost claustrophobic there was still a gentle swell to the land letting you know you were driving over the toes of mountains do you want us to wait for you outside the station jamil asked no you guys sort of stand out how are you going to get to the cabins he asked i shook my head i dont know taxi he looked at me the look was eloquent in myerton i dont think so damn i said drive us to the cabins then ill take the van back into town with jason jamil said i nodded with jason i looked at him why is everyone so solicitous of me i mean i know there may be problems but you guys are being awful cautious i sat up straighter in the seat and stared at the side of jamils face he was watching the road like his life depended on it what arent you guys telling me he hit his turn signal and waited for a pickup truck to go past then turned left between yet more trees itll take longer to get to the cabins jamil what is going on cherry tried her best to sink into the seat but when youre model tall and in the middle its hard to play invisible that one body movement told me she knew too that they both knew something i didnt i looked at her cherry tell me whats going on she sighed and sat up a little straighter if anything happens to you jeanclaudes going to kill us i frowned at her i dont understand jeanclaude couldnt come here himself jamil said it would be seen as an act of war but hes worried about you he told us all that if we let you get killed and he survives your death hell kill us all of us he watched the road as he talked turning onto a gravel road that was so narrow that trees brushed the sides of the van define all i said all of us jamil said were your bodyguards i thought you were richards bodyguard i said and youre his lupa his mate if youre a real bodyguard you cant guard two people you can only guard one at a time why cherry asked i looked at jamil he didnt answer so i did because you cant take a bullet for more than one person and thats what a bodyguard does jamil nodded yeah thats what a bodyguard does you really think anyones going to be shooting at anita the bullets a metaphor jamil said but it doesnt matter bullet knife claws whatever it is i take it he pulled into a wide gravel turnaround and a huge clearing there were small white boxy cabins scattered around the clearing like a motel that had been cut into pieces there was a neon sign pale in the sunlight that said blue moon cabins anita is our nimirra shes supposed to protect us not the other way around i agreed with her id picked zane and cherry not for their bodyguarding ability but because they didnt mind sharing blood with the vampires even among the wereleopards most of them didnt like donating they seemed to think being a blood cocktail for the vamps was worse than sex for money i wasnt sure i agreed with them but i wasnt about to force them to do it if they didnt want to i didnt donate blood and i was sleeping with one of the undead no i said i didnt agree to this i can take care of myself thank you very much i opened the door and jamil reached across and grabbed my arm his hand looked very dark against the paleness of my arm i turned very slowly and looked at him it was not a friendly look let go of me anita please you are one of the toughest humans ive ever met you are the most dangerous human female ive ever seen his hand squeezed just enough for me to feel the immense strength in it he could probably deadlift an elephant if it didnt wiggle too much he could certainly crush my arm but you are human and the things youre up against arent i stared at him cherry sat very still between us halfpinned by jamils body let go of me jamil his hand tightened it was going to be a hell of a bruise just this once anita stay in the background or youre going to get us all killed jamils body was extended across the seat across cherry i was on the edge of the seat butt half in the air neither he nor i were balanced very well his grip was on the middle of my forearm not a good place to hold on what you fuzzballs keep forgetting is that strength isnt enough leverage theres the ticket he frowned at me obviously puzzled his hand tightened just this side of serious injury you cant fight this anita what do you want me to say uncle jamil smiled uncle okay yeah say uncle admit that just this once you cant take care of yourself i pushed myself out of the van tucking my legs so he was suddenly trying to hold my entire body weight with a onehanded grip on my forearm my arm slipped through his fingers i let myself fall to the ground going for the long blade down my back not worrying about trying to stand my right hand went for the browning but i knew i wouldnt make it in time i was trusting that jamil wasnt going to kill me we were grandstanding if i was wrong on that i was about to die jamil spilled over the seat arms reaching for me trusting in his own way that i wouldnt blow his head off he knew i had the gun he was treating me like a shapeshifter who knew the rules you didnt kill over small stuff you bled each other but you didnt kill i sliced his arm open from a nearly prone position there was a moment of utter surprise on his face he hadnt known about the third blade or its length and getting sliced open is always a shock he jerked backwards out of sight like someone had pulled him but i knew better he was just that fast i had time to get to one knee before he bounded onto the hood of the van crouched like the predator he was i had the browning pointed at him i got to my feet gun nice and steady on the middle of his body standing didnt help things i didnt shoot better standing but somehow i wanted to be on my feet jamil watched me but made no move to stop me maybe he was afraid to try not of the gun but of himself i had hurt him blood was splashing all over those pretty white clothes his entire body vibrated with the desire to close the distance between us he was pissed and it was four nights until full moon he probably wouldnt kill me but i wasnt going to test the theory he could break my neck with one blow hell he could explode my skull like an egg no more chances i pointed the browning at him onehanded knife still in my left dont do it jamil id hate to lose you over something this stupid a low growl trickled from his lips the sound alone raised the hair at the back of my neck the others were out of the back of the van i had a sense of movement everyone stay back i said anita jason said voice very calm no teasing no jokes anita whats going on ask mr macho there cherry spoke from her seat inside the van she hadnt moved jamil was trying to explain to anita how she couldnt handle herself against shapeshifters and vampires she slid very slowly towards the edge of the seat i kept my gaze on jamil but my peripheral vision was good enough to catch the spots of blood all over the white skin stay in the van cherry dont press me she stopped scooting along the seat and just sat there jamil wanted her to take a backseat when the action starts she is still human jamil growled she is still weak cherrys deep caressing voice said she could have sliced your throat open instead of your arm she could have shot you in the head when you reached for her i still can i said if you dont tone it down jamil lay nearly flat on the hood fingers splayed his entire body trembled with tension something lurked behind that human body swimming up through his eyes his beast pushed against his flesh like a leviathan swimming just below the water so you caught a dark glimpse of something huge and overwhelmingly alien id turned my body in silhouette my left hand with the knife behind my back the back of my hand resting lightly on the top of my butt id fallen into the stance i used at the shooting range when i was shooting targets the gun was pointed at his head now because hed lowered his body mass until it was the biggest target id saved jamils life once he was a good man to have at richards back even if he didnt always like me i didnt always like him so we were even but i respected him and until now i thought he respected me his little show in the van said he still thought of me as a girl once upon a time it had bothered me more to kill people maybe it was years of killing vampires they looked human but somewhere along the way it just didnt bother me to pull the trigger i stared at jamils face looked him right in the eyes and felt that stillness fill me it was like standing in the middle of a buzzing field of white noise i could still hear and see but it all fell away so there was nothing but the gun and jamil and the emptiness my body felt light and ready in my saner moments i worried that i was becoming a sociopath but right now there was nothing but a very calm knowledge that id do it id pull the trigger and watch him die at my feet and feel nothing jamil watched my face and i saw the tension begin to leak out of him he stayed very still until that vibrating energy died down and that awful looming presence of his beast slid below the surface once more then he very very slowly sat back on his knees still watching my face i kept the gun pointed on him i knew how fast they could move fast as a wolf maybe faster like nothing this side of hell you really would do it he said youd kill me you bet he took a deep breath and it shuddered down his body reminding me strangely of a bird settling its feathers its over he said youre lupa you outrank me i lowered the gun carefully still looking at him still trying to keep a feel for where everyone else was standing please tell me that this wasnt some sort of dominance crap jamil gave a smile that was almost embarrassed i thought i was trying to make a point but i wasnt ive spent the last month down here having to explain to the local pack how we ended up with a human lupa how im outranked by a human woman i shook my head and pointed the gun at the ground you stupid son of a bitch your pride is wounded that im higher in the pack than you are he nodded yeah you guys just drive me crazy i said i was almost yelling we do not have time for macho bullshit zane leaned against the van near cherry he was very careful to keep his hands down and move slowly no sudden moves you couldnt have taken jamil without the knife and the gun you wont always have them with you is that a threat i asked he raised his hands upward just an observation hey folks a man stepped out of one of the cabins he was tall thin with shoulderlength grey hair and a darker mustache the hair and the lines in his face said he was over fifty the body that showed from the tshirt and jeans looked lean and younger hed frozen in the doorway hands on the wooden edges of the doorjamb easy there little lady i pointed the gun at him because under that calm exterior there was enough power to raise goose bumps on my skin and he wasnt even trying this is verne jamil said he owns the cabins i lowered the gun to the ground he the local ulfric or do they have something scarier hiding in the woods verne laughed and started walking towards us he moved in an almost clumsy roll like his arms and legs were too long for his body but it was deceptive he was playing human for me i wasnt fooled you spotted me pretty damn quick there little lady i put the browning up because to keep it out would be rude i was here as his guest in more than one way besides i had to trust someone enough to put the gun up i couldnt keep it naked in my hand the entire trip i still had the naked blade complete with blood it needed to be cleaned before i could sheathe it id gummed up a couple of smaller sheaths from not cleaning them well enough nice to meet you verne but dont call me little lady i started to wipe the blood on the edge of the black jacket blacks good for that dont you ever give an inch jamil asked i glanced at him there was blood all over his nice white clothes no i said i motioned him over to me he frowned what i want to use your shirt to wipe the blood off the blade he just stared at me come on jamil the shirt is already ruined jamil pulled the shirt over his head in one smooth motion he threw the shirt at me and i caught it onehanded i started cleaning the blade with the unstained part of the shirt verne laughed he had one of those deep rolling chuckles that matched his gravelly voice no wonder richards been having such a hard time finding a replacement for you you are a solid castiron ballbusting bitch i looked at his smiling face i think it was a compliment besides truth was truth i wasnt down here to win miss congeniality i was down here to rescue richard and to stay alive bitch was just about the right speed for that the outside of the cabins were white and looked sort of cheap the interiors werent honeymoon cabins but they were amazingly roomy there was a queensize bed in the one i was given there was a desk against one wall with a reading lamp there was an extra chair in front of a picture window the chair was blue plush and comfortable it sat on a small throw rug that looked homemade and was woven in shades of blue the woods were hardwood and polished to a honeyed gleam the beds comforter was royal blue there was a bedside table complete with a lamp and a phone the walls were pale blue there was even a painting over the bed it was a reproduction of van goghs starry night frankly any of van goghs work done after he started going seriously nuts creeps me out but it was a good choice for a blue room for all i knew the other cabins had matadors done on velvet but this was okay the bathroom was standard white with a small window high over the bathtub the bathroom looked like standard motel issue except for a blue bowl of potpourri that smelled like musk and gardenia verne had informed me that this was the largest cabin left i needed the floor space two coffins take up a lot of room i wasnt sure i wanted to have asher and damian in my room permanently but i didnt have time to argue i wanted to go see richard as soon as possible we could always argue about who got the vamps as bunk mates after i saw richard i made three phone calls before we went to the jail the first was to the number that daniel had given me to let him know we were in town no one answered the second call was to catherine to let her know id arrived safely i got her machine the third call was to the lawyer that catherine had recommended carl belisarius a woman with a very good phone voice answered when she found out who i was she was sort of excited which puzzled me she forwarded me to belisariuss cell phone something was up which was probably bad a deep rich male voice answered belisarius here anita blake i assume that catherine maisongillette told you who i am just a moment ms blake he pushed a button and there was silence i was on hold when he came back on the phone i could hear wind and traffic hed stepped outside i am very glad to hear from you ms blake what the fuck is going on excuse me i said tone less than friendly he wont see me catherine gave me the impression that he needed a lawyer i traveled to this godless piece of real estate and he wont see me he says he didnt hire me shit i said softly im sorry mr belisarius i had a thought did you tell him that i hired you on his behalf will that make a difference truthfully i dont know either itll help or hell tell you to go to hell hes already done that i am not cheap ms blake even if he refuses my services someone has to pay for the day dont worry mr belisarius ill take care of it do you have that kind of money how much are we talking about i asked he mentioned a fee i did my best not to whistle in his ear i counted slowly to five and said calmly youll get your money you have that kind of money i took catherines word for a lot of things on this forgive me if im starting to be suspicious no i understand richards giving you a hard time so youre giving me one he gave a rough laugh all right ms blake all right ill try not to pass the buck but i want some assurances can you pay my fee i raise the dead for a living mr belisarius its a rare talent i can pay your fee and i could but it sort of hurt to do it i wasnt raised poor but i was raised to appreciate the value of a buck and belisarius was a little outside of outrageous send word to richard that i hired you call me back if it makes a difference he may refuse to see either of us youre paying a great deal of money ms blake especially if i take the case i assumed you and mr zeeman were close in some way its a long story i said were sort of hating each other right now a lot of money for someone you hate he said dont you start too i said he laughed again his laugh was more normal than his speech almost a bray maybe he didnt practice his laugh for the courtroom i knew he practiced that rich rolling voice ill send the message ms blake hopefully ill be calling you back call me even if he says no at least ill know what to expect when i come down to the jail youll come down even if he refuses to see you belisarius asked yeah i said i look forward to meeting you ms blake you intrigue me i bet you say that to all the girls to very few ms blake he hung up jason came out of the bathroom as i hung up he was wearing the suit id never seen him in anything except tshirts and jeans or leather and less it was odd to see him standing there in a navy blue suit white shirt and a thin white tie with a tastefully small design running through it when you looked close the tie was silk and the print was tiny fleur de lis i knew who had picked out the tie the suit was a better cut than most off the rack but jeanclaude had ruined me for off the rack no matter how nice the fit he buttoned the first button on the jacket and smoothed his hands through his blond hair how do i look i shook my head like a person he grinned you sound surprised i smiled ive just never seen you look like a grownup he fake pouted at me lip pushed out youve seen me nearly naked and i didnt look grownup i shook my head and smiled in spite of myself id changed my clothes in the bedroom while he changed in the bathroom i found a few dark spots of blood on the red blouse as it dried it would turn black and look even worse which was why the blouse was soaking in the sink red shows blood no matter what people say the black jeans had escaped unstained as far as i could tell a few spots of blood are hard to find on black black or navy blue hides blood best i guess a really dark brown would work but i dont own much brown so i dont know for sure the fresh blouse was a pale almost icy lavender it had been a gift from my stepmother judith when i opened the box at christmas and saw the pale blouse i assumed she bought me yet another piece of clothing that would look better on her blond ice princess body than on my darker one but the pure clear color actually looked pretty spiffy id even been gracious enough to tell judith i was wearing it i think it was the first gift in ten years that i hadnt exchanged i was still for in the gift department for her oh well black dress pants with a belt wide enough for the browning and wider than was fashionable black flats and i was ready id added just a touch of makeup eye shadow mascara a hint of blush and lipstick i tried not to think why id dressed up it wasnt for the local cops jason and i were probably both overdressed for the locals of course if wed shown up in jeans and tshirts wed have been underdressed the only really good thing to wear to meet police is a uniform and a badge anything else and you are not in the club there was a law being discussed in washington dc right now that might give vampire executioners what amounted to federal marshal status it was being pushed hard by senator brewster whose daughter had gotten munched by a vampire of course he was also pushing to revoke vampires rights as legal citizens federal status for executioners maybe revoking vamps legal rights i didnt think so some vampires would have to do something pretty gruesome to give the antivamp lobby that much push in march vampire executioners had been officially licensed it was a state license because murder was a state not a federal crime but i understood the need for federal status for vampire executioners we didnt just kill we hunted but once we crossed out of our licensed area we were on shaky ground the court order was valid as long as the state we crossed into agreed to an extradition order the extradition order was then used to validate the original order of execution my preference was to get a second order of execution every time i crossed a state line but that took time and sometimes youd lose the vamp to yet another jurisdiction and have to start all over again one enterprising vampire crossed seventeen states before he was finally caught and killed the general run if they run is maybe two or three which is why most vampire executioners are licensed in more than one state in our own way we have territories sort of like vampires within that territory we kill outside of it its someone elses job but there are only ten of us and thats not a lot for a country with one of the largest vampire populations in the world we arent constantly busy most of us have day jobs i mean if the vampires had been bad enough to keep us hopping then theyd never have made legal status but the more vamps you get in an area the higher your crime rate just like with humans having to stop every time you left your licensed area made it harder to do our jobs having no real status as a police officer made it impossible to enter an investigation unless invited sometimes we werent invited in until the body count was pretty damn high my largest body count for a vampire was twentythree twentythree dead before we caught him there had been higher body counts back in the fifties gerald mallory sort of the grandfather of the business had slain a kiss of vampires that took out over a hundred a kiss of vampires is like a gaggle of geese its the group name poetic aint it the phone rang i picked it up and it was belisarius hell see us together ill try to have something to tell you by the time you get here he hung up i took a big breath in through my nose and let it out in a rush through my mouth whats wrong jason asked nothing youre nervous about seeing richard he said dont be so dammed smart he grinned sorry like hell i said lets go we went the drive to myerton took longer than it had to because i was driving an unfamiliar van on very narrow roads it made me nervous jason finally said can i drive please well get there before dark shut up i said he shut up smiling we did finally drive into myerton the town consisted of a main street that was paved and looked suspiciously like a twolane highway with buildings hugging the edges there was a stoplight with a second much smaller gravel road spilling red clay dust across the blacktop the towns only stoplight made you notice the two fastfood restaurants and a momandpop diner that actually had a bigger crowd than the dairy queen either the food was good or the dairy queen wasnt jamil had given me directions to the police station he said to drive down the main street turn right you cant miss it whenever someone says that it means one of two things either theyre right and its obvious or its hidden and youll never find it without a detailed map where x marks the spot i turned right at the stoplight the van hit a pothole and rolled like a great beast treading water i wished i had my jeep the gravel road was the true main street of the town buildings with a raised wooden sidewalk in front of them lined one side of the street i spotted a grocery store and a woodworkers shop selling handmade furniture they had a rocking chair out in front that still had rough grey bark on parts of the wooden frame very rustic very nifty another shop sold herbs and homemade jellies though this wasnt the time of year for it houses lined the other side of the street they werent the newer midwestern look that has taken over large parts of the south the houses were mostly one story on cinder blocks or red rock bases they were covered with side shingles running strongly to offwhite and grey one yard had a herd of ceramic deer and a crop of lawn gnomes so thick it looked like they should be selling them there were mountains at the end of the street and trees like a thick green curtain we were about to drive back into the forest and i hadnt seen anything that looked like a police station great it has to be right here jason said i checked my rearview mirror no traffic and stopped what do you see that i dont i asked shangda he said i looked at him excuse me on the porch at the end of the street i looked where he was looking a tall man sat slumped in a lawn chair he was wearing a white tshirt jeans no shoes and a billed cap pulled low his tan stood out strongly against the whiteness of the shirt large hands held a can of soda or maybe beer just an earlymorning pickmeup thats shangda hes our packs second enforcer hes hati to jamils sk—Üll ah the light dawned hes guarding richard so the police station has to be nearby jason nodded i looked at the slumped figure he didnt look particularly alert at first glance he almost blended into the scene until you realized the tshirt was spotless and new the jeans had creases as if theyd been ironed and you realized though he was tanned the skin coloring wasnt just from the sun but it wasnt until he moved his head very slowly and looked straight at us that i realized just how good the act was even from a distance there was an intensity in his gaze that was almost unnerving i knew we suddenly had his full attention and all hed done was move his head shit i said yeah jason said shangdas new he transferred in from san francisco bay pack no one fought him when he came in as hati no one wanted the job that badly jason pointed across the street is that it it was a low onestory building made of whitepainted cinder blocks there was a small gravel parking lot out front but no cars the van took up most of the parking lot i parked as close to the side as i could hearing the soft swish of tree branches along the top of the van there was probably a police car out there someplace that would be parking beside me i think they had room there was a small wooden sign elegantly carved hanging beside the door it read police station that was it the only hint couldnt miss it jamil had a sense of humor or maybe he was still pissed that id cut him childish we got out i felt shangdas gaze on me he was yards away but the power of his attention crept down my skin raising the hair on my arms i glanced his way and for a second our eyes met the hair at the back of my neck stood to attention jason came to stand beside me lets go inside i nodded and we walked to the door if i didnt know better id say shangda doesnt like me hes loyal to richard and youve hurt him badly i glanced at him you dont seem mad at me arent you loyal to richard i was there the night richard fought marcus shangda wasnt are you saying i was right to leave richard no im saying i understand why you couldnt handle it thanks jason he smiled besides maybe i have designs on your body jeanclaude would kill you he shrugged whats life without a little danger i shook my head jason got to the door first but didnt try to open it for me he knew me better than that i opened the mostly glass doors i guess the doors were also a clue everything else on the street had doors like youd see on a house the glass doors were modern business doors the interior was painted white including the long barlike desk across from the door there were some wanted posters tacked to a bulletin board to the left of the door and a radio system behind the desk but other than that it could have been the reception room for a dentist the guy sitting behind the desk was big even sitting down you had a sense of size his shoulders were almost as broad as i was tall his hair was very short and still curled in tight ringlets hed have had to shave his head to get rid of the curls my executioners license is in a nice fakeleather carrying case it had my picture on it and looked damned official but it wasnt a badge it wasnt even a license good in this state but it was all i had to flash so i flashed it i went in holding the license out in front because i was bringing a gun into a police station cops tended not to like that im anita blake vampire executioner the cop moved just his eyes his hands were hidden behind the desk we didnt call for an executioner im not here on official business i said i stood in front of the desk i started to put the license away but he held his hand out for it and i gave it to him he studied the license while he asked why are you here im a friend of richard zeeman his grey eyes flicked up then it wasnt a friendly look he tossed the license back on top of the desk i picked it up is there a problem officer i read his nameplate maiden he shook his head no problem except that your friend is a damned rapist i never understand why the meanest son of a bitch in the world always seems to have a girlfriend im not his girlfriend i said im exactly what i said i was his friend maiden stood and he looked every inch of his sixfootplus frame he wasnt just tall he was bulky hed probably been a wrestler or a football player in high school the muscle had started to melt into a general bulk and he was carrying about twenty pounds around the waist that he didnt need but i wasnt fooled he was big and tough and used to it the gun around his waist matched the rest of him it was a chromeplated colt python long barrel with heavy black custom grips good for hunting elephants a little much for scaring drunks on a saturday night who are you he pointed a thumb at jason just a friend jason said he smiled trying to look harmless he wasnt as good at looking harmless as i was but he was close beside officer maiden we both looked sort of fragile her friend or zeemans jason gave a big goodhumored smile im everyones friend maiden didnt smile he just looked at jason giving him a cold hard stare out of those dark grey eyes maiden didnt have any better luck staring jason down than i did jason kept smiling maiden kept staring i finally touched jasons arm ever so lightly it was enough he dropped his eyes blinked but the smile never faltered but it was enough for maiden to feel hed won the staring contest maiden lumbered out from behind the desk he moved like he was aware that he was big like in his own ears the earth trembled as he moved he was big but he wasnt that big of course i wasnt going to point it out to him a second man came out of a small door to the right of the desk he was wearing a pale tan suit that fit him like an elegant glove the white shirt was ribbed down the front and he had one of those string ties with a hunk of gold at his throat his eyes were large black and surprised when they saw me his hair was cut very short but stylish the hand he extended for me to shake had a diamond pinkie ring and a college class ring on it could this vision of loveliness be the infamous ms blake i smiled before i could stop myself you must be belisarius he nodded call me carl im anita and this is jason he shook hands with jason still smiling still pleasant he turned to maiden may we go see my client now the two of you can go but not him maiden jerked another thumb at jason sheriff said let the two of you in no one said anything about anybody else jason opened his mouth i touched his arm thats fine and the gun stays out here he said i didnt want to give up the gun but it made me think better of maiden that hed spotted it sure i said i pulled the browning out from under the jacket i hit the slide and spilled the clip into my other hand i jacked the gun open to show the chamber was empty and handed the whole shooting match to maiden didnt trust me to unload it for you i figured the browning might be too small for your hands requires fine motor skills you giving me shit he said i nodded yeah im giving you shit he smiled then he looked the browning over before he put it in a desk drawer along with the clip not a bad gun if you cant handle anything bigger he locked the drawer another brownie point for maiden its not size that counts maiden its performance his smile widened to a grin your friend still has to wait out here i said that was fine i meant it maiden nodded and led the way back through the door that belisarius had come out of there were two doors in the middle of the long white hallway one said ladies the other men id hoped you coming out of this door meant you were visiting richard im afraid not mr zeeman has not relented relented maiden said relented now thats a nice lawyer word reading improves your vocabulary officer maiden you should try it sometime though i suppose you can get by with just looking at the pictures ooh im cut to the quick on that one maiden said if you cut us do we not bleed belisarius asked maiden shocked the hell out of me by giving the next line if you tickle us do we not laugh belisarius clapped softly touch–π officer maiden big and well read i said im impressed he pulled a chain out of his pocket with keys on the end of it dont tell the other cops theyd think i was a sissy i looked up at him all the way up at him its not reading shakespeare that makes you a sissy maiden its that damn gun only pansies carry that much hardware he unlocked the door at the end of the hallway got to carry something big ms blake balances me out when i run that made me laugh he opened the door and ushered us through he locked the door behind us and went down a long white stretch of hallway with two closed doors on either side wait here ill go make sure your boyfriend is ready to see you hes not my boyfriend i said it was becoming automatic like an involuntary reflex maiden smiled and unlocked the door at the far end he vanished through it you and officer maiden seem to have hit it off ms blake cops dish out a lot of shit trick is dont take it personally and dish back ill remember that next time i looked up belisarius it might not work for you youre a lawyer and youre wealthy and im not an attractive woman he said that too though that can work against me with policemen belisarius nodded maiden stepped back through the far door he was smiling like something had amused the hell out of him i was betting i wasnt going to think it was funny i told zeeman that for a fucking pervert he had a cute girlfriend ill bet thats not what you said i said he nodded i asked him why with a nice piece of ass like you for his girlfriend he had to go out and rape somebody whatd he say i asked face as blank as i could make it he said youre not his girlfriend i nodded see i told you so maiden opened the door wide and motioned us through ring the buzzer when you want out we stepped through and he said enjoy as he locked us in they must have gotten a deal on white paint because the entire room was white even the floor it was like standing in the middle of a blizzard two bunks one on top the other the bars on a small window even the toilet and sink were white the only color was the bars that formed a threesided cage richard sat on the other side of the bars looking at us he was sitting on the lower bunk his hair fell in thick waves nearly hiding his face in the stark whiteness of the overhead lights the hair looked darker than its normal honey brown almost chestnut he was wearing a pale green dress shirt untucked sleeves rolled back over muscular forearms his dark brown dress slacks were wrinkled from being slept in he unfolded his sixfootoneinch body from the bunk the dress shirt stretched tightly across his shoulders and upper arms hed bulked up a little since last id seen him and hed been pretty muscular to begin with once upon a time it would have been my great pleasure to have peeled that shirt off and seen what was underneath to have run my hands over that lovely chest and those strong arms but that was then and this was a whole new ball game one that i really couldnt win richard came to stand at the bars hands wrapping around them what are you doing here anita his voice wasnt as angry as i feared it would be he sounded almost ordinary and some tightness in the center of my body relaxed belisarius stepped away from us he sat at the table outside the cell and began spreading papers out of his briefcase he tried to look very busy and give us as much privacy as he could it was a nice gesture i heard you were in trouble so you came to rescue me he made it a question his solid brown eyes stared at me searching my face his hair had fallen into his eyes he smoothed it back from his face in an achingly familiar gesture i came to help i dont need your help i didnt do it belisarius interrupted youve been charged with rape mr zeeman i turned and looked at belisarius i thought it was attempted rape ive been reading the file while i was waiting once i had mr zeemans permission to act as his lawyer i got access to the records the rape kit was negative for semen but there was evidence of penetration penetration is enough to constitute rape i never had intercourse with her richard said it never got that far but you did date her i said he looked at me yes i did there was a little anger in his voice now i let it go id probably be grumpy too if i were in jail on trumpedup charges hell id be grumpy even if i had done it the problem mr zeeman is that without semen samples you cant really prove conclusively that you didnt violate ms schaffer if this is a frame its a good one you dated the woman more than once she went out with you and came home beaten up he paged through one of the files there was vaginal bruising some tearing if she wasnt raped it was still very rough becky said she liked it rough richard said quietly when did how rough she liked sex come up in conversation i asked he met my eyes no flinching ready to be angry if i was angry when she was trying to get me to go to bed with her what exactly did she say belisarius asked richard shook his head i dont remember exactly but i told her i was afraid id hurt her she said if i liked it rough she was my girl i walked away from him to stand looking at the closed door i didnt want to be here for this i turned around and he was already staring at me already meeting my gaze is this why you wanted to see both of us at once so id hear all the details he gave a harsh sound almost laughter but bitter a strange look passed over his face once i could have read his every thought on his face in his eyes now i didnt know him sometimes i thought id never known him that wed both been fooling ourselves if you want details i can give you details not about betty but theres lucy and carrie and mira especially lucy and mira i can give you details on them i heard youd been a busy boy i said my voice was softer than i wanted it to be but normal i wasnt going to cry who told you to come down here anita who disobeyed me that first prickling roil of energy crept through the room sometimes you could forget what richard really was he was better at hiding it than any lycanthrope i knew i glanced at belisarius he seemed oblivious good he wasnt sensitive to it but i was the power crept over my skin like a warm wind no one disobeyed you richard someone told you his hands flexed on the bars rubbing over and over i knew he could have ripped them out of the floor he could have knocked a hole through the back wall if he wanted to the fact that he was still in this cage was only because he didnt want out badly enough to blow his cover a mildmannered junior high science teacher could not bend steel bars i leaned close to the bars lowering my voice his otherworldly energy breathed along my skin do you really want to discuss this now in front of a stranger richard leaned in so close his forehead pressed against the bars hes my lawyer doesnt he need to know i leaned in so close i could have touched him through the bars i wanted to touch him he didnt seem quite real this way you really are a babe in the woods on this one arent you ive never been arrested before he said no that was always my job he almost smiled some of that energy leaked away his beast sliding away inside that perfect camouflage i touched the cool metal bars sliding my hands just below his i bet you thought you might be visiting me like this someday but not the other way around he gave a small smile yeah and id bake you a cake with a file in it i smiled you dont need a file richard i slid my hands over his he squeezed my fingers gently you need a good lawyer and i brought you one he stepped away from the bars why do i need a lawyer when im innocent belisarius answered youve been charged with rape the judge has refused you bail son if we cant break her story youre looking at two to five years if were lucky the pictures are in the file she was beat up pretty bad shes a pretty little blond thing shell come into court dressed like everyones favorite second grade teacher the one you had a crush on that smelled like ivory soap he stood up and started walking towards us as he talked well cut your hair cut his hair i exclaimed belasarius frowned at me cut your hair dress you up nice it helps that youre handsome and white but youre still a big stronglooking man he shook his head its not you we have to prove innocent mr zeeman its ms schaffer we have to prove guilty richard frowned what do you mean we have to make her look like the whore of babylon but first ill file a motion that no bail is excessive for a first offense hell you dont even have a traffic ticket ill get you bail how long will it take i asked belisarius looked at me a little too hard is there a time limit im not aware of richard and i looked at each other as if on cue then he said yes and i said no well which is it boys and girls yes or no is there something i need to know here richard looked at me then said no i guess not belisarius didnt like it but he let it go okay kiddies ill take your word for it but if this piece of information that i dont need to know comes up and bites me on the ass i will not be amused it wont i said he shook his head if it does i will leave mr zeeman high and dry you will be finding yourself a new lawyer faster than you can say penitentiary i didnt do anything wrong richard said how can this be happening why would she cry rape on you i asked somebody did it belisarius said if not you then who richard shook his head betty dates a lot i know of at least three other men myself well need their names why he asked son if you are going to argue with me every step of the way this wont work i just dont want to drag anyone else into this richard i said you are in trouble here let carl do his job please richard looked at me you dropped everything to ride to my rescue huh i smiled pretty much he shook his head howd jeanclaude feel about that i looked away not meeting his eyes he wasnt thrilled but he wants you out of jail ill just bet he does look kiddies we dont have a lot of time here if you two cant curb the personal stuff maybe anita here should leave i nodded i agree youre going to have to tell him details about ms schaffer that i dont want to hear and you need to be able to talk freely about her are you jealous richard asked i took in a deep breath and let it out i would have liked to have said no but he could smell a lie id been doing okay until hed made that crack about betty being his girl for the rough stuff that had bugged me i have no right to be jealous of you richard but you are arent you he asked he watched my face while he asked it i had to force myself to meet his eyes while i answered i wanted to dunk my head and i couldnt stop the rush of color up my face yeah im jealous happy he nodded yes im out of here i wrote the phone number of the cabin on belisariuss notebook and pressed the buzzer to be let out im glad you came anita richard said i kept my back turned to the door hoping maiden would hurry i wish i could say the same richard the door opened i escaped have fun visiting your boyfriend maiden asked as he followed me down the hall i waited at the second locked door hes not my boyfriend everyone keeps saying that maiden unlocked the door and held it open maybe its a case of the lady protesting too much take your library card and shove it maiden ooh he said that was nasty wonder if i can think of a comeback half that good let me have my gun maiden he locked the door behind us jason was sitting in the little row of chairs across from the desk he looked up can we go home now wasnt officer maiden entertaining i asked he wouldnt let me play with his handcuffs jason said maiden went behind the desk and unlocked the drawer he brought out the browning slipped the clip back in it and pulled the slide back which jacked a shell into the chamber he checked the safety and handed it to me butt first you think myertons dangerous enough to need to carry one in the chamber i asked maiden looked at me it was a long look as if he were trying to tell me something you never know he said finally we stood staring at each other for a few frozen moments then i put the browning in the holster with the bullet ready to go though i checked the safety twice didnt usually go around with a live round in the chamber made me nervous made me more nervous that maiden might be trying to warn me of course he might just be yanking my chain some cops especially small town ones tended to give me grief being a vampire executioner made some of them want to trade macho shit with me like getting me to carry a live round in the chamber have a nice day blake you too maiden i said i had the door open jason at my back when maiden said be careful out there his eyes were guarded there was nothing to read on his face i am not a subtle person big surprise you got something to say maiden i asked im going to be taking my lunch break after you leave i looked at him its ten oclock in the morning little early for lunch dont you think just thought youd like to know i wont be here ill try and squelch my disappointment i said he flashed a quick grin then stood i gotta lock the door behind you since im leaving the desk unattended locking belasarius in with richard i wont be gone that long he said he opened the door for us waiting for us to go outside i dont like games maiden what the fuck is going on he wasnt smiling when he said if the fancy lawyer gets bail for your boyfriend id leave town youre not suggesting he jump bail are you officer his family has been here almost from the first night he was taken into custody before that it was the scientists that hes been working with a lot of nice upstanding citizens standing around for witnesses but the nice upstanding citizens wont be here forever maiden and i looked at each other i stood there for a minute wondering if hed stop hinting and just tell me what the hell was going on he didnt i nodded at him thanks maiden dont thank me he said he locked the door behind us my hand wasnt on the butt of the browning but it was sort of close to it itd be silly to draw the gun on a nice august morning in a town with a population lower than most college dorms what was that all about jason asked if we dont get richard out hes going to get hurt the only reason he hasnt been yet is that there have been too many witnesses too many people to ask questions if the cops are in on it jason said why would maiden warn us hes not happy about being in on it maybe oh hell i dont know but it means that someone wanted richard in jail for a reason a pickup truck pulled across the street in front of the little grey house that shangda was camped out in four men jumped out of the back there was at least one more in the cab he slid out of sight and they formed a semicircle at the base of the porch one of them had a baseball bat well well jason said you think if we bang on the doors and yell for police help well get it i shook my head maiden did help us he warned us im all warm and cozy with the effort jason said yeah i said i started walking across the street jason followed a couple of steps behind i was thinking as hard as i could i had a gun and they might not but if i killed somebody id be bunking with richard myertons legal system didnt seem to take to well to strangers shangda stood on the porch looking down at the men hed taken off the billed cap his black hair was cut very short on the sides and longer on top the hair was shiny with gel but squashed flat from the cap he stood balanced on his bare feet long arms loose at his sides he wasnt in a fighting stance yet but i knew the signs his eyes flicked to us and i knew hed seen us the thugs hadnt yet amateur thugs didnt mean they werent dangerous but it meant you might be able to bluff them professional muscle tended to call a bluff a small elderly woman came through the screen door to stand next to shangda she leaned heavily on a cane her back bowed her grey and white hair was cut very short and permed in one of those tight hairdos that elderly women seem so fond of she wore an apron over a pink housedress her kneehigh hose were rolled down over fuzzy slippers glasses perched on a small nose she shook a bony fist at the men you boys get off my property the man with the baseball bat said now millie this has got nothing to do with you this is my grandson youre threatening she said he aint her grandson another man said he was wearing a faded flannel shirt open like a jacket are you calling me a liar mel cooper the woman asked i didnt say that mel said if wed been someplace more private id have just wounded one of them it would have gotten their attention and called the fight off but id have bet almost any amount of money that if i shot one of them the mysterious sheriff would ride to their rescue maybe the plan was to get more of us in jail i was too new on the scene to even make an educated guess jason and i walked up onto the grass mel was the closest to us he turned showing a stained undershirt and a beer gut beneath the flannel shirt ooh charming who the hell are you he asked well arent you just mr smooth he took a menacing step towards me i smiled at him he frowned at me answer the fucking question girlie who are you doesnt matter who she is the one with the baseball bat said this isnt any of her business leave it alone or youll get what hes going to get he motioned with his head at shangda i get to the beat the crap out of you too i said oh goody baseball bat frowned at me too i had two of them puzzled confusion to my enemies the woman shook a bony fist at them again you get off my property or i will call sheriff wilkes one of the men laughed and another said wilkes will be along when were finished baseball bat said come down off that porch boy or were coming up after you he was ignoring me he was ignoring jason they werent just amateur muscle they were stupid amateur muscle shangdas voice was surprisingly deep very calm there was no fear in it big surprise but there was an undercurrent of eagerness as if under that calmness he was itching to hurt them if i come down off this porch you will not enjoy it the man with the baseball bat wheeled his weapon of choice in a quick professional circle he used it like he knew how maybe hed played ball in high school oh ill enjoy it china boy china boy jason said i didnt have to see his face to know he was smiling not very original is it i commented nope mel turned towards us and another man moved with him are you making fun of us i nodded oh yeah you think i wont hit you because youre a girl mel asked it was tempting to say no i think you wont hit me because i have a gun but i didnt say it once you pull a gun in a fight youve pushed the violence level to a height where death is a very real possibility i didnt want anyone dead with the cops waiting to ride down and sweep us up didnt want to go to jail i have a black belt in judo but mels companion was almost as big as officer maiden and not half as pretty they both outweighed me and jason by a hundred pounds apiece or more theyd been big most of their lives they thought it made them tough up until this moment it probably had in fact it still might i wasnt going to stand there and trade blows with them id loose whatever i was going to do had to be quick and take my opponent out immediately anything less and i stood a very good chance of getting seriously hurt id bet on me against any bad guy my size trouble was as usual none of the bad guys were my size there was a tightness in my gut a nervous tremble i realized with something close to shock that i was more afraid right now than i had been with jamil in the truck this wasnt a dominance game with rules no one was going to say uncle when someone was bleeding scared who me but it had been a long time since id stood up to the bad guys without pulling a weapon was i becoming too dependent on hardware maybe jason and i moved back sliding a little away from each other you need room to fight the thought occurred that id never really seen jason fight he could have thrown the pickup truck they came in across the street but i didnt know if he knew how to fight if you throw human beings around like toys people can get badly hurt i didnt want jason in jail either dont kill anyone i said jason smiled but it was just a baring of teeth gee youre no fun that first prickle of energy that said shapeshifter breathed along my body mel had been moving forward in a flatfooted untrained movement no martial arts no boxing just big the other guy was in a stance he knew what he was doing jason could heal a broken jaw in less than a day i couldnt i wanted mel but hed stopped moving forward there were goose bumps on his hairy arms what the hell was that he was big and stupid but he was psychic enough to feel a shapeshifter interesting who the hell are we what the hell was that mel you need better questions i said fuck you he said i smiled and motioned him forward with both hands come and get it mel if you think youre man enough he let out a roar and ran at me he literally ran at me with his beefy arms wide like he was going to do a bear hug the bigger guy with him rushed jason i had a sense of movement and knew shangda wasnt on the porch anymore there was no time to be afraid no time to think just to move to do what id done a thousand times in practice in the dojo but never in real life never for real i ducked mels outstretched arms and did two things almost simultaneously i caught his left arm as he went past and swept his legs out from under him he fell heavily to his knees and i got a joint lock on his arm i really hadnt decided to break the arm a joint lock on an elbow hurts enough that most people will negotiate after you prove just how much it hurts mel didnt give me time i caught a flash of the blade i broke his arm it made a thick wet sound flopping loose like a chicken wing bent backwards he shrieked screaming didnt cover the sound the blade was in his other hand but he seemed to have forgotten it for the moment drop the knife mel i said he tried to get to his feet one knee hyperextended to the side i kicked the knee and heard it give a deep low pop a bone breaking is a crisp sharp sound a joint doesnt break as clean but it breaks easier he fell on the ground writhing screaming throw the knife away mel i was yelling at him the knife went airborne lost across the fence into the next yard i stepped away from mel just in case he had another surprise everybody else had been busy too the big one that had attacked jason was lying in a heap by the pickup truck there was a fresh dent in the side of the truck as if hed been thrown into the side of it he probably had a third man lay in a crumpled heap at the foot of the porch steps he wasnt moving another man was trying to crawl away one leg dangling behind him like a broken tail he was crying shangda was trying to break through the man with the baseball bats defenses jason was fighting a tall thin man with muscles corded along his bare arms he was in a low fighting stance tae kwon do or jujitsu shangda took two blows on each arm from the baseball bat then he took the bat away from him he broke the bat into two large pieces the man turned to run shangda started to stab him in the back with the broken end of the bat i yelled dont kill him shangda flipped the broken wood in his hand and smashed the unbroken end against the mans skull he went to his knees so suddenly it was startling the tall man fighting jason crept forward in a fast crab movement that looked sort of silly but his foot lashed out and jason had to throw himself back onto the ground jason kicked at him but the tall man leaped over the kick so high and so gracefully that he seemed to float in the air for a moment sirens wailed coming quickly closer baseball bat fell forward onto his face he never tried to catch himself he was out for the count the only one of the bad guys standing was the tall man jason scrambled to his feet quickly enough to stay just ahead of the punches and kicks but not well enough to hurt him back super strength does not mean super skill shangda started to move in to help jason looked at shangda and that was all the tall man needed he landed a kick to the side of jasons head that stunned him and left him on his knees on the ground the man turned and i saw the roundhouse kick coming it was a kick that could snap someones neck i was closer than shangda i didnt even think about it i moved forward and knew it wouldnt be in time but the tall man saw the movement he switched his attention from jason to me i was suddenly in a defensive stance he reversed the kick and i managed to avoid it because he was off balance there were two police cars skidding down the street towards us shangda stopped moving forward i think we both thought the fight was over the tall man thought otherwise the kick was just a blur of motion i got one arm up in a partial block my arm went numb and the next thing i knew i was flat on my back staring up at the sky it didnt even hurt he could have moved in and killed me because for a second i couldnt move there was no sound for that frozen second just me on the grass blinking upward then i could hear my blood pounding in my ears i took a deep gasping breath and i could hear human voices again a mans voice yelled freeze motherfucker i tried to say colorful but no sound came out i could taste blood in my mouth my face didnt hurt that much yet i was sort of numb i opened my mouth just to see if i could i could my jaw wasnt broken great i raised one arm upward and managed to say help me up jason said theyve got guns pointed at us millie came down off the porch with her cane she looked funny from my angle like a fuzzyfooted giant dont you be pointing guns at my grandson and his friends these men attacked them attacked them said a mans voice looks like your grandson and his friends attacked them i fumbled my id out of my jacket pocket and held it up in the air i could probably have sat up on my own but since id taken a hit i might as well use it i was hurt and the more hurt the cops thought i was the less likely wed be going to jail if only the bad guys had been hurt then wed have all ended up in jail on assault charges or worse i hadnt checked for pulses in at least two of the thugs theyd been lying awfully still this way we could all press assault charges they could put us all in jail or none in jail or that was the plan as plans go id had better ones i was lucky my jaw wasnt broken anita blake vampire executioner i said the announcement would have had a little more oomph if i hadnt been flat on my back but hey you do what you can i did roll onto one side my mouth had filled with enough blood that i either had to spit or swallow i spat onto the grass even rolling onto my side made the world spin i wondered for a second or two if i was going to spit up more on the grass than just blood the nausea passed leaving me worried about a concussion id had them before and they usually made me sick to my stomach i couldnt see millie anymore but i could hear her you put up those guns billy wilkes or i will tan your hide with my cane now miss millie the male voice said i repeated who i was and said i need some help to stand can my people help me up please the male voice sheriff wilkes i presumed sounded a little uncertain but said they can move jason grabbed the arm that was holding my id up in the air he looked down at me and pulled me to my feet it was too quick and i didnt have to pretend that the world went spinning when my knees buckled i didnt fight it i slid to my knees and shangda took my other arm between the two of them they got me standing and facing the cops sheriff wilkes was about five foot eight and he was wearing a pale blue smokey the bear hat and a matching uniform he looked trim and in shape like he worked out and took it seriously the gun at his side was a ten mil beretta it was holstered the day was looking up he stared at me with eyes a dark solid trustworthy brown he took the hat off and wiped sweat from his forehead his hair was a pale salt and pepper and made me put his age at over forty anita blake ive heard of you what are you doing in our town i spat another mouthful of blood into the grass and managed to stand more than sag between shangda and jason truth was i could have stood on my own but all the bad guys were on the ground even the one that had kicked me was down for the count shangda must have stepped in after i went down i knew jason couldnt have taken the tall man i came to see a friend in your jail richard zeeman friend he made it a question yeah friend there were two deputies behind wilkes they were both over six feet tall one of them had a scar that went from eyebrow to jaw on one side jagged more a broken bottle than a knife the other deputy had a shotgun in his hands it wasnt pointed at us but it was there scarface snickered at me the one with the shotgun just stared with eyes as empty and pitiless as a dolls maiden was standing behind the others hands in front one hand clasping his opposite wrist his face was blank but there was an edge around his mouth that said he was trying not to smile weve got to run you all in for assault wilkes said great i said i cant wait to press charges he looked at me his eyes just a touch wide youre the only ones standing ms blake i dont think you have grounds to press charges i leaned a little heavier against jason a trickle of blood ran from the corner of my mouth i could feel my eye already starting to swell ive always been a bleeder if you hit me in the face i knew i looked pitiful they attacked us and we were forced to defend ourselves i let my knees slide out from under me shangda caught me and lifted me easily in his arms i closed my eyes and curled against his chest shit wilkes said look at that poor little girl billy wilkes millie said you going to take her before judge henry what do you think hes going to do to the rest of these hooligans hes got a daughter about her age shit wilkes said again with more force lets get everybody down to the hospital well sort it out there ambulance is on its way maiden said one wont be enough wilkes said maiden laughed low and deep there arent enough ambulances in the county for this many bodies there would have been enough for three wilkes said i tensed in shangdas arms he tightened around me one hand pressed against the side of my head firmly enough that raising up would have hurt my face i let the breath ease out of my body and concentrated on being still but id remember what wilkes had said wed see who got the ambulance ride next time it took one ambulance one pickup truck two squad cars santas sleigh and me riding in the van for everyone to get to the hospital okay not santas sleigh but we did look like a parade nearly six hours later we were back in myerton in the only interrogation room they had id been the only one of the injured that got to leave the hospital the guy that jason had thrown into the truck might have permanent spine damage theyd know when the swelling went down two of the three that shangda had knocked unconscious had regained consciousness they had concussions but would recover the third was still out for the count and the doctors were talking about swelling of the brain and skull fractures shangda had also done the bad guy with the compound fracture i only had mel to my credit but he was in worse shape than the compound fracture it takes a hell of a lot of work to heal a joint break sometimes you never recover full use of the limb i felt sort of bad about that but he had pulled the knife belisarius had been a busy little lawyer hed not only arranged bail for richard but hed also been representing us for the last hour or so richard was a free man temporarily if belisarius could keep the rest of us out of jail he was worth the money wilkes didnt want to arrest us but he wanted to take our fingerprints i didnt have a problem with that until shangda did he really didnt want his prints taken which made both wilkes and me suspicious but if shangda wouldnt do it then none of us would i told wilkes if he wanted our prints he had to charge us with something he seemed reluctant to do that maybe it was because id used my one phone call to contact a cop i knew who in turn had contacted an fbi agent i knew having a call from the feds made wilkes jumpy as hell the bad guys had ambushed us across from the police station you didnt do a planned attack right next door to the cops unless you were pretty sure they wouldnt spoil the fun the bad guys had known the police wouldnt help us theyd said as much during the fight challenging millie to call wilkes like it wouldnt help but wilkess reaction to the call from the feds sort of clinched it for me policemen are very territorial no federal laws had been broken the fbi had no business in a simple assault case wilkes should have been pissed and he wasnt oh he made noises like he was angry and he was but he should have raised hell and he didnt his reaction to everything was just a little bit off a little bit less convincing than it should have been i was betting he was dirty i just couldnt prove it yet of course it wasnt my job to prove it id come down here to get richard out of jail and wed done that wilkes finally asked to speak with me alone belisarius didnt like it but he left with the others i sat at the little table and looked at wilkes it was the cleanest interrogation room id ever been in the table was pale pine and looked handmade the walls were white and clean even the linoleum on the floor was hospital bright i didnt think myerton got a lot of use for the room itd probably started life as a storage closet it had been almost too small to hold five of us but there was room for two wilkes pulled a chair out and sat across from me he clasped his hands in front of him and looked at me there was a band around his head where the hair had been pressed flat from the hat there was a plain gold wedding band on his left hand and one of those watches that joggers use big and black and utilitarian since i had the ladys version of the same watch on my left wrist it was hard to criticize what i said you going to give me the silent treatment until i scream for mercy he gave a very small smile made some phone calls about you blake theres a lot of talk that youll bend the law if you need to that maybe youve murdered people i just looked at him i could feel my face thinning out blanking once upon a time every emotion id felt had played along my face but that was a while ago id perfected my blank cop stare and it showed nothing is there a point to this conversation i asked the smile this time was bigger i just like to know who im dealing with blake thats all good to be thorough i said he nodded i got calls from a saint louis cop a fed and a state cop the state cop says youre a pain in the ass and will bend the law six ways to sunday bet that was freemount i said shes still pissed about a case we worked together he nodded smiling pleasantly the fed sort of hinted that if you were detained he might find a reason to have the local federal office to come take a look around i smiled bet you really enjoyed that his brown eyes went hard and dark i dont want the feebies down here messing in my pond ill bet you dont wilkes his face tightened letting me see just how angry he was what the fuck do you care i leaned across the table on my elbows you should be more careful who you do a frameup job on wilkes hes a fucking junior high science teacher how was i supposed to know he was shacking up with the fucking executioner were not shacking up i said automatically i sat back in my seat what do you want wilkes why the private talk he ran his hand through his saltandpepper hair and for the first time i realized how nervous he was he was scared why what the hell was happening in this tiny town if the rape charges disappear zeeman is free to leave town you and everybody go with him no harm no foul a sports metaphor ooh i was all atingle i didnt come down here to sniff around your mess wilkes im not a cop i came down here to get richard out of trouble hes out of trouble if he leaves im not his keeper wilkes i cant promise what richard will do why does a schoolteacher have bodyguards wilkes asked i shrugged why do you want the schoolteacher out of the way bad enough to frame him for rape weve all got our secrets blake you make sure he leaves town and takes his assassins with him and we can all keep our secrets i looked at my hands spread on the smooth tabletop i looked back up met his eyes ill talk to richard see what i can do but i cant promise anything until after ive talked to him make him listen blake zeeman is so clean he squeaks but you and i know the score i shook my head yeah i know the score and i know what people say about me i stood up he stood up we looked at each other i dont always pay attention to the letter of the law thats true one of the reasons richard and i arent dating anymore is that he is so fucking squeaking clean it makes my teeth hurt but we have one thing in common whats that wilkes asked push us and we push back richard usually for moral grounds because its the right thing to do me because i am just that unpleasant unpleasant wilkes said mel cooper may never walk right again or have the full use of his left arm he shouldnt have pulled a knife on me i said if there hadnt been witnesses would you have killed him i smiled and even to me it felt like a strange smile not humorous unpleasant maybe ill talk to richard hopefully well be out of your hair before tomorrow night i wasnt always a smalltown cop blake dont let the surroundings fool you i will not let you and your people fuck with me funny i said i was thinking the very same thing well wilkes said we know where we stand i guess we do i said i hope come dark tomorrow you and your friends are on your way out of town i stared into his brown eyes id looked into scarier eyes blanker more dead he didnt have the eyes of a professional killer he didnt even have good cop eyes i could see the fear shiny and almost panicked around the edges no id seen scarier eyes but that didnt mean he wouldnt kill me if he got the chance make even a good man scared enough and you never know what hell do make a bad man scared and you are in trouble wilkes probably hadnt killed anybody yet or they wouldnt have framed richard for rape theyd have framed him for murder or just killed him so wilkes hadnt slid completely down into the abyss but once you embrace the screaming darkness eventually you kill maybe wilkes didnt know that yet but if we pushed hard enough hed figure it out by the time i got back to the cabins it was after seven it was august so it was still daylight but you could tell it was late there was a softness to the light a tiredness to the heat as if the day itself was eager for night or maybe it was just me that was tired my face hurt at least i hadnt had to have stitches in my mouth the ems guy on the ambulance had said id need a couple of stitches when i got to the hospital the doctor said i didnt a very bright spot for me im sort of phobic about needles but ive taken stitches with no painkiller and that aint fun either jamil was standing in front of the cabins hed changed into black jeans and a tshirt with a smiley face on it the tshirt was cut across the middle so his abs showed though my dance card was full of attractive men jamil did have one of the nicest stomachs id ever seen the muscles stood out under the tight smoothness of his skin like shingles on a roof it didnt even look real somehow i didnt think you needed cobblestone abs to be a good bodyguard but hey everyone needs a hobby im sorry i missed the fun he said he touched my bruised lip gently it still made me wince im surprised you let anyone mark you she did it on purpose shangda said jamil looked at him anita pretended to faint jason said she looked really pitiful jamil looked back at me i shrugged i didnt let someone kick me in the face on purpose but once i was down i did play up how hurt i was this way we could press our own assault charges i didnt think you lied that well jamil said live and learn i said wheres richard i need to talk to him jamil glanced behind him at one of the cabins then back to me there was a look on his face that i couldnt read hes cleaning up hes been in the same clothes for two days i stared at his socareful face trying to figure out what he wasnt telling me whats going on jamil he shook his head nothing dont give me grief jamil i need to talk to richard now hes in the shower i shook my head and it made my head hurt screw this what cabin is he in jamil shook his head give him a few minutes longer shangda said his voice very bland jason looked from one to the other of them eyes just a touch wide what is going on i asked the cabin door behind jamil opened a woman appeared in the doorway richard had her arms and seemed to be trying to push her gently but firmly out the door the woman turned and saw me she had pale brown hair in one of those hairdos that seem artless and simple yet actually take hours to do she pulled away from richard and stalked towards us no towards me her dark eyes were all for me lucy dont richard said i just want to smell her lucy said it was the kind of comment a dog might make if it could speak smell me not see me we primates tend to forget that a lot of other mammals consider smell more important than vision lucy and i had time to study each other as she walked towards me she was only a little taller than me maybe five foot six her walk was an exaggerated sway so that the short plumcolored skirt bloused around her and you got glimpses of the hose and garters she was wearing underneath she was carrying a pair of black heels but walked towards us in a graceful almost tiptoe movement her blouse was a paler purple unbuttoned so that you glimpsed enough of the bra to know it was black and matched the rest of the undies that you could see and either the bra was a wonderbra or she was well stacked she was wearing more makeup than i ever wore but it was wellapplied and made her skin look smooth and perfect her dark lipstick was smeared i glanced behind her at richard he was wearing a pair of blue jeans and nothing else water still beaded on his naked chest his thick hair clung to his face and shoulders in wet strands he had her dark lipstick smeared across his mouth like a plumcolored bruise we looked at each other and i dont think either of us knew what to say the woman knew exactly what to say so youre richards human bitch it was so hostile it made me smile she didnt like the smile she stepped into me so close id have to step back to keep the edge of her skirt from brushing my legs if id had any doubt what she was this close her power danced over my skin like insects swarming over my body she was powerful i shook my head look before we get into any arcane werewolf shit or worse personal shit i need to talk to richard about jail and why the local cops went to the trouble of framing him for rape she blinked at me my name is lucy winston remember it i looked into her pale brown eyes from inches away i was close enough to see the small imperfections in her eyeliner richard had mentioned a lucy in jail he couldnt be dating two of them could he lucy richard mentioned you i said she blinked again but this time she was puzzled she took a step back from me to glance at richard you mentioned me to her richard nodded she backed up and looked on the verge of tears then why i glanced from one to the other of them why what is what i wanted to ask but i didnt id been enjoying disliking lucy if she cried it might spoil my fun i put my hands up like i was surrendering and stepped around her i walked towards richard because we had to talk but seeing lucy in her garters and hose had taken a lot of the fun out of it it was none of my business what he did i was sleeping with jeanclaude i was all out of stones to throw so why was i having such a hard time not being pissed maybe that was a question better left unanswered richard stepped back out of the doorway so i could walk past him he closed the door behind me leaning against it we were suddenly alone really alone and i didnt know what to say he leaned against the door with his hands behind his back water beaded on his naked upper body hed always had a nice chest but he had been lifting weights since last id seen him without his shirt his upper body was almost aggressively masculine though still short of that overdone look that bodybuilders strive so hard for he was slumped against the door it made his stomach muscles bunch once upon a time i could have helped him dry off his hair was starting to dry in a wavy mass if he didnt do something soon hed have to wet it and start over lucy drag you out of the shower without a towel the moment i said it i wished i hadnt i put my hand up and said im sorry its none of my business i dont have the right to be catty with you he smiled almost sadly i think thats the second time ive ever heard you admit you were wrong oh im wrong a lot i just dont admit it out loud that made him smile again and it was almost his normal smile that bright flash of perfect teeth in the permanent tan of his face most people thought richard was tanned i knew it was skin color because id seen the whole package he was white bread all middle american with a family that made the waltons look unfriendly but a generation or so back was something not so white bread richard pushed away from the door he walked towards me on his bare feet i was more aware than was polite of the line of hair running down the center of his lower abdomen i turned away and said why did they want you in jail business concentrate on business im not sure he said may i get a towel and finish drying off while we talk its your cabin help yourself i said he disappeared into the bathroom i was left to look around the cabin was almost identical to mine except that it was yellow and it was more lived in the cheerful comforter was pushed onto the floor in a sunny heap the white sheets were wrinkled richard was almost fanatical about making the bed somehow lucy didnt strike me as the neat type i was betting she had mussed the bed of course there was a wet spot on one side so maybe shed had help i passed my hand over the damp sheets even the pillow was wet as if that thick wet hair had laid across it my throat felt tight and if i hadnt known better id have said there were tears in my eyes naw surely not i mean id been the one that dumped richard why should i cry the print above the bed was another van gogh sunflowers this time i wondered if every cabin had a van gogh print in a color that matched the decor yeah maybe if i concentrated on the rooms furnishings i wouldnt keep wondering if lucy had looked up at the melting sunflowers while richard i cut that particular visual off i didnt need to go there ever did i really think that richard was going to stay chaste while i boffed jeanclaude did i really expect him to just wait around maybe i had stupid but maybe true the bathroom door was still closed i could hear water running was he taking another shower maybe he was just wetting down his hair maybe or maybe he was cleaning off sex was never as neat as the movies made it real sex was messy good sex was messier three months with jeanclaude and i was a sex expert it was almost funny id been chaste until he came along not virginal my fianc–π in college had taken care of that id fallen into my fianc–πs arms with the trust that only first love can give you it was one of the last naive things i ever did richard and i had been engaged briefly but wed never had sex wed both been chaste since our first experience in college with other people just a personal choice that we both shared maybe if wed given in to that lust there wouldnt be so much heat left between us of course lately wed been mostly fighting richard had been too kindhearted too tender too squeamish to rule the wolf pack hed had a chance to kill the old ulfric marcus twice and twice richard refused the kill no kill no new ulfric i urged him to kill marcus and after he did it i dumped him unfair wasnt it of course i hadnt told him to eat marcus just to kill him whats a little cannibalism between friends the water was still running in the bathroom if i hadnt been afraid hed answer dripping wet in nothing but a towel id have knocked and asked him to hurry but id seen enough of mr zeeman for one day less was definitely more there were pictures pinned above the desk i walked towards them id had one semester of primate studies north american wed all called it troll class the lesser smokey mountain troll is one of the smallest of the north american trolls they average between three and a half feet to five feet they are mostly vegetarians but will supplement their diet with carrion and insects i let all the stats run through my head as i walked towards the pictures they were covered in blackish fur from head to foot crouched in the trees huddled together they looked like tall chimpanzees or slender gorillas but there were pictures of them walking they were completely bipedal the only primate except man that walked upright the closeup shots of faces were startling their faces were more furry than the great apes and more manlike some early theories had said trolls were the missing link between man and ape there had been at least two famous cases of circuses in the early s that toured with trolls but listed them as wild men american settlers had been killing trolls for centuries by the early s theyd been rare enough to be oddities two things happened in that saved the trolls from utter destruction one a scientific article was published that said that the trolls used tools and buried their dead with flowers and personal articles the scientist very carefully did not project anything beyond the basic findings but the newspapers did they declared that trolls believed in an afterlife that they believed in god an evangelical minister named simon barkley felt that god spoke to him he went out and captured a troll and tried to convert him to christianity he wrote a book about his experiences with peter the troll and it became a bestseller suddenly trolls were a cause c–πl–∏bre one of my biology profs had kept a blackandwhite photo of peter the troll up in his office peter had his head bowed and his hands clasped he was even wearing clothes though minister barkley was always distressed that without constant supervision peter disrobed i wasnt sure how good a time peter had with barkley but he saved his species from almost certain extinction peter had been a north american cave troll the only species on this continent smaller than the lesser smokey barkley had been moved by the spirit of god but he hadnt been stupid there had still been greater smokey mountain trolls in those days eight to twelve feet tall and carnivorous barkley hadnt tried to save one of them probably just as well it would have been a real downer if the troll had eaten barkley instead of praying for him trolls were the first protected species in america the greater smokey mountain troll was not protected it was hunted to extinction but then it pulled up large trees and beat the tourists to death and sucked the marrow from their bones hard to get good press that way there was still a troll society called peters friends even though it was illegal to kill trolls any trolls for any reason it still happened hunters poached them though staring into those toohuman faces i dont know how they did it not just for a trophy richard stepped out of the bathroom in a rush of warm air he was still wearing the jeans but now there was a towel on his head and a blowdryer in one hand he had rewet his hair though he seemed to have gotten all of him in the shower to do it mercifully hed dried his chest and arms off his arms looked amazingly strong i knew he could have tossed around small elephants regardless of how muscular he looked but the muscles helped remind me physically he was a pleasure to gaze upon but it made me wonder why hed been spending the extra time on his body richard didnt usually sweat that kind of thing i pointed at the pictures these are great i smiled and meant it once upon a time id envisioned spending my life in the field doing this kind of work a sort of preternatural jane goodall though truthfully primates hadnt been my main area of interest dragons maybe or lake monsters nothing that wouldnt eat me if it got the chance but that had been long ago before bert my boss recruited me to raise the dead and slay vampires sometimes even though richard was older than i was by three years he made me feel old he was still trying to have a life amid all the strange shit id given up on anything but the strange shit you couldnt do both equally well or i couldnt ill take you up to see them if youd like he said id love to if it wouldnt upset the trolls theyre pretty accustomed to visitors carrie dr onslow has started allowing small groups of tourists to come and take pictures hed mentioned a carrie in the same breath with lucy was this the same woman are you guys that hard up for money i asked he sat down on the side of the bed and plugged in the blowdryer youre always short of money on a project like this but its not money we need its good press i frowned at him why do you need good press have you been reading the newspaper lately he asked he removed the towel from his head his hair was dark and brown with moisture heavy as if there was still water to be squeezed from it you know i dont read the newspaper you didnt own a television either but you do now i leaned my butt against the edge of his desk as far away from him as i could get and not leave the room id bought the television so that he and i could watch old movies and videos i dont watch much television anymore jeanclaude not a fan of musicals richard asked and there was that edge to his voice that id heard in the last few weeks angry jealous hurt cruel it was almost a relief to hear it his anger made everything easier jeanclaudes not much of a watcher hes more a doer richards face thinned out anger making his high sculpted cheekbones stand out underneath his skin lucy isnt much of a watcher either he said voice low and careful i laughed and it wasnt a happy sound thanks for making this easier richard he stared down at the floor his wet hair tucked to one side so his face was in full profile i dont want to fight anita i really dont could have fooled me i said he looked up and his chocolate brown eyes were dark with more than just color if id wanted a fight i could have just given in to lucy let you find us in the bed together youre not mine anymore richard why should it bother me what the hell you do that is the question isnt it he stood and started walking towards me why did they frame you i asked why did they want you in jail thats you anita all business and you let yourself get distracted richard you dont keep your eye on the ball geez a sports metaphor maybe it was contagious fine he said and that one word was so angry that it almost hurt the troll band that were studying has broken into two bands their birth rate is so low that they dont do that very often its the first recorded offshoot for a north american troll troop in this century this is all fascinating but what does it have to do with anything just shut up and listen he said i did that was a first the second smaller troop moved out of the park theyve been on private land for a little over a year the farmer who owned the land was okay with that in fact he was sort of pleased carrie brought him up to see the first troll baby born on his land and he carried the picture in his wallet i looked at him sounds great the farmer ivan greene died about six months ago his son was not a nature lover ah i said but trolls are a severely endangered species and theyre not like the snail darter or the velvetback toad theyre a big showy animal the son tried to sell the land and we got it stopped legally but the son wasnt happy with that i said richard smiled not hardly so he took you to court i said not exactly richard said we expected him to do that in fact we should have known something was wrong when he didnt keep us tied up in court what did he do i asked the anger was leaking away as richard talked he always had to work really hard to stay angry me it was one of my best things he retrieved the towel from the bed and started drying his hair while he talked goats started disappearing from a local farmer goats i said richard peered at me through a curtain of wet hair goats somebodys been reading too much billy goat gruff i said richard wrapped the towel more firmly around his head and sat down on the bed exactly he said no one who really knew anything about trolls would have taken goats even the european lesser trolls that do hunt will take your dog before theyll take your goat so it was a setup i said yeah but the newspapers got hold of it we were still okay until the dogs and cats started disappearing they got smarter i said they listened to carries interviews where she discussed food preferences he said id come to stand at the foot of the bed why are the local cops interested in some land squabble wait it gets worse he said i picked up the spilled comforter and sat on the edge of the bed with it bundled in my lap how worse a mans body was found two weeks ago it was just one of those horrible hiking accidents at first he fell off the mountain it happens richard said having seen some of the mountains im not surprised i said but somehow the body was listed as a troll kill i frowned at him its not like a shark kill richard how did they tell a troll did it a troll didnt do it richard said i nodded of course not but what was their proof false or otherwise carrie tried to get the coroners report but it was leaked to the newspapers first the man had been beaten to death and had bites out of his body from animals troll bites i shook my head anybody who dies in these mountains is going to have animal bites on the body trolls are known scavengers not according to sheriff wilkes richard said what does the sheriff get out of this money richard said do you know that for sure i asked you mean can i prove it i nodded no carries been trying to see if theres a paper trail but so far nothing shes been chasing around trying to get me out of jail for the last few days is she the same carrie you mentioned as a girlfriend in jail i asked richard nodded aha i said did you just say aha he asked yes and i apologize for it but what better way to keep carrie from working on the mystery than to put her boyfriend in jail im not her boyfriend anymore he said i hurried past that little bit of knowledge is it common knowledge that youre not an item anymore not really then that may explain why they wanted you in jail they framed you for rape because so far wilkes isnt willing to kill you think that will change richard asked i touched my swollen lip hes already started upping the violence level richard leaned across the bed until his fingertips touched the bruises on my face it was a tentative touch like a butterflys wing did wilkes do this my heart was suddenly beating faster no i said wilkes was very careful to only show up after all the bad guys needed an ambulance richard smiled fingers tracing the edge of my face just beyond the bruises how many of them did you hurt my pulse was beating so hard i was afraid he could see it jumping in my throat just one richard scooted just a little closer to me hand still trailing up and down my cheek what did you do to him i didnt know whether to move away or cuddle my aching face against the cool warmth of his hand i broke his arm and leg at the joint why did you do that richard asked he was threatening shangda and he pulled a knife on me my voice sounded breathy richard leaned in close then closer he pulled the ridiculous towel from his head and his thick hair fell in chilled wet strands around his face against my skin his lips were so close to my mouth i could feel his breath i stood stepping back from him the comforter still bundled in my arms i let it fall to the floor and we stared at each other why not anita you want me i can feel it smell it taste your pulse on my tongue thanks for that visual richard you still want me after months in his bed you still want me that doesnt make it right i said loyal to jeanclaude now he asked just trying not to fuck up any worse than i already have richard thats all regretting your choice he asked i shook my head no comment he stood and started towards me i put a hand out and he stopped the weight of his gaze was almost touchable as if i could feel what he was thinking and it was personal and intimate and things wed never done before sheriff wilkes says get out of dodge by dark tomorrow take our bodyguards with us and hell just forget everything the rape charges will vanish and you can go back to your normal life i cant do that anita theyre talking about hunting the trolls down with guns and dogs im not leaving until i know the trolls are safe i sighed school starts in less than two weeks are you going to stay here and lose your job do you really think wilkes will let it go that long richard asked no i said i think he or some of his men will start killing people first we need to find out why this land is so valuable if its minerals greene hasnt filed the report which means he doesnt need government permission and doesnt need partners what do you mean permission and partners if hed found say emeralds on land that bordered the national park then hed have to file the claim and try to get permission to place a mine next to the park if hed found something that needed blasting and hard mining like maybe lead or something then he might need partners to help him finance it then hed need to file a claim to show the prospective partners when did you start studying geology i asked he smiled weve been trying to figure out what is on the land that is worth this much trouble minerals seemed the logical choice i nodded agreed but either its not minerals or its something private and he doesnt have to share that info right exactly i need to speak with carrie and the other biologists i said tomorrow he said why not tonight you said it outside arcane werewolf shit whats that supposed to mean i asked it means that were four nights from the full moon and youre my lupa i heard youve been taking applicants for the job i said he smiled and it wasnt nearly embarrassed enough you may find it strange but a lot of women find me attractive you know i dont find that strange i said but youre still with jeanclaude he said i shook my head im out of here richard ill stay around and try to keep you from being killed or getting any of our pack killed but lets drop the personal stuff he closed the distance between us and i put my hands up to keep him from touching me my hands ended up pressed to his bare chest his heart thudded against my hands like a trapped animal dont do this richard i tried hating you and i cant he put his hands over mine holding them against the hard smoothness of his chest try harder but it was a whisper he leaned over me and i drew back if you dont dry your hair youre going to have to wet it down again ill risk it he kept moving towards me lips half parted i stepped back pulling my hands out of his and he let me he was strong enough that he didnt have to let me and that still bothered me i backed towards the door stop trying to love me richard i have tried then stop trying and just do it the door was pressed against my back i grabbed the doorknob without turning around you ran from me that night you ran from me to jeanclaude you pulled his body around you like a shield to keep me away i opened the door but he was just suddenly there holding it halfclosed i started tugging on the door and it was like pulling against a wall immobile his one hand pressed flat on the door against the pull of my entire body and i couldnt budge him i hated that a lot damn it richard let me go i think youre more afraid of how much you love me than you are of jeanclaude at least with him you know youre not in love that was it i wedged my body in the door enough so he couldnt close it on me but i stopped tugging on it i looked up at him at every gorgeous inch of him i may not love jeanclaude in the same way i love you he smiled dont get cocky i said i do love jeanclaude but love isnt enough richard if love were enough i wouldnt be with jeanclaude now id be with you i looked into his big brown eyes and said but im not with you and love isnt enough now get away from this damned door he stepped back hands at his side love can be enough anita i shook my head and stepped out on the steps the darkness was thick and touchable but not yet solid the last time you listened to me you killed for the first time and you havent recovered from it i should have just shot marcus for you id have never forgiven you for that he said i gave a harsh sound that was almost a laugh but at least you wouldnt be hating yourself id be the monster not you his handsome face was suddenly very solemn all the light fled from it whatever i do wherever i go anita i am the monster you left me because of what i am i stepped down onto the ground staring up at him there was no light inside the cabin and richard stood in a darker shadow than the coming night i thought you said i left you because i was afraid of how much i loved you he looked confused for a second not knowing how to deal with his own logic thrown back into his face he finally looked at me do you know why you left me i wanted to say because you ate marcus but i didnt i couldnt say it staring into his face so ready to believe the worst of himself he wasnt my problem anymore so why did i care how hurt his ego was good question i was out of good answers besides maybe there was some truth to what richard was saying i didnt know anymore im going to go to my cabin now richard i dont want to talk about this anymore afraid he asked i shook my head and answered without turning around tired i kept walking knowing he was watching me the parking area was empty i didnt know where jamil and the others had gone and i didnt care i needed some alone time i walked through the soft summer darkness there was a spill of stars overhead glittering and edged by the dark shapes of leaves it was going to be a beautiful evening somewhere off in the distance a high clear howl rode the coming dark richard had said something about arcane werewolf shit we were going to have a moonlight jamboree god i hated parties i leaned against the door of my cabin eyes closed breathing in the cool air id turned the airconditioning on for my two guests the coffins sat in the middle of the floor between the desk and the bed under the circus of the damned deep underground neither damian nor asher slept until full dark i hadnt been sure if they would aboveground or not so the air though actually it had been partly selfish vampires in a closed hot space tended to smell well like vampires they didnt smell like dead bodies it was like the smell of snakes and yet that wasnt it either it was a neckruffling smell thick musky more reptile than mammal the smell of vampires how could i be sleeping with one of them i opened my eyes it was dark in the cabin but there was still a faint push of illumination through the two windows a faint touch of light against the gleaming feet of the coffins had that small touch of natural light been enough to keep both vampires comatose dead in their coffins waiting for true dark something had because i knew that they were still and waiting inside the coffins a small amount of concentration and i knew they were still dead to the world i strode between the coffins into the bathroom closed and locked the door the darkness seemed too solid i turned on the light it was white and harsh after the darkness i was left blinking in the brightness getting a good look at myself in the mirror was almost startling i hadnt really seen the bruises yet the corner of my left eye was a wonderful shade of purple black swollen puffy seeing it made it hurt worse like seeing blood from a cut that doesnt sting until you notice it my left cheek was a wonderful shade of greenish brown it was that sickly green that usually takes days to accomplish my lower lip was puffy you could still see the edge of darkened skin where it had bled i ran my tongue inside my mouth and could feel the ridge where my cheek had been forced against my teeth but it was healed i stared into the mirror and realized as sore and awful as it looked it wasnt as bad as it should have been it took me a few moments of staring to figure it out when i did finally realize what was happening a rush of fear ran through my body from my toes to the top of my head i felt almost faint i was healing i was healing days worth of injury in only hours at this rate the bruises would be almost gone by tomorrow i should have been wearing the fight marks for days a week at least what the hell was happening to me i felt damian wake in his coffin i felt it like a stab through my body it staggered me against the sink i knew he was hungry and i knew that he sensed me near at hand i was jeanclaudes human servant bound by marks that only death would break but damian was mine id raised him and another vampire willie mccoy more than once id called them from their coffins during daylight hours safely underground but the sun had been burning bright when i did it one necromancer had said it made perfect sense we could only raise zombies after the souls had fled the bodies so i could only raise vamps when their souls had fled for the day i wasnt even going to debate the vampires and soul issue my life was complicated enough without religious discussions i know i know i was just delaying the inevitable if i stayed with jeanclaude i was going to have to face the whole issue no hiding but not tonight raising damian had forged some kind of link between us i didnt understand it and didnt have anyone to ask advice of i was the first necromancer in several hundred years that could raise vampires like zombies it scared me it scared damian more frankly i didnt blame him was asher awake too i concentrated on him sent that power magic whatever the hell it was outward it brushed him and he felt me he was awake and aware of me asher was a master vampire not as powerful as jeanclaude but a master nonetheless that gave him certain abilities that damian who was by far the elder of the two would never have without the link between us damian wouldnt have sensed me searching for him i wanted a few minutes to be alone and think and i wasnt going to get it i didnt make them call for me i opened the door and stood framed in the light blinking out into the thick darkness the vampires stood like pale shadows in the gloom i hit the overhead light asher threw his hand up to protect his eyes from the light but damian just blinked at me i wanted them to cower back from the light i wanted them to look monstrous but they didnt damian was a greeneyed redhead but that didnt really cover it his hair fell like a red curtain around his upper body the hair so red it looked like spilled blood against the green silk of his shirt the shirt was a paler green than his eyes they were like liquid fire if fire could burn green it wasnt vampire powers that made his eyes gleam it was natural color as if his mother had fooled around with a cat asher was a blueeyed blond but again that description didnt do him justice the waves of his shoulderlength hair were golden i dont mean blond i mean gold his hair was almost metallic in its glittering brilliance his eyes were a blue so pale they were almost white like the eyes of a husky he was wearing a white dress shirt untucked over chocolate brown dress pants leather loafers no socks completed his clothes id spent too much time around jeanclaude to call it an outfit if you could stop staring at the eyes and hair long enough to see their faces asher was the handsomer of the two damian was handsome but there was a length of jaw a less perfect slope to the nose small imperfections that might go unnoticed if you hadnt had asher for comparison asher was beautifully handsome like a medieval cherub half of him anyway half of ashers face was the beauty that drew a master vampire to him centuries ago the other half was covered in scars holy water scars the scars started about an inch from the midline of his face so his eyes nose and those full perfect lips remained untouched but the rest was like melted wax his neck was pale and perfect but i knew that the scars continued at his shoulders his upper body was worse than the face the scars rough and pitted but like the face only half of his body was scarred the other half was still lovely i knew that the scars touched his upper thigh but i had never seen him completely nude i had to take his word that the scars covered the space between it had been implied though never stated that he was still capable of sex but was scarred i didnt know for sure and i didnt want to know where are your bodyguards asher asked my bodyguards you mean jason and the furballs asher nodded his golden hair fell forward over the scarred side of his face it was an old habit the hair hid the scars or almost hid the scars he could use the shadows the same way he always seemed to know just where the light would hit him centuries of practice i dont know where they are i said i just finished talking to richard i guess they thought we needed privacy did you need the privacy asher asked he looked straight at me using the scars and beauty for a double effect he didnt look happy for some reason its none of your damn business i said damian sat at the foot of the carefully made bed he smoothed pale longfingered hands across the blue coverlet not in this bed you didnt he said i came to stand beside the bed and stare down at him if one more vampire or wereanything tells me they can smell sex i am going to scream damian didnt smile hed never been a real happy camper but lately was even more serious than usual he just sat there looking up at me jeanclaude or even asher would have smiled teased damian just looked at me with eyes that held sorrow the way others held laughter i reached out to touch his shoulder and had to sweep back a lock of his hair to reach it he jerked back from my touch as if it had hurt he pushed to his feet and went to stand near the door i was left with my hand out puzzled whats wrong with you damian asher came to stand beside me he rested his hands lightly on my shoulders you are quite right anita what you do with monsieur zeeman is none of my business i slid my hands over his sliding my fingers to intertwine with his i remembered the feel of his cool skin against mine i leaned my back against him pulling his arms around me and i wasnt tall enough it wasnt my memory it was jeanclaudes asher and he had been companions for over twenty years once upon a time i sighed and started to pull away asher leaned his chin on the top of my head you need someones arms that you dont feel threatened by i leaned against him eyes closed and for just a moment let him hold me the only reason this feels so good is that im remembering someone elses pleasure asher gently kissed the top of my head because you see me through the nostalgia of jeanclaudes memories you are the only woman in over two hundred years who doesnt treat me like a circus freak i leaned my face against the bend of his arm you are devastatingly handsome asher he smoothed the hair from my bruised cheek to you perhaps he leaned over me and laid the softest of kisses on my cheek i pulled away from him gently almost reluctantly what i remembered of asher was simpler than anything i was trying to pull off in this lifetime asher didnt try to hold me if you were not already in love with two other men the way you look at me might be enough i sighed im sorry asher i shouldnt touch you like that its just i didnt know how to put it into words you treat me like an old lover asher said you forget and touch me as if youd touched me before when it is always the first time do not apologize for that anita i enjoy it no one else will touch me so freely jeanclaude will i said these are his memories asher smiled and it was almost sorrowful he is loyal to you and to monsieur zeeman hes turned you down i asked and wished i hadnt asher smile brightened then dimmed if you would not share him with another woman would you truly share him with another man i thought about that for a second or two well no i frowned up at him why do i feel like apologizing for that because you share with jeanclaude and myself the memories of julianna and the two of us we were a very happy m–πnage –∞ trois for almost longer than you have been alive julianna had been ashers human servant shed ended up burned as a witch by the same people that had scarred asher jeanclaude couldnt save them both i wasnt sure that either of them had truly forgiven jeanclaude for this oversight damian said if im not interrupting i need to feed he was standing by the door hugging himself as if he were cold you want me to open the door and yell dinner i asked i want permission to go feed he said i frowned at the phrasing but said go find one of our walking donors and help yourself just our people though we cant hunt here damian nodded standing up straighter as if hed been hunched in upon himself i could feel that he was hungry but it wasnt hunger that made him huddle i will not hunt good i said he hesitated with his hand on the doorknob his back was to me but his voice came low may i go and feed i glanced at asher is he talking to you asher shook his head i think not sure help yourself damian opened the door and slipped outside he left the door slightly ajar what is his problem lately i asked i think he must answer that question asher said i turned and looked at him does that mean you cant answer the question or wont answer it asher smiled and his face moved freely even the scarred skin he was having consultations with a plastic surgeon in saint louis no one had ever tried to repair holy water damage on vamps so they didnt know if it would work but the doctors were hopeful hopeful but cautious the first operation was still months away it means anita that some fears are very personal are you saying damians afraid of me i didnt try to keep the astonishment out of my voice i am saying that you must speak to him directly if you want answers i sighed great just what i need another complicated male in my life asher laughed and it slid along my bare arms like a touch raising gooseflesh the only other vampire that could do that to me was jeanclaude stop that i said he gave a low sweeping bow my most sincere apologies bullshit i said go get dinner i think the werewolves are planning some sort of party or ceremony you need one of us with you at all times anita i heard jeanclaudes ultimatum i looked at him and couldnt keep the surprise off my face you think hed really kill you if something happened to me asher just looked at me with his pale pale eyes your life means more to him than mine does anita if it did not he would be in my bed and not yours he had a point but it would kill something inside of him to kill you personally but he would do it asher said why because he said hed do it no because he would always wonder if i allowed you to die as revenge for his failure to protect julianna oh i opened my mouth to say more and the phone rang daniels voice came low and panicked backed by country music anita were out at the happy cowboy on the main highway can you come down whats wrong daniel moms tracked down the woman who accused richard shes determined to make her stop lying are they fighting yet i asked yelling you outweigh her by over a hundred pounds daniel just toss her over your shoulder and get her out of there shell only make things worse shes my mother i cant do that shit i said asher asked what has happened i shook my head ill be there daniel but youre being a wimp id rather take on every guy in the bar than my mother he said if she makes a big enough scene you may get your chance i hung up i cannot believe this what asher asked again i explained as quickly as i could daniel and mrs zeeman were staying at a nearby motel richard hadnt wanted them at the cabins with so many shapeshifters running around now i wished wed kept them closer to home it would have been nice to have changed out of the bloodsplattered blouse but we were out of time no rest for the wicked the real trick was what to do with richard hed want to come along and i didnt want him anywhere near miss betty schaffer legally he could enter the bar and sit down beside her there was no court order to stay away but if the sheriff realized we werent getting out of town hed look for any excuse to get richard back behind bars i didnt think richard would have nearly as pleasant a second visit as he had a first their ambush today had backfired theyd be frustrated and scared theyd hurt richard this time hell they might hurt his mother charlotte zeeman and i were going to have to have a little talk come to think of it i was with daniel id have rather faced a fullblown bar fight than have a talk with his mother at least shed never be my motherinlaw if i was going to have to punch her out tonight that was almost comforting richard and i compromised he came along and swore to stay in the car i brought along shangda jamil and jason to make sure he stayed in the car though if push came to shove i wasnt sure theyd listen to me over richard not even if it was for his own good it was the best i could do some nights that has to be enough because thats all youve got the happy cowboy which was one of the worst names for a bar id ever heard was on the main highway it was a twostory building that was supposed to look like a log cabin and managed not to maybe it was the neon horse with its cowboy rider on the sign the lights gave the illusion that the horse was going up and down along with the cowboys arm and hat he didnt look particularly happy riding the neon horse but then maybe that was just me i certainly wasnt happy to be here richard had driven his fourbyfour hed finally gotten around to blowdrying his hair it was a thick wavy foam around his face and shoulders it looked so soft you wanted to plunge your hands into it or again maybe that was just me hed added a plain green tshirt tucked into his jeans and white jogging shoes jamil and shangda were riding shotgun in the middle seat jamil was still wearing his cutoff smiley tshirt but shangda had changed he was all in black from his soft leather loafers to his belted dress slacks to the silk tshirt and tailor cut jacket his short back hair was gelled into a crop of spikes on top of his head he looked relaxed and at home in the clothes and the hair he would also look utterly out of place at the happy cowboy of course being over six feet tall and chinese put him behind the game when it came to blending in here maybe he like jamil was tired of trying to pass that was why jason still in his grownup blue suit was with us nathaniel had wanted to come but he wasnt old enough to go into a bar i didnt know how good zane was in a stress situation yet and cherry always made me feel vaguely protective so jason it was if youre not out in fifteen minutes were coming in richard said thirty minutes i said i did not want richard near ms betty schaffer fifteen he said voice very quiet very low very serious i knew that tone of voice id gotten all the compromise i was going to get fine but remember that if you go to jail tonight your mom may go with you his eyes widened what are you talking about what would charlotte do if she saw her little boy being dragged away to jail he thought about that for a second then bowed his head he laid his forehead on the steering wheel shed put up a fight for me exactly i said he raised his face and looked at me ill behave for her sake i smiled i knew it wasnt for mine i got out of the car before he could answer that one jason settled into step beside me hed straightened his tie and buttoned the first button on the jacket hed also tried to slick back his babyfine hair but it escaped all efforts in tiny wisps his hair was very straight and very fine and it would have looked better either much shorter or much longer but hey it wasnt my hair we were both carded at the door by a muscular guy in a dark blue tshirt the crowd was divided almost down the middle there was the tight jeans cowboy boots crowd and the short skirts business jackets crowd there was some intermingling some of the women in cowboy boots had short skirts some of the business jackets were wearing jeans it was the only alcohol for a twentymile radius and it served food where else were you going to go on a friday night id have rather gone for a moonlit walk but i didnt drink come to think of it i didnt dance either though jeanclaude was working on both corruption at every turn there was a live band playing country music so loudly it might as well have been hard rock a haze of cigarette smoke floated over everything like a latenight fog the entrance was on a little raised platform so you could look around before plunging into the sea of bodies charlotte is actually an inch or two shorter than i am so i didnt bother scanning for her i looked for daniel how many sixfoottall tanned guys with wavy shoulderlength hair could there be more than youd think i finally spotted him near the bar because he was waving to me hed also tied his long hair back in a very tight ponytail which was why scanning for the hair hadnt worked his hair was nearly identical to richards except it was a more solid brown a rich chestnut his skin was the same tanned shade as his brothers the same high sculpted cheekbones solid brown eyes even the dimple in the chin richard was a little broader through the shoulders and chest just physically more imposing but other than that the family resemblance was almost scary all the brothers looked like that the two oldest had cut their hair one of them was almost a blond and the father was going a little grey but the five zeeman men in one room was a testosterone treat and the matriarch of this pile of masculine pulchritude was standing about six feet from her son charlotte zeeman had short blond hair that framed a face that looked at least ten years younger than i knew she was she was wearing a butter yellow suit jacket over dress slacks she was also poking her finger into the chest of a tall blond woman the second woman had a mane of curled blond hair but i was betting that neither the color nor the curl were real it had to be betty schaffer and the name didnt suit her she looked like someone named farrah or tiffany i waded into the crowd with jason behind me the crowd was thick enough that i stopped saying excuse me about halfway across the room and just started pushing a tall man in a plaid work shirt stopped me with a hand on my shoulder can i buy you a drink little lady i reached back and got jasons hand i raised it where it was visible taken sorry there was more than one reason id wanted to bring jason with me to a bar on a friday night he stared down at jason way down making a show of how very tall he was dont you want something a little bigger i like them small i said my face very serious it makes oral sex easier we left him speechless jason was laughing so hard he could barely keep his feet i pulled him through the crowd by the hand holding his hand seemed to be hint enough for the rest of the cruising males the crowd was clearing around the bar people had moved back to form a semicircle around charlotte betty and daniel he had stepped up behind his mother laying a hand on either shoulder trying to pull her back she shrugged him off rather violently and ignored him he let her do it charlotte got up in the womans face i was close enough to catch a word or two above the band liar whore my son rapist to hear even that much charlotte was screaming at the woman betty was tall but the spikeheeled boots put her at six feet the jeans were painted on the blouse was midriff and there was no bra she had small enough breasts that she could get away with it but it was still noticeable and meant to be she looked like a cowboy hooker richard had dated her it made me think worse of him two large guys wearing tshirts that matched the guy who had carded us at the door were at the edge of the crowd i think they were sort of puzzled by charlotte she was tiny and female and hadnt hit anyone yet she also looked older than the general crowd though not really like anyones mother betty had finally had enough she was screaming back words like he did rapist bastard i let go of jasons hand and stepped up beside them they both looked at me charlotte was the most startled her large honeybrown eyes went wide she said anita as if no one had told her i was in town i smiled hi charlotte can we talk outside i had to put my face nearly next to hers to be heard she shook her head this is the whore thats lied about richard i nodded i know lets take it outside though charlotte shook her head again i am not leaving until she tells the truth richard did not rape her we were yelling with our faces almost touching to be heard of course he didnt i said water is wet the sky is blue and richard isnt a rapist charlotte stared at me you believe him i nodded i got him out on bail hes waiting to see you outside her eyes went even wider then she smiled and it was beautiful it was one of those smiles that made you feel warm down to your toes charlotte was like that when she was happy everyone around her was happy when she wasnt happy well that spilled over too she yelled in my ear lets go see richard i turned to go through the crowd and heard a gasp i turned to see betty schaffer wearing the dripping remnants of a beer betty slapped charlotte charlotte returned the favor but with a closed fist betty was suddenly on her butt in the floor blinking up at us the bouncers moved in as charlotte moved in to finish the job i threw charlotte over my shoulder she weighed more than she looked like she did and she was struggling unlike most women she was good at struggling i didnt want to hurt charlotte but she wasnt returning the favor she kicked me in the knee and i dumped her onto the floor hard she lay there for a second breath knocked out of her staring up at me daniel moved forward to help her up and i stopped him with a hand on his chest no the band had fallen silent with a last twangy guitar string into the sudden silence my voice sounded loud you can walk out of here on your own or you can be carried out unconscious charlotte your choice but you are leaving i went down on one knee carefully because charlotte didnt fight like a girl i lowered my voice for her ears alone richard will come in here in just a few minutes to see whats wrong if he gets near her again the local cops will revoke his bail and lock him up again it was only partially true legally he had every right to enter the bar but i was betting that charlotte didnt know that most lawabiding citizens wouldnt have charlotte looked at me for a second longer then offered me a hand i helped her stand still cautious she had a hell of a temper once it got started admittedly it took a lot to get her this mad but once she reached it it was every man for himself she let me help her to her feet without trying to slug me an improvement we made our way through the crowd with daniel and jason trailing behind us no one crowded us as we went for the door they stared but didnt crowd the bouncer at the door said she doesnt come back in here charlotte opened her mouth to say something and i gripped her shoulder dont worry she wont he looked at charlotte but nodded i let her get about three good steps ahead of me as we reached the parking lot call it an instinct she whirled and i think would have hit me but i was out of reach she stared at me with those big honeybrown eyes made somehow paler by the halogen lamps dont you ever lay hands on me again she said behave like richards mother and not his outraged girlfriend and i wont how dare you she said she moved closer i moved away i didnt really want to have a fistfight in the parking lot of a bar with richards mother if anyone should be trying to beat the shit out of ms peroxide blond it should be me that stopped her cold she stood straight and looked at me i could almost see her sanity returning but you arent dating him anymore why should you care that is the sixtyfour thousand dollar question isnt it i said charlotte smiled suddenly i knew you couldnt resist my boy no one could if he keeps dating everything in sight i might she frowned i cant believe he ever dated that thing she said we both turned and watched richard walk towards us there were nearly identical looks on our faces we disapproved of ms schaffer a lot her first words were i cannot believe you dated that woman she is a whore richard looked embarrassed more than id gotten from him i know what she is did you have sex with her mother dont you mother me richard alaric zeeman alaric i said richard spared me a frown then turned back to his mother no i never slept with betty he was saying hed never had intercourse with her charlotte would take it to mean that no sex at all had happened just like i had i remembered what jamil had said about alternatives but i kept quiet i didnt want to upset charlotte and i didnt want to know well at least that shows better sense charlotte said she walked up to him and smoothed the front of his tshirt then bowed her head and i realized she was crying i couldnt have been more surprised if shed bitten him maybe less richards entire face crumpled into helpless lines he looked at me as if for help and i backed up i shook my head i was no better around crying women than he was maybe less he hugged her to him i heard her murmur i was so worried about you in that awful jail i backed up out of earshot and daniel joined me he didnt seem eager to join them either of course charlotte didnt have to cry to unman daniel thanks anita he said i looked up at him he was wearing a red tank top that was almost a twin of one richard had for all i knew it was the same one he looked tanned and handsome and very grownup youre assertive around everyone but your parents why is that he shrugged isnt everyone like that i shook my head no jason moved up beside us he echoed me no then he laughed of course my mother would never have gotten into a fight in a bar no matter what i did shes much too decorous decorous i said my last roommate had a wordaday calendar jason said youve been reading again i said he hung his head looking abashed then gave me rolled eyes and a grin it was such a mix of shame and utter cuteness that i laughed i cant donate blood and have sex twentyfour hours a day theres no television at the circus of the damned if there was i asked id still read but dont tell anyone i put an arm around his shoulders your secret is safe with me daniel put his arm around jason from the other side and said wont breathe a word of it we walked towards the fourbyfour arm in arm if anita was in the middle this would be perfect jason said daniel just stopped in his tracks staring at jason i pulled away from both of them you just dont know when to stop do you jason he shook his head no richard walked over to us he sent daniel to their mother and daniel didnt argue with the order he sent jason on to the car and jason didnt argue i stood looking up at his suddenly serious face wondered what my orders were going to be and bet i would argue with them whats up i asked ill have to go with daniel and my mother to calm her i hear a but coming i said he smiled but theres a ceremony to meet my lupa tonight its customary before two packs share a full moon that they be formally introduced how formally i asked i didnt pack for formal the smile widened into that wondrous smile that was his mothers it had that same utter good humor to it contagious i dont mean that kind of formal anita i mean there are rites to observe rites as in what i asked i sounded suspicious even to me he hugged me spontaneously not girlfriendboyfriend but just a happytoseeyou hug i have missed you anita i pushed away from him i make a suspicious comment and you say youve missed me i dont get that richard i love all of you anita even the suspicious parts i shook my head stick to business richard what rites the smile faded the good humor dying from his eyes he looked suddenly sad and i wanted to take it back to have him smile at me again but i didnt we werent an item anymore and hed been dating little miss schaffer the cowgirl hooker i didnt understand that at all she puzzled me even more than lucy i have to go with my mother for a while jamil and shangda can explain what you have to do as my lupa tonight i shook my head one of the bodyguards stays with you richard i dont care which one it is but you dont go out there alone mom will not understand a chaperone that isnt family richard said dont go all mommas boy on me richard ive had enough of that from daniel for one night explain it any way you like but you arent leaving here without backup he stared down at me and his handsome face was serious arrogant i am ulfric anita not you yeah youre ulfric richard youre in charge fine then do a good job of it whats that supposed to mean it means that if the bad guys find you out alone tonight they might not wait to find out if youre leaving tomorrow one of them might get a little eager and try to hurt you if its not silver bullets they cant kill me and how are you going to explain to your mother that you survived a shotgun blast to the chest i asked he glanced back at her and daniel you cut right to the bone dont you he said it saves time i said he turned back to me anger had darkened his eyes thinned out his face i love you anita but sometimes i dont like you very much its not me you dont like richard not on this issue youre terrified that if mommy dearest finds out youre a shapeshifter shell think youre a monster dont call her that sorry i said but its still the truth i think youre underrating charlotte youre her son and she loves you he shook his head i dont want her to know fine but choose a bodyguard why not tell your mom that hes backup in case the police try to make trouble its the truth as far as it goes richard said the best lies are always at least partially true richard youre much better at lying than i am he said i looked for anger in the words but there was nothing it was just a statement of fact that left his eyes empty and sad i was tired of apologizing so i didnt do you want to take their car and i can drive the fourbyfour back to the cabins he nodded ill take shangda with me he doesnt like you much i thought he might have warmed up to me since the fight this afternoon i said he still thinks you betrayed me richard said i didnt even try to touch that one fine ill take jason and jamil with me they can give me lessons in werewolf etiquette jason wont be much help hes never been part of a healthy pack whats that supposed to mean i asked it means that because our old lupa was such a sadistic bitch we were all afraid of each other a normal pack is much more touchyfeely more casual with each other how touchy i asked he smiled almost sadly talk to jamil hell teach you and jason too he seemed to think about that what about the wereleopards and the vampires i already asked verne they are our guests tonight one big happy family i said richard looked at me it was a long searching look it took a lot to meet his eyes and not to flinch it could be anita it really could be with that he turned and walked to his mother and brother i watched him go and wasnt sure what to make of his last comment i used to wonder why he put up with me but after meeting his mother i knew it had taken me three sunday dinners to realize why charlotte and i were either in perfect agreement or on opposite ends of any discussion we were too much alike a family like a pack can only have so many alphas or it tears itself apart only richards brother glenn is currently married and his wife and charlotte butt heads constantly aaron is a widower im told the fights between charlotte and aarons deceased wife were legendary theyd all gone out and married someone like mom glenns wife though fullblooded navajo was still petite and tough the zeeman men seemed to have a weakness for small and tough beverly as the only girl and the eldest was wonderfully dominant she and charlotte had almost not survived her teenage years according to glenn and aaron bev had settled down gone to college married and was pregnant with her fifth child she had four boys and was trying one last time for a girl id paid attention to richards family because id thought they were going to be my inlaws that didnt seem likely to happen now oh well i had enough problems with my own family who needed a second one everyone was in my room getting a lesson in werewolf etiquette i sat on the foot of the bed with cherry perched beside me shed washed off the black makeup and her face was pale and young with a dusting of golden freckles across her cheeks i knew she was my age twentyfive but without makeup she looked younger like her own younger more innocent sister the new clothes added to the illusion shed changed into a faded pair of jeans and an oversized tshirt clothes you wouldnt mind shapechanging in this close to the full moon sometimes you got carried away and changed early so im told so ive seen zane leaned against the far wall wearing nothing but a pair of jeans with the knees worn away to holes hed kept the nipple ring it looked very noticeable against his bare chest jason was wearing shorts that had started life as a pair of jeans the edges were ragged with strings like hed picked at them the only other thing he was wearing was an older pair of jogging shoes no socks he lay on his stomach head pointed towards us with one of my pillows bundled under his chin knees bent feet kicking slowly in the air while he listened to jamil jamil paced back and forth in front of us in his little smiley shirt hed kicked his shoes off by the door and paced on smooth dark feet even just walking he gave off an energy like a lowlevel current the moon was nearly full and energy was easy to come by wed tried to include nathaniel in the lecture but we couldnt find him i didnt like that much id been ready to man a fullscale search but zane had seen him going off with one of the female werewolves the implication seemed to be that theyd gone off for a little one on one so no search but i wasnt happy about it i wasnt even sure exactly why i wasnt happy about it but i wasnt nathaniel needed to know some rudimentary greetings because he was mine no one had ever met a lupa that was also nimirra for a leopard pard but verne had decided the leopards would be included because they were mine so they needed the little greetings lecture id sent damian and asher out to find nathaniel no one in vernes pack expected the vampires to be part of the official greeting in fact it had been requested that they not touch any of the werewolves unless offered strongly requested so it was just the four of us watching jamil pace he finally stopped in front of me stand up it sounded far too much like an order for my taste but i stood looking up at him richard says you have a degree in biology not the opening i was expecting but i nodded preternatural biology yeah how much do you know about natural wolves ive been reading mech i said jamils eyes widened just a bit l david mech yeah you seem surprised he is one of the leading authorities on wolf behavior why have you been reading him jamil asked i shrugged im lupa of a werewolf pack but im not a werewolf there are no good books on werewolves so the best i could do was research real wolves what else have you read he asked of wolves and men by barry holstun lopez a few other books but those were the two best ive found jamil smiled a quick baring of teeth you have just made my job a lot easier i frowned up at him the formal greeting is like one friendly wolf greeting another the point is to get the nose back here he touched the hair behind my ear gently do you rub the cheek along the other persons cheek like a real wolf would do i mean in human form you dont have any glands on the cheek to help you scent mark another wolf he looked down at me solemn almost nodding yes you do rub cheeks even in human form then you bury your nose in the hair behind the ear how big is vernes pack i asked fiftytwo wolves jamil said i raised eyebrows at him please tell me that i dont have to rub faces with every single one of them jamil smiled but it left his eyes serious he was thinking something i wanted to know what it was not with all of them just the alphas how many nine he said doable i guess i looked up into his thoughtful face and just asked what are you thinking so hard about jamil he blinked at me what dont tell me its nothing you went all solemn and thoughtful about five minutes ago what gives he stared down at me the concentration in his dark eyes was almost touchable im impressed that you bothered to research natural wolves thats the third time youve used the term natural wolves ive never heard it before jason rolled off the bed to his feet we are real wolves part of the time were just not natural i looked to jamil and he nodded so calling you guys real wolves is an insult yes jamil said anything else to watch for i asked jamil looked at jason they exchanged a look that made me feel excluded like there was some unpleasant surprise coming and no one was telling me what i said lets just do the greeting jamil said what are you guys hiding from me jason laughed just tell her a low growl trickled from jamils human throat the sound alone raised the hair on my arms i am sk—Üll and you have no name among the lukoi your voice is only the wind outside our cave jason took a few steps closer the trees themselves bow before the wind he said it sounded way too formal for jason good jamil said you do know some lukoi phrases we were afraid to touch each other jason said not to talk to each other zane pushed away from the wall moving between them standing close to me the moon is rising time is passing i frowned at all of them i feel like youre speaking in code and i dont know how to crack it apparently we have some phrases in common jamil said between the lukoi and the pard great the wolves and the leopards share some common ground now what greet me jamil said uhuh i said im lupa youre just the sk—Üll the muscle i outrank you so you offer me your face and throat first she is your lupa and our nimirra which is an equivalent rank to your ulfric she has the right to ask zane said jamil growled at him zane moved behind me as if using me for a shield it would have worked better if he hadnt been nearly ten inches taller than me she refuses you jamil said you stand alone before me no way i said zane is mine you arent going to use him for some macho dominant crap jamil shook his head he moved into you but you didnt touch him i frowned up at him so jamil sighed all your reading has told you nothing about us then explain it to me i said jason said when zane moved in close to you he was asking for your protection but you didnt touch him thats seen as a rejection of his petition for protection cherry was still sitting very still on the bed hands clasped in her lap its one of the rules that works the same for the wolves and for us i glanced behind me at them how do the two of you know all this with raina and marcus in charge we all got to do a lot of petitioning for protection jason said gabriel spent a lot of time with raina cherry said we the wereleopards got to spend a lot of time with the wolves so when zane moved up close what was i supposed to do do you want to protect him against me jamil said i stared up at that tall muscular body even if he hadnt been a lycanthrope hed have scared me in a fair fight of course nature had made sure there would be no fair fight jamil outweighed me by a hundred pounds or more his reach was twice mine his upper body strength well enough said there was no such thing as a fair fight between the two of us that was why i felt perfectly comfortable using weapons yeah i said i want to protect zane against you if thats what it takes then touch him jamil said i frowned again can you be a little more specific the touch is whats important jamil said not where or how zane was standing at my back i moved backwards until my back touched his body our bodies made a nice solid line enough i asked jamil shook his head for gods sake just touch him he motioned to jason ask for my protection jason came to his side with a smile he stood very close but was careful not to touch jamil put an arm across his shoulders obviously protective almost a hug there thats it does it have to be just like that or can i touch him anywhere thats noticeable jamil made a small sound between an umph and a growl you are making this too complicated no i said you are just answer the question no it doesnt have to be just like this but its best if you get in the habit of making the offer look normal to people why i asked what if zane were running from me in public he sees you through the crowd comes up to you all you have to do is pretend to hug him or even kiss him i know youve given him your protection and none of the humans around us know anything is wrong i wasnt sure how i felt about not being included with the other humans but i let it go i drew zane out from behind me with a hand around his waist id have been more comfortable if hed been wearing a shirt but hey that was my hangup not his i made it my left arm leaving my right free i also moved back enough so that my gun wasnt pressed up against his body having my arm around zanes waist standing a little apart made the gun under my arm very obvious there were a lot of different ways to make threats happy i asked jamil nodded once very curtly jason stepped away from him closer to zane and me jamils just mad that zane told you he had to do a submissive greeting and youve reminded her jamil said ooh jason said im so scared a roil of power prickled through the room i watched jamils brown eyes bleed to a rich yellow he stared at jason with wolf eyes you will be cherry slid off the bed kneeling behind me she reached a hand up to me and i took it she licked a quick tongue across my hand a greeting that only the leopards used then one slender hand went to my leg holding onto my pants like a small shy child she seemed to think something bad was about to happen i half expected jason to come to me like the wereleopards had but he didnt he moved farther into the room away from jamil but he didnt ask for help whats the big deal i asked jamil just offers me his cheek first right oh no jason said much more fun than that that made me frown because i knew what jasons idea of fun was maybe i asked for something i dont understand but you did ask jamil said and as our lupa it is your right i was beginning to suspect id made a faux pas that id asked something of jamil he didnt want to give and i probably wouldnt like receiving if you hadnt been such an asshole when we first got here jamil id probably let this go but he said but i dont back down not to you not to anyone jason said softly that too if i refuse its challenge between us jamil said fine but remember youve had your last free pass for the weekend jamil he nodded i see the gun then we understand each other i said we understand each other he said jamil closed the distance between us eyes still an eerie shade of yellow dont get cute jamil he gave a quick baring of teeth i am doing what you asked anita zane moved behind me hands on my shoulders but giving me more room to move cherry huddled against my legs neither of them moved away i took that as a good sign i hoped i was right jamil touched my face very lightly with the tips of his fingers if we were in public it would be this he bent downward and it looked like he was going to kiss me he did a soft brush of lips fingers still holding my face he drew back from me when he opened his eyes they were still that rich golden yellow it was a startling color against the darkness of his skin i had just stood there throughout too startled to know what to do neither the leopards nor jason called foul so jamil was doing what id forced him to do probably if it had been jason id suspected some sort of ploy to steal a kiss but jamil didnt play those kinds of games he stayed with his hands still cradling my face but tonight wont be in public between ourselves when no one watches he didnt finish the sentence he just leaned over me again his tongue ran across my lower lip i jerked back he let his hands fall to his sides you read the wolf books anita i am a submissive wolf begging a dominants attention its a variation of food begging by pups i said in two adult wolves its a ritual of licking and biting gently at the mouth of the dominant wolf by the subordinate jamil nodded youve made your point i said the greeting i am trying to teach you is like our version of a handshake you both offer your faces at the same time its more like a kiss show me i said he leaned into me again but this time he didnt try to touch my mouth he rubbed his cheek along mine rubbing his face across my ear until his face was buried in the hair behind my ear his movement had put my face against his hair his hair was in cornrows and the texture was rough and soft at the same time jamil spoke with his mouth still against my hair you have to bury your face in the hair and smell the skin he burrowed his face into my hair until he had to be touching skin i heard him breathing in air his breath was almost hot against my skin i tried to return the favor but had to raise on tiptoe one hand against his chest for balance zane slid away from me and i used my other hand on his shoulder the cornrows made it easier to put my face next to the skin of his scalp the braids moved around my face like small thin ropes i could smell his hair straightener his cologne and under all that was him the moment his scent hit me i felt a rush of power and it wasnt his i suddenly knew that richard was sitting on a bed holding his mother i felt him look up as if hed see me standing at the foot of the bed but i was miles away standing at the foot of a different bed we drew in the rich warm smell of jamils skin and richards power broke over me in a march of goose bumps jamil drew back from me hands still on my shoulders his nostrils flared while he drew in scent richard i smell our ulfric how zane pressed against my back rubbing his face against my hair cherry had curled herself around my leg like a fetus she is your lupa bound to your ulfric jamil stepped back from me something very close to fear on his face she cannot be bound to richard she is not lukoi i moved towards him and zane went to his knees behind me cherry let me go hands sliding away reluctantly they huddled together holding each other i spared them a glance and asked you guys all right zane nodded i saw you call the power of the marks once before but ive never been touching you when you called the ulfrics power its a rush cherry just stared at me eyes gone large in a pale face dont i know it jason said he was still across the room hugging his naked chest hands rubbing up and down his bare arms as if he were cold he wasnt cold i turned back to jamil i am bound to richard it isnt the same kind of bonding that hed have with another lycanthrope but it is a bond you are jeanclaudes human servant jamil said i hated the term but it was accurate technically anyway yes i am just as richard is jeanclaudes wolf to call he cannot call our ulfric like a dog richard does not answer to the vampires whims me either i said sometimes i think jeanclaude may have bitten off more than he can drink with the two of us the door to the cabin opened no knock no preliminaries asher stepped through with nathaniel in his arms he was bundled into ashers suit jacket what i could see of his legs were pale and bare i ran forward what happened asher laid nathaniel on the bed on his back trapping the jacket under his body he was nude except for the jacket nathaniel tried to curl up onto his side into a ball but asher stopped him trying to smooth his legs down to make him lie still lie still nathaniel it hurts his voice was strangled twisted tight with pain i knelt by the bed touching his face he looked at me eyes so wide they flashed white his mouth opened and a small moan escaped him his hand clawed at the bedspread as if he needed to hold something anything i gave him my hand and his grip was so tight i had to remind him not to crush my hand he muttered sorry then his spine bowed body twisting normally seeing nathaniel completely nude would have embarrassed me now i was too scared to be embarrassed there were bleeding cuts on his chest but they looked shallow nothing seemed wrong enough for this kind of pain cherry disappeared into the bathroom i didnt think you were that squeamish if you were a nurse who did this i asked he is our message from the local vampires asher said what message nathaniel twisted on the bed his other hand grabbing at my arm two slow tears trailed down his cheeks they kept asking me why wed come here he threw his head back and forth and i caught a glimpse of something on his neck i got one hand free and moved all that long auburn hair so i could see his neck a vampire bite showed in the smooth flesh of his neck the bite was clean neat but the skin was slightly darker than it should have been did one of you do this i asked i took blood from the bend of his arm asher said that is colins doing nathaniels body eased against the bed the spasm or whatever passing i told them we were here to rescue richard i told them the truth over and over his hand convulsed around mine eyes closing as if he were riding a wave of pain after a few seconds he opened his eyes his hand easing around mine they wouldnt believe me cherry came out of the bathroom she tried to push me gently but firmly out of the way but nathaniel clutched at my hand cherry settled for making me kneel by the head of the bed he could still hold my hand but i was out of the way she began to explore the wounds on his chest she was very submissive almost untrustworthily so but let someone be injured and it was like a different cherry rose to the occasion she became nurse cherry as if the leatherslutfromhell was her secret identity do you have a first aid kit in this cabin she asked no i said ive got one in my suitcase in the other cabin cherry said ill get it jason offered he started for the door wait i said jamil go with him i dont want anyone else taken tonight no one argued with me it was a first the two werewolves just went for the door damian had to move out of the way for them to leave he shut the door behind them and leaned against it his eyes had gone a drowning solid green like emerald fire his pale skin was taking on that translucent almost glowing quality that the vamps get when their humanity begins to fold away strong emotions will do that to the lesser vamps fear lust anger i looked at asher he was normal he stood just back from the bed that handsome tragic face blank and empty it was so like the expression jeanclaude used when he was hiding something i thought colin was either supposed to attack us directly or leave us alone i said no one said anything about this kind of shit it was unexpected asher said well explain it to me damian pushed away from the door stalking into the room every movement tight with anger they tortured him because they enjoyed it theyre vampires but they fed off more than just blood what are you saying damian they fed off his fear i looked from his glowing face to asher then back to damian you mean literally dont you damian nodded the one who brought me over was like that she could feed off of fear as if it were blood shed go for days feeding off of terror then suddenly shed take blood but she didnt just feed she slaughtered shed come back to the chamber covered in blood slick with it then shed make me his voice trailed off he looked at me his eyes were beginning to look like naked green flame as if his power were eating the bones of his eye sockets i felt it when we met colin i smelled it hes like her hes a night hag a mora what the hell is a night hag or a mora and what do you mean you met colin i thought you rescued nathaniel no they gave him back to us asher said if we did not see him the message would not be complete cherry interrupted us his pulse is thready his skin is clammy hes going into shock the cuts on his chest are shallow even two vampire bites in one night shouldnt put him into shock we heal better than this there is a third bite asher said through it all his voice had been utterly calm as if nothing touched him cherry looked down the length of nathaniels body then touched his thigh she moved his legs apart of course the femoral artery why is the skin discolored on both bites she touched the skin of his inner thigh the skin feels almost cold nathaniel writhed on the bed he let go of my hand reaching for me as if he wanted a hug he grabbed one arm and a handful of my blouse his eyes were wild it hurts what hurts i asked the bites are contaminated asher said what do you mean contaminated think of it as a poison hes a wereanimal theyre immune to poisons i said not this one asher said what kind of poison is it cherry said there was a knock on the door jason said its us damian looked at me his eyes had calmed down to a soft glow his skin almost back to the milky perfection that passed for normal i nodded he opened the door jason came in with a first aid kit bigger than most overnight bags maybe cherry had been a girl scout in another life jamil followed behind jason like a dark solemn shadow the kind of poison that nothing in that little bag will stop asher said i stared up at him suddenly realizing what hed just said you mean hes going to i couldnt even say it die asher said in that same utterly calm almost mildly amused voice that hed been using since they first walked into the cabin i stood nathaniels hands clinging to me i looked at cherry and she moved in to help me draw free of him i wanted to say things to asher that i didnt want nathaniel to hear zane crawled onto the bed on the other side nathaniel grabbed his hand and held on another spasm threw nathaniel writhing on the bed zane and cherry held him down let him use that crushing strength on their hands the two wereleopards stared at me while nathaniel thrashed eyes rolling back into his head zane and cherry watched me i was their nimirra their leopard queen i was supposed to protect them not drag them into shit like this i turned away from their accusing expectant eyes and moved with asher to the door what do you mean hes going to die youve seen the kind of vampires that rot and reform themselves yeah so one of them bit nathaniel ive been bitten by one of them jasons been bitten by one of them nothing like this happened to us i glanced back and found jason holding nathaniels hand while cherry started cleaning the chest wounds somehow i didnt think bandaging the cuts was going to help jamil and damian joined us we stood in a little circle talking while nathaniel screamed asher said it is one of the rarest of talents i thought that only morte damour lover of death the council member could do this colin chose his messages carefully the slashes are harm from a distance with just a flexing of power jeanclaude cant cause harm from a distance i said no and no one else can spread corruption from their bite no one else in this country you keep saying corruption jamil said what does that mean exactly cherry came to us with white gauze pads in her hands her pale freckles stood out like ink on her suddenly pale skin there was yellow and green puss on the gauze this came out of the chest wounds she said quietly what the hell is it we all looked at asher even damian but i was the one who said it out loud hes rotting hes decaying while hes still alive asher nodded the corruption is in his blood it will spread and then he will rot i looked back to the bed jason was speaking low and softly to nathaniel stroking his head like youd comfort a sick child zane was looking at me there has to be something we can do i said ashers face was as closed and careful as id ever seen it one of jeanclaudes memories of asher went through me so forcefully that my fingertips tingled with it it wasnt a memory of any one event i recognized the set of ashers shoulders i knew his body language with a familiarity built up of years of observation more years than id been alive what are you hiding asher i asked he looked at me pale pale eyes blank empty lined with those amazing golden eyelashes like shining lace he smiled the smile was everything it should have been joyous sensual welcoming that smile went through my heart like a knife i remembered that face whole and perfect i remembered when that smile had made me catch my breath i shook my head the physical movement helped i shook off the memories they faded but it didnt change what id seen what i knew you know how to save him dont you how badly do you want to save him anita his voice wasnt neutral now it was almost angry i brought him down here asher i put him in danger im supposed to protect him i thought he was supposed to be your bodyguard asher said hes walking food asher you know that nathaniel cant even guard himself asher let out his breath in a long sigh nathaniel is a pomme de sang what the hell are you talking about it means apple of blood it is a sobriquet among the council for willing food damian finished the thought the vampire that feeds from a pomme de sang is duty bound to protect them like a shepherd keeping the wolf from his sheep damian looked at asher while he said it and it was not a friendly look they were fighting about something but there was no time i touched ashers arm it felt stiff wooden not even alive he was drawing away from me away from the room away from what was happening he was going to let nathaniel die without even trying unacceptable i made myself grip that wooden unalive arm i hated it when jeanclaude felt like this it was a reminder of what he was and what he wasnt dont let him die not like this please mon chardonneret he jumped like id hit him when i used the old nickname that jeanclaude had used so many years ago it meant literally my goldfinch which sounded silly in english but the look on ashers face wasnt silly it was almost shocked no one has called me that in over two hundred years his arm softened under my hand feeling warm alive again i dont beg often but for this i will he means so much to you asher asked hes everyones victim asher someone has to give a damn about him please mon he put his fingers over my lips dont say it anita dont ever say it again unless you mean it i will save him anita for you i felt like i was missing something i could remember jeanclaudes pet name for asher but i couldnt remember why asher was afraid to try to heal nathaniel as i watched him walk to the bed golden hair trailing like a glittering veil across his shoulders that missing memory seemed very important asher held his hand out to damian come my brother or does the famed courage of the vikings fail you now i was slaughtering your ancestors before you were a gleam in your greatgranddaddys eye shit this is dangerous isnt it i asked asher knelt beside the bed he looked back at me the golden hair sliding over the scarred side of his face hiding it he knelt all golden perfection and smiled but it was bitter we can take the corruption into ourselves but if we are not powerful enough it will enter us and we will die but your precious wereleopard will be saved either way damian crawled onto the far side of the bed moving zane away from his spot by nathaniels head nathaniel had stopped screaming he lay very still skin pale shiny with sweat his breath came in shallow pants the wounds on his chest were oozing pus there was a smell in the room now faint but growing the bite on his neck still seemed solid but the skin of his neck was a deep blackish green like a bruise that was killing deep asher i said he looked at me one hand running along nathaniels bare thigh damians not a master i cannot save your leopard by myself anita who would you save which will you sacrifice i looked at damian his green eyes were human again he looked very mortal curled beside nathaniel dont make me choose but it is a choice anita it is a choice i shook my head do you want me to save him damian asked i met his gaze and didnt know what to say his pulse is very weak cherry said if youre going to do something you better do it soon do you want me to save him damian asked again nathaniels fast gasping breath was the only sound in the sudden silence they all looked at me waited for me to decide and i couldnt decide i felt my head nod almost as if i wasnt doing it i nodded the vampires began to feed a feeding takes longer in real life than it does in the movies either its too quick or they do a fade like a s sex scene we all stood around the room and watched the room was quiet enough that you could hear the vampires making small wet noises as they fed cherry knelt by the head of the bed she checked nathaniels wrist pulse periodically the rest of us had moved farther away i ended up on the far side of the room leaning my butt on the desk i was working very hard at not looking at the bed everyone moved around the room restless embarrassed i thought jason came to stand beside me leaning on the desk if i didnt know his life was at stake id be jealous i looked at him trying to tell if he was teasing there was a look in his eyes a heat that said he was not it made me look over at what was happening damian had drawn nathaniels body into his arms his lap so that he cradled the smaller man almost the full length of his body parts of damians body were lost to sight behind nathaniels naked body his arm cradled the smaller mans chest against the green silk shirt the pus had soaked into the cloth in blackening streaks nathaniels face was pressed by one pale hand into the vampires shoulder damian had come from behind for the neck strike you could see the top of his bloodred hair his mouth locked over the wound even from where i stood i could see damians jaws swallowing asher was still kneeling on the floor one of nathaniels pale legs flung outward so his foot hung in empty air ashers face was buried in the mans inner thigh so close to the groin that nathaniels slack genitalia touched the side of his face asher moved his head slightly and a spill of golden hair flung over nathaniels groin it didnt hide it so much as have him peeking out through it a blush flowed over my face so hard and fast i was almost dizzy in turning away i caught a glimpse of myself in the rooms only mirror my face was burning my eyes looked wide and surprised it was junior high all over again stumbling on couples under the bleachers hearing their laughter chase me into the night i stared at myself in the mirror and got a grip i was not fourteen anymore i was not a child i was not a virgin i could do this with a modicum of grace couldnt i jamil had moved to the farthest corner of the room he was sitting there arms tucked around his knees face set in harsh lines angry he wasnt enjoying the show either zane had moved back to lean against the wall arms crossed he was looking at the floor as if there was something very interesting on it jason was still sitting against the desk watching the show i looked at him without turning around you do realize that youre the only one who seems to be enjoying the view he shrugged grinning its a nice view i raised my eyebrows dont tell me youre gay dont tell me you care he replied my eyebrows went up a little farther my heart is breaking ill have to burn all my lingerie i kept watching his face he was smiling but not like it was a joke are you saying all that teasing is just an act i asked oh no i like women but anita almost none of the vampires in jeanclaudes inner circle are women ive been acting as a pomme de sang for two years thats a lot of fangs sinking into your body is it really that close to sex i asked the humor left his face and he just looked at me youve really never been rolled completely by a vamp have you i mean i knew you had partial immunity even before the marks but i thought someone somewhere would have gotten to you nope i said sometimes im not sure but it may be better than sex and almost everyone whos been doing me has been a guy so youre bisexual if what theyre doing now counts as sex yeah if it doesnt then he laughed and the sound was so abrupt in the silence that i saw zane and jamil jump if this doesnt count as sex lets just say that where no man has gone before no longer applies damned if i didnt want to ask who it had been maybe i would have asked but cherry spoke and the moment was gone his pulse is stronger losing this much blood he should be getting weaker but hes not asher drew back from the wound we are not so much drinking blood as drawing out the corruption he stood one hand under nathaniels thigh he moved the leg back onto the bed straightening his limbs as if he were a sleeping child a moment before it had been utterly sexual now there was something in the way asher acted that was tender careful damian pulled away from the wound there was a spot on his lip not red but black i wondered if it had tasted bad he wiped the spot away with the back of his hand if it had been pure blood hed have licked it off so it hadnt been pleasant he crawled out from under nathaniel laying him carefully on his back he drew covers over nathaniel as he moved off the bed cherry had her first aid kit open she recleaned the chest wounds with antibacterial antiseptic the first few sterile cloths came away smeared with pus wed all moved next to the bed without realizing it the smell was stronger here unpleasant but fading when the skin and wounds were completely cleaned the flesh was whole and bright red blood welled into the slashes cherry flashed the room a smile so warm and bright that you had to smile back hes going to be all right she sounded surprised and i wondered how close it had been someone drew a hissing breath i turned to the sound damian was backing up he was staring at his hands that pale milky skin was turning dark a blackness flowing under the skin the flesh of his hands began to peel back while we watched shit i said damian held his hands out to me like a child that had burned its hand i didnt know which was worse the terror in his face or the almost resigned look in his eyes i shook my head no i said but my voice was soft no i said it again louder stronger you cannot stop it asher said damian stared at the darkening flesh of his hands soft horror on his face help me he said and he looked to me i stared down at him and didnt have the faintest idea how to save him what can we do i said i know you are accustomed to riding in on your white steed and saving the day anita but some battles cannot be won asher said damian had gone to his knees staring at his hands he ripped his shirt off in pieces leaving remnants of the sleeves on his arms the rotting flesh was halfway to his elbows a fingernail split and fell to the floor with a burst of something dark and noisome the smell was back sweet and sickly i healed damian once of a facial cut i said damian made a sound between a laugh and something more bitter i didnt nick myself shaving anita he shifted his gaze from the peeling flesh of his hands to me even you cant heal this i dropped to my knees in front of him reaching out to touch his hands damian jerked away dont touch me i put my hands over his hands the skin felt almost hot to the touch as if the corruption were cooking him from the inside out the skin was soft as if if i pressed too hard the skin would give way like a rotted spot in an apple my throat was tight damian im sorry dear god it was an inadequate word a thousand years of life and hed given it up for me he would never have taken such a risk if i had not asked it was my fault the look in his eyes was grateful and painfilled he pulled his hands gently out from under mine careful not to press too hard against my hands i think we were both afraid my fingers would sink through his skin and into the flesh inside his face twisted in pain and a small sound escaped his lips i remembered nathaniels cries of how it had hurt the ends of his fingers burst like overripe fruit spilling something black and greenish onto the floor it spattered my arm the smell was growing in sickening waves i didnt swipe at the drops on my arm but i wanted to i wanted to slap at them like a spider shrieking my voice held some of the strain i was trying to keep off my face ive got to at least try to heal you how asher asked how do even you begin to heal this damian made a low whimpering sound his body shuddered face ducking neck twisting and finally he screamed wordless hopeless how asher asked again i dont know and i was screaming too only his original master the one who saved him from the grave would have any chance of healing him i looked at asher i called damian from his coffin once it was accidental but he answered to my call i kept his soul whatever from fleeing his body once we are bound together a little how did you call him from his grave asher asked necromancy i said i am a necromancer asher i know nothing of necromancy he said the smell swelled stronger i breathed through my mouth but that just put the odor on the back of my tongue i was almost afraid to look at damian i turned slowly like a character in a horror movie where you just know the monster is right behind you and you delay looking because you know it will blast your sanity forever but some things are worse than any nightmare the rot had moved past his elbows naked bone showed through the back of his hand the smell had driven all but the three of us back i stayed kneeling in the rotting fluid of damians body asher stayed close but only i was still within touching distance if i were his master what would i do you would drink his blood take the corruption into yourself as we did for nathaniel i didnt think vamps fed on each other not for food asher said but there are many reasons to share blood food is only one of them i stared at damian watching the blackness spread under his skin like ink i could actually see it swimming underneath his flesh i cant drink the corruption away i said but i could damians voice came breathy with pain no asher said he took a threatening step towards us i could feel his power flaring out from him like a whip damian flinched but looked up at the other vampire he held his hands out to asher pleading what is going on i asked looking from one to the other of them asher shook his head face angry but otherwise unreadable i watched his features smooth and grow blank he was hiding something no i said getting to my feet no you tell me what damian meant neither spoke tell me i screamed it into ashers calm face he just stared at me face as closed and impassive as a dolls dammit one of you tell me what damian meant how could he drink away his own corruption if damian started no asher said pointing a finger at him you are not my master damian said i must answer shut up asher i said shut the fuck up and let him talk would you have her risk all for you asher asked it does not have to be her only someone with more than human blood damian said tell me i said now damian spoke in a rushed whisper voice edged with pain if i drank blood from one powerful enough i might be able he shuddered struggling then continued in a voice that was weaker than just a moment before might be able to take in enough power to cure myself but if the one he takes blood from is not strong enough mystically to take the corruption into himself then they will die as damian is dying now asher said im sorry jason said but count me out me too zane said jamil was across the room hugging his arms he just shook his head cherry knelt by the bed she said nothing eyes huge face terrified i finally turned back to asher it has to be me i cant ask anyone else to take the risk asher grabbed the back of my hair in a movement so fast i hadnt seen it coming he twisted my face back to look at damian is this how you want to die anita is it is it i spoke through gritted teeth let go of me asher now he released me slowly dont do this anita please dont the risk is too great hes right damians voice came in a bare whisper so low i was surprised i could hear it at all you could cure me but kill yourself the rot had spread up his arms and was gliding like some malignant force underneath his collarbones his chest was like glowing ivory and i could feel his heart thudding in his chest i could feel it like a second heartbeat in my own head a vampires heart didnt always beat but it was beating now i was so scared i could taste something flat and metallic in my mouth my fingertips tingled with the desire to run i couldnt stay in this room and watch damian melt down into a stinking puddle but part of my brain was screaming at me to run run somewhere far away where i wouldnt have to watch and i certainly wouldnt have to let those rotting hands touch me i shook my head i stared at damian not at the rotting flesh but at his face his eyes i stared into those shining green eyes like bits of emerald fire it was ironic that as parts of him corrupted and slothed away that what was left had become its most beautiful his skin was polished ivory with a depth of light like some white jewel his hair seemed to glow like spun rubies and those eyes those emerald eyes i stared at him made myself see him i swept my hair to one side exposing my neck do it i dropped my hand and the hair moved back to hide my neck anita he said do it damian do it now please before i lose my nerve he crawled to me he swept the hair aside with a hand gone blackened flesh and bone he left a trail of something heavy and thick on my shoulder i could feel that thickness sliding down my shirt like a snail i concentrated on the soft glow of his skin the imperfect slope of his nose where someone centuries ago had broken that perfect profile but it wasnt enough i turned my head to one side so he wouldnt have to touch me more than necessary i saw his head tense for the strike and i closed my eyes it was sharp like needles and it didnt get better damian wasnt strong enough to roll me with his eyes there would be no magic to take away the pain his mouth locked against the wound and he began to feed i thought id have to try and force my power into him or lower my shields and let him inside my power let him drink it away but moments after his teeth pierced my skin something flared between us power bond magic it raised every hair on my body damian cuddled against the front of me pressing our chests to one another and the power burst over us in a rush that filled the room with sighing distantly i realized that there was a wind and it was coming from us a wind forged of the cool touch of vampire and the chill control of necromancy a wind forged of us damian was like a feeding thing at my throat the power took the pain turned it into something else i felt his mouth at my throat felt him swallowing my blood my life my power i gathered it all into us and thrust it back into damian i fed it into him with my blood i visualized his skin whole and perfect i felt the power spill down his body i felt us push out the other i could feel it flowing out of us not onto the floor but into the floor past the floor into the ground below we were exorcising it ridding ourselves of it it was no more the two of us knelt bathed in power a wind trailed damians hair across my face and i knew the wind was us it was damian who drew back trailing power between us like the broken shreds of some dream he knelt in front of me lifting his hands to my face they were healed under the remnants of that black ooze his hands were healed his arms healed he cradled my face in his hands and kissed me the power was still there it flowed over us through his mouth in a line of energy that burned i drew back from damians kiss i managed to sit up anita i looked at damian thank you he said i nodded youre welcome now asher said i think it is time for showers all around he stood pants covered in black goop it was on his hands too and i couldnt remember when hed touched damian or the floor i could feel the stuff clinging to my bare back where damian had touched me my pants were soaked with it from the knees down the clothes would have to be burned or at least thrown away this was one of the reasons i kept a pair of coveralls in my jeep to put on over my clothes at crime scenes and some zombie raisings of course i hadnt expected to get this messy before id even left the damn cabin showers sound great i said you first may i suggest that you go first a hot shower is a wonderful luxury but for damian and me it is a luxury not a necessity good point i said my hair had kept the stuff from soaking to my scalp but i could feel it when i touched my hair it i kept saying it i was shying away from the fact that it was damians body rotted and leaked out upon the floor sometimes when its too horrible you have to distance yourself from it language is a good way to do that victims become an it very quickly because sometimes its too horrible even to say he or she when youre scraping pieces of someones loved one off your hands it has to be an it has to be or you run screaming so i was covered in black greenish it i washed my hands thoroughly enough so i could dig through my suitcase without contaminating the clothes id picked out jeans and a polo shirt asher appeared behind me i looked up at him what i asked it sounded rude even to me i mean what now asher rewarded me with a smile we will have to meet colin tonight i nodded oh yeah he is definitely on my dance card for tonight he smiled and shook his head we cannot kill him anita i stared at him you mean we cant as in its too hard a job or we cant as in we shouldnt do it perhaps both but certainly the latter i stood he sent nathaniel to us to die i looked into the suitcase not seeing it just not wanting to look up there was a rim of blackness at the base of my fingernails that the scrubbing at the sink hadnt lifted there had been a moment when the power broke between us and i knew it would work but until that second i had tried very hard not to think about it it was only after id gone into the bathroom to clean my hands off that i started to shake id stayed in the bathroom until my hands were steady the fear was under control all that was left was anger i do not think anyone was meant to die anita i think it was a test a test of what i asked how much power we truly have in a way it was a compliment he would never have contaminated nathaniel if he thought we had no hope of saving him how can you be so sure because to kill a pomme de sang of another master vampire is a mortal insult wars have begun over less but he knows we cant make war on him without the council hunting us down which is why we cannot kill him asher held up his hand which stopped me with my mouth open i closed it the last master you killed was threatening your life directly you killed her to protect yourself selfdefense is allowed but colin has not offered us personal violence that is cutting it pretty damn close asher he gave a graceful nod oui so if we kill him the council comes back to town and cleans our clock slight frown lines showed between his eyes i dont think he understood the slang they will kill us he said id met some of the council and i knew he was right jeanclaude had enemies on the council and now so did i no i did not want to give the nightmares of all vampirekind an excuse to come back to st louis and wipe us out what can we do because mark me on this asher they will pay for what they did to nathaniel i agree if we do nothing to avenge the insult it will be viewed as a sign of weakness and colin may come against us and kill us why is everything so damned complicated with you guys i asked why couldnt colin just believe wed come down here to rescue richard because we didnt leave town nathaniels voice came thin but steady from the bed he blinked lilac eyes at me cherry had bandaged his chest and the neck wound was covered with a large piece of taped gauze i assumed the thigh wound was similarly covered but the bedspread covered him from the waist down when richard got out of jail colin expected us to leave town when we didnt he thought we meant to take over his territory i went to stand by the bed zane said you went off with one of vernes werewolves how did the vamps get hold of you mira he said excuse me i said the werewolfs name is mira he looked away from me as if he didnt want to look me in the face while he talked she took me home we had sex then she left the room when she came back the vampires were with her he looked up at me i found myself staring down into his eyes and the need in them was so raw it made me flinch there were too many of them for you to fight nathaniel i said its okay fight he laughed and it was so bitter it hurt just to hear it there was no fight i was already chained down i frowned why he let out a long sigh anita anita god he put one arm across his eyes zane came to the rescue sort of you know that nathaniel is a submissive i nodded i know he likes to be tied up and the light dawned oh okay i get it mira invited you home for some s and m sex d and s dominance and submission zane said but yeah i took a deep breath mistake the room still stank of bodily fluids the unpleasant kind so she wrapped you up like a present and gave you to them yes he said softly the sex had been good she was a good top top i asked dominant zane said ah nathaniel curled onto his side drawing the bedspread around him the master colin paid her to bring one of us to them anyone of us it didnt matter who it could have been jason or zane or cherry one of their animals he said he huddled down into the blankets eyes fluttering shut then open then shut i looked at cherry is he alright i gave him something to help him sleep it wont last long our metabolisms are too fast but hell get maybe half an hour an hour if were lucky if youre not going to take a shower id like to damian said no im getting in but you cant wear what youve picked out asher said i frowned at him what are you talking about jeanclaude sent a trunk of clothes just for this occasion he said oh no i said no more leather and lace shit i agree with you anita asher said if we were simply going to kill them it wouldnt matter what we wore but we are putting on a show as much as anything appearance will matter well shit i said fine ill dress up we wont kill anyone but you better come up with something that we can do to them they cant abuse our people like this and just walk away they will expect retribution anita they are waiting for it i looked at nathaniel cuddled so deep in the blankets that only the top of his head showed this retribution better be good asher i will do my best i shook my head you do that i went into the shower without any clothes to put on because the trunk was in the other cabin i figured with both coffins in my room i didnt need the trunk id really hoped we wouldnt be opening the damn thing i hated dressing up in normal dressy clothes jeanclaudes idea of dressing up was always worse it took three rounds of shampoo to get my hair clean the stuff on my body didnt seem to want to come off unless i scrubbed there is that point in the middle of the back that you just cant do yourself it is one of the few areas that married people have an edge on us single folk i finally had to turn the shower on as high as it would go and just let it pound the middle of my back the stuff finally sloughed off and floated down the drain the stuff clung like nothing id ever had to clean off before that included real rotting corpses and zombies none of it had ever been as tough to get rid of as damians fluids cherry was the one who knocked on the door and brought in a pile of clothes i didnt like any of them too much leather for my taste it took two trips back and forth wrapped in nothing but a towel to find clothes that i was willing to wear there was one red leather bodysuit that seemed to be nothing but straps it might be interesting for private use just between jeanclaude and myself but wearing it in public was definitely out i ended up in a shortsleeved black velvet midriff top with such a low neckline that it took a special bra under it just so the bra didnt show jeanclaude had kindly packed the bra it was one of those uplifting ones and if there was one thing my chest didnt need it was more lift but it was also the only bra i had access to that plunged low enough that it didnt show with the shirt there was a velvet dress that would have needed the bra for its neckline too jeanclaude had been a busy little vampire everything fit perfectly if you were willing to wear it i picked a leather skirt as the lesser of evils there was a pair of thighhigh black boots that zipped in the back the tops of the boots were wide and stiff and open at the back the fronts of the boots came up to the absolute limit of my legs brushing my groin at odd moments if i walked wrong the boots had to have been custommade for me i didnt remember jeanclaude ever measuring me for shoes hed held pretty much every inch of me in his hands at one point or another apparently that had been enough but the leather skirt had belt loops for my shoulder holster and the velvet midriff had enough sleeves that the shoulder straps didnt dig into any bare flesh the side straps felt a little strange against my bare sides when i moved but it was doable of course there was no way to wear an innerpants holster in the skirt i had added the spine sheath down my back and both wrist sheaths the spine sheath showed underneath the midriff but hey they expected us to be armed frankly i wanted a second gun with me one of the good things about flying on jeanclaudes private jet as opposed to an airline was that i had several guns to choose from it was a miniuzi on a shoulder strap it had a clip that attached to the back of the skirt so it didnt swing around too much but you could pull it out into the open with one hand when i put it on ashers only comment had been we cant kill them anita i looked at the weapons that id laid out on one of the last clean spaces of floor there was an american derringer a second browning hipower a sawedoff shotgun and one pumpaction shotgun i looked up at him i didnt bring everything i had so glad to hear it he said but the machine gun is a killing weapon nothing more the reason im in this outfit is because you said we need to make a good show well we cant cause harm from a distance we cant spread corruption with any of your bites what the hell are we going to do asher what can we possibly do that will impress them i swung the uzi into my left hand pointing it at the ceiling if theres anyone with him tonight that we can kill ill kill them with this and you think that will impress or frighten colin have you ever seen a vampire cut in half by one of these i asked asher seemed to think about that for a few seconds as if hed seen so many horrible things that he just wasnt sure finally he shook his head no i have not well i have i let the gun swing back to the small of my back it impressed me did you do it he asked his voice soft i shook my head no just saw it done jamil knelt beside me he was wearing something that had started life as a black tshirt but had been cut so severely at the neck arms and midriff that it looked more like a wishful thought than a shirt it covered his nipples and that was about it but his upper body was muscular and impressive nearly bare we were going for impressive tonight hed gotten to keep his black jeans and i was jealous but jamil didnt belong to jeanclaude so thered been no time to have some piece of leather specially made truthfully i hadnt been a hundred percent certain jamil was even going to come with us not only was jamil coming but so was richard surprise surprise jamil took an armload of clothes for richard to choose from shangda was coming along as well and he needed to change though he like jamil had never belonged to jeanclaude intimately enough to have specially made clothes so it was whatever they could find in his suitcase happy hunting damian had refused to share a shower with asher even though they were both dirty and would need someone to help scrape the stuff from the hardertoreach places id suggested they share a shower because they were both guys i knew that asher was bisexual but i still had a hard time wrapping my midwestern upbringing around the fact that it didnt matter what sex asher shared a shower with he saw both as sexual objects i knew it and it didnt really bother me but every once in a while the knowledge surprised me i dont know why asher came out of the shower with nothing but a towel knotted at his waist damian went into the shower the last of the night jason had helped asher scrape the hardertoreach places jason didnt tease the vampire he just went in helped him clean up and got out id actually wondered after jasons little confession if he would tease men the same way he teased women apparently not the scars on ashers chest were very visible as he walked the scars on his right thigh flashed from the towel the rest of him was a pale golden perfection hed once known what it was like to walk into any room and have people gasp at his beauty people still gasped but not for the same reasons zane and cherry were being very careful not to look at him they kept their faces blank but their discomfort screamed how they felt ashers face was bland as if he didnt notice but i knew he did jason didnt look away hed pulled on a pair of leather pants but waited on the shirt and boots because he still had to help damian flake the gunk off his skin he sat on one of the coffins swinging his bare feet looking at me his eyes flicked to the vampire then back to me oh hell who died and made me den mother youd think hanging around with this many preternatural studly guys would mean there was a lot of sex and sexual tension was in the air a lot but more than sex was pain i dont know if it was because i was a girl or what but i ended up doing a hell of a lot more handholding than any of the guys maybe it was a girl thing i certainly didnt think of myself as particularly compassionate so why was it me walking across the floor to the vampire asher was kneeling in front of the trunk his back was smooth and almost perfect only a few trailing scars where the holy water had dripped down his side his golden hair hung thick and wet water trailing in silver lines down his back there werent enough towels so the guys were forgoing a second towel for the hair i took the towel id used for my hair from the back of the desk chair id put it there so it could dry i went to him and put a hand on his shoulder he flinched lowering his head trying to get the wet hair to cover his scarred face the gesture was automatic no thinking required and it hurt my heart to see him do it if wed been lovers id have licked the water off his chest caressing my tongue down the deep scars maybe even slid a hand under the towel but we werent lovers and id never seen him nude i didnt know what was under the towel hed told me once that he was still fully functional but that didnt really tell me what he looked like under the towel and as comfortable as i was with him i wasnt sure i wanted to know if it was as bad as his chest i was almost sure i didnt want to see yes i admit there was a small part of me that did want to know for sheer curiositys sake i did the best i could i laid my face against the roughness of his right cheek what are you going to wear he sighed and leaned his face into me one hand touched my hand sliding my arm across his damp chest i think we shall need to shock them i shall wear very little i moved back enough to see his face he kept my hand pressed to his chest resting on the smooth perfection of his left side you sure about that he smiled but blinked at the same time so i couldnt read his eyes he patted my hand and let me go i am accustomed to the effect i have on people ma cherie i have had centuries to use it to my advantage i stood and draped the towel over his shoulders youll need this for your hair he grabbed the ends of the towel like a shawl pressing the cloth to his nose and mouth it smells of the sweet scent of your skin i touched a strand of that heavy gold hair you say the nicest things i stared down into that face into the frosted blue of his eyes and felt something low in my body tighten a sudden flexing of lust that made me catch my breath sometimes it happens sometimes its just a gesture a turn of the head and you catch your breath your body reacts on a level that you cant control when it happens you pretend it didnt you hide it heaven forbid that the object of such instant desire should know what youre thinking but tonight i let it show in my eyes i let him see how he moved me he took my hand and laid a gentle kiss against my skin ma cherie jason came to stand near us leaning against the nearest coffin as hed leaned against the desk damn he said what i asked youve seen me naked or almost weve been up close and very personal he sighed and you didnt look at me like that jealous i asked he seemed to think about that for a second then nodded yeah i think i am asher laughed and it was touchable caressable like a feather trailing down your skin held by a knowledgeable hand in that smooth perfect body in the full bloom of your youth alive and breathing and you are jealous of me how lovely a knock on the door saved us from further discussion i drew the browning and put my back to the wall near the door who is it its verne i parted the drape and looked out he seemed to be alone i opened the door and ushered him inside the moment his back was to me i pressed the gun barrel into his back and kicked the door closed he froze whats up he asked you tell us i said anita asher said no hes the ulfric hes supposed to have his pack under solid control i felt his ribs expand through the gun barrel i can smell the shit in the carpet the sheets colin pay a visit i shoved the barrel tight enough into his back to leave a bruise he left a present he gave us one of his presents once verne said i know what im smelling in here because i held erins hand while he rotted to death why should i believe you i asked if you have a problem with colins people why pull a gun on me one of your wolves lured nathaniel away and delivered him to the vampires again i felt the movement through the gun barrel as he turned his head to look at the bed why isnt he dead thats our business i said he nodded which of my wolves delivered your cat to colin mira i said shit he said i knew she was pissed that richard had stopped seeing her but i never thought shed go over to the vampires asher walked to us by rules of hospitality you can be held responsible for the actions of your pack what can i do to make up for this breach of protocol the words sounded way too formal for vernes downhome drawl i leaned into him because the gun couldnt get any closer without going into his body had to make my point somehow how do i know you didnt tell her to do it i told you what he did to erin colin said we were getting above ourselves forgetting that vampires are more powerful than any animal how the hell did you cure your leopard his names nathaniel i said verne took a deep breath let it out slowly how did you cure nathaniel i flicked my eyes past vernes body to asher he gave the slightest of nods and i backed up enough steps that id be out of reach in case verne was upset about the gun but i kept the gun pointed at him because i was still closer than ten feet even a normal man armed with just a knife can close that distance quicker than most people can upholster a gun at great risk to ourselves asher said how verne asked he moved towards the bed as if i was of no importance asher told him how wed healed nathaniel and neither of you were poisoned by it verne asked damian was affected asher said verne searched the room you mean the redhaired vampire asher nodded i can hear him in the bathroom he should be dead yes he should be asher said verne turned and looked at me then our vargamor said she felt your power tonight said you conjured up some sort of spell i dont know the term vargamor i said a packs wise woman or wise man a witch usually but not always sometimes just a psychic most packs dont bother with them anymore how did you save the vampire once he started to rot i holstered the browning one i couldnt keep the gun naked in my hands forever two i was beginning to believe verne im a necromancer verne damians a vampire i healed him his eyes narrowed just like that i laughed no not just like that we damn near didnt save him but we did it could you cure one of my people did colin do one of your people tonight i asked he shook his head no but if we stand with you against him he will why would you stand with us on this i asked because i hate that bloodsucking son of a bitch if thats true then mira broke pack law jason said verne nodded normally id kick her ass she disobeyed me but she injured you your grievence takes precedence he glanced at asher then at me as if he wasnt a hundred percent sure who to ask permission of what can my pack do to make this right between us i looked at him head to one side i didnt like the idea that one of his wolves had betrayed nathaniel it made me not trust him but i understood why mira was pissed richard had dumped her a woman scorned and all that first delay the greeting ceremony i said were going to be ass deep in vampires there wont be time for anything else tonight verne nodded done and i want miras head in a basket i said we need a place to meet colin asher said our lupanar is ready for company verne said most generous asher said it was generous maybe too generous you understand that we arent going to kill colin for this that whatever happens tonight unless he attacks us forces us to defend ourselves well be leaving in a few days and colin will still be master of the city you mean if i help you hurt him he may hold a grudge verne said i nodded yeah erin was a good kid he wasnt even one of the young ones that had gone up against the vampires they picked him because he was one of my wolves nathaniel said that mira had been paid to bring one of our animals to colin i said it sounds like him vernes hands balled into fists and his power moved through the cabin like a line of heat ive wanted him to pay for what happened to erin for ten years but i havent had the power to go up against him you dont want him dead i asked and i sounded surprised colin for the most part leaves us alone but better yet he cant call wolves if we kill him a new master will move in maybe one that can control wolves maybe one that is a bigger meaner son of a bitch dead would be great but not until i know what it would cost my pack the devil you know or the devil you dont i said verne looked at me for a second then nodded yes great i said lets turn up the fire under this particular devil and roast his cojones for one of the few times on this trip everyone seemed to be in agreement i was used to killing vampires not punishing them because id learned a long time ago that you either killed monsters or left them the fuck alone once you pull on their tail metaphorically speaking youre just never quite sure how theyre going to react sorry cancel that i knew exactly how colin would react the question was how much blood would be spilled and could we possibly pull this off without getting some of our people killed i didnt give a damn if we killed some of colins people in fact i was sort of looking forward to it i walked through a world of silvered moon shadows and the black outlines of trees the boots were lowheeled enough and they fit well enough that they actually werent bad for walking through the woods it wasnt the fit of anything that made it uncomfortable to be out in the woods it was the heat and the noise there was sweat at the bend of my knees underneath the nylons and the leather id added a leather jacket borrowed from jason the jacket hid the miniuzi and the big leather purse i had slung over one shoulder the purse was cherrys and had a can of aerosol hair spray in it i had a golden lighter in the pocket of the jacket the lighter belonged to asher it was too hot to be wearing the jacket all that leather crinkled and sighed every time i moved under other circumstances it might have been interesting as it was it was irritating important safety tip dont try to sneak up on people in new leather at least not people with supernatural hearing of course we werent sneaking up on anybody tonight the vampires knew we were coming vernes people had delivered the message once richard arrived on the scene my suspicious nature was ignored if verne said he told the vamps where to meet and why then of course richard believed him truthfully so did i but it still bugged me how easily richard accepted vernes word of course richard had been visiting with vernes pack for several years every summer he knew them as friends i respected friendship i just didnt always trust it okay i didnt trust other peoples friends i trusted my own because i trusted my own judgment which meant i guess that i still didnt trust richards judgment no i didnt thinking of him was enough i could feel him off to my left like a warm presence moving through the summer night i had a moment of feeling him walking i could feel the rhythm of his body as he moved i was almost dizzy stumbling as i pulled away from the image zane took my arm you all right i nodded and pulled away i didnt know him that well yet if i had a choice i wasnt that touchyfeely with people i didnt know but the moment i pulled away i felt him shrink back i knew without any magic at all that id hurt his feelings i was his nimirra his leopard queen and i was supposed to like him or at least not dislike him i didnt know whether apologizing would make it worse or better so i said nothing zane moved off through the woods leaving me to myself he was wearing the leather pants vest and boots hed worn on the plane funny how zanes personal wardrobe was just fine for tonight richard stopped moving and stared at me across the yards that separated us he was dressed all in black leather pants and a silk shirt that clung to his new improved muscular upper body hed been lifting weights since jeanclaude last measured him for shirts he stood there all in black a color id never seen him in the moonlight was strong enough that i could see his face in bold highlights only the eyes were lost to shadow as if he were blind even from here i could feel him like a line of heat in my body earlier asher had made things in my body go low and tight but now standing in the hot summer woods watching the gleam of moonlight reflecting off the silk and leather on richards body seeing his hair slide like a soft cloud around his shoulders it made my chest tight closer to tears than to lust because he wasnt mine anymore whether i liked it or not whether i wanted it or not i would always regret not having been with richard id had other opportunities in the past for being with other guys in intimate settings but id never regretted saying no before in fact i always felt like id dodged a bullet only richard made me regret he started walking towards me it made me look away as if wed been at a restaurant or something and id been caught staring at my ex i remembered a night just after college when id been in a restaurant with some friends and seen my exfianc–π with his new girlfriend hed walked towards us as if hed introduce me to her id fled to the ladies room and hid out until one of my girlfriends came and told me the coast was clear four years ago id run for cover because he had dumped me and didnt seem to miss me now i stood my ground but not because i had dumped richard i stood my ground because my pride wouldnt let me hurry away through the trees and pretend i hadnt run away i wasnt much into running lately so i stood there in the silvered dark my heart beating in my throat and waited for him to come to me jamil and shangda stood together in the dark watching but not following him as if hed told them to stay put even from here i could tell shangda didnt like it as far as i could see shangda hadnt changed clothes he was still in his allblack totally monochromed tailored suit shirt and accessories richard came to stand about two feet in front of me he just looked down at me and said nothing i couldnt read his expression and i didnt want to read his mind again i broke first babbling im sorry about that richard i didnt mean to invade you like that im not very good at controlling the marks yet thats all right he said why is it that voices in the dark can sound so much more intimate you okay with ashers plan for tonight i asked more for something to say while he stared down at me than for anything else verne had learned through mira that colin believed that asher was his replacement both masters were of an equivalent age colin was more powerful but much of that extra power could have been from the ties that made him master of the city it was the first time id ever been told that just being master of the city gave you extra power live and learn i understand that asher has to convince colin that he doesnt want the job richard said asher had decided that the way to do that was to convince colin he was infatuated with me and with jeanclaude i wasnt sure how i felt about the plan really but we all agreed even richard that the local vamps wouldnt believe that ties of friendship and nostalgia made asher happy where he was vampires are like people in one respect theyll believe a sexual explanation before an innocent one even death doesnt change the human trait of being willing to believe the worst of a person rather than the best its none of my business what you do or who you do it with remember his voice was a great deal more neutral than his words i was embarrassed in the bathroom you caught me off guard i remember i said he shook his head if were supposed to flaunt our power tonight that means we need to use the marks mira told them that you were interviewing new lupas they know were not an item i said we dont have to show them domestic bliss anita just power he held out his hand to me i stared at it the last time hed led me through summer woods had been the night he killed marcus the night when everything had gone wrong i dont think i can take another stroll through the woods richard his hand closed into a fist i know i handled it badly that night anita youd never seen me shapeshift and i shifted on top of you while you couldnt get away ive thought about that i couldnt have chosen a worse way to introduce you to what i was i know that now and im sorry i scared you scared didnt quite cover it but i didnt say it out loud he was apologizing and i was going to accept it thank you richard i didnt mean to hurt you i just couldnt handle it he said i sighed couldnt handle it he held his hand out to me im sorry anita me too richard he gave a small smile no magic anita just your hand in mine i shook my head no richard afraid he asked i stared up at him when we need to draw the marks we can touch but not here not now he reached up to touch my face and i heard the silk of his shirt rip he lowered his arm and put three fingers in the ripped seam thats the third time thats happened he spread the seam on the other arm putting his whole hand in it he turned and showed me his back the seams at the shoulders had pulled apart on both sides like mouths i giggled and i dont do that often you look like the incredible hulk he flexed his arms and shoulders like a bodybuilder the look of mock concentration on his face made me laugh the silk ripped with an almost wet sound silk sounds the closest to flesh of any cloth when you tear it only leather sounds more alive under a blade his tanned flesh showed pale through the black cloth as if some invisible knife were slashing rips in it he straightened up one sleeve had ripped so badly at the shoulder that it flapped around his upper arm the seams at the top of his chest were like twin smiles i feel a draft he said he turned and showed me his back the shirt had peeled off his back hanging in tatters its trashed i said too much weight lifting since i was measured for the shirt you are perilously close to being too muscular i said can you ever be too muscular he asked yes you can i said you dont like it he asked he wadded his hands into the front of the shirt and pulled the silk tore into black shreds ripping like a soft scream he tossed the silk at me i caught it by reflex not thinking he grabbed what was left of the shirt across his shoulders and pulled it over his head exposing every inch of his chest his shoulders he strained his arms upward making the muscles mold against his skin from stomach to shoulder it didnt just make me catch my breath it made me catch and hold forgetting to breathe for a few seconds so that when i did remember my breath came out in a shaky gasp so much for being cool and sophisticated he lowered his arms and all that was left were the sleeves he pulled them off like a stripper removing long gloves and let the bits of silk fall to the ground he stood looking at me nude from the waist up am i supposed to applaud or say my my mr zeeman what big shoulders you have im aware that you have a great body richard you dont have to rub my face in it he moved into me until he was standing so close that a hard thought would have made us touch what a good idea he said i frowned at him because i wasnt following whats a good idea rubbing your face in my body he said his voice so low that it was almost a whisper i blushed and hoped he couldnt see it in the dark its an expression richard you know i didnt mean it i know he said but its still a good idea i stepped back go away richard you dont know the way to the lupanar he said ill find it on my own thanks anyway he started to reach out to touch my face and i almost stumbled backing up he flashed me a quick smile and was gone running through the trees i could feel the roil of power like wind in a sail he rode the energy of the woods the night the moon overhead and if i wanted to i could go along for the ride i stood there hugging my arms concentrating everything i had on blocking him out cutting the power between us when i felt alone and locked within my own skin again i opened my eyes jason was standing so close it made me jump it also made me realize how careless id been damn jason you scared me sorry i thought someone should stay behind and make sure no vampires made off with you thanks i mean that you all right he asked i shook my head im fine he grinned and there was almost enough moonlight to see the laughter in his eyes hes getting better at it jason said getting better at what i asked being ulfric seducing you jason said i stared at him you know how i was jealous of the way you looked at asher i nodded the way you look at richard he just shook his head its something i took a deep breath and let it out slowly it doesnt matter it matters he said it doesnt make you happy but it matters and to that there wasnt a damn thing i could say we started walking through the woods in the general direction everyone else had been going we didnt need no stinking directions we found the lupanar and we didnt need directions we had jasons nose and my ability to sense the dead id assumed that all lupanars were the same but yards away from this one i knew i was wrong whatever lay up ahead had death mixed in with it old death it felt almost like a restless grave sometimes youd be out in the woods and find one an old grave where someone was buried without rites just a shallow hole in the ground the dead dont much care for shallow holes it needs to be deep and wide or they get restless cremation takes care of all of it actually id never met a ghost of someone who had been cremated we could see the soft shine of lanterns through the trees when jason stopped touching my arm for attention i dont like what im smelling he said what do you mean i asked a body aboveground for a long time a zombie i made it a question he shook his head no drier older than that we both looked at each other i was pretty sure we were both thinking the same thing rotting vampire i realized that i was clutching his arm and he was clutching mine we stood in the dark like children wondering if that noise was really a monster or if it was the wind neither of us took that next step to find out if wed had covers wed have been under them if wed gone in there just to kill them id have been all right a slashandburn operation was my style lately every time we approached the vamps on their own territory by their own rules we got hurt i realized suddenly how much i did not want to walk into that place and negotiate with the monsters i wanted to press a gun under colins chin and pull the trigger i wanted done with it i did not want to walk in there and give him power over me through some ancient rules of hospitality among the terminally anemic damian came gliding through the trees he was dressed in the standard uniform of black leather pants so tight you knew that nothing else was under them but vampire but he was wearing a black silk tshirt with a scooped neck it looked almost like a womans shirt his shoulderlength hair helped the illusion of feminity but the chest and shoulders that peeked out of the shirt ruined the effect masculine definitely masculine jason was wearing an almost identical outfit except the shirt and pants were satin though the kneehigh boots were identical for the first time i realized that jason was broader through the shoulders than damian had that just happened recently i looked from the werewolf to the vampire and shook my head they grow up so fast what i said out loud was you guys look like backup singers for a gothic band everyones waiting for you damian said i realized that i still didnt want to go i felt jason shake his head no he said youre afraid damian said jason nodded i frowned jason and i were both usually braver than this no matter what nasty things were in the next room or the next clearing as the case may be whats up damian whats happening i told you what colin was you called him a night hag he can feed off fear was that supposed to be a clue i asked he can also cause fear in others damian said i took a deep breath and forced myself to relax my hold on jasons arm he kept his death grip that makes sense i said they can always guarantee a meal that way right damian nodded but he also enjoys it fear is like a drug to a night hag my old master said it was better than blood because she could walk through a world of fear if she desired it she could move through a world that trembled ever so slightly at her passing and thats what colin is doing tonight i said jason dropped his hand from my arm he stayed close enough that our arms brushed but we werent huddling in the dark like rabbits i can usually tell when a vamp is doing mind stuff on me hes good this is different from the other masterlevel powers anita my first master said it was like breathing to a human something you did without thinking about it she could intensify it but she could never really stop it a low level dread surrounded her at all times was she scary in bed jason asked i think he meant it as a joke the look on damians face even by moonlight wasnt funny yes he said yes she was he looked at me and there was an intensity in his face that i didnt like he actually reached out to me then let his hand drop he finally said some of the masters can feed off of other things not just fear what else i asked asher breathed through my mind and he must have done the same to damian because we both jumped his voice came like a whisper in a nearby room almost as if it was sound without words hurry there was no more talk we hurried the lantern light shone through the trees like small yellow moons damian glided through that last line of trees into the clearing i didnt glide i stumbled over the outer edge of the clearing there was a power circle in this land so old and walked so often that it was like a curtain waiting to be drawn around the lupanar it would take almost no power to bring whatever was here alive when i quit seeing with that inner vision and looked out into the clearing i stopped walking i just stood and stared jason stood and stared with me between the two of us we were getting pretty jaded but the lupanar of the oak tree clan was worth a stare or two it was a huge clearing with an oak tree in the center of it but that was like saying the empire state building is tall the tree was like some great spreading giant a hundred feet tall rising up and up there was a body hanging from one of the lower branches it was mostly skeleton with dried bits of tendon holding one arm out the other arm had disintegrated falling to the ground there were bones everywhere under the tree white bones yellowed bones bones so old they were grey from being weathered a carpet of bones stretched out from beneath the tree filling the clearing the wind picked up hurrying through the forest it sent the leaves on the oak rustling and whispering the rope on the skeleton creaked as it swung in the wind and with that one creak my eyes went back to the tree because there were dozens of creaking ropes most of them were empty now broken or eaten to ragged ends but those ropes creaked and moved with the wind up and up i followed the ropes up to the top of the tree as far as i could look in the dark by moonlight the tree had to be over a hundred years old and there were ragged bits of rope at its top theyd been hanging bodies on this tree for a very long time the skeleton rotated suddenly in the growing wind jaw gaping empty sockets reflecting the lantern light for a second the tendons at the jaw gave way and the jaw hung swinging on one side like a broken hinge i had a horrible urge to run across that boneyard and yank the jaw away or reattach it anything so that bit of bone would stop waggling in the wind my god jason whispered all i could do was nod i wasnt rendered speechless often but i had no words for this damian had stopped and moved back to stand by us he seemed to be waiting as if he were our escort i finally tore my gaze away from the tree and its awful burden there were benches forming three sides of a disconnected triangle there was enough room between each bench that no one was unduly crowded yet the clearing felt crowded almost as if the air itself was thick with things unseen hurrying to and fro brushing past me in a rush of gooseflesh did you feel that i asked jason looked at me feel what i guess not that meant whatever was crowding so close in the air wasnt something that a shapeshifter would pick up on so what was it there was a vampire staring at me from where he sat on the near bench his hair was brown cut short so his neck was pale and bare his eyes seemed very dark maybe brown maybe black he smiled and i felt his power rush over me he was trying to capture me with his eyes usually i would have tried to stare him down but i didnt like what i was feeling in this place power and it wasnt vampires i looked away from his eyes studying the pale curve of his cheek his lips were full with an upper lip that was set in a perfect bow very feminine the rest of the face was all points and angles the chin sharp the nose too long it was a face that would be homely except for that mouth and those longlashed eyes dark and drowning deep as black mirrors i didnt stare too long at those eyes i was feeling unsteady as if the ground under my feet wasnt quite solid richard should have told me about the lupanar someone should have prepared me later id be angry that no one had now i was just trying to figure out what to do about it if vernes clan were practicing human sacrifice then it had to be stopped damian moved in front of me blocking my view of the ethers whats wrong anita i looked at him the only thing that kept me from losing it right then in front of the other vampires was richard hed have never tolerated human sacrifice oh he might have come down here once then never returned and not called the police but he would never have returned year after year he simply wouldnt have approved maybe this was the way vernes clan treated its dead if it was anything else id call in the state cops but not tonight not unless they dragged out a screaming victim if they did that then all bets were off i shook my head what could possibly be wrong i said i walked into the clearing going for our own little group it looked as if all three groups had the same amount of people that was pretty typical of a meet between preternatural groups you always negotiated your entourage richard stood and came to meet me i took his hand when he offered it but strangely right at that moment i didnt care if he was wearing his shirt or not i was angry at him angry at him for not preparing me for this place maybe he thought that nothing shocked me anymore or maybe oh hell i didnt know but hed screwed up again so i let him hold my hand and the touch of his flesh meant nothing i was too confused and working too hard on holding my temper to be seduced right then take the jacket off child lets get a look at what youve got a voice said i turned slowly to look at the owner of that voice the vampire had hair that i would have called golden if i hadnt had ashers hair to compare it to the hair was cut short all over his eyes could have been blue or grey in the uncertain light the face had frozen before hed ever hit twenty still young enough that his face was thin and smooth as if hed died before hed been able to grow a decent beard he had the face of a child on a tall gangly frame as if hed been awkward in life he wasnt awkward as he stood he came to his feet in a movement so smooth it looked like dancing he stood and the blackeyed vamp stood with him coming to his side in a motion of long practice like they were two parts of a whole there was one human woman among the eight of them she looked like pure native american with waistlength hair that was as true black as my own hers was straight and thick her skin was a dark brown face almost square with large brown eyes that had lashes so thick that even from a distance they were noticeable if she wore any makeup i couldnt tell she was one of those women that is striking rather than beautiful too strong featured for conventional prettiness but you wouldnt forget the face once you saw it come on girl strip off that young face said weve seen most everything everybody else has i will be mighty disappointed if i dont get to see your goodies too the womans face remained marvelously blank but there was a tightness to those strong shoulders a slight turn to that long line of neck she didnt seem to be enjoying the show richards hand tightened around mine i thought at first he was trying to warn me not to get mad but one glance at his face and it was the other way around he was getting pissed the night would go downhill pretty damn fast if i was supposed to be the calm one are you always this offensive or am i getting a special treat i asked he laughed but it was just a laugh ordinary human he couldnt do the voice tricks that jeanclaude and even asher could do of course colin had other talents id seen those other talents carved in nathaniels chest asher stood hed started the evening wearing satin a pale icy blue only two shades darker than his whiteblue eyes the jacket had darker blue embroidery at the sleeves and lapels it fastened with one of those cloth loops over a large silkcovered button the pants matched the jacket perfectly hed tried the jacket on with no shirt his chest had been very visible the scars had seemed harsher against the soft blue cloth hed stared at himself in the rooms only mirror for a long time hed finally put a white silk shirt on under the jacket now that white shirt was in tatters it looked like gigantic claws had ripped at it his chest showed very plainly through the ruined cloth there was no blood id only seen three vampires that could cause harm from a distance one of them had been a member of their council but none of them had had the delicacy of control to shred cloth so close to flesh and not draw blood we were deep into the pissing contest so far colin was winning i looked at shangda and jamil standing just behind the bench they looked untouched unharmed some bodyguards i said were not here to guard vampires shangda said i looked at jamil he shrugged great just great zane was standing even farther behind the wolves he didnt look any worse for wear either but he also looked lost like the lone teetotaler at a wine tasting was i supposed to stop him he asked i shook my head no zane not you i spared a glance at richard wondering why hed just let everyone stand around asher i understood asking for help was a sign of weakness remove the jacket or ill remove it for you colin said colin youve made your point the womans voice was surprisingly deep a rich smoky alto colin patted her hand smiled but his words werent gentle i will tell you when my point has been made nikki he moved away from her then dismissed her and the pain of that dismissal showed for a moment anger flared in those dark eyes and i felt her power her power not his she was a witch or a psychic or something i had no word for human in the same way i was human barely the anger vanished behind that dark stoic face but i knew what id seen she didnt love him nor he her but she was his human servant bound for all eternity for better or worse you want to see whats under the jacket i said come over here and help me out of it itd be the gentlemanly thing to do anita richard said i patted his arm its okay richard chill the look on his face was enough he didnt trust me to behave funny in our own ways neither of us trusted the other i looked at asher we shared no marks we couldnt read each others thoughts but we didnt need to we were getting our butts kicked because the werewolves werent helping us i looked over at the eight werewolves that were local verne sat on the bench with his wolves poised around him two of them were in full wolf form except they were the size of ponies bigger than any normal grey wolf verne was still in his tshirt and jeans no one had dressed up but us even the other vampires were just in suits and dresses id never seen this many vampires dressed so ordinarily most of them had a sense of style or at least theater they put on a good show of course in the presence of the bonedraped tree who needed a better show of course the lupanar was supposed to be our showplace not colins again i wondered if we could trust verne as far as richard thought we could i walked a little into the center of the triangle made by the three benches i waited for colin to join me he just stood there next to the blackeyed vamp smiling now why would i waste the energy to walk even a few yards when i can undress you from here i smiled and i made it mocking scared to get too close i admit you are a delicate little thing but appearances are often deceiving i have used this youthful face of mine more than once to fool the unwary i am not the unwary anita blake he extended a pale hand and i felt the power thrill over my skin before it slashed through the front of the velvet top the cross spilled out of the velvet like a captive star set free the cross flared white and i was careful to look sideways from it it burned like magnesium so bright it was almost painful crosses glow around vamps but they dont glow like small supernovas unless you are in serious trouble id never had one glow like this when i wasnt afraid yet id always assumed the cross reacted to my level of fear like a holy mood ring tonight for the first time i realized that it may have been my faith that enabled it to glow but once the faith was in place something else took over not my will but thine colins vampires reacted just as they were supposed to they cowered throwing their arms or their jackets or in one case a skirt in front of their eyes hiding from the light except for colin and the blackeyed vamp why was i not surprised that those two were old enough and powerful enough to face the cross they werent happy about it they were protecting their eyes squinting against the light but they werent cowering slash me again fangboy see what else falls out he did what i asked i really hadnt thought hed try he slashed at me through the air but the power fell away like water parting around a rock if you want to hurt me colin youre going to have to get up close and personal i could have nikki rip it from your throat i thought you were hot shit colin or is that just when you have young men tied up and helpless is that what you need to feel like a big bad vampire someone tied up and helpless or is it young men that does it for you colin said one word barnaby the blackeyed vampire moved in front of colin closer to the cross but he stopped unable to come closer then over the glow of the cross i watched barnabys face begin to rot that smooth flesh sloughed away sliding in wet gobbets of flesh down his face until tendons glistened wetly and bone showed as his nose collapsed showing his face like a skull covered by rotted things he limped towards me one hand held out and it reminded me of damians hands earlier in the night the flesh bursting in a stinking wave of blackness except there was no smell the last vamp id seen who could rot at will had also been able to control the smell like a magical deodorant if it had been a fight id have drawn a gun and blown him away before he took the cross but this was a contest of wills more than anything if he was vampire enough to touch my cross then i had to be brave enough to let him do it i hoped he didnt press it between our bodies id had one vampire do that and a second degree burn on my breast wasnt my idea of fun the cross burned brighter and brighter as he came for me i had to turn my head away from the light it was so bright it hurt me to look at it i knew it hurt the vampire more i felt that rotted hand slide across my chest leaving something wet and semisolid to slide between my breasts he grabbed the chain and not the cross smart vampire he jerked the chain and it broke the cross swung into his arm and the silver burned with a flame as white and pure as the light had been the vampire screamed and threw the cross which spun in a glittering arc like a tiny comet until it was swallowed by the dark as my eyes adjusted to the dim lantern light once more i said dont worry about it barnaby ive got extras hed fallen to his knees cradling his arm he was still a walking rotted nightmare but the flesh of his hand had blackened but not everyone has your faith colin said again just like in the forest i didnt feel his vampire powers reach out but i was suddenly afraid now that i knew what it was it wasnt as bad but it was different from any other ability id ever sensed quieter somehow and more frightening because of it barnaby the young blond werewolf is very afraid of you hes tasted your kind before barnaby got to his feet and tried to move around me i stepped in front of him jason is under my protection barnaby wont hurt him just play with him a little i shook my head i gave jason my word that i wouldnt let the vampire that did nathaniel touch him your word colin said youre a modern american your word means nothing my word means something to me i said i dont give it lightly i can taste the truth of your words but i say that barnaby shall play with your young friend and you cannot stop him without breaking truce whoever breaks truce first will have the council to answer to i kept moving with barnaby so that he was slowly backing me up but i kept getting in his way colin you can feel fear so im told you can feel how very afraid he is of your friend here oh yes i will feast tonight you could break his mind i said someone touched my back and i jumped it was asher id been backed up all the way to the bench richard and his bodyguards had moved around jason they might not protect asher but they would protect jason barnaby moved to one side trying to get around me i was forced to jump on and over the bench to put myself in his way again i put my left hand against that decaying chest the right was on the butt of the browning i made sure he saw it colin spoke though barnabys body should have blocked his view it was almost as if he could see through the other vampires eyes if you shoot one of my vampires then you will have broken truce you sent nathaniel back to us dying asher said it was a compliment of sorts that you truly thought we could cure him and you did didnt you colin said yeah i said well let me pay you the same compliment i think if i shoot barnaby pointblank hell survive it ive shot rotting vamps before and their clothes took more damage than they did you can taste the truth in her words asher said she believes hell live which means it is not a breach of truce she believes it but she hopes for his death colin said breaking the mind of one of our entourage asher said will break the truce as well i do not agree colin said then weve got a stalemate i said i think not colin said he turned to verne verne earn your keep strip the young one of his protectors verne stood and his wolves flowed around him they moved into the clearing on a roil of energy that made the nape of my neck dance and my hand go for a gun richard said verne but verne wasnt looking at richard he was looking at me he was carrying a small covered basket in his hands i didnt wait to find out what he had in the basket i pointed the gun at his chest ease down girl verne said its a present i kept the gun nice and steady on the center of his body yeah right when you see what it is youll know that we arent on his side dont pick the wrong side puppy dog colin said or i will make you very very sorry verne looked at the vampire i watched his eyes bleed from human to wolf while he held that basket out to me but he kept those angry frightening eyes on colin you have no animal to call verne said in a voice gone rough and growling low you dare to stand in our place of power and threaten us you are less than the wind outside our cave you are nothing here she is not one of you either colin said she is lupa of the thronnus roke clan she is human she stands between you and a werewolf thats lupa enough for me barnaby had backed off i dont know if he thought id jump the gun and shoot him or if colin had whispered a new plan in his rotting skull i wasnt sure i even cared there was a glob of something heavy and wet sliding down into the bra it was like feeling a tear slide down your cheek but worse so much worse id resisted the urge to wipe it away with barnaby staring me down as soon as he crept back to colin i used my left hand to scoop the leftover part out and fling it on the ground whats the matter anita too up close and personal for you i wiped my hand on the leather skirt and smiled fuck you colin verne stepped into the center of the triangle alone his wolves stayed huddled in front of the far bench he came to stand a couple of yards in front of our bench with that basket in his hands i glanced at asher he shrugged richard nodded like i was supposed to go meet him a present verne had called it i went to meet him he knelt setting the basket on the ground between us he stayed kneeling i knelt too because he seemed to expect it he just kept looking at me with those wolfish eyes he still looked like an aging hells angel but those eyes i wondered if i would ever get used to seeing wolf eyes in a human face probably not i raised the hinged lid of the small basket a face a head looked up at me i scrambled to my feet the browning just appeared in my hand i pointed it at verne then the ground then pressed the flat of the barrel to my forehead i found my voice finally what is that you said you wanted miras head in a basket that if we gave you that it would make it right between our two clans i took a sharp breath and blew it out i looked down into the basket still standing still holding the gun like the comfort object it was the mouth was open in a soundless scream the eyes half closed as if theyd caught her napping but i knew they hadnt someone had simply closed the eyes after they took her head even dead like this the bones of the face were delicate and you knew at least the face had been pretty i forced myself to put up the gun it couldnt help me now i dropped back to my knees staring at it i finally looked up at verne i was shaking my head over and over i looked into his face and tried to read something in it that i could yell at or talk to but the expression was alien and it wasnt just the eyes youd think after all this time i would stop forgetting that they werent human but i had id been pissed and id spoken as if i was talking to another human being but i hadnt been id been speaking to werewolves and id forgotten that i heard someone whispering and it was me i was whispering this is my fault this is my fault i started to put my left hand in front of my face and i caught a whiff of barnabys rotted flesh it was enough i crawled to one side and vomited i knelt on all fours waiting for it to pass when i could speak i said dont any of you people understand the term its just a fucking expression richard was there kneeling by me he touched my back gently you told him what you wanted anita she had betrayed the packs honor it can carry a death penalty all you helped them choose was the method of execution i glanced sideways at him i had a horrible urge to cry i didnt mean it i whispered he nodded i know there was a look in his eyes of such sorrow of a shared knowledge of how many times you never really meant what you said but the monsters were listening and they always took you at your word i thought you were tough miss blake richard helped me stand and i let him i leaned against him for a second my forehead against the smooth skin of his arm i pushed away from him and stood on my own i met colins eyes they were definitely grey not blue i know were supposed to go through all the protocol and waltz for a while colin but the last of my patience is sitting in that basket so state your grievance and lets all get the fuck out of here he smiled so tenderhearted maybe your reputation is just talk after all i smiled then and shook my head maybe it is but since were not supposed to kill each other tonight colin it doesnt matter colin walked away from me he went to stand closer to his own people but faced asher i had been dismissed as his own human servant had been dismissed i will not be replaced asher i have not come to replace you asher said voice empty neutral why would jeanclaude send a master almost exactly my age into my lands against my express orders i could have hidden what i was asher said but jeanclaude thought you would misinterpret that i came in hiding nothing but still you came colin said i cannot change what has happened asher said what would satisfy us all your death colin said everybody went very still as if wed all caught our collective breaths i started to say something and richard touched my shoulder i closed my mouth and let asher talk but it was hard asher laughed that wonderful touchable laugh breaking the truce arent you colin not if i kill a rival sent to supplant me then i am merely protecting myself and making an example for other ambitious vampires you know i have not come to supplant you asher said i know nothing of the kind i am content where i am why colin asked you could be the master of a city somewhere far from their triumvirate why would you be content with less asher gave a very small smile i prefer gentler persuasions over power colin shook his head i have been told you are in love with her and with jeanclaude himself i have been told that you are bedding them both and that is why the ulfric seeks a new lupa if he would only cooperate it could be a happy foursome asher said richard startled beside me stiffened it was my turn to touch his arm and keep him from saying what he was thinking i have been told many things colin said my people have watched you from afar we believe you are enamored of the girl and of jeanclaude we are aware of your history together we even believe that a lover of men like yourself would do their ulfric if he would let you what we do not believe is that you are bedding any of them we believe that this is a pathetic story to save yourself i started walking to asher the plan was that we would put on a mild show of petting id warned him it better be mild but i never got the chance there was movement in the dark dozens of vampires appeared out of the darkness encircling the clearing colin had been distracting us while the vampires moved up to flank us and neither asher nor i nor any of the wereanimals had sensed them let us have asher and the rest of you may go free you are breaking the truce now asher said he sounded calm empty as if colin hadnt just demanded his death verne strode forward this is our lupanar we can close it to all strangers not without your vargamor you left her safe at home just in case things went wrong so protective of your human pet i counted on it he raised an arm as if summoning his people no one you have with you is witch enough to invoke the circle if you kill asher it will break truce i will not harm jeanclaudes triumvirate i merely remove a rival the vampires moved up through the trees they didnt hurry they moved like solid shadows slow as if they had all night to tighten the circle and take us asher i asked without taking my gaze from those slowly menacing figures oui does this break truce oui great i said i felt him move towards me but i had eyes only for the outer dark and that evershrinking circle i picked one vampire out male slender youngish in appearance he wore no shirt his chest was a pale almost glowing whiteness in the darkness what is it ma cherie asher was standing very close to me now i moved him to one side with my left arm and brought the miniuzi out with my right swinging it around my body shooting before id actually pointed so the bullets cut across the vampires legs making him jerk i grabbed it with both hands and fought the gun to spray it back and fourth across his body i was screaming as i did it wordless not to sound menacing you couldnt hear the screams over the machine gun i screamed because i couldnt help myself because the tension the horror something came up my hand from the gun and out my mouth the blood that sprayed from his body was black from distance and night it looked like his body was torn in half by some giant hand his upper body fell slowly to one side his lower body collapsed to its knees the circle of vampires had frozen or had dived for cover the silence was thunderous my own labored breathing seemed painfully loud my voice came breathy but clear a shout nobody move nobody fucking move no one moved ashers voice broke the stillness we can all walk away from here tonight colin impressively violent colin said but i think you are mistaken poor archie will not be walking anywhere my apologies to archie i said i must have payment for him miss blake you can bill me oh i intend to miss blake i intend to take it out of your hide how many of your people do you want me to kill tonight colin ive got lots more bullets you cannot kill them all miss blake yeah but i can kill about a half dozen and wound twice that many i dont see them lining up for it colin i badly wanted to see his face but i kept my attention on the vamps in the trees they hadnt moved the vampires already inside the lupanar were someone elses problem my job was keeping the others at a distance i think asher knew the division of labor i just hoped richard did i dont know how jeanclaude runs his territory but i know how i run mine what you fail to appreciate miss blake is that nothing you can do to them will make them fear you more than they already fear me death is the ultimate threat colin and i dont bluff neither do i i felt something move out through the trees power moving from colin to those waiting figures i started to turn the gun from the darkness to colin but asher touched my arm he is mine watch the others i slid the gun a fraction back to the still forms you get the master of the city and i get all the rest sounds fair richard moved up beside me you dont get all of them he said i wanted to ask if he would kill them if he would use that preternatural strength to snap spines and tear their bodies apart with his bare hands as i had done with the machine gun but i didnt ask how good richards threat was was between him and his conscience the only thing that bothered me about richards conscience was that i couldnt count on him for a single kill tonight hed hurt people and toss them around but if he wouldnt kill that meant that he couldnt account for any of them there were over a hundred bad guys vampires and only eight of us sixteen if i could count verne but i didnt know if i could count on him and his people it would have been nice to be able to trust richard at my back but i didnt the vampires out in the dark began to rot not all of them but damn near half id never seen so many for a vampire to rot it means that the vamp that made them was the same kind of creature which meant that barnaby had made half of colins people no master of the city would allow any subordinate to have such power but the proof was staring me in the face with eye sockets gone to black dripping ruin you have been very bold colin to share your power with your second to this degree asher said barnaby is my right hand my second eye together we are a stronger master than either of us would be apart as are jeanclaude and i asher said but barnaby is a corruptor he brings that to the dance colin said what do you bring to jeanclaudes dance asher fear breathed through the lupanar i shivered as it prickled down my skin tightened my chest and tried to stop my breath in my throat night hag damian spoke his voice a hiss he spit on the ground in the general direction of colin but he didnt walk any closer i smell your fear damian i can taste it like rich nutty ale on the back of my tongue colin said your master must have been a fine piece of work damian moved back a step then stopped you ask why asher is content to remain with jeanclaude when he could go elsewhere and be his own master maybe he is tired as i am tired of the struggle the infighting the fucking politics jeanclaude ransomed me from my master i am not a master vampire nor will i ever be i have no special powers yet jeanclaude bargained for me i serve him not out of fear but out of gratitude you make jeanclaude sound weak the council does not fear weaklings yet they fear him colin said compassion is not weakness richard said only those without compassion think otherwise i glanced at him but he was looking at the vampires not me the fact that i felt it was a personal remark to me was just me being overly sensitive compassion colin shook his head he threw back his head and laughed it was sort of unnerving i kept my attention on the outer darkness and the waiting vamps but it was hard not to watch the laughing vampire hard not to ask what was so funny compassion colin said again now that is not a word i would have used for jeanclaude has he fallen in love with his human servant i do not think love is the path to jeanclaudes heart is it sex he raised his voice and called to me is that it miss blake has the seducer finally been seduced are you that good a piece of ass miss blake that made my shoulders hunch but i kept my eye on the other vampires the machine gun held in both hands a lady doesnt kiss and tell colin that made him laugh again jeanclaude would never forgive me if i killed the best piece of ass hes found in centuries i say again give me asher and the blond wolf ashers life and the wolfs fear at barnabys hands that is the price for safe passage through my lands it was my turn to laugh a soft harsh sound fuck you i take it that is a no he said no i said i watched the vampires out in the dark they hadnt moved but somehow there was a sense of movement an increased energy it was nothing i could start shooting about but i didnt like it does miss blake speak for all of you colin asked you cant have jason to torture richard said i would not willingly give up my life asher said the human servant speaking for all how very strange but if the answer is no then the answer is no asher yelled anita i started to rotate the gun back towards them but something slashed down my face over one eye it made me hesitate one hand going over my eye holding it i had time to think stupid and start to lower my hand start to raise the gun back up and a vampire slammed into me taking us both to the ground i was flat on my back with a woman on top of me mouth wide fangs snapping at my face like a dog i pulled the trigger with the muzzle pressed to her body the bullets exploded out her back in a rain of blood and thicker bits her body danced on top of mine twitching jerking i had to push her body off of me and when i could sit up it was too late the vampires were inside the lupanar and the fighting was joined i couldnt see out of my right eye it was too full of blood and more kept pouring down a figure appeared in front of me and i fired up the length of its body until the bullets exploded its head in a burst of splattering rain i closed my right eye and did my best to ignore it nursing the wound was going to get me killed i looked around for the others verne tore the head off a vampire and sent it spinning into the dark richard was at the center of a mob almost lost to sight with bodies hanging off him asher was covered in blood facing colin there were werewolves everywhere in wolf or manwolf form two vamps came for me and sightseeing was over one of them was rotting down to bones the other was solid i shot the solid one first because he i was sure i could kill rotting vamps dont also die from bullets the solid one fell to his knees in a spray of blood face split in half like a ripe melon the rotting vamp jumped me in a blur of speed and we went tumbling across the ground as i tried to bring the gun up the mouth stretched above my face naked tendons straining between the bones of his cheeks fangs came for my face i fired into the body but the gun was at a bad angle and missed anything vital all i got for my troubles was the scream of a wolf and i knew that id shot someone that was on our side shit i turned my head and the fangs sank through the leather jacket into my shoulder i screamed my hand fumbling for the jacket pocket and my backup cross a rotted hand caressed my face sliding over the wound above my eye the leather jacket acted as a sort of armor keeping the fangs from getting a good lock on my shoulder the mouth worried at my shoulder like a dog with a bone trying to dig through the thick leather into the flesh beyond it hurt but not as much as it was going to hurt if i didnt do something the cross flared to life like a captive star but the vamp had its face buried in the leather it couldnt see the cross i swung the cross by the chain into its bare skull smoke rose from the bone and the vampire jerked its face back from me naked teeth opened in a scream i shoved the cross in its face and those teeth snapped at it like a dog telling you to stay away but those teeth caught the chain and bit through it there was a moment where even without most of the flesh left on the skull i could see surprise on its face i flung my arms across my face and heard the dull explosion the spatter of debris there was a sharp pain in my hand and when i could look i had a bone shard in my left hand i pulled the shard out and only then did i bleed the vampire was just so much mess scattered around me the cross lay on the ground still glowing smoke rising off its surface as if the metal had been freshly made and quenched in the blood of the vampire i started to pick it up by the chain and nikki colins human servant was standing over me i caught the dull flash of her knife and rolled away coming to one knee with the browning in one hand she was right above me waiting for an underhand strike but i wasnt standing and she didnt have time to change her strike i started to pull the trigger and a werewolf barreled into her took them both off into the dark shit what was i supposed to do yell mine like in a volleyball game i heard jason yelling he was standing only about a yard away with both arms stuck through the chest of a rotting vampire he was pulling desperately on his arms but they seemed trapped caught on the ribs the vampire didnt seem to mind it licked his face and he screamed another rotter was on his back riding him head back for a strike i sighted down my arm at the head and fired the head jerked back and brains spilled out a hole on the other side in a dark gush but the vampire turned its head slowly and looked at me i fired into that calm face three more times in a tight cluster before the head collapsed in upon itself like an empty eggshell the vampire fell away from jason i walked towards jason and the other vampire now it was the vampire who was struggling to get free of jason but they were entwined like bumpers after a car wreck i put the gun barrel under the vampires chin my other hand over jasons eyes to protect them and fired it took three shots for the brain to be destroyed and the body to go limp i moved my hand from jasons eyes and he looked past me eyes widening i was already turning before he could yell behind you the blow came before id finished the turn my shoulder and arm went numb my hand opened and the browning slipped out while i was still trying to see what had hit me i dived for the ground rolling on my good shoulder and came up to my knee to see nikki holding a very big stick i was lucky shed lost the knife somewhere i started to draw the big knife down my back but i was using my left hand because my right still wasnt working lefthanded i was slower and nikki was unbelievably fast she moved in a blur of motion that was beyond human she was on me slashing the air with the club and i gave up trying to draw a knife and worked just at not being hit the attack was so quick so savage that i didnt have time to stand all i could do was roll on the ground barely ahead of each blow the jagged end of the branch sank into the ground next to my face she struggled for a second to free it and i kicked her in the knee it made her stagger but didnt dislocate it or shed have screamed it did force her back from the club i rolled away trying to get to my feet she grabbed me and lifted me over her head like she was benchpressing me the next thing i knew i was airborne i hit the ground just short of the oak falling into the bones beneath the tree hard enough that some of them shattered the jolt of power that ran through me from hands to knees drove what air i had left from my body i lay there halfstunned not just from being thrown across the clearing but from the power roaring across my body from the bones it was death magic and though different from mine it recognized me recognized my power i knew as i lay in the bones that i could bring the circle to life but what would happen when the wards flared to life this pack worshipped odin if i set the circle of power would it count as a holy place would it suddenly be like standing inside a church it had possibilities if i could warn asher and damian i got painfully to my knees and found that we were losing everywhere i looked our people were buried under piles of vampires asher and damain were still standing free but both were bleeding and colin and barnaby were pressing the attack richard was completely lost to sight except for one arm gone long with claws verne was standing with another werewolf in human form it was a woman shorter than i was with short dark hair that touched her shoulders dressed in a thighlong tshirt and pants she looked small beside verne but she was the only one of his people still standing the others were dead or dying on the ground my right hand was working again just stunned not dislocated lucky me i drew a knife from one of the wrist sheaths it wasnt a blade consecrated to ritual but it would have to do i wanted to whisper to asher and damian for them to fly but it was too far away to whisper and i didnt know how to talk directly to either of their minds i did the only thing i could think of i yelled i yelled asher damian they turned startled faces to me i raised the knife so they could see it and screamed fly damn it fly nikki was almost to the bone circle i screamed fly asher grabbed damians wrist and i had to turn away before i could see them safe i had moments to try and make this work nikki had a power similar to mine if she figured out what i was trying to do shed stop me if she could i pressed my hands to the tree trunk and the power breathed through me it was magic that had been built with death and that was my speciality the moment i touched the tree i knew that it wasnt human sacrifice but that this was where their munin gathered the spirits of their dead were here in the bones the tree the ground they filled the air with a whispering tittering noise that only i could hear the lukoi consume their dead at least part of them and the eating of their flesh puts them into some sort of ancestral memory munin they call them after odins raven memory they arent ghosts but they are the spirits of the dead and i was a necromancer the munin liked me they eased around me like a cool caress of wind entwining like phantom cats i could channel the munin sort of like a medium at a seance but more and worse the only munin id ever channeled had been raina the wicked bitch of the east but when she came it was like a battering ram standing there in the middle of hundreds thousands of munin i knew i could open to them but it would be like opening a door an invitation i could wallow in the past live other lives it was a whisper of seduction raina came like a rapist an overwhelming force not a sharing but a taking however theyd tied their munin to this place it was blood magic death magic i cut the palm of my hand and pressed it to the tree i prayed and sprinkled blood on the bones at my feet the circle of power snapped into place with a rush that raised my skin as if it would crawl off my flesh i invoked the circle i called the wards i worshipped and it was enough shrieks screams filled the night the vampires went up in flames they ran burning for the edge of the ward and all who made it across exploded in a rain of burning bits and pieces i felt damian above me and asher none of the vampires left behind tried to do anything but run most fell into burning heaps on the ground without taking another step anyone under a hundred died where they stood the indian woman had come to stand on the edge of the bone circle she stared at me while the vampires screamed and died and the stink of burning flesh and hair was thick enough to choke her face showed nothing shed rescued the club finally she said i should kill you i nodded yes you should but your allies are dead and your master has flown away id get out while the gettings good if i were you she nodded and threw the club to the ground colin and barnaby live and we will see you again anita i look forward to it i said i was hoping that she wouldnt notice that my back was pressed against the tree because i wasnt sure i could stand on my own nikki nodded and started to walk away into the dark past the tree and the bones she spoke something then stepped through the ward when she stepped through the magic quenched swallowed back into the earth she looked at me from the dark on the other side of the quieted circle we stared at each other for a long moment and i knew that if we met again she would kill me if she could she was colins human servant it was her job i slid down the tree until i was sitting in the bones my legs were too weak to hold me and a fine trembling had started in my hands i gazed out into the lupanar gazed out over my handiwork some of the bodies still burned but no vampire moved within the circle the vampires were dead all of them another fight another shower rotting vampire was not an odor you wanted to wear to bed my hair was still damp when i called jeanclaude to fill him in on what wed done okay on what id done i told him the shortest version possible his response you did what i repeated it silence on the other end of the phone i couldnt even hear him breathe jeanclaude you still there i am here ma petite he sighed you have surprised me once again i did not see this coming you dont sound happy i said you know the news could be worse we could all be dead i did not think colin would be so foolish live and learn i said colin was right to fear you ma petite i told colin what would happen if he messed with us he pushed the button not me who are you trying to convince ma petite me or yourself i thought about that for a moment i dont know are you admitting you were wrong his voice held mild amusement no i tried to think how to say it finally i said we were losing jeanclaude they were going to kill us i had to do something i wasnt even sure it would work i held the phone and wished that he were here to hold me i hated the thought that i wanted him like that that i wanted anyone like that i hated needing people they all had a tendency to die on me but id have given a great deal for a pair of comforting arms right at that moment ma petite ma petite what is wrong i motioned asher over to the phone talk to your second banana ask asher if there were other options if there were other options i couldnt see them there is something in your voice ma petite something fragile he whispered the last word i just nodded and handed the phone to asher i walked away from it hugging myself tight fragile he said scared more like id scared myself tonight something in the power i released had extinguished the torches around the lupanar those of us still standing had moved by the light of burning corpses it had been a scene right out of dantes inferno and i had done it the power inside of me had done this thing yeah scared about covered it damian came up to me he whispered jasons crying in the shower i sighed great just what i needed another crisis but i didnt ask questions i just knocked on the door of the bathroom jason you all right he didnt answer me jason im all right anita his voice even over the shower sounded strained id never really heard him cry before but thats what it sounded like a voice thick with tears i pressed the top of my head to the door and sighed i did not need this tonight but jason was my friend and who else was i going to send in to comfort him damian had come to me with it zane didnt seem the handholding type and cherry well if i was going to send another woman into comfort him it seemed cowardly asher naw i knocked on the door again jason can i come in for a minute silence if hed been feeling anywhere near okay hed have made some kind of joke about me finally seeing him in the shower that he didnt tease me at all was a bad sign jason can i come in please come in he said finally i opened the door and the warm air fogged around me i closed the door behind me the room was soft and thick with warmth it was hot the moisture beading on every surface as if hed cranked the shower up to as hot as it would go hot as it would go was enough to scald the flesh from your bones if you were human the light left his shadow on the white shower curtain he wasnt standing he was sitting on the floor of the shower huddled i moved the towel from the lid of the stool and sat down with it in my lap whats wrong he took a deep sobbing breath and even over the shower i could hear him weeping crying didnt cover it weeping i wanted to see him while i talked to him and i didnt want to see him naked choices choices talk to me jason whats wrong i cant get it off me i cant get clean you mean metaphorically speaking or literally i asked its all over me and i cant get it off i was being a coward and a prude i reached a hand for the curtain and slowly drew it back until i could see him without splashing the entire bathroom with water jason had his knees drawn up tight to his chest arms locked around them the heat from the water was enough to make me draw back his skin had turned a nice cherry pink but that was it id have had blisters or worse by now there were clinging patches of black goo on his back the back of one arm had a patch on it hed scrubbed and boiled himself nearly raw and couldnt get clean he stared straight ahead at the faucets rocking ever so slightly i was okay until i got in the shower and it wouldnt come off then i kept seeing those two vampires in branson i thought about yvette watching her rot but its the two in branson i can still feel their hands on me anita sometimes i still wake up in the middle of the day in a cold sweat remembering in branson missouri wed taken on the local master of the city shed had two young women that she was going to torture unless we gave her some of us to torture theyd suggested that if jason made love to two of the female vamps they would let one of the girls go i think hed enjoyed it at first but then theyd started to rot jason had struggled away from them crawling against the wall his bare chest was covered in bits of their flesh a strand of something thick and heavy slid slowly down his neck onto his chest he batted at it like you would swat at a spider that you found crawling along your skin he was pressed into the black wall with his pants nearly to his thighs the blond rolled off her back and crawled towards him reaching a hand out that was nothing but bones with bits of dried flesh she seemed to be decaying in dry ground the brunette was wet she lay back on the floor and some dark fluid rushed out from her to pool beneath her body shed undone her own leather shirt and her breasts were like heavy bags of fluid im ready for you the brunette said her voice was still clear and solid no human voice should have come out of those rotting lips the blond grabbed jasons arm and he screamed i shook my head trying to clear the memory it had haunted my dreams for a while just witnessing it but for jason it had become his private phobia one of the councils flunkies had been one of the rotting ones shed tortured him too because she liked how very very afraid he was of her yvettes little torment had only happened about two months ago tonights fun and games had been far too close to home i took off the wrist sheaths and laid them on the back of the stool the fact that i was wearing the wrist sheaths when i should have been getting ready for bed said something about my own paranoia the heat from the water as i reached for the knob was almost frightening years of being told dont touch hot i knew that fire killed wereanimals but apparently heat didnt i turned the knob until the temperature was something i could touch jason started to shiver almost as soon as the water began to cool frankly i was amazed that the cabins hot water heater had kept up this long the floor was wet and the water soaked into the legs of my jeans i had another pair i could change into i found the bar of soap but the washrag was black i threw it into the sink and got the last clean one id have to remember to ask for extra towels i should have done that anyway jason finally looked at me a slow turning of his head his blue eyes looked almost glassy as if he were slipping into his own version of shock i cant go through it again anita i cant i soaped the clean washrag until it squished white suds i touched his back and he flinched i would have given almost anything in that moment if he had grabbed for me or teased or even made a pass anything to let me know he was okay instead he sat there naked and wet and miserable it made my throat tight but damn it if i cried i was afraid i wouldnt stop i was in here to comfort jason not to make him comfort me worse yet i couldnt get it off his back it had been hard enough to get off my own skin but the extra hour jason had sat around waiting for me to finish my shower had turned the fluid into glue i finally resorted to using my fingernails glad that id refused cherrys offer of fingernail polish i would have chipped it all to hell i scraped it off a piece at a time with my fingers while the hot water ran and jason shivered but it wasnt the cold that made him shiver i was so hot in the moist heat i didnt feel well id cleaned everything but one last patch low on his back very low it was like the fluid had soaked into the band of his pants low enough that the curve of buttocks started just below the patch i was squeamish about that one because though jason seemed unaware that he was nude i was very aware of it i was also having trouble keeping the oversized tshirt id put on for bed from getting wet normally i wouldnt have cared but id forgotten to pack a second nightshirt i finally turned the shower off and adjusted the temperature on the faucets so i had water without having to try and dodge the shower i moved back to jason and started peeling that last patch off his skin i tried talking to get my mind off of where my hands were we killed all the vampires jason its okay he shook his head not barnaby we missed him and he was their creator i cant stand the thought of him touching me anita i cant do this again then go home jason take the jet and get out i wont desert you he said his gaze stayed on my face for a moment and its not just because jeanclaude wouldnt like it i know that i said but all i can do is swear to you that if it is within my power to protect you from barnaby i will i was leaning very close to him my arm down the length of his back id finally gotten over the embarrassment with the sheer concentration of prying the dried bits from his body it was like dissecting that frog in high school it was gross until the teacher told me to cut out the brain then i got so interested in scraping the skull away ever so carefully so as not to damage the brain that i forgot the smell the poor pitiful frog and just concentrated on getting the brain out in one piece my lab partner and i were the only pair to get the brain out whole jason turned his head towards me brushing my hair with his face you smell like cherrys base makeup i spoke without looking up i dont own any base so she put some of hers on me earlier she wears base that is way too pale for her so it works for me i thought i got all of it off hmm he said his mouth was very close to my ear i froze in midmovement my body pressed against his back my hand touching the smooth skin just above his buttocks there was a tension now that hadnt been there my pulse sped up with the awareness of his body because i suddenly knew he was aware of me i got the last piece of dried goop off his skin and took a deep breath i started to lean back and knew that he was going to try something part of me was nervous about it and part of me was relieved it was jason after all and he was naked and i was close and it was jason if hed let the opportunity pass id have known he was hurt beyond anything i could fix his arm slid around my waist and he used that incredible speed that they were capable of i felt him lift me and we were just suddenly on the floor with him on top it was his legs on my legs that pinned me he used his arms to keep his body raised enough that his groin didnt press into me which of course meant my view of his body was unobstructed a mixed blessing he began to lean his face down for a kiss i put a hand on his chest and stopped the movement stop it jason the last time i did this you shoved a gun in my ribs and said youd shoot me if i stole a kiss i meant it i said youre armed he said im not holding your hands down i sighed you know my rule i dont point a gun at anyone unless i plan to shoot them youre my friend now jason im not going to shoot you for stealing a kiss you know it i know it he smiled and leaned in closer my hand was on his chest but my hand just kept getting closer to my own chest but i also dont want you to kiss me if youre really my friend you wont do it youll just let me up his face was just above mine so close it was hard to focus on his eyes what if i tried for more than a kiss he moved his face so his mouth was hovering over my chest i could feel his breath just above the soft line where my breasts began dont push it jason if i shoot you in the right spot it wont kill you youll be hurt but youll heal he raised his face back up to me he grinned and started to roll off of me the door opened and richard was just suddenly standing there staring down at us perfect just perfect would you believe i slipped jason asked no richard said that one word was very cold get off of me jason he rolled to one side but made no move to grab for a towel richard threw the towel at him jason caught it and his eyes sparkled with the effort not to smile jason had a streak in him that made him enjoy yanking someones chain he liked to stir the pot and see what happened someday he was going to do it with the wrong person and he was going to get hurt but not tonight get out jason i need to talk to anita jason stood and wrapped the towel around his waist id sat up but hadnt stood up jason offered me his hand i almost never let a man help me stand sit or do much of anything i took jasons hand and he gave it that little extra pull that made me bump into him when i got to my feet you want me to go he asked i moved a step back but let him keep my hand ill be all right i said jason grinned up at richard as he walked out the door richard closed the door leaning against it i was effectively trapped and he was angry enough that the room filled with prickling energy what was all that about he asked its none of your business anymore is it i asked earlier today i thought you turned me down because you were being loyal to jeanclaude i turned you down because it was the right thing to do i went to the sink and started trying to clean the bits of black crud out from under my fingernails if jeanclaude finds out youre doing jason hed hurt him maybe kill him are you going to tell on us run home tattling to our master i looked at him in the mirror when i said it my reward was that he flinched a little too close to home that comment why jason he asked do you really believe that im having sex with jason i turned and used the slightly damp towel to dry my hands richard just looked at me jesus richard just because youre jumping everything in sight doesnt mean i am i sat down on the closed stool and tried to blot my jeans dry with the towel so youre not sleeping with him the towel was not helping the jeans no im not i threw the towel in the corner i cant believe youd even ask if youd found me on the floor with a naked woman on top of me youd have thought the same thing he said hmm he had me there all the women id find you with would be strangers who are either dating you fucking you or both what you saw on the floor was jason being jason you know how he is you used to threaten to shoot him if he touched you i stood do you really want me to shoot him because he made a pass i thought one of our main problems was that you thought i shot first and asked questions later i think you called me bloodthirsty i pushed past him and where our skin touched power flared like an invisible flame he moved back clutching his arm like it had hurt but i knew it hadnt hurt it had felt wonderful a rush of power to make your hair stand on end it was little touches like that that let us both know what it could be between us i walked out so there was power between us so there was heat so what it didnt change the fact that i was sleeping with jeanclaude it didnt change the fact that richard was sleeping around the fact that i was jealous of his girlfriends and he was jealous of any man he thought i might be having sex with was just a nasty cosmic joke wed get over it there were three people in my bed none of them were me cherry and zane had curled up around nathaniel like fleshy security blankets id been informed that the physical closeness of your group whatever the animal flavor was healing both emotionally and physically richard had backed up this bit of werelore so the wereleopards got the bed because nathaniel had hysterics at the thought of being without me so the wereleopards got the bed and i got the floor i managed to get a blanket and a pillow to go with my bit of carpet we were in a new cabin verne was going to try to clean the old cabin but the bed and carpet were probably a lost cause i apologized for that but verne seemed to think i could do no wrong he was tickled pink purple and blue that id fried colins vamps i was not so happy revenge can be a very scary thing if someone had done to jeanclaudes vamps what i did to colins vamps id wed have killed them the bathroom door opened and closed quietly i sat up hugging the blanket around me jason threaded his way between the two coffins he was wearing a pair of silk boxers hed put them on last night in the bathroom and come out without a word id still been trying to convince the wereleopards that they couldnt all sleep naked jason had wanted to sleep with them adding his otherworldly energy to theirs but they refused him not because he was wolf instead of leopard but because cherry didnt trust him to keep his hands to himself jason paused in front of the bed staring down at the pile of sleeping wereleopards he ran his hands through his sleeptousled hair his hair was straight enough and baby fine enough that his hands could smooth the hair into place he stayed near the foot of the bed staring down i finally stood wrapping the blanket around me i was wearing an oversized sleeping shirt that hit me at midcalf one size does not fit all but it was still nightclothes and i wanted something between me and anyone else at heart i am a prude i went to stand next to jason covered shoulder to foot in the blanket it wasnt jason i didnt trust it was everyone else who made me uncomfortable cherry lay on her back sheets tangled around her knees she was wearing a pair of red bikini underwear stretched tight across narrow hips her waist was very long so that she got height from there as well as those long legs her breasts were small and firm she sighed and rolled one shoulder making the flesh of one breast move settling closer to the bed the nipple tightened as if something in the movement or the dream was exciting or maybe she was just cold i glanced at jason he was gazing at her like he was memorizing every curve the way her breast spilled to the side his eyes were almost soft as he looked at her more than lust maybe or the way you look at a really fine work of art admiring it because youre not allowed to touch neither of the others were giving nearly as good a show nathaniel was wrapped in a ball head pressed to cherrys waist he was so bound in covers that all you could see was the top of his head he whimpered in his sleep and cherrys hand touched the top of his head her other arm flinging out into space eyes still closed still asleep but even in her sleep she reached for him comforted him zane lay on the other side of nathaniel spooning his body against the smaller mans but the covers had been dragged off him showing the blue bikinis he was wearing the underwear looked suspiciously like cherrys as if shed had to give him something to wear to bed jason had eyes only for cherrys slender form i was surprised that she couldnt feel the weight of his gaze even in her sleep i held the quilt in place with one hand and touched his wrist with the other i crooked my finger at him and led the way to the far corner of the room as far away from the bed as we could get i leaned against the wall to the side of the window jason leaned against the wall close enough that his shoulder brushed the edge of the quilt i didnt protest because we were whispering besides after awhile complaining about everything that jason did just got tiresome it wasnt really personal he pushed his luck with everyone did you sense anyone the last watch he shook his head leaning so close that i could feel his breath against my cheek theyre afraid of you after last night i turned to look at him and had to move my head back a little to be able to focus on his eyes afraid of me his face was very serious dont be coy anita what you did last night was impressive and you know it i hugged the blanket around my shoulders and looked at the ground after the rush of power had faded last night id been cold id been cold all night it was nearly ninety degrees outside the air conditioner was whirring and i was cold unfortunately it wasnt the kind of cold that blankets or heat or even another warm body could chase away id scared myself last night lately that took a lot id seen the burning vampires in my dreams theyd chased me with flamecovered arms their mouths opened in screams fangs leaking fire like dragons breath the burning vamps had offered me miras head the head had talked in its basket asking why because i was careless didnt seem like a good enough answer i ran from the dying vampires all night long one dream after another or maybe it was just one long broken dream who knows either way it hadnt been restful richard had turned to me last night with the vampire bodies still glowing like banked fires hed looked at me and id felt his revulsion his horror at what id done like a knife through my heart if things had been reversed and id been the werewolf and hed been the human hed have been just as sickened after the show with marcus as i had been no more so the only reason richard hung around with monsters was the fact that he was one richard had gone off to his cabin with jamil and shangda shangda and jamil hadnt been horrified theyd been impressed though shangda had said theyll kill us all for this asher had disagreed colin is a lesser master than jeanclaude yet he demanded the life of jeanclaudes second me and the sanity of one of his wolves jason he overstepped his bounds anita merely reminded him of that shangda had looked at the blackened corpses slowly turning to piles of ash you think any master vampire will allow this to go unanswered asher shrugged it is no disgrace to lose against someone who has met the council and survived besides jamil said hell be scared now he wont come against anita facetoface again asher nodded exactly he fears her now his human servant nikki could have enabled the wards just like i did i said i believe asher said that if his servant had power so similar to your own she would not have merely warned him shed have tried to keep me from setting the magic free i said yes asher said she lied i said asher smiled and touched my cheek how can you be so cynical and be surprised when people lie to that there was no answer what id done was just beginning to sink in then now in the light of midday not morning wed managed to sleep the morning away i was cold with the knowledge that what id done last night hadnt used power from either richard or jeanclaude what id done last night had been all me id have been able to do it without a single vampire mark or a drop of extra power i hated it when i did something so inhuman and couldnt blame anyone else for it made me feel like a freak jason touched my shoulder i looked at him there must have been something in my face because the grin faded from his his eyes held that worldweary sorrow that peeked through every once in awhile whats wrong he asked i shook my head you saw what i did last night i did it not jeanclaude not richard me just little old me he put his hands on my shoulders and turned me to look at him full face you saved me last night anita you put yourself between me and those things ill never forget that ever i tried to look away and he shook me gently until i looked at him we were exactly the same height so it wasnt like looking up at him just at him all the teasing was gone what was left behind was something more serious more grownup less jason you killed to save us last night none of us will forget that verne and his wolves wont forget that colin wont forget it either i said hell come after us jason shook his head asher and jamil are right hes scared shitless of you now he wont come near you i grabbed his arms letting the quilt slide to the floor but hell hurt the rest of you hell try and take you jason hell give you to barnaby hell break you just to hurt me or hell kill asher jason said i know he smiled and it was almost his usual grin why do you think we both stayed in here with you last night i for one wanted your protection you know you have it i said the smile softened i know he touched my face gently whats wrong i mean really wrong why do you look so tormented today what i did last night wasnt very human jason i felt richards horror i felt him think of me as a monster and hes right jason hugged me i stiffened at first and he started to let me go then i relaxed against him i let him hold me wrapping my own arms around his back i buried my face against his neck and had a horrible urge to cry there was a soft sound from behind us i raised my head to look the wereleopards were climbing off the bed gliding towards us on human feet but moving as if there were muscles in their legs and hips and torsos that didnt exist in mine zane and cherry writhed and glided nearly naked towards us cherry held nathaniels hand leading him like a child but he didnt look like a child as he padded towards us naked undies would have hurt the upper thigh wound now as he came towards us it was clear that he wasnt completely unhappy to see me or maybe it was waking up next to cherry or maybe it was just a guy thing either way i didnt like it i pushed away from jason he didnt fight it just stepped back he watched the wereleopards come but i dont think he was worried about it in fact i could feel his energy prickle along my skin strong emotions like lust will make a shapeshifters energy rise the moment i thought it i looked without thinking jason was happy to see cherry very happy i looked away blushing i turned my back on all of them arms hugging my sides someone touched my shoulder i flinched its me anita jason said i shook my head he hugged me from behind arms very carefully across my shoulders and no lower im not sorry you killed them anita im just sorry you didnt kill barnaby someone else is going to pay for my bravado jason like mira last night i do things say things around you guys and it all goes wrong zane moved around in front of me i stared up at him with jasons arms still around my shoulders like a bulky necklace zanes brown eyes were as serious as id seen them on this trip he reached out to touch my face and only jasons arms tightening ever so slightly kept me from backing away or saying dont touching didnt mean the same thing to lycanthropes as it did to the rest of american society i would say human but there were a lot of countries that were more into casual touching than ours zanes fingers trailed down my cheek while he studied my face frowning gabriel was our whole world he and elizabeth made us chose us as bad as you think he was gabriel saved most of us i was a junkie but he didnt allow drugs in his pard he leaned into me sniffing along my skin rubbing his cheek so that i could feel the fine stubble along his jaw nathaniel was a street whore gabriel pimped him out but not to just anybody not to everybody cherry was on her knees she took my hand rubbing her face against my skin like a cat scentmarking i lost a leg in a hitandrun accident gabriel offered me my leg back he cut it off above the stump and when i shifted the leg grew back zane laid a gentle kiss on my forehead he did care for us in his own twisted way but he never risked his life for us cherry said she started licking my hand again for all the world like a cat she stopped licking me seconds before i told her to stop maybe she sensed my tension you risked your life to save nathaniel you risked the lives of your vampires for him zane cradled my face in his hands leaning back so he could see my face you love asher why would you risk him for nathaniel i drew back gently from their hands until i was standing alone near the door i wasnt going to make a break for it i just needed some room nathaniel crouched in the middle of the room he was the only one who hadnt touched me i dont love asher i said we can smell your desire for him zane said oh great i didnt say i didnt think he was cute i said i didnt love him my eyes slid to the coffin i knew he couldnt hear me but jason was leaning against the wall grinning at me arms crossed over his chest the look on his face was enough i dont love him cherry and zane stared at me wearing almost identical expressions neither of which i could read you care for him cherry said i thought about that then nodded okay i care for him why would you risk him for nathaniel she asked she was still on her knees she went to all fours as she spoke her breasts hung down moving as she crawled towards me id never had a naked woman crawl towards me ever naked men but not naked women it bothered me homophobic who me nathaniel is mine to protect im his nimirra right cherry kept crawling towards me zane had dropped to all fours and was joining her muscles moved under the skin of their shoulders their arms muscles that shouldnt have been there they moved forward in a wave of grace and muscled potential like violence contained inside skin except for nathaniel he stayed crouched and immobile as if waiting for some signal i looked past the oncoming wereleopards to jason whats going on they want to understand you theres nothing to understand i said colin hurt nathaniel because he could like youd abuse a dog you didnt like no one abuses my friends its not allowed cherry had waited for zane so that they moved in tandem towards me a nearly matched pair they were almost to me almost within touching range and i didnt want them to touch me something was going on and i didnt like it nathaniel isnt your friend jason said it wasnt friendship that made you risk asher i frowned at him stop helping me zane and cherry looked up at me and i think they would have touched me but werent sure of their welcome gabriel said he cared for us zane said but he risked nothing he sacrificed nothing he raised up on his knees close enough that his otherworldly energy pressed like a warm wind against my bare legs you risked your life for one of us last night why cherry raised up on her knees and again it was like an echo their power pressed against me like a great warm hand their intensity their need filled their eyes and i realized for the first time that it wasnt just nathaniel that was needy it was all of them they had no home no love no care it wasnt friendship zane said the wolf is right you arent having sex with nathaniel cherry said i stared at them at those eager faces sometimes you do things just because its the right thing to do i said you risked asher and damian then you risked yourself zane said why why why did you protect me last night jason asked why did you stand between me and barnaby youre my friend i said jason smiled now i am but that wasnt why you protected me youd have done the same for zane i frowned at jason what do you want me to say jason the real reason why you protected me the same reason you risked so much for nathaniel not friendship or sex or love then why i asked you know the answer anita i looked from him to the two kneeling wereleopards i hated putting it into words but jason was right nathaniel is mine now hes on the list of people that ill protect hes mine and no one can hurt him without answering to me jasons mine youre all mine and no one hurts whats mine its not allowed it sounded so arrogant saying it out loud it sounded medieval but it was still true some things just are true you dont have to voice them they just are and somewhere along the way id started collecting people my people it used to mean friends but lately it meant more than that or less it meant people like nathaniel we certainly werent friends but he was mine just the same staring down into zane and cherrys faces it was like i could see all the disappointments the small betrayals the selfishness the pettiness the cruelty i watched it fill their eyes theyd seen so much of it that they simply couldnt understand kindness or honor or worse they just didnt trust it if you mean that zane said were yours you can have all of us have i made it a question they mean sex jason said he wasnt smiling now i wasnt sure why hed been enjoying the show a moment before i dont want to have sex with either of you any of you i added hastily didnt want to have any misunderstandings please cherry said please choose one of us i looked at them why do you want me to have sex with one of you you love some of the wolves zane said you feel true friendship for them you feel none of that for us but you feel lust cherry said nathaniel disturbs you because you find him attractive that cut a little too close to home look guys i dont sleep with people just because i find them attractive why not zane asked i sighed i dont do casual sex if you dont understand that im not sure i can explain it to you how can we trust you if you dont want anything from us cherry said i didnt have an answer for that one i looked at jason can you help me out here he pushed away from the wall i think so but you may not like it explain i said the problem is that theyve never really had a nimirra not for real gabriel was an alpha and he was powerful but he wasnt a nimirraj either one of the werewolves described gabriel as a lion passant a passive leopard one that had power but didnt protect i said the pard called me a l–πoparde lionne one that protects before they promoted me to nimirra we called gabriel l–πopard lionne zane said because he was all we knew but the wolves were right he was a lion passant great i said so its settled no cherry said if gabriel taught us anything it was that you cant trust anyone unless they want something from you you dont have to love us but pick one of us for a lover i shook my head no i mean thanks for the invitation but no thanks then how can we trust you cherry asked voice almost a whisper you can trust her jason said its gabriel that you couldnt trust hes the one that convinced you that sex was so damned important anita isnt even sleeping with our ulfric but zane saw her last night he saw what she did to protect me she did it to protect her vampire the one she cares for zane said i dont feel for damian the way i feel for asher but i risked my life for him last night i said the leopards frowned up at me i know zane said and i dont understand that why didnt you let him die id asked him to risk his life to save nathaniel i try never to ask of others what im not willing to do myself if damian was willing to risk his life then i couldnt do less the leopards were lost it showed in their faces the tension that flowed through their power as it breathed along my skin am i yours nathaniel asked his voice sounded small and lost i looked past the others to him he was still crouched huddled in the middle of the floor he was huddled in around himself his long long hair had spilled around him across his face his flowerpetal eyes stared out at me through that curtain of hair like he was staring out through fur id seen other lycanthropes that did that hid behind their hair and stared crouched there he was suddenly feral and vaguely unreal he brushed the hair back from one side revealing a line of arm and chest his face was suddenly young open and raw with need i wont let anyone else hurt you nathaniel i said a single tear slid down his face im so tired of not belonging to anyone anita so tired of being anyones meat that wanted me so tired of being scared you dont have to be scared anymore nathaniel if its within my power to keep you safe i will i belong to you now i didnt like the phrasing but watching him cry one crystalline tear at a time i knew that now wasnt the time to quibble over semantics i hoped i wasnt signing up for more upcloseandpersonal care than i wanted but i nodded yes nathaniel you belong to me words alone rarely impressed shapeshifters it was like part of them didnt understand words i held out my hand to him come nathaniel come to me he crawled to me not in that wild muscular grace but head down crying face hidden by his hair he was sobbing full out by the time he reached me he held one hand up to me blind not looking at me zane and cherry had moved to either side letting him come close to me i took nathaniels hand and wondered what to do with it shaking it wasnt enough kissing it seemed wrong i racked my brain for anything on leopards and just blanked the one thing that the leopards did most often was lick each other i couldnt think of anything else i raised nathaniels hand to my mouth bending over to press my mouth to the back of his hand i licked his skin one quick movement and the taste of him was familiar i knew in that moment that raina had licked this skin ran lips tongue teeth down this body the munin welled up inside of me and i fought it the munin wanted to bite his hand to draw blood and lap it like a cat with cream the imagery was too repulsive to me my own horror helped me chase raina away i pushed her down inside me and realized that she never really left me anymore that was why she came so quickly and so easily i felt her hiding inside me like a cancer waiting to spread i stood there with the taste of nathaniels skin in my mouth and did what raina had never done i gave comfort i raised nathaniels head gently until i could cradle his face between my hands i kissed his forehead i kissed the salty taste of tears from his cheeks he fell against me with a sob arms locked around my legs pressed against me there was a moment when raina tried to flare to life as nathaniels groin pressed against my bare legs i reached out to richard drawing on the mark between us his power came to my call like a warm brush of fur it helped chase away that awful stinging presence i offered my hands to the other leopards they pressed their faces to my skin chin marking me like cats licking me as if i were a kitten i stood there with the three wereleopards pressed to me borrowing richards power to keep raina at bay but it was more than that richards power filled me washed through me into the leopards i was like the wood in the center of a fire richard was the flame and the wereleopards warmed themselves against that heat they took it into themselves bathed in it wrapped it around themselves like a promise standing there caught between richards power the wereleopards needs and that awful touch of raina like some foul perfume i prayed dear god dont let me fail them the greeting ceremony that had been interrupted last night was back on for tonight one thing about the monsters you have to observe the rules the rules said we needed a greeting ceremony well by golly wed have one vengeful vampires or crooked cops or hell freezing over if there was a rite to be performed or a ceremony to be had you went ahead with it the vampires were worse about being cultured while they tore your throat out but the werewolves werent far behind me id have ordered takeout and said hell with it lets try to solve the mystery but i wasnt in charge even crispycrittering over twenty vamps last night didnt make me top dog or top anything else though vernes invitation had been very very polite colin wasnt the only one who was scared of me now executing almost all of colins vamps meant that vernes pack was in charge now they had the personnel to keep colin from making more vamps apparently if there was no tie between vampires and wereanimals in an area then whoever had the strength could rule over the others until last night colin had kept the wolves in line now the shoe was on the other foot and from the look in vernes eyes the shoe was going to pinch it was one of those hot august nights that is utterly still the world sits in the close hot darkness as if holding its breath waiting for a cool breeze that never comes but there was movement under the trees no wind but movement people crept among the trees no not people werewolves everyone was still in human form but you wouldnt have mistaken them for human they eased through the trees like gliding shadows moving through the scattered underbrush almost soundlessly if there had been even the smallest breeze to stir the trees they would have been soundless but a brush of twig a crunch of leaf a rustle of green leaves and you heard them on a night like tonight even the small sounds carried a twig snapped off to my left and i jumped jamil touched my arm and i jumped again damn babe youre jumpy tonight dont call me babe his smile flashed in the darkness sorry i rubbed my hands along my arms you cant be cold he said im not it wasnt cold that was trailing up and dawn my skin like insects marching whats wrong jason asked i stopped in the dark woods kneedeep in some tall leggy weed i shook my head searching the darkness yeah there were several dozen werewolves slinking around but it wasnt the shapeshifters themselves that were freaking me out it was it was like hearing voices in a distant room i couldnt understand what they were saying but i could hear them hear them in my head i knew what it was it was the munin the munin in the lupanar the munin called to me whispered across my skin they were eager for me to come waiting for me shit zane stared out into the dark he was standing close enough that i heard him draw a breath and knew he was scenting the wind they were all turned out into the night even nathaniel he seemed more confident than id ever seen him more comfortable in his own skin no pun intended our little ceremony this afternoon had meant something to all three of the leopards i still wasnt sure what exactly it meant to me they were all wearing old jeans tshirts things you wouldnt mind shapeshifting in because one night closer to the full moon accidents happened no not accidents i would get to watch some of them lose their human shapes tonight i realized that i really didnt want to see it not really asher and damian were not here they had gone to spy or negotiate with colin and his remaining vamps id thought this was a really bad idea but asher had assured me that it was expected that he as jeanclaudes second would carry the message that i we had spared colin and his second in command barnaby we had allowed his human servant to walk from the circle we had been generous and we didnt have to be by their laws colin had overstepped his bounds he was the lesser vampire and we could have taken everything from him of course the truth was that colin and barnaby had escaped the only person we allowed to escape was colins human servant but asher assured me that he could lie to colin and that the master of this city would never realize it was a lie there was a tightness in my gut at the thought of damian and asher out there alone with colin and company the vamps had rules for everything but they had a tendency to bend the rules until they were just this side of breaking close enough to get asher and damian hurt but asher had been so confident and tonight i was playing lupa one monster at a time i guess another thing that was making me nervous was no guns knives were okay they substituted for claws but no guns marcus had been the same way no ulfric worth his salt would let you bring a gun into their inner sanctum i understood it but i didnt have to like it after what id done for verne last night i thought the request for no guns was downright rude richard had informed me that my killing of colins vamps inside the lupanar would be our gift the gift that the visiting ulfric and lupa gave to the resident pack the gift was usually a freshly killed animal jewelry for the lupa or something mystical death jewelry or magic it sounded like valentines day id put jeans on to protect my legs from the underbrush even though it was hot enough for my knees to sweat the only one of us wearing shorts was jason if his legs were getting scratched up he didnt seem to mind he was also the only one not wearing a shirt of some kind id put on a royal blue tank top so at least the top of me would be cool it did leave the knives sort of visible though the big knife down my spine was still invisible unless you looked really hard at my back the tank top was thin material and you could see the sheath though not in the dark i had my usual wrist sheaths and silver blades on my forearms they were very visible against my skin i had a new knife in my pocket it was a fourinch switchblade with a safety lock didnt want to sit down and stab myself this is one of those blades that comes straight out yes it is illegal it had been a gift from a friend who didnt sweat legalities much so why have a fourincher that is illegal to carry in most states because at six inches it wasnt comfortable to sit down with it in my pocket so nice to have friends that know your size i was also wearing a silver crucifix i didnt plan on meeting any bad vamps tonight but i didnt trust colin not to try something if he knew enough about the greeting ceremony to know i wouldnt be allowed a gun now is when he would jump me there were soft grey shadows under the trees the moon and stars were bright somewhere overhead but where we stood the trees were a solid darkness between us and the sky i felt almost claustrophobic standing there in the dark i dont smell anything but other lukoi jason said everybody agreed nothing but us shapeshifters tonight no one but me seemed to be able to feel that whispering echo i was the only necromancer in the bunch so the spirits of the dead liked me better we need to be at the meeting place before the ceremony goes any further jamil said i looked at him you mean theyve started the ceremony already the call has been given jason said he said it like call should have been in capital letters what do you mean the call has been given theyve sacrificed an animal and smeared blood on the tree sort of what you did last night jason said i rubbed my arms i wonder if thats why im sensing the munin when we smear blood on the rock throne our spirit symbol it doesnt make the munin come jason said i shook my head ive been in your lupanar jason this one is different their magic is different from yours i felt something creeping through the trees a roil of energy that made my heart skip a beat and then beat faster as if id been running jesus what was that shes feeling the call jason said thats impossible jamil said she isnt lukoi he stabbed a finger at cherry zane and nathaniel they dont feel it theyre shapeshifters and they dont feel the call to the lupanar cherry looked at us then shook her head hes right i feel something like a vague buzz through the woods but its nothing big nathaniel and zane agreed with her my skin rushed across my body like it was going to try to crawl away under its own power it was creepy as hell what is happening to me she is feeling the call jason said that is not possible jamil said you keep saying that about her jamil and you keep being wrong jason said a low growling snarl trickled from jamils mouth stop it both of you i said i looked behind me farther into the trees until there was nothing but a wall of darkness shot by faint moonlight jason was right i could feel the magic it was ritual magic and it was death magic lycanthropes power comes from life they are the most alive preternatural creatures ive ever been around more like fairies than humans sometimes but this lupanar ran on death as well as life it called to me twice once through richards marks second through my necromancy i wished richard were here hed gone to have dinner with his family shangda had gone with him at my insistence sheriff wilkes had to know we werent leaving town by now it wasnt just the local vampires we had to worry about richard had called on the telephone saying they were running late to start without him his mother just hadnt understood why he couldnt stay longer all of the zeeman men were so pussy whipped ah henpecked sorry i started through the trees and they followed me i climbed on top of a fallen log you never step directly over a log you never know if theres a snake on the other side step on the log then over tonight it wasnt snakes i was worried about i moved slowly picking my way through the trees my night vision is excellent for a human and i could have gone faster i wanted to go faster i wanted to fling myself through the trees and run i didnt but it was force of will alone that kept me walking it wasnt just the death i was picking up on it was that warm rising energy that was pure lycanthrope i knew i could sense some of this with richard holding my hand wed done it before on a full moon but never with me alone never just me moving through the darkness trying to breathe past the beating of my heart and the rush of someone elses power i whispered richard what have you done to me maybe it was his name maybe it was just thinking of him but i suddenly felt him sitting in the car i had a moment of seeing daniel driving i could smell daniels aftershave i could feel the warm tightness of richards chest i pulled away and was left staggering if i hadnt had a tree to hug id have fallen to my knees if that moment of sharing hit richard as hard as it hit me i was glad he wasnt driving anita are you all right jason touched my shoulder and power flowed between us in a hot skincreeping rush i turned to him and it felt like i was moving in slow motion i couldnt breathe past the power and the sensations that filled my mind images flashes like watching a room through strobe light a bed white sheets the smell of sex so fresh it was hot and musky my hands resting on a smooth chest a mans chest that warm rolling power that was pure lycanthrope pure beast filled my body like the man underneath me sharp pleasant exciting the power spilled out my fingertips pulling claws from my hands like knives unsheathing the beast pushed at the smooth skin of my body tried to slip out and overwhelm me but i held it tightened my body around it and let only my hands turn monstrous claws sliced that smooth chest blood hot and fresh enough to taste on our tongues jason stared up at me from the bed still pinned by my body our body and he screamed hed wanted this chosen it and still he screamed i felt his flesh give under claws those hands struck again and again until the white sheets were spongy with blood and he lay motionless underneath us if he survived he would be one of us i remembered not caring if he lived or if he died not really it was the sex the pain the joy of it all that mattered when i could feel my body again jason and i were kneeling in the leaves his hands were still on my arms someone was screaming and it was me jason stared at me with a face almost blank with horror hed shared the ride but it wasnt his memory it wasnt richards memory or mine it was rainas she was dead but not forgotten she was why i feared the munin i was a necromancer with ties to the wolves the munin liked me rainas munin liked me best of all whats wrong cherry said she touched me and it opened something inside of me again it welcomed raina back with a rush that left me screaming but i fought it this time fought it because i did not want to see cherry the way raina would see her jason wouldnt care cherry would care i would care there was a rush of sensations skin damp with sweat hands with long polished nails on my breasts those grey eyes staring up at me mouth open slack shoulderlength yellow hair against a pillow raina on top again i screamed and pulled away from them both the images died as if a plug had been pulled i scrambled through the leaves on all fours eyes shut tight i ended sitting hugging my knees to my chest face buried against my legs i squeezed my eyes so tight that i began seeing white snakes against my eyelids i heard someone move through the crunching leaves i felt them hovering over me dont touch me i said it was almost another scream i heard whoever it was kneel in the dry leaves before jamils voice came i wont touch you are you still getting the memories he didnt ask if i was seeing the memories i found the phrasing strange i shook my head without looking up then its over anita once the munin leave theyre gone until called again i didnt call her i raised my face slowly and opened my eyes the summer night seemed blacker somehow it was raina again he made it a question yes he knelt as close as he could get without touching me you shared the memories with jason and with cherry i wasnt sure if it was a question or a statement but i answered it yeah it was a full visual jason said he was sitting with his bare back against a tree cherry had her hands pressed to her face she spoke face hidden i cut my hair after that night after what she did to me one night with her was the price for not having to do one of their porno movies she jerked her hands away from her face crying god i can smell rainas scent she rubbed her hands against her jeans over and over as if shed touched something bad and was trying to wipe it away what the fuck was that i asked ive channeled raina before but it wasnt like that ive got glimpses of memories but not a fullblown movie nothing like that ever have you been trying to learn to control the munin jamil asked just to get rid of it them whatever jamil moved closer to me studying my face as if looking for something if you were lukoi id tell you you cant just turn the munin off if you have the power to call them then you must learn to control them not just shut them out because you cant shut them out theyll seek a way into you through you how do you know so much i asked i knew a werewolf who could call the munin she hated it she tried to shut them out it didnt work just because it didnt work for your friend doesnt mean i cant do it i could feel his breath warm against my face back off jamil he scooted back but he was still closer than i wanted him to be he sat back in the leaves she went crazy anita the pack had to execute her his eyes went past me into the darkness i turned to see what he was looking at two figures stood in the darkness one was a woman with long pale hair and a long white dress like something out of a s horror movie if you were playing the victim but she stood very straight very certain as if she were anchored to the ground like a tree there was something almost frightfully confident about her the man with her was tall slender and tanned dark enough that he looked brown in the dark his hair was short and a paler brown than his skin if the woman seemed calm he seemed nervous he gave off energy in a roiling bath that breathed along my skin and made the night seem hotter are you well the woman asked she shared the munin with two of us jamil said by accident i take it the woman said she sounded faintly amused i was not amused i got to my feet a little unsteady but standing who are you my name is marianne i am the vargamor for this clan i remembered verne and colin talking about a vargasomething last night verne mentioned you last night colin said hed left you at home to keep you safe a good witch is hard to find she said smiling i looked at her you dont feel wiccan again i knew she smiled at me her peaceful condescension grated on my nerves a psychic then if you prefer the term id never heard the term vargamor before last night i said its rare she said most packs dont have one anymore considered too oldfashioned you arent lukoi i said her head cocked to one side and the smile was gone as if id finally done something worthwhile are you so sure i tried to get a sense of what had made me so sure she was human or at least not lukoi she had her own energy she was psychic enough for me to notice wed have recognized each other without any introductions we might not have known the exact flavor of each others abilities but wed have recognized a kindred or rival spirit whatever power moved her it wasnt lycanthropy yeah im sure youre not lukoi i said why she asked you dont taste like a shapeshifter she laughed then and it was a rich musical sound that managed to be wholesome and earthy all at the same time i like your choice of senses most humans would have said i didnt feel right feel is such an imprecise word dont you think i shrugged maybe this is roland he is my bodyguard for this night we poor humans must be watched over for fear that some overzealous shapeshifter might lose control and harm us somehow i dont think you are that easy a prey marianne she laughed again why thank you child her calling me child made me add about ten years to her age she didnt look it it was dark but she still didnt look it come anita we will escort you to the lupanar she held out her hand to me like i was supposed to take it and be led like a child i looked to jamil i hoped somebody knew what was going on because i was lost its all right anita the vargamor is neutral she never fights or takes sides in challenges thats how she can be human and run with the pack are we involved in a challenge or a fight that i dont know about i asked no jamil said but he sounded uncertain marianne interpreted for me without being asked introducing two outside dominants to a pack can lead to fighting having someone as powerful as richard is raising the hackles on our younger wolves having him sleeping with our packs only two dominant females makes it worse you mean we may get into a pissing contest i said a colorful phrase but accurate enough she said okay now what i asked now roland and i escort you all to the lupanar the rest of you may go ahead you know the way jamil i dont think so i said no to what marianne asked do i look like little red riding hood i said im not taking a stroll in the woods with two strangers one of them a werewolf and the other a i dont know what you are yet marianne but i dont want to be alone with the two of you very well she said some or all may stay i was thinking that you might like privacy to speak with another human tied to the lukoi perhaps i was wrong tomorrow in the light of day we can talk tonight lets just take it easy as you like she said again she held out her hand to me come let us talk as we all troop to the lupanar as one big happy family youre making fun of me now i said that wont put you on my alist i make fun of everyone a little she said i mean no harm by it she waggled her hand at me come child the moon is passing above us time wastes away i walked towards her with my five bodyguards at my back i didnt take her hand though i was close enough to see the condescending smile clearly now anita blake the famous vampire hunter afraid of some backcountry wisewoman i smiled im cautious by nature and paranoid by profession youve offered me your hand twice now within just a few minutes you dont strike me as someone who does anything without a reason what gives she put her hands on her hips and tsked at me is she always this difficult worse jason said i frowned at him even if he couldnt see it in the dark it made me feel better all i want child is to touch your hand and get a sense of how powerful you are before we let you inside the boundaries of our lupanar again after what you did last night some of our pack fear you within the boundaries of our lupanar they seem to think you will steal our power i can tap into it i said but i cant steal it but the munin already reach out to you i felt you call your munin it traveled through the power we have called tonight in the lupanar it disturbed it like plucking on a thread of a spiders web we came to see what we had caught and if it were too big to eat we would cut it loose and not take it home the spider metaphor worked for maybe two sentences then you lost me i said the lupanar is our place of power anita i need to get a sense of what you are before you enter it this night the laughter was gone from her voice she was suddenly very serious it is not just our protection i am thinking of child it is yours think child what would happen to you if the munin within our circle rode you one after another i need to make sure you can control at least that well just hearing her say it made my stomach tight with fear okay i held out my hand to her like we were going to shake hands but i gave her my left hand if she didnt like it she could refuse it offering the left hand is an insult she said take it or leave it vargamor we dont have all night that is more true than you know little one she put her hand out as if to touch mine but stopped with her hand just above mine she spread her hand above my skin i mirrored her she was trying to get a sense of my aura two could play at that game when i raised my hands up in front of my body she mirrored me we stood facing each other hands spread wide not quite touching she was tall fivefootseven or fivefooteight i didnt think there were high heels under that long dress her aura was warm against my skin it had a weight to it as if i could have wrapped her aura in my hands like dough id never met anyone with such weight to their aura it confirmed my first sense of her solid she pushed forward suddenly wrapping her fingers around my hand she forced my aura back in upon itself like a knife thrust it made me gasp but again i knew what was happening i pushed back and felt her waver she smiled but it wasnt condescending now it was almost as if she were pleased the hair at the back of my neck tried to crawl down my spine powerful she said strong i spoke around a tightness in my throat you too thank you she said i felt her power her magic move over me through me like a rush of wind she pulled away so abruptly it staggered both of us we were left standing a foot away from each other breathing hard like wed been running my heart thudded in my throat like a trapped thing and i could taste her pulse on the back of my tongue no i could hear it i could hear it like a small ticking clock but it wasnt her pulse i smelled richards aftershave like a cloud that i had walked through when the marks were working through richard it was often scent that let me know what was happening i didnt know what had caused them to act up maybe the power of the other lycanthropes or the closeness of the full moon who knew but something had opened me to him i was channeling more than the sweet smell of his body what is that sound i asked describe it marianne said like a clicking soft almost mechanical ive got an artificial valve in my heart she said it cant be that why not when i lean forward to the mirror to apply eyeliner i can hear it through my open mouth echoing against the mirror but i cant hear it i said but you are she said i shook my head i was losing the sense of her she was pulling away from me putting up shields i didnt blame her because for just a second i could feel her heart beating limping along the sound hadnt made me sorry for her or empathetic the sound excited me i felt it pull things deep inside my body it was almost sexual shed be slow an easy kill i looked at this tall confident woman and for a split second all i saw was food fuck we followed marianne and her guard roland through the darkened trees id have caught that damn dress on every twig and deadfall marianne floated through the woods as if the trees themselves let her and the dress pass gently through roland paced at her arm gliding through the woods like water down a wellworn channel jamil nathaniel and zane moved just as gracefully it was the rest of us that were having trouble my excuse was that i was human i didnt know what jason and cherrys excuse was i tried to step on a log and missed i ended up on my stomach arms scraping along the rough bark i straddled it like a horse and couldnt seem to get my leg over the other side cherry tripped on something in the leaves and fell to her knees i watched her get to her feet and trip over the same damn thing this time she stayed on her knees head down jason fell in a tangle of dry tree roots at the end of the log i was sitting on he fell on his face and cursed when he got to his feet there was a scrape on his chest deep enough to show blood black in the moonlight it reminded me of what raina had done to him shed cut his chest to rags and there wasnt a scar on him from it i closed my eyes and leaned over the log resting my forearms on it my arms hurt i raised myself slowly and looked at them id scraped them up enough so that blood was slowly filling the wounds in spots great jason leaned against the end of the log far enough away that we wouldnt touch i think we were all still afraid of that didnt want a repeat whats wrong with us jason asked i shook my head i dont know marianne was just suddenly there i hadnt heard her come up was i losing time was i that out of it you cast out the munin before it was ready to release you so i said so that takes energy she said fine that explains me stumbling around what about them why do they feel like shit she gave a very small smile you are not the only one who fought the munin anita it was you who called it and if you had not been willing to fight it then the other two would have been helpless before it but they fought it as well they struggled against the memories that costs you sound like you know i said i can call the munin these chaotic flashes are what happens when you have a munin that hunts you and that you do not want to embrace how did you know it was chaotic i asked i caught a glimpse or two of what you saw the merest touch she said why dont you feel awful i asked i did not struggle if you simply allow the munin to ride you it passes much more quickly and relatively painlessly i halflaughed at her that sounds like the old advice of lie back close your eyes and itll be over soon she turned her head to one side long hair sliding over her shoulders like a pale ghost embracing the munin can be pleasant or unpleasant but this munin hunts you anita most of the time a munin that tries to bond with a pack member does so out of love or shared sorrow i just looked at her it isnt love that motivates this one no she said i felt both the strength of her personality and her hatred of you she chases you out of spite i shook my head not just spite what little is left of her enjoys the game shes having a really good time when i channel her marianne nodded yes but if you would embrace her instead of fighting you could pick and choose among the memories strong ones will come easiest but you could control more of what comes and how strongly it comes if you would truly channel her as you put it then the images would be less like a movie and more like wearing a glove except that im the glove i said and her personality overwhelms mine no thanks if you continue to fight this munin it will get worse if you will cease struggling and meet her even partway the munin will lose some of its strength some feed off of love this one feeds off of fear and hatred was this the old lupa the one you killed yeah i said marianne shivered i never met raina but even that small touch of her makes me glad shes dead she was evil she didnt see herself that way i said she saw herself as more neutral than evil i said it like i knew and i did know i knew because id worn her essence like a dress more than once very few people see their own actions as truly evil marianne said it is left to their victims to decide what is evil and what is not jason raised his hand evil cherry echoed him evil nathaniel and zane and even jamil raised their hands i raised my hand too its unanimous i said marianne laughed and again it was a sound equally at home in the kitchen or the bedroom how she managed to be both wholesome and suggestive in the same breath puzzled me of course a lot of things puzzled me about marianne well be late roland said his voice was deeper than i thought it would be low and careful almost too old for his body he looked peaceful enough but i could look at him with things other than my eyes you couldnt see it but you could feel it he was a mass of nervous energy it danced along his skin breathing out into the dark like an invisible cloud hot almost touchable like steam i know roland she said i know we could carry them jamil said a thrill of power flowed through the trees it caught at my heart as if some invisible hand had touched me we must go roland said what is your problem i asked roland looked at me with eyes that were a nice solid darkness you are he said he spoke in a low voice and it sounded like a threat jamil moved between us so that my view of roland was almost completely blocked and i assumed his view of me now children marianne said play nicely we will miss the ceremony entirely if they do not hurry roland said if you were a true lupa marianne said you could draw energy from your wolves and give it in return like a great recycling battery it sounded like shed given this lecture before i guess every pack needs a teacher i know ours needed one sorely i was beginning to realize that we were like children that had been raised by neglectful parents we were grownup but we didnt know how to behave youre psychic enough that you might be able to do it in a small way without being lukoi marianne said i dont think id call being a necromancer the same thing as being psychic jamil said marianne shrugged its all much more alike than most people wish to acknowledge many religious groups are comfortable with psychic ability but not with magic but call it what you will its either that or we call some more wolves and throw you across our shoulders the real trouble was that i only knew two ways to call power one was ritual the other was sex id realized a few months ago that sex could take the place of ritual for me not always and i had to be attracted to the person involved but sometimes i didnt really want to admit to strangers that sexual energy was one of the ways i performed magic even though no actual sex was involved it was still embarrassing besides doing anything sexual seemed like putting out the welcome mat for rainas munin how could i explain all this to marianne without sounding like a slut i couldnt think of a way to explain it that didnt make me sound bad so i wasnt going to try go on without us marianne well get there on our own thanks anyway she stamped her foot under that flowing gown why are you so reluctant to try anita i shook my head we can discuss magical metaphysics tomorrow right now why dont you take your wolf and go well get there slow but sure lets go roland said marianne looked to him then back to me i was told to see if you were a danger to us and you are not but i dont like leaving you out here like this the three of you are weak well get over it i said she cocked her head to one side again hair sweeping like a white veil to frame her face are you planning some sort of magic that you dont wish me to see maybe i said truth was no no way was i voluntarily touching jason or cherry again not tonight but if marianne thought we were going to do something mystical but private she might go away i wanted her to go away she stood looking at me for nearly a full minute then finally smiled dim in the moonlight very well but do hurry the others will grow impatient to greet richards human lupa you have everyones curiosity piqued glad to hear it the sooner you go the sooner we can start she turned without another word and started off through the trees roland trailed her then took the lead we all stood around waiting for mariannes white dress to grow distant and ghostlike through the forest finally jason said start what nothing i said i just wanted them gone why jamil asked i shrugged i dont want to be carried like a sack of potatoes i started walking slow but sure towards the lupanar jamil fell into step beside me why not try what she was suggesting i walked carefully paying a lot more attention to my feet than i usually did because outside of raising the dead im still an amateur it will probably take less time for us to walk to the lupanar than for me to do something mystical jason agreed with me which made me frown at him but it was still true i was like someone with a loaded gun that didnt know how to shoot i would be struggling to figure out how to undo the safety while the bad guys shot me a million times about two months ago the only other necromancer id ever met had offered to teach me real necromancy not this voodoo dabbling i was doing hed ended up dead before he could teach me much of anything funny how many people ended up dead after they met me no i didnt kill him cherry stumbled and went down again zane and nathaniel were just suddenly there one on either side of her they helped her stand hugging each other for a moment cherry slipped a hand around the waist of both men leaning her head for a second on zanes shoulder they walked this way through the treacherous dark cherry leaning heavily on her fellow wereleopards there was a camaraderie between them that hadnt been there before had i done that had just having someone to protect them forged some sort of bond or had it been richards prickling energy i had a lot of questions and didnt even know if there was anyone who would know maybe marianne would know if i decided i could trust her jamil offered me his arm i waved him away i knew that raina had slept with him and i did not want the memory help jason i said jamil looked at me for a second then went and offered his arm to jason who refused the offer if anita doesnt need help neither do i dont be a hard case i said now thats the pot calling the kettle black jason said if i offered you my arm youd take it i said an excuse to hang all over a pretty girl sure then he seemed to think about it but maybe not tonight i cant call the munin but theres something in the air tonight he shivered rubbing his hands along his bare arms of all the memories raina had of me why that one we were both slowly walking as we talked the three things raina liked best were sex and violence and terrorizing people making you lukoi hit all her buttons jason stumbled fell to his knees and just stayed that way for a second or two i waited with him wondering if i should offer to help him up i know you wondered why i never did any of her porno movies i guess i mean youre not exactly the shy type he looked up at me and even by moonlight there was a sorrow in his face that was deeper and wider than most people ever saw he was too young for the look in his eyes but there it was innocence lost ill always remember the look on her face when she killed me she didnt kill you jason she tried it didnt matter to her whether i lived or died it really didnt that one shared memory and i couldnt argue with him rainas pleasure had been more important to her than his life like a serial killer jason hunched in upon himself but she was my sponsor and i had to stay with her until my probation period was over when i could i got away is that why you went to stay with jeanclaude as his lapwolf to escape raina jason nodded partly he looked up suddenly and grinned of course jeanclaude is way cool i shook my head and offered him my hand think we can risk it he asked i think so im not feeling particularly muninish right now he took my hand and it was just a hand his hand in mine i helped him stand and he staggered just a bit on his feet which made me wobble we clung to each other for a second like two drunks leaving a party i hugged him and he hugged me back it was quick he pulled away first and looked almost embarrassed dont tell anyone i didnt take my chance to grope you when it was your idea i patted him on the back not a soul he gave me his usual grin and we started through the woods walking close enough to catch each other if we fell a breeze blew through the trees rustling everything the woods were suddenly alive with sound i turned my face to the wind hoping it would be cool but it was hot like the air from an oven jasons baby fine hair moved gently in the breeze i heard him take a deep breath then he touched my arm he spoke low i smell the man that i threw into the truck yesterday we kept walking as if nothing were wrong are you sure i asked i saw his nostrils flare as he tested the air he smelled like peppermint lifesavers and cigarettes a lot of people smell like peppermint and cigarettes i said we kept moving his hand on my arm now i also smell gun oil great jamil was waiting for us just up ahead the three wereleopards waited among the trees jamil came back to us smiling and enveloped both of us in a big hearty hug you guys are so damned slow tonight he hugged us against him and whispered i smell two maybe three to our left one of them is a guy i beat up yesterday jason said smiling as if we were talking about something else entirely revenge maybe he made it a question how far away are they i asked he drew back with a big very unjamil grin he whispered a few yards i can smell the guns i encircled his slender waist with my arm and whispered against his chest we dont have any guns any suggestions jason leaned in laughing and said i dont feel good enough to outrun them i patted his arm me either if theyre here for revenge jamil said then maybe theyll settle for just the two of you i drew back from him i wasnt sure i liked his reasoning so you stay here and make out they move up to get you and i get them theyve got guns you dont ill send zane and cherry to the others theyll bring reinforcements but we cant let them follow us to the lupanar we cant take danger there some werewolf rule i asked yes he said all right i said but dont let them kill me okay what about me jason said sorry him either jamil leaned into both of us i suggest the two of you get a lot more cozy fast or theyre not going to buy it i transferred my arm to jasons waist but said how long have they been watching make them think youre drunk just in case they saw the screaming make out but get on the ground as soon as possible in case they just decide to shoot you with that comforting thought jamil went back to the others he walked away into the dark with the wereleopards zane looked at me as they walked away but i nodded once and that seemed to satisfy him he turned and let jamil lead him away i really was going to have to find the leopards a true alpha they were all so damn submissive jason pushed me up against a tree watch it i said he grinned at me we want it to look real dont we i thought we had a moment of real friendship bonding back there i said jason leaned in towards me as if he were going to kiss me just because were friends doesnt mean that i dont want to sleep with you he kissed me a soft brush of lips i frowned at him not kissing back please tell me that you dont want to sleep with all your female friends he put a hand on either side of my head propping himself against the tree what can i say im a guy i shook my head thats not an excuse he leaned his whole body into me in a sort of standing pushup the muscles in his arms swelled with the effort how about because its me i smiled that ill buy i put my hands on his waist he was leaning against me but not too hard he could have been taking a lot more advantage of the situation than he was i realized that he was being a gentleman there was a time not long ago that jason wouldnt have made the effort we were friends but we needed to get down on the ground and this wasnt getting us there i glanced as casually as i could at the others i could still see zane and cherrys hair gleamed through the trees i had a sense that jamil and nathaniel were still with them but it was all that blond hair that made them so visible if the bad guys had a highpowered rifle they could shoot us both through the tree once the others got out of sight they might do just that i slid my hands up jasons chest the skin was soft but underneath he was very firm i knew what that smooth flesh felt like shredding under claws it wasnt the munin coming back it was just me flashing on the vision i balled my hands into fists and forced my hands to his face i didnt want to do anything that would remind either of us of what wed just shared there was always the extra danger that it could bring raina back no i didnt want to be channeling raina with armed goons in the woods i cradled jasons face in my hands moving just my head towards him as i leaned into him he leaned more into me i was suddenly very aware that his body was pressed down the length of mine it made me hesitate but when his lips brushed mine i kissed him i ran my hand back through his hair until i had a handful of it i whispered into his mouth we need to get on the ground as soon as possible he kissed me harder hands dropping to my belt he slid his fingertips inside the belt and knelt in front of me pulling me down with him i let him he fell back into the leaves and pulled me down on top of him i propped myself on my scraped forearms against his chest sort of startled i just wasnt a good enough actress for this i could feel his heart thudding under my hands he rolled me suddenly and i let out a little yip of surprise he ended very firmly on top and i didnt like it i want on top i said he put his lips next to my cheek if they shoot us i can take a bullet better than you can he rubbed his cheek along my face and i realized he was doing the werewolf greeting maybe it was their version of a handshake but id never been tempted to shake hands while making out i whispered into his ear which was very close to my mouth do you hear them yes he raised his face enough to kiss me how close i kissed him back but we were both listening straining to hear here we were lying on top of each other bodies perfectly matched up and we were both tight enough that i could feel the muscles along his back knotting a few yards he said theyre good he rested his cheek against mine they move quietly not quiet enough i whispered can you hear them he asked no we were both just staring at each other neither of us was making much of an effort to kiss or anything else i could feel that his body was happy to be pressed up against mine but it was all secondary men with guns were coming men who didnt like us very much i stared up into his eyes from inches away i knew they were pale blue but by moonlight they looked almost silver youre not going to do anything stupid like shield my body with yours he pushed just a little with his hips and grinned why do you think im on top the grin and the hip movement were to distract me from how very serious his eyes were get off of me jason nope he said he propped himself up on his arms pressing into me leaning over like we were kissing theyre almost here i slid a knife out for either hand he whispered against my mouth were supposed to look helpless remember bait doesnt go armed i could feel how very smooth his cheek was smell his cologne i stared past the pale halo of his hair we just trust that jamil and the rest will save us is that it he licked my chin then my mouth i realized he was doing the submissive greeting he was begging me to go along his tongue was very wet and very warm stop licking me and ill do it i said he laughed but it was high with an edge of tension to it i couldnt resheath the knives with him pressed on top of me so i laid them down in the leaves i kept my hands on them lightly but tried to relax and look harmless with jason pressed on top of me kissing down my neck it was easy to look helpless the relaxed part wasnt going to happen i heard them now moving through the dry leaves they were quiet if i hadnt been listening for it i might have thought it was wind an animal moving through the undergrowth but it wasnt it was men moving heavy and secretively through the forest hunting they were hunting they were hunting jason and me i saw the first one round the tree and i wasnt a good enough actress to look surprised i just stared up at him with jason on top of me still kissing the side of my neck hed looked big yesterday from flat on my back he was enormous like a twolegged tree the rifle in his hand looked long and black and hostile he didnt point it at us just held it in the crook of one arm a big smile split his pale face i heard the second man before he touched jasons shoulder with the tip of a doublebarreled shotgun the moment i saw the shotgun i knew theyd come to kill us you didnt go after people with shotguns if you just meant to scare them not as a general rule anyway if it were silver shot at this range he could have killed both of us i wasnt scared yet i was pissed where the hell was our backup jason raised his face slowly the shotgun tapped his cheek almost gently my brother mel sends his regards i rolled my eyes to look past the shotgun the man was wearing a black tshirt with a harley logo on it his belly hung out over his belt there was a family resemblance i said very calmly each word careful but not scared what do you want mels brother laughed the first man joined him they stood over us with the guns and laughed not a good sign where the fuck was jamil get off of her real slow the first man said the rifle was at his shoulder now snuggled against his chin like he knew what he was doing jason leaned over me until i was as hidden as i could get under his body being short made it hard for him to shield me completely i told him get off of me no he said hed seen the shotgun too and i realized he understood what it meant i was not going to let him die a hero i was certainly not going to let him die by spattering his brains all over me some things you recover from some things you dont wiping jasons brains off my face might be one of the latter i let go of the knife in my right hand letting the blade lie in the leaves it took everything i had not to tighten my grip on the one in my left i tried to keep my hand very still in the dark they might not notice they hadnt so far get off of her the man repeated or i will shoot you both where you lay off jason i said softly he moved enough so we could see each others eyes i looked to my right at the rifleman then i touched my chest and looked at mels brother i was trying to tell him that the rifle was his problem and the shotgun was mine i hoped he understood either he did or he had his own plan because he raised very slowly and got to his knees i sat up not too fast not too slow i kept my left hand in the leaves knife gripped tightly the rifleman said hands on your head boy jason didnt argue he just clasped his hands on his head like hed done it before no one told me to put my hands on my head so i didnt if we were lucky theyd treat me like a girl the rifleman had been unconscious when i hurt mel the one with the shotgun hadnt been there what had mel told them the rifleman said remember me asshole is he asking you or me i asked i scooted in the leaves a little closer to the guy with the shotgun dont get cute chickie the rifleman said we came here for both of you but i want my piece of this one first jason flicked his eyes to me you must be losing some of your charm anita he wants a piece of me instead of you the rifleman had the rifle aimed very steadily at the middle of jasons chest if it were silver ammo he was gone the rifleman said chuck chuck the one with the shotgun grabbed my left arm i opened my hand and let the knife fall before he raised my hand free of the leaves the rifle was too steady on jason for me to try stabbing chuck if i were lucky id get another chance if i wasnt i was going to come back and haunt jamil chucks hands were big and meaty thick fingers dug into my arm enough that if i lived id be bruised if you dont do exactly what i say your girlfriend gets it i wanted to say who writes your dialogue but i didnt the shotgun hovered about an inch from my cheek pretty clear what it was i could smell the oil in the gun barrels it had been cleaned recently nice to know of chuck took care of his weapon the rifleman did two things almost at once he stepped forward and reversed his gun the rifle butt smashed into jasons chin jason swayed but didnt fall the rifle stabbed at him again catching him high on one cheekbone blood spilled in a black line i must have moved because the shotgun was suddenly pressed against my cheek dont do it bitch i swallowed and spoke very carefully with the cool metal against my face do what anything he said he jerked my arm for emphasis grinding the shotgun into my cheek the rifleman said the doc said you could have broken my spine said i was lucky i am going to hurt you asshole then im going to kill you if you take it like a man ill let the girl go you wimp out and i do you both he smashed the rifle into jasons mouth blood and something heavier flew shining in the moonlight the beating began in earnest id seen people hurt on the judo mat id gone to martial arts tournaments id even been knocked out a couple of times for real by bad guys but id never seen a real beating not like this it was methodical thorough professional jason made no move to protect himself he never cried out he just knelt in the leaves and took it his face was covered in blood his eyes fluttered and i knew he was close to passing out i had to do something before he lost it through it all chuck had kept the shotgun pressed to my face so hard i knew id have the imprint of it on my skin he never wavered never gave me any chance to do anything i was beginning to think that chuck wasnt an amateur id given up on jamil or anyone else it was just the four of us in the darkened woods just the smack of the rifle hitting flesh the sound of the riflemans grunt of effort as he tried to make jason cry out jason finally slipped to his side he tried to keep his hands up but he couldnt he leaned on his arms in the leaves there was a fine visible trembling in his upper body he was fighting to stay upright beg me to stop the rifleman said beg me and maybe ill just shoot you beg me to stop or i will fucking beat you to death i believed him i think jason did too because he just shook his head he knew if he gave the man what he wanted he would finish it i felt something a prickling rush of warmth it was richard he was out there somewhere he opened the mark inside my body it flowed over my skin and across chucks hand what the fuck was that he asked i didnt move or say anything answer me bitch you trying some magic shit on me he pushed the shotgun in even harder if he kept it up he was just going to shove it through my cheek wasnt me i said he jerked me to my knees and the shotgun wasnt pressed into me anymore it was pointed out into the darkness for just a second it was one of those moments everything slowed down as if i had all the time in the world to draw the big knife down my back the knife cleared the sheath the shotgun and chuck turned back towards me i used the momentum of drawing the blade to swing it down and across i felt the tip catch chucks throat and knew it wasnt a killing blow something fell from the trees above us a shadow only a little more solid than the rest the shotguns barrels were like two dark tunnels pointed at my face i heard the rifle behind me but there was no time to look for jason there was just the gun pointed at my face the shadow that i didnt have time to look up and see the shadow fell between us the shadow had fur the shotgun exploded on the other side of that furred shadow the lycanthrope staggered backwards but didnt fall the shotgun exploded again both barrels before the echoes died i was scrambling through the leaves around the lycanthrope chucks eyes were wild showing white but he had the shotgun broken down across his left arm the two spent shells were gone and two more were being shoved into the breech he was good i shoved the blade just under his big shiny belt buckle a shudder ran through him but he slid the shells inside the breech i shoved the blade in until it grated on bone spine or pelvic girdle who knew he slapped the breech closed against his arm like he was skeet shooting i pulled the blade out of his body in a gout of blood he fell in slow motion straight down to his knees i lifted the newly loaded shotgun from his hands and he didnt fight me he knelt in the leaves and blinked out into the darkness he didnt seem to be seeing me now someone was screaming high and wild i glanced behind me and it was the rifleman he was sitting on the ground with one arm pointed up in the moonlight the arm was missing from the elbow down jason was lying very still in the leaves zane was sitting beside him with blood on the back of his yellow tshirt i stood and moved away from chuck he fell face forward into the leaves he was alive enough to put his face to one side but not to catch himself with his hands the werewolf that had saved me was lying on his back gasping for air there was a hole in his gut bigger than my two fists there was a bitter smell almost like vomit but ranker his intestines had been perforated the smell told me that the gut wound wouldnt kill him even if it was silver shot it wouldnt kill him right away the second wound was higher up in the deep broad chest his black fur was wet to the touch soaked with blood i could have shoved my hands in the dark wet hole but i couldnt see shit i couldnt see if the heart was damaged his breathing was wet sloppy almost strangled i could hear bubbling coming from the wound at least one lung had been compromised thats what i was hearing he was still struggling to breathe so his heart had to be working didnt it real werewolves look sort of like movie wolfmen but the movies never quite capture it he very definitely a he lay on his back gasping it was like watching a dream breathe except this dream was dying i thought it was one of vernes wolves that i didnt know him then i saw the remnants of a white tshirt caught on one shoulder like a bit of forgotten skin i pulled gently on the cloth and saw the smiley face on it i stared into yellow wolf eyes stared down at jamil hed done what a bodyguard is supposed to do hed taken my bullet i took off my shirt and packed it into the hole in his chest it took both my hands to cover the wound to try and make a seal so he could breathe again so he wouldnt bleed to death i whispered dont die on me damn it then i started screaming for help my hands were wet with blood the shirt had soaked up what blood it could but more was pouring out it was soaking into my jeans covering my forearms he stared at me with yellow eyes mouth open trying desperately to keep breathing longclawed hands made small convulsive movements in the leaves a prickling warmth spread under my hands his skin moved under my hands like warm furry water shapes appeared out of the darkness they looked like people but i knew it was a lie werewolves i was eyeball deep in werewolves he needs a doctor i said a darkhaired man with small round glasses knelt on the other side of jamil he opened a large brown satchel and pulled out a stethoscope i didnt question it most packs had a doctor never knew when youd need some confidential medical care he pushed my hands from the wound its healing it wasnt silver shot he shone a penlight into the wound what the hell is in there my shirt get it out before the skin heals around it the wound was healing my hand barely squeezed into the opening i got a handful of bloodsoaked shirt and pulled it came out in a long wet sloppy mess blood poured in a steady stream from one corner of the shirt i let the shirt fall to the leaves i would not be wearing it tonight i had a thought that i was wearing nothing above the waist except a black bra i didnt care is he going to live i asked hell live promise i said he stared at me and nodded stray moonlight made his glasses look like blank silver mirrors i promise i looked down into jamils wolfish face i stroked the fur across his forehead the fur was both rough and thick and soft ill be right back there were other people with jason and zane cherry with zane cradling him nathaniel was kneeling by them but his eyes were for me there was even a man leaning over the rifleman he was tying a belt off on the stump of his arm good i wanted him alive i had questions for him but not yet i knelt by jason he lay in the leaves on his side a woman was tending his wounds she was dressed in short shorts and a halter top dark hair tied back in a loose ponytail it wasnt until she turned her head that i realized it was lucy she held a penlight between her teeth and was searching jasons wounds with sure hands as if she knew what she was doing she answered my question before i asked hell heal but its going to take a couple of days which meant if jason had been human the beating would have been fatal she looked at me then our eyes met from inches away the makeup was a little less severe but the face was still pretty by moonlight i turned away from her first i didnt want to see what was in her eyes i just didnt want to know i knelt over jason started to touch his face then stopped because the blood was still wet on my hands he said something very soft i had to lean over him to hear it let me lick the blood he said i stared down at him eyes just a little wide youre not dying jason i said dont get cute verne said its fresh blood anita its pack blood it will help him heal i stared at him the local ulfric stood off to one side tall and straight and slender letting his medical personnel do their jobs i started to ask him where the hell he had been while we got cut up but zane made a sound zane seemed to be healing just fine from a rifle blast that would have cost a human his arm but it hurt and he made small pain sounds while the doctor worked on him the blood will help them heal verne said especially blood from someone as powerful as you are marianne feeds the pack sometimes lucy said it really will help him her face was neutral as she said it i looked down at jason his face was a mask of blood one eye was swollen completely shut he tried to smile at me but his lips were so badly swollen that the smile didnt work it was like part of his face just didnt work right now i touched those wounded lips with my fingertips brushed the fresh blood across his lower lip he rolled his lip under tasting the blood but the movement made him wince it hurt i laid two fingers against his lips and slid them gently into his mouth he tried to suck them but his mouth wouldnt work right he licked the blood swallowing almost convulsively i drew the fingers out and his hand came up to grab my wrist i let him guide two new fingers into his mouth richard spilled into the clearing going to his knees in the leaves shangda was at his back like a good bodyguard richards gaze met mine and just the glance opened me up to him a little more without jeanclaude to act as a buffer the marks between richard and i were stronger he knelt there his breathing coming in nearpainful gasps i could feel his chest rising and falling almost as if i were breathing for him i felt him look at the woman beside me i saw lucy for a second as he saw her i saw the rise of her breasts swelling under the halter top the line of her cheek half in shadow half in moonlight she raised her face to meet my eyes like she could feel me looking he still wants you i said she gave a very small smile but not as much as he wants you the marks between richard and i quieted i couldnt feel him breathe or what he was thinking he had cut me off afraid of what id see maybe what happened verne they were supposed to be safe in your lands richard said cherry answered jamil sent the three of us for help he she pointed to a shadowy figure on the other side of the clearing wouldnt let us pass into the lupanar he wouldnt take our request for aid to verne the man stepped forward so a patch of moonlight showed him tall muscular darkhaired pale they are not pack they have no right to demand passage verne was just suddenly there and the tall werewolf was on the ground i hadnt seen him move it was a speed that was dreamlike impossible but id almost seen it i am ulfric i decide who is worthy and who is not eric you are only freki third in the pack you have one more battle before you can even challenge me eric touched his hand to his face and came away with something dark and liquid i am not challenging you there was movement behind me in the leaves zane was crawling towards me the wounded arm held close to his chest with a makeshift sling i came back to help while cherry and nathaniel argued with their watchwolf i could feel an intensity to his gaze even in the dark the bloods going to dry before he gets to it all he stayed there in the leaves just out of touching distance his shirt had been ripped off one side of his slender chest it hung in rags to one shoulder he stared at me and even by scattered moonlight i could see the need not in his face but in his body the way he held himself he was asking for more than the healing of his body if he hadnt been there jason would be dead now even a lycanthrope has a limit to the damage he can take jason held the palm of my hand to his mouth licking with long lingering movements you need the other hand i asked it will be dried before he can use it lucy said i stared at her and hated her just a little hated her for having been in richards bed hated her for doing things with him that id never allowed myself to do the wereleopard doesnt need the blood richard said hell heal without it i just stared at him and held my hand out to zane he crawled to me on his knees and his good arm i stared at richard while zane took my fingers into his mouth he sucked on them like a hungry child licking the last bit of cake from a spoon hes mine richard mine as much as jason is i am nimirra and lupa richard stood i know what you are anita i shook my head you have no idea what i am the moment i said it i felt that warm growing presence munin rising inside of me like a pool of warm water spilling upward richards mark seemed to bring it on sometimes or maybe it was just the way he made me feel lust or anger or both i didnt fight the munin marianne had said if i stopped fighting that it would lose some of its control over me i wasnt even sure i could fight it off completely the best i could do was control it i let it flow over me down my arms into the two men jason had worked his way to my wrist tongue moving over the veins there hed been hesitating over the smell of fresher blood so very close to the surface now his good eye stared up at me wide a little scared i smiled down at him and i knew that it wasnt just my smile i was still here but i wasnt exactly alone rainas thoughts lay over mine like a veil i could see out but it colored everything i saw her body our body wanted things craved things that made me want to run screaming but if i were careful i could use her as she used me it was like walking up a flight of steep narrow stairs with a cup of scalding coffee filled to the brim careful oh so careful or it spills over the edge and you get burned the alternative to letting the munin have a little fun was what happened in the woods earlier i did not want another fullblown memory with jason and zane hanging onto me not tonight not ever jason couldnt handle it and neither could i i looked down at jason its all right jason enjoy the blood while it lasts i dont think youre going to get this offer twice he ran his tongue up my arm working hard against the skin like a cat washing its own fur zane had sucked my fingers clean and had raised my hand up in front of his face cradled in his good hand he was licking very slowly very thoroughly up my palm there was a sound behind us i turned to see the rifleman he was conscious and in some pain the doctor with the round glasses was about to give him a shot i called bring him to me the doctor and the werewolf with him looked across the clearing to verne and richard richard had moved across to the other ulfric they were discussing how everything had gone wrong they could discuss things all night i wanted answers dont look at them look at me and bring him to me rainas munin swelled outward and burst over me over jason over zane it spilled over lucy and brought a gasp from her throat everyone in the clearing got a taste a preview if you like it was getting harder to hold together harder to think they dragged the rifleman over to me i knew what i looked like i was wearing a black underwire bra that hid more than most bathing suits but it was still a bra i was still covered in blood jason and zane were licking blood from my naked skin it was strange and macabre and would work as a threat very nicely the doctor and the other werewolf threw the rifleman down in front of me jason and zane ignored him mouths on my skin zane slid his mouth along the edge of my skin teeth grating ever so gently on the skin his eyes slid to the rifleman and i knew we would put on a show for him i felt rainas munin like a warm glow she it whatever wanted to cover zanes mouth with ours and taste jamils blood wanted to rip the bandage off his shoulder and lick the wound with the thought came the knowledge that licking the wound would make it heal faster surely not the rifleman stared at me his eyes showing mostly white i could feel his breath smell his fear i could smell his fear like a miasma of sweat i could taste in his scent how injured he was i knew his skin would be cool to the touch from blood loss all this from a smell shit whats your name the question seemed too hard for him we can check your wallet whats your name he made an involuntary move to his back pocket with a hand he didnt have anymore if we get him to a hospital soon the doctor said they might be able to reattach the arm if he answers my questions truthfully you can take him to the hospital whats your name i asked terry terry fletcher okay terry who sent you to kill us i wanted to pay you back for making us look bad thats all nobody was supposed to die jason had cleaned my arm to the elbow i could feel the passage of his tongue like a cool line running over and over my skin hot where he still touched me cool where hed just been lies wont get you to a hospital terry lies wont save your arm who paid you to hurt us i asked hell kill me i looked at him and laughed the laugh was rich and thick enough to hold it rolled out of my mouth and it wasnt my laugh the sound raised the hairs on the back of my neck and made jason hesitate mouth pressed to my arm do you really think i wont kill you a breeze had finally come up hot and stale jasons mouth was cooler his mouth had healed enough to suck at my skin but there was an edge of swelling to the side of his mouth i wanted to kiss the wound lick it see if what i was being told was right could i really heal him i looked at terry tell me who paid you to hurt us tell me who sent you to kill us tell me everything i want to know and the good doctor will take you to a hospital where they may save your arm lie to me and your arm is just so much meat lie to me and you die tonight here in this clearing you think it over terry ive got all night i leaned over jason drawing his mouth away from my arm we kissed and i could taste jamils blood my skin the faint remnant of the perfume on my wrist and jasons blood his mouth had bled and i could taste that too but it wasnt bleeding now it was healing and i could make it heal faster it took everything i had not to press my mouth hard against his and force that warmth into him everything i had not to press jasons wounded body into the leaves and ride him i drew away from him eyes closed i opened my eyes and looked at the man jason moved to my stomach licking along the top of my jeans they were soaked in blood and wouldnt really dry while i was still wearing them zane curved around to my back licking along my spine there was no blood there and he had to stop at the spine sheath but it looked good for our captive audience talk to me terry once i start fucking one of them i really dont want to be interrupted i leaned towards him just a little and he flinched i drew away from jason and zane and crawled towards terry i made the movement everything it was supposed to be fluid dangerous sexual even now his eyes kept flicking to my breasts so white against the blackness of the lingerie even now he was still a man i felt rainas utter disdain of men all that sex and it was mostly hate how terribly odd she was enjoying terrorizing the man his wide eyes the quick breath the pounding of his heart i could hear it hell i could almost taste his skin on my tongue food he smelled like food who sent you terry i made it a whisper intimate for his ears only i reached out to him and when i trailed my finger down his cheek he whimpered i leaned forward and licked a quick line the length of his face you taste like food terry i could feel the others at our back vernes pack responding to rainas call to my call through richard i was more lupa than i wanted to be but now tonight it had possibilities they came from every side moving like shadows creeping closer nearer drawn by my desire and the mans terror he stared at them watched them coming closer with wide eyes he turned his head to watch them moving in i kissed his cheek while he wasnt looking and he screamed oh god please dont rainas laugh fell from my lips names terry names niley franklin niley he paid us to run you off said the cops wouldnt be a problem then he said kill you you especially he said kill that bitch before she queers my deal what deal i whispered frank niley was the employer of the muscleman milo hart i hadnt seen him since he was here for land speculation was he the buyer for greenes land terrys eyes flicked around to the waiting werewolves i dont know honest to god i dont know he paid us five hundred apiece to hurt you he made it five thousand for chuck and me to kill you five thousand apiece i asked he nodded it wasnt enough i said we didnt know you was a werewolf we didnt know what you were one of the shadowy throng was sniffing his leg terrys voice rose a little higher with every word his next i didnt know was almost a scream rainas munin was like a warm pulse behind my eyes i leaned into the man as if id kiss him he backed away but bumped into the good doctor my mouth hovered over the mans but it wasnt a kiss i wanted i stayed there hovering over his mouth frozen fighting not to lower my mouth to his neck fighting not to sink teeth into his throat and tear fighting not to draw first blood and let the pack feed i started crawling back from him as if i were the one that was afraid take him to the hospital you cant let him live zane said i promised him if he talked wed take him i caressed zanes face we stayed kneeling in the leaves close enough to embrace when i didnt remember moving that close take him take the arm and terry i said the man wasnt looking at me he was staring at the waiting wolves terry i said again i was still caressing zane one hand buried in his short white hair the man looked at me eyes flicking back and forth madly as if he were trying to keep all of us in sight at once what what do you want you said i could go to the hospital if you tell niley about tonight about what i am and what happened ill kill you i lowered zanes face until i planted a gentle kiss on his forehead i wont tell i wont tell anyone nileyd kill me if he knew i gave him up hed fucking kill me good i said i cradled zane against me he began to lick down my neck he passed over my shoulder licking a small line down my collarbone he went lower and i pushed him away rough enough that he fell on his wounded shoulder the world was narrowing down i was losing the fight with raina get him out of here now i felt like i was going blind i could see but it was all different i was fighting her and she didnt like it shed asked for violence and id refused shed asked for sex and id refused even dead she was a hard lady to say no to i covered my eyes with my hands i heard someone moving towards me dont touch me its marianne child tell me whats happening i lowered my hands until i could see marianne she was still in the white dress with her long pale hair you never met raina did you no child i reached for her hand and it was just a hand there was no memory attached to it no horror that the munin could share help me she gripped my hand with both of hers its too late to force the munin out it must be made to want to leave i shook my head she wont leave shes left you before i shook my head harder until my hair slapped my face you dont know what she wants you dont understand what she wants i cant i wont richard was there he started to touch my shoulder and i fell back into the leaves one hand raised as if to ward off a blow i did not want to know what raina had done with him or to him that was one image i did not need whats wrong the munin will not leave until anita does something it wants you knew raina i said tell her the kind of thing raina enjoyed it was rising inside me i couldnt stop it it rose higher and higher until the power spilled out of my mouth in a shriek he started to touch me and i crawled away from him no no no no marianne caught me held me against her she smelled like ivory soap and lilacs i knew i could have broken her hold but i didnt want to i wanted to be held i wanted help i needed help she smoothed my hair rocking me like i was a child anita you must give in to the munin in part youve done it before richard has discussed past events with me when the munin leaves you this time we will work together to make sure this does not happen again i raised up enough to see her face can you really stop this i can teach you how to stop it i stared into her pale eyes for a space of heartbeats i could hear the strange click of her artificial heart valve the munin was hinting that food would do as well as sex not as well but it would do i pushed gently away from marianne youre just food to her i crawled back from her slowly marianne just watched me kneeling in the leaves in her white dress she was the only one in the clearing that was more than a shadow all that whiteness caught the moonlight and glimmered she looked like a target i stood my breath coming in ragged gasps i could taste my heart in my throat like a ball that i could have touched and played with i looked around the clearing desperate for a way out something that raina would be content with and i could live with zane was staring at me raina wanted him but what she wanted had very little to do with sex i went to him he knelt in the leaves staring up at me with large eyes gone silver with moonlight i fell to my knees in front of him and ripped the sling off his shoulder he made a small grunt of pain and raina liked it the problem with doing something to get the munin out was that the munin had to be in control enough for me to be willing to do what it wanted giving her more control seemed like a bad idea but what she wanted was to plant our mouth over the wound in his shoulder and i couldnt do it sober there wasnt enough raina in me yet to put my tongue in an open wound i crawled away from zane and found jason i stared at him he was almost a safety zone for me when the munin had me the munin liked him and i wasnt afraid of him i went to him kneeling on all fours in the leaves but knew if i touched him and i was still fighting the munin wed get another rush of horror if i went to him it had to be for real i had to be willing to give in at least a little his mouth was almost completely healed the swelling in his eye was better the blood or the munin it really was working he was healing i knew the munin could be used for healing on lycanthropes id done it once before but not like this that was back when raina first made an appearance and i hadnt realized how much trouble i was in now i knew and i was scared and hated it raina thought that was hilarious that dead she scared me more than she had when she was alive i could feel her pleasure like a line of warmth through my body the echo of her laughter chased through my mind and made gooseflesh on my arms being possessed by anyone would have scared me being possessed by a sociopathic nymphomaniac sadomasochist that i had killed personally was too frightening and too ironic for words jason lay back in the leaves i was very careful not to touch him as i crawled over his body on all fours i knelt there on hands and knees and stared down at him legs and arms wide so that we didnt accidentally touch his voice came hoarse rough as if something in his throat were still hurting you have a plan if i dont fight the munin marianne says no memories just power he stared up at me you going to kiss it and make it all better i nodded my hair sliding over his face all better i leaned my face towards his in a sort of pushup motion our lips brushed in a trembling line and what not an hour before had been chaste and a little uncomfortable was suddenly changed i broke the kiss and held my body off of his with fingertips and toes my body above his i could feel the trembling energy of his aura underneath me pushing against the power of my aura the power that was munin i stayed above him not touching staring into his face when we kissed again the power poured from my mouth into his in a warm breath that burned through our bodies i let my body drop against his in an abrupt violent movement that brought a cry of pain from him the sound fell into my mouth and was swallowed in a wave of heat and power i poured the munin into jason i poured me into him i poured in through his mouth down through my pores everywhere that skin touched skin i seeped into him i felt as if i were draining away into his body he behaved himself at first hands at his sides but the power rode us both his arms locked behind my back his mouth searched mine as if he were climbing inside i straddled his body and felt him hard and ready even through our jeans he rolled me over suddenly so that he was on top my body did nothing to protect itself i locked my legs around his waist and felt him pumping against me each thrust made things low in my abdomen jerk and tighten i swam upward through the power and started pushing at his chest we were not doing this again i was not doing this off get off my voice was strangled hoarse i swallowed the munin back enough to struggle inside and out jason froze over me then collapsed on top of me his heart beat frantically against my chest his breathing was rushed he swallowed and managed to say if i said it was too late to stop would you believe me i started crawling out from under him no i said he rolled onto his back freeing me to stand the bruises were gone his face stared up at me as clean and innocent as it started if i could only get this shit to work without the sex my turn zane asked i turned and he was kneeling in the leaves hed stripped off the remains of his shirt i never really thought of zane as a guy not like that but now he was kneeling in a splash of moonlight so that the shadows and light showed the muscles in his chest and stomach his arms were lost in darkness his face was a pattern of strong clean flesh gleaming pale one half caught in shadows like pieces of darkness his nipple ring glinted silver like a wink of an eye an invitation and that was all it took i stood in front of him staring down and did what the munin wanted i grabbed his wounded arm and jerked it upward forcing the shoulder to its fullest extension he cried out in pain the skin had closed over the wound but it was there below the surface i pressed my mouth to the wound and felt the muscles torn the bone already knitting broken i bit him sinking teeth in enough to leave a mark and blew power into his skin i healed it and fought raina she wanted to take a chunk out of his skin a sort of joke heal him and hurt him at the same time i pushed away from him before i could give in i stumbled to my feet and realized that each time i used it the power was growing it was filling me like another person something growing inside of me pushing at my skin i staggered to jamil and fell beside him to my knees hed changed back to human form which meant he had been very hurt i stared down at his nude body and fought with raina not to touch him not to do what she wanted or not to do everything she wanted i ran my hands over jamils chest until i touched the wound the skin was closed but soft i knew i could force my fingers inside him i knew i could reach in and snatch his heart instead i lowered my face to his chest and kissed the wound gently softly i closed my eyes and took in the scent of him the feel of his soft skin healing skin was always so soft like a babys flesh tender and smooth i put my hands over the wound and thrust that warm building power into him like a sword jamils eyes flew wide and his spine bowed he tried to scream and i stole it with a kiss i rode his body straddling not his groin but the second lower wound i drew back from his lips and forced my hands low on his body i healed him i felt it leave my body in a warm rush my hands slid lower i brushed him and he was beginning to grow hard i threw myself off of him shed healed him raina felt somebody owed her something for the healing i fought it until i fell back into the leaves and screamed my body writhed and it was like my left side wasnt talking to my right like something was breaking inside me that large warm presence that second body was trying to rise to the surface trying to break the surface rainas beast was trying to come out trying to make me lupa in truth but my body couldnt hold it couldnt give it a home i was human and no matter how much power you shoved into me that didnt change hands held me down richards voice as if from a great height whats happening to her shes fighting the munin it was mariannes voice i heard her voice close to my face but i couldnt see her it was like the world was vanishing into the dark dont fight anita whatever happens tonight tomorrow i can help you give in and live or the munin will kill you anita please please richard again she will kill you if she can she will kill you from the grave itself anita stop fighting embrace it or it will destroy you i screamed no then suddenly i could see again i stared up into the treelined darkness there was a sparkle of moonlight through the leaves it seemed as bright as sunlight only softer i lay very still blinking up at them all richard had my shoulders pinned verne had my legs shangda had my right arm lucy had my left id been having convulsions i remembered that marianne was kneeling near my face keeping my face still between her hands anita she made it a question im here my voice was quiet but clear i felt light and empty but not alone i wasnt fooled the munin hadnt left it wasnt finished is the munin gone richard asked marianne shook her head its still here it made me think better of her that she wasnt fooled do we let her up verne asked anita marianne asked me let me up they let me go slowly as if almost afraid afraid of me or for me i wasnt sure which they moved away from me only richard stayed kneeling i leaned my back against him and let him hold me in his arms i closed my eyes and let him take it all away for just an instant id never had anyones arms feel as safe as his no ones my leg brushed something in the leaves i pulled away from him enough to find my knife i sheathed it from across the small clearing jason said heres the other one he held it up by the blade i went to him taking the blade from his hand i could feel all of them watching me like i was something new and uncertain that had just appeared i sheathed the second blade jason grinned up at me dont take this wrong anita but someday id like to do that for real why not tonight i said jason stared up at me what did you say i walked back across the clearing i felt their eyes following me as i moved i smelled of blood and power and flesh and there was nothing better than that for attracting werewolves richard stood there in his jeans and tshirt his hair foamed around his shoulders a soft rich brown in the moonlight i grabbed a fistful of his tshirt and forced his face low enough for me to kiss the kiss was long and full and he tasted all the blood id had every skin id touched i pulled his shirt out of his pants in a long motion running my hands across his bare stomach across the smooth hardness of his chest he grabbed my arms and pulled my hands away whats wrong with you is she not good enough for you either it was lucy striding towards us her impressive breasts strained against the white material of her halter top either she had very large nipples or she was cold because the outline of her nipples was clear even in this dim light i stared up at richard id been sleeping with jeanclaude hed been sleeping with lucy and mira mustnt forget mira it was fair that he had other lovers really but i hated it and hated me for minding hated me for wanting him hated me for being with jeanclaude and not being happy with it hated me for knowing that even if id been with richard instead id have been missing jeanclaude i was fucked no matter what i did i knew as i stared at her that the hands that held my arms with such tender strength had cupped those large round breasts i knew that shed touched him all of him that shed held him naked inside her and i knew jealousy so strong that the only word for it was hate i pulled away from richard and unsheathed one of the knives shangda moved forward as if to step between us but richard stopped him and made him step back he just stared at shangda until he stepped out of reach but you could tell from his face that he was really unhappy about it i didnt blame him richard turned back to me stared at me but made no move to protect himself i dont know if he didnt believe id hurt him or was sure i couldnt i was sure i could my hand was already on the downward stroke before i could stop myself i sliced through his shirt not deep but the wound bled he winced eyes so lost hurt fuck him shangda was there and it was richard who struggled with him richard who kept him from grabbing me disarming me hurting me i put the tip of the blade against my chest and drew downward over my heart the pain was sharp and immediate but it was shallow i wasnt hurt the blood trickled down between my breasts like tickling fingers the blood was very dark against the whiteness of my skin richard started towards me and verne caught him its her choice verne said its not her its raina richard said but in a way he was wrong raina had finally found something that called to both of us we both wanted him to suffer we both felt betrayed and neither of us had a right to it wed both betrayed him in our own ways words that i didnt know spilled from my lips your heart to mine mine to yours lupa to your ulfric but not to your bed nor you to mine i threw the knife into the ground so it stuck thrumming i could feel the blade in the earth as if id disturbed some large sleeping beast the power burst over me from the ground from me and something let loose in a liquid rush inside me i was dizzy and on my knees without meaning to fall i stared up at richard still struggling and said help me but it was too late i felt the munin blow outward like a wind and every man it touched caught the scent i could almost feel their bodies react i knew what raina had done and if it were to be her last night in the drivers seat she couldnt have chosen better short of killing me it was the perfect revenge i fell to my knees fighting not to finish the ritual but i could feel them in the dark eager i was giving off scent and it wasnt just the blood the words were pulled from my throat as if by a hand each word squeezed out until it hurt to speak claim me again if you can my ulfric i stared up at him and saw the look on his face it was wild and part of me was pleased god help me my own jealousy had given her the keys to me i stared around at the shapes in the dark i could feel them like a growing tension in the air it was like the air before a storm so heavy it was hard to breathe through the growing power you could feel the lightning growing in the air coming closer but this storm was waiting for me waiting for me to move marianne was beside me get up she said i struggled to my feet and she helped me now run she said i stared at her what are you talking about youve declared yourself frejya now run before they lose patience and take you here i knew what she meant but i had to have her say it out loud take me if the munin does not come to the front it will be rape but it will still happen now go she pushed me towards the dark i stumbled and stared around the clearing one last time richards face was tormented horrified shangda was at richards shoulder and he was angry angry with me jasons face was as neutral as id ever seen it as if afraid to show me what he was feeling i caught rolands face too id met him an hour or two before but his face wasnt neutral his face was hungry anticipatory and i knew that theyd do it that someone somewhere would have me unless i killed them two silver blades and an entire pack of werewolves not good odds and richard would do everything he could to save me everything shangda i said the tall bodyguard stared at me i could feel the weight of his gaze in the moonlit dark richards life means more to me than my own safety shangda dont let him die i said he stared at me then gave one sharp nod marianne grabbed my arm and said go i went i flung myself into the trees into the dark beyond and ran i ran as if i could see in the dark flinging myself into halfperceived openings trusting to the forest the way you trust to water knowing it will part before you without question i gave myself over to the night woods like id learned to do as a girl you dont run in the dark in the forest with your eyes you run with the same part of your brain that makes the back of your neck prickle i ran and leaped and dodged and knew it wouldnt be enough a howl cut the night in a long mournful line there were growls and a sharp whimper cut so short i knew someone was hurt maybe dead would they really kill each other for the privilege real wolves didnt do this shit only people could take a nice sane animal and screw it up this badly i slipped going over a log that was bigger around than a small car i fell sprawling i lay there for a moment on the ground catching my breath and i didnt have the faintest idea what to do i didnt so much hear the werewolves as feel them in the ground under my hands i knew they were out there in a way i hadnt before the munin invaded i pressed myself against the huge log and my hands found an opening it was partially hollow i crawled into the black opening hand with knife in front of me half expecting to meet a raccoon or snake but there was nothing but the feel of the cool rotted wood under my bare stomach and the weight of the great fallen tree above me i knew theyd find me that wasnt the point it would take them a little time to get me out of the hole i was trying to buy time i wasnt even sure time for what i needed a plan and i didnt have one the munin thought that richard might save us that thought scared me all on its own richard was sort of squeamish when it came to killing the thought that he might get himself killed trying to save me was almost worse than me getting caught i would probably survive being raped i wasnt at all sure id survive richards death of course having never been raped maybe i was jumping to conclusions maybe i wouldnt survive i heard them moving around the log more than one more than two three four shit claws ripped at the rotted log and i screamed one of those short yips that is almost exclusively a girl sound i heard one of them rolling around on the ground i felt the rush of energy as he shifted into wolf form and just like that he was out of the running if you lost human form before the lupa you were chasing you couldnt mate with her you went furry you lost the rules about going frejya had never been written for a human who had no other shape wed lose the lesser wolves to their beasts this close to full moon with sex and violence in the air wed maybe lose half a dozen maybe a dozen to their beasts fifty wolves in vernes pack altogether a dozen helped something heavy hit the side of the log i managed not to scream at least that was an improvement i heard the sounds of scuffling at least two of them were fighting but i was almost sure there was a third the fighting stopped and there was a loud crack as if something brittle and wet had broken the silence was so heavy my heartbeat was thunderous the log moved i froze as if just holding very still would save me the end of the log near my feet lifted into the air the cavity that had hidden me kept me trapped as that one end raised slowly into the air the fallen tree was at least six feet around i didnt know how much it weighed but it was heavy a tall bearded man was lifting it he pushed it overhead palms flat against the wood he smiled down at me his teeth white against the beard his voice was more growl than words come out little one little one i crept very carefully out from under the huge log it was a crushing weight a fine trembling ran through his body all the way to his feet it was not effortless to hold the fallen giant up i stayed crouched just beside his leg hed have to put the log down before he could touch me his smile widened as if not moving away from him was a good sign for him i shoved the knife into his belly and rolled away from him tearing the blade along the meat of his stomach as i moved he looked surprised as he fell to his knees and the tree fell on top of him it pinned him to the ground and i didnt wait to see if he could get out from under it there were two bodies on the ground one mans skull was smashed open and thicker things than blood licked onto the ground in the dark everything was grey and black the second guy might have had a pulse but i didnt check i ran i felt the rushing of air and looked in time to see a blur of motion a man hit me from the side in a flying tackle i was on my back with him on top of me one arm pinned between us i had a second to recognize roland then i slashed at him with the knife he jerked back too fast to see and his fist was suddenly connecting with my chin i didnt pass out but my body went limp the knife fell from my fingers and i couldnt stop it part of me was screaming silently the other part was saying oh what pretty trees when i could move again my jeans were halfway down my thighs the only thing that kept me that much dressed was the jeans were tight and wet with blood wet jeans peel slowly roland dont do this he kept pulling on my jeans like i hadnt said anything i didnt want him to hit me again if i passed out it was all over he was having trouble getting my jeans over my nikes because the jeans wont go over my nikes i raised up on my elbows and tried to be friendly reasonable and wondered where the hell my knife was roland roland the shoes have to come off first maybe if i were helpful id get brownie points at least maybe i could stall where was richard roland wrapped my jeans in one hand effectively trapping my feet why help me he said his voice was still too deep for his slender chest his words still carefully spoken that nervous energy still crawled along his skin vibrating like summer heat on a road he was no different but everything else had changed maybe i just dont want you to hit me again i said i dont want to be stabbed either he said fair enough we stayed that way staring at each other me propped on my elbows him kneeling at my feet it was almost as if he didnt know what to do next i think he hadnt expected me to be calm crying anger maybe even eagerness he was ready for but i gave him nothing i was friendly helpful as if hed asked me directions to a restaurant i knew i even felt calm strangely it had a faintly surrealistic air as if it wasnt really happening if he touched me it was going to seem all too real but as long as he stayed where he was i was fine he pinned my jeans with his knee and started taking off his shirt the shirt was okay i was fine with that he had a nice chest pleasant to look at as long as his pants stayed on i was fine where the hell was richard he undid the snap to his pants and my nerves just werent that good i didnt want to try and contact richard in case he was fighting using the marks was distracting but i wanted some help i was betting that roland didnt wear underwear i won my bet i sent out a call to richard and he was fighting i saw through his eyes for one dizzying second he was fighting eric great i broke contact as quickly as i could but i knew it cost him a second of concentration i was on my own roland pushed his jeans to his knees and seemed to think that was sufficient because he started to crawl up my legs oh this was romantic it wasnt richard who came to the rescue it was a man i didnt know he tackled roland much as roland had tackled me they rolled off me and down a small incline into a hollow i started pulling my pants up as fast as i could there was a movement behind me and i turned pants just above my knees and no weapon in sight it was zane one arm held tight to his chest nathaniel came out of the dark behind him nathaniel held out his one good hand to me hurry i hurried nathaniel took my hand and pulled me into the trees he ran like liquid spilling through every crack and shadow i tried to stay behind him trusting that if his body could go through the openings so could mine i jumped when he jumped weaved when he weaved even if i couldnt see the obstacle his night vision was better than mine and i didnt question it i had a sense of zane behind us following like smoke in our wake a chorus of howls broke out to our right nathaniel pulled me faster through the trees until i fell headlong and a jagged branch sliced my cheek open it missed my eye by a wish shit nathaniel theyre coming he said i know i touched my hand to my cheek and came away with blood fuck i wont let them take you nathaniel said i stared up at him he was only three inches taller than i was he couldnt have outweighed me by thirty pounds it was muscle but he was small size counts if everyone youre fighting can lift large trees theyll kill you nathaniel he didnt look at me just kept staring out into the dark as if he could hear things i couldnt zane leaned against a tree looking at me his good hand was rubbing his bound arm like it hurt i bet it did if they take you youll fight zane said theyll kill you he closed his eyes this is one time when you cant protect yourself but maybe we can youll both die i said zane shrugged with his one good shoulder casual like it didnt matter the thought came that it would all be over if i had sex it would end then and only then raina came back in full force spilling through me she wanted nathaniel and that she could not have not with my body fucking nathaniel would be like child molesting i wouldnt do it zane zane would do raina had always been fickle i got a sudden visual so strong it made me blush was there anyone that raina hadnt slept with i wasnt going to do either of them no way then theyll die i wasnt sure if it was my thought or the munin either way we were right jason limped into sight i knew him just by the shape of his shoulders and his hair either i hadnt healed him completely or hed been in a fight maybe both id broken contact before i finished the munin was saving the deeper healing for sex for her it was the toll to be paid for services rendered no payment no healing like a drug dealer giving just a taste jason gave me a very strange smile as he entered the trees near nathaniel and zane he slid down until he was sitting with his back against a small tree trunk he let out a sigh we all looked at him a scream tore our gaze back to the woods out there close they were fighting another howl rode the still hot air the sound was close enough to make my scalp prickle the trees we had stopped at were at the bottom of a hill it was familiar are the cabins just up there yes zane said if you go to the cabins theyll follow jason said cant have the tourists seeing it fuck that i said some of them wont follow to the cabins because of the tourists i say we go and board ourselves in it wont end until someone wins jason said he sounded tired or maybe discouraged and up there are two vampires who are on my side i started up the hill nathaniel and zane followed at my heels jason just sat there we were a quarter of the way up the hill before he pushed to his feet to follow when all this shit was over id ask what was wrong right now there was no time figures appeared through the trees zane gave a little push to my back run he said ill delay them nathaniel turned with him facing down into the dark and the danger no zane said you go with her nathaniel he looked at me im learning what it means to be an alpha nathaniel doesnt know how to fight nathaniel looked from one to the other of us he finally settled on me what do you want me to do i thought about that for a second studying zanes socareful face id say come with me but im not leaving zane behind i reached back and touched zanes hand i wont leave you to die damn it anita if youre not here they wont kill us theyll just hurt us and go after you zane said im sort of bait i said yes dont die on me okay ill do my best zane said i squeezed his hand dont do your best just dont die you either i said to jason he shook his head i have to stay with you richards orders why he shook his head and glanced back at the dark figures moving through the trees closer always closer later now we move he had a point we moved and left zane alone in the dark with at least five figures gliding through the trees they put on a burst of speed as we neared the crest of the hill i cleared the hill on my knees and we were at a flatout run across the gravel parking lot i thought damian he opened the door as if id spoken he was standing there with a surprised look on his face it isnt often you see a thousandyearold vampire shocked i had a moment to think how we must look me bloody in just the black bra and bloodsoaked jeans jason running with a noticeable limp nathaniel running full out behind us we cleared the doorway damian shut the door behind us he locked it without being told smart vampire what he started to say block the windows and door i said asher grabbed the heavy wooden desk like it weighed nothing and shoved it over the window do we have nails or am i forced to hold it in place something struck the window shattering glass around the edges of the desk like glittering rain asher was staggered backwards damian joined him and they shoved the desk against the window the door shuddered as something heavy threw itself against it hes not going to make it in time jason said nathaniel stood in the center of the room like he was lost what now the door shuddered again jason went to the door leaning against it nathaniel help me nathaniel joined him putting his shoulder against the quaking wood hands pushed past the edge of the table asher took one hand off the table to break the wrist like match wood there was a scream and the hand pulled back he spoke as if he wasnt using almost all his strength to hold the table against the broken window may one ask why the local werewolf pack is trying to kill us theyre not trying to kill us jason said theyre trying to fuck her he leaned his entire back against the door whatever was at the door left abruptly and jason almost fell against the suddenly quiet door the window cleared too it was suddenly terribly quiet too quiet as the old saying goes what is going on damian said later jason said his eyes looked almost wild ask me why richard told me to stay with you i stared at him okay why did richard tell you to stay with me this ends when you have sex with any of the lukoi i stared at him harder come again if it looks like someone else will get there first he told me to do it do it i said i walked around to the nightstand you mean do me jason had the grace to look down he nodded i opened the drawer and took out the firestar i tucked it down the front of my jeans i took the browning out next and clicked off the safety nothing personal jason but ive got a different plan i didnt say i liked the plan jason said i may joke about it and i would love to be with you but jeanclaude is my master too hed kill me i glanced at asher he gave a very small nod probably and if you let someone else get to me because you were squeamish i let it be a question richard doesnt kill easily jason said but if i let someone rape you for that hed make an exception i waggled the gun in the air barrel pointed at the ceiling lucky for you im armed jason nodded glass broke in the bathroom shit wed been stupid stay at the doors i said i kicked the bathroom door in already sighting down my arm i had a glimpse of a man trying to squeeze a large body through the small window i hit the wildly swinging door with one hip and fired into the mass of the man he screamed and fell back through the opening i yelled ive got this window covered sounds of fighting came from outside the cabin screams turned into growls i felt the rising energy and knew that people were losing human form i could feel them slipping away slinking through the trees i could almost smell the musk of their fur the munin swam back up so suddenly and so purely that i staggered against the door that i was using to steady my aim i turned away from the window to stare across the room at jason raina was fine with that she didnt care who if it caused jeanclaude distress or cost jason his life that was dandy i slid down the door slowly eyes closed the flat of the gun barrel pressed to my forehead someone else needs to do this window i said i hoped id spoken aloud i was having trouble telling jason must have filled them in because no one asked what was wrong i felt damian brush my legs as he went into the bathroom the feel of his passing caused things low in my stomach to clench i glanced up at him and he was frozen in the doorway as if hed felt my bodys reaction he stared down at me with his cat green eyes and i knew as surely as i knew anything that if i told him to come to me he would have done it what i didnt know for sure was why damian asher said the window damian stayed where he was staring down at me i cant order him to watch the window anita asher said i went to my knees free hand sliding up damians pants leg i slid my hand up his thigh and shook my head i grabbed a handful of his green silk shirt and pulled him down to me he stayed on the balls of his feet knees on either side of my body i went to my knees and kissed him i slid my tongue between the delicate points of his fangs id perfected the art of french kissing a vampire practice practice he tried not to kiss me back he drew back enough to whisper you taste like blood other peoples blood then he locked his mouth to mine like he would breathe me into himself his long pale hands cupped my face slid behind my head in the warmth of my hair i pressed my body against him the firestar was still in front of my pants the gun pressed into his groin i ground it into him until he made a small pain sound the browning was lost on the floor there was a sound at the bathroom window i drew back from the kiss and damian began to run his lips down my neck i saw the man crawling through the window as if down a long crystalline tunnel i tugged the firestar from my pants and pointed it i sighted at the center of his forehead his eyes widened and he suddenly spilled backwards into the night not so far gone that he didnt want to live the question was how far gone was i damians mouth hovered over the big pulse in my throat his tongue curled over it caressing he was asking for permission but it wasnt that kind of blood i wanted to donate tonight raina had no interest in just opening a vein i wrapped my free hand in his long bloodred hair and jerked his face up to me dont bleed me fuck me asher yelled jeanclaude will kill him i dont care the moment i heard myself say it i swam back up it was like pushing aside a wet curtain that clung to my face suffocating trying to mold itself to my body and keep me drown me i crawled away from damian into the room i said watch the damn window damian and stay away from me he stood in the doorway uncertain asher said you heard your mistress do as youre told i heard him walk into the bathroom heard his boots crunch on the broken glass i stayed on all fours my head hanging down my breath coming in gasps the firestar was still gripped in one hand i squeezed it tight until my hand ached i ground the feel of the gun butt into my skin this was real this was real raina was dead she was just another kind of ghost damn it i heard someone crawling towards me i raised my head to find nathaniel staring at me with lilac eyes i screamed and scrambled back from him he was a victim and raina liked victims i held my hand out to him as if to ward off a blow i ended with my back against the bed gun squeezed in both hands rocking back and fourth nathaniel crawled towards me he crawled like he had muscles in places he shouldnt have in a graceful roll that was almost snakelike as if his spine had too many parts he put his face so close to mine that when he spoke i could feel his breath on my face im yours anita you are my nimirra my queen he was very careful not to touch me he stayed that last fraction of an inch away so that it was my decision but it wasnt mine i tried to tell him to get away from me but my voice wouldnt work i couldnt speak i couldnt move all i could do was hold onto that last ragged edge of control and not move my mouth that last space i fought with all i had left not to kiss nathaniel because whoever i fell on next was it the munin was wearing me down even my selfcontrol wasnt limitless i didnt want it to be nathaniel that helped me hold on there was a knock at the door it was so unexpected that i screamed the scream pushed nathaniel back to his knees a little farther out of reach but still too close asher asked do you open it i shook my head not as a no but i couldnt say i couldnt think i was fighting too hard to not throw my clothes off and fuck something in the room that was taking about all my concentration maybe asher figured that out for himself because he said who is it very civilized the answer shocked us all i think its richard jason was on his feet opening the door before anyone could tell him to do it the outer surface of the door was clawed and broken richard stood there in the doorway his tshirt was in rags still clinging to his shoulders but so ripped apart that you could see the bloody wounds in his tanned skin he walked through the door a little unsteadily zane and shangda came behind him zane looked unhurt but shangdas face had been opened from forehead to chin his eye sat in a mask of blood he closed the door and looked at me with cool eyes i was glad to see all of them but i couldnt move if i moved it was over i was putting everything i had into just staying where i was if i moved anything the control was gone a tear squeezed out of one eye and fell in a hard hot line down my cheek i stared up at richard and wanted to say so many things and couldnt say any of them words would break me into a million glittering pieces richard walked to me he stood over me staring down i didnt look up he didnt so much kneel as collapse to his knees in front of me i put out a hand to steady him and the munin spilled across my skin like a flame the firestar fell to the floor with a thunk i grabbed a handful of the torn tshirt balled it into both my fists and pulled him those last few inches into a kiss his lips were dry i licked his mouth running my tongue over his lips until they were like wet rubbed velvet to kiss i slid my hand inside one of the tears to trace the cut id made over his heart his breath came out in a sharp hiss as if it hurt he grabbed my wrist i slid my other hand inside the tear and found another wound to probe he grabbed both my wrists in his hands you forget how large richard is he doesnt seem intimidating physically but he could have held both my wrists in one hand he forced my arms back at my sides i tried to pull my hands free and his grip tightened he leaned over me but not for a kiss he licked the edge of the knife wound on my chest i gasped half in pain half in pleasure he ran his mouth down the wound until he came to the soft upper part of my breast he bit gently into my flesh not hard enough to leave a mark just hard enough that i felt his teeth i made a small moan he raised his face to look at me he let go of my wrists and put a hand on either side of my face he trapped my face between the strength of his hands and forced me to stare into the perfect chocolate brown of his eyes anita can you hear me i tried to move forward for a kiss but his hands held me trapped my hands found his chest explored the smooth flesh the torn wounds i tried to press my body forward against his but his hands held my face and i couldnt go closer anita anita talk to me are you in there the grip on my face was almost painful i didnt push the munin aside it fell back i felt raina leave me enough for me to answer im here it was a whisper do you want this he asked i started to cry huge silent tears slid down my face do you want me now like this he shook my face between his hands as if he could shake me back to myself i slid my hands over his cupping him against me while i cried did i want him yes it was a whisper now like this the question was too hard for me i curled my fingers against his hands trying to move them from my face i started tugging at his hands kiss me please kiss me please richard please i was crying again and couldnt have said why he leaned into me hands still on either side of my face he kissed me his lips pressed against mine like heat his tongue parted my lips and i tried again to move forward but his hands held me he leaned into me pressing his mouth against mine he kissed me like he was tasting me as if hed reach into my mouth with his tongue and his lips and pull me inside out i shuddered in his hands from the feel of his mouth eyes closed my hands limp at my sides letting him do it all his hands slid very slowly from my face he never stopped kissing me as his fingertips slid down my bare shoulders his hands hesitated over the shoulder straps for the spine sheath as if he didnt know what to do with it i opened my eyes started to lift my hands up to help him he grabbed my hands and held them down at my sides ill figure it out he said softly i stared up at him i could barely breathe around the need i wanted his naked skin pressed against mine i grabbed one of the tears in the tshirt and ripped it wider off he shook his head not yet i wanted to fall on him like a ravening wolf and he was so controlled i could feel his need feel his need as great as my own and yet he could kneel there so close so very close everyone out richard demanded id forgotten that we still had an audience i hid my forehead against richards chest my hands slid behind his back trying to press myself against him asher said what of the other wolves i made a pact with verne its over except for this i stared past richards broad shoulder into ashers scarred face his face was carefully blank empty unreadable i had a thought what was he hiding but most of my thoughts were the scent of richards skin the smell of fresh blood the clinging scent of earth and pine and leaves the light salty dew of sweat on his body there was no room for regrets there was only the warmth of his body pressed against mine if you take her like this it will be very like rape asher said im going to try very hard for it not to be richard said asher gave a small sound that might have been a laugh bonheur he said and left good luck hed said hed said it in french and it made me think of jeanclaude so close to the warmth of richards body i could feel him hard and ready and i thought of jeanclaude i wanted to wrap myself in richard i wanted to pull him around me like a blanket but what would my other lover say that thought pushed the munin away better than anything else had months in jeanclaudes bed and i still wanted richard i wanted richard not raina not munin i wanted him i wanted him so badly i couldnt think about anything but the feel of him in my arms but it wasnt fair not like this not with raina riding me she poured over me like a warm bath this was her price this that she be here with us for the first time that even this would always be part hers my skin ached to be touched my body hurt with a need id never known when the door closed behind them richard pulled me away from his body he held me away from him with his hands on my forearms while i struggled to get closer i needed him needed him i reached for him crying richard please please he spun me around until i fell against the foot of the bed he put a hand in the middle of my back keeping me turned away from him he slipped the shoulder straps of the spine sheath off sliding them down my arms he threw the sheath across the room to bang into the wall then he leaned over me a hand on either side of the bed he leaned his face over until his hair brushed my face he molded his body against mine arms wrapping my arms against my chest he held me with his body and his arms pressing us so close i could feel his heart beating against my back he whispered against my cheek if at any time you want to stop say so and its over ill go i made a small sound very like a whimper and said fuck me richard fuck me please a shudder ran through his body from toes to head and his breath fell out in a long sigh he pulled back enough to undo the back of my bra then he slid it slowly off my shoulders he used the bra straps to lower my arms to my sides again he pushed the bra off my arms and it fell to the floor his hands slid over my waist his hands felt hot he slid upward slowly so slowly that i wanted to cry out his hands spilled over my breasts cupping them kneading them his fingers rolled my nipples and i did cry out he turned me to face him almost throwing me against the bed his arms locked under my buttocks and he lifted me still on his knees his mouth found my breasts his tongue flicked across my nipple fast quick wet i leaned into him and his mouth slid over my breast sucking it the feel of his mouth on me was almost too intense it made me want to cry out to squirm to say stop and never stop i made a small sound like a sob as he released my breast in one long pull so that the nipple stretched between his teeth he moved to the other breast harsher this time using more teeth he bit gently around the soft tissue of my breast then licked the nipple rolling it with his tongue he gave one quick bite that hurt and i was suddenly on the floor looking up he knelt over me and put his hands into the tears in his tshirt and ripped it open exposing the hardness of his chest his arms there were two slashing claw wounds one high and one low the high one had gone over his nipple and blood had dried on the tip of it i sat up and reached for him he didnt stop me i ran my tongue over his chest over the wounds and he gasped i licked a quick tongue over the bloody nipple and when he didnt chase me away i locked my mouth around it and fed i sucked the wound clean pulling hard enough that i reopened the wound it was his turn to cry out he pushed me back to the floor gently he took off my shoes and socks and i let him my heart was beating so fast it hurt pounding in my throat like a trapped thing his hands went to the tops of my jeans when the top button went it made my stomach jerk he unzipped my pants and started sliding them down my hips i helped him push the drying cloth down my legs he pulled the jeans off in one last motion and i was left lying wearing nothing but the black panties that had matched the bra he was on his knees staring down at me his hands went to his own jeans unsnapping them he hesitated ive wanted this for so long anita wanted you like this but not as much as raina and i hated each other her essence and i had a moment of perfect understanding i went to him kneeling oh no you dont dont go all boy scout on me now my hands finished unzipping his pants he caught my hands eyes searching my face its you again yes i said its me i pulled my hands out of his and he let me undress for me richard let me see you naked youve seen me naked before he said softly not like this i said no stopping no questions he stood up this will change everything for me anita it has to change some things for you too i covered my eyes with my hands and gave a little scream oh for gods sake richard stop talking i want your hands on my body i want you inside me so badly i cant think how can you stand there and be reasonable something fell across my hands and face it was his jeans and underwear i sat up and found richard naked i just looked at him the perfect golden brown of his skin was uninterrupted from the curve of his calves to the narrowness of his hips the swelling of his groin the flat hardness of his chest and the sweep of his shoulders his hair fell across one side of his face in a golden brown mass that left half his face in shadow i stood and walked towards him i was scared nervous didnt cover it scared and eager i put my hands on his chest and rose on tiptoe to offer him my lips we kissed and the movement made my body fall full against his the feel of him hard and naked with nothing between us but the black lace panties made me shudder and fall back from the kiss his hands caught me around the waist and kept us pressed together then he was suddenly on his knees hands pulling down my panties in a motion so quick it was violent i was suddenly naked with him kneeling in front of me staring up there was a look in his eyes that made things all over my body tighten he put his large hands on the insides of my thighs and spread my legs he slid his hands along my thighs until they cupped my buttocks bringing my groin against his face he laid his cheek against me licking a quick line along my hip my heart was beating so hard i couldnt get a good breath but i could talk please richard please please he slid one hand between my thighs one finger slid inside me i shuddered head back eyes closed youre wet he said i opened my eyes and stared down at him i know my voice sounded breathy raina was like that she still is i said make her go away he licked the inside of my thigh forcing me to spread my legs just by licking nuzzling his mouth against my skin the first touch of his tongue between my legs made me gasp he kissed me there like hed kissed my mouth all tongue and exploring he licked me in long sure strokes then he found just the right spot and sucked i could see his eyes staring up at me while he did it there was a dark light in his eyes something more primitive than we have words for it had nothing to do with being a werewolf and everything to do with being a man it was waves pulsing along my body the sensations were overwhelming it felt so good it was almost too much a pleasure so great it was almost pain he pulled me into his mouth until the warmth spread from my groin upward in a golden rush that left the world hazy and edged with white gauze like i was seeing through a mist with the last drop of pleasure i felt raina leave the munin was gone when he lowered me to the floor his mouth was glistening he used the remains of his shirt to wipe his mouth he said i could always go brush my teeth i just shook my head dont you dare i held my arms out to him is she gone he asked i nodded just me just us good he said he moved over me and laid his naked body the length of mine he was too tall for missionary position id have suffocated against his chest he propped himself up on his arms in a sort of pushup position he slid inside me and it was tight and wet and i could feel every inch of him working its way inside of me when he was sheathed inside of me he stared down at me his eyes had gone that startling amber of a wolf they were almost orange gold in the tan of his face he worked in and out once twice three times gently as if making room then his hips caught the rhythm i slid my hands to his buttocks until i could cup them while he pushed himself inside me i dug my fingernails into the smooth hardness of his flesh he pumped faster harder still holding most of his weight on his arms and shoulders i raised my hips to meet his body without his body trapping me under him i could move a rhythm began between us a wave of movement and heat and muscles moving together something opened inside of me inside of him i felt the mark that bound us open like a door what fell through that door was a warm golden rush of power it spilled over me into me it raised every hair on my body as if it were an electric current richard lifted me in his arms still sheathed inside me he halfcarried me halfflung me to the bed he collapsed on top of me and i was lost under the warmth of his skin and the weight of his chest it was as if his power rode my skin every thrust sent a line of warmth pouring inside of me it was as if i were bathing in the golden warmth of his body inside and out it grew in golden pulses with every thrust the pulses turned to waves that made my body tighten around him he cried out but didnt come he raised back up on his arms only his hips and legs pinning me to the bed his eyes were still amber still not human and i didnt care i watched his beast ride up through those alien eyes i watched it look down at me from richards face i watched thoughts slide across that handsome face that had more to do with food than sex and nothing to do with love his hands flexed in the bed on either side of me i heard the cloth tear ripping i turned my head and saw his hands lengthening turning into human claws those claws ripped the mattress with a thick tearing sound i stared up at richard and couldnt keep the fear off my face richard i said i would never hurt you he whispered it and when his hands convulsed in the bed bits of white bedding sprang in the air i said richard my voice was high not panicked but close he sliced claws down the length of the bed and pulled out rolled off me he rolled onto his side into a tight ball his hands his claws were long and thin with his fingernails turned into something monstrous dangerous shit i smoothed my hands down his back im sorry richard im sorry i wont change during sex anita but this close to the full moon its hard he turned his head to look up at me and his eyes were still amber his hands began to reform shrinking back to human i watched them change felt the rush of energy like a wave of dancing insects on my skin i knew that if i left him like this hed never recover it wasnt my loss not really it was that this would confirm his deepest fears that he was a monster and only fit to be with other monsters richard was not a monster i believed that i trusted him not to hurt me i trusted him more than i trusted myself sometimes roll over i said he just looked at me i rolled his hips over and he let me he wasnt completely hard now nothing like having your lover scream for help to take the fun out of it i touched him and he shuddered eyes closing i held him in my hands and stroked him until he grew warm and hard i slid over him and he was almost too big from this angle almost too much it was more intense with me on top sharper somehow a small moan escaped him i love you richard i love you i moved above him with him so deep inside me it felt like i should be able to taste him his hands slid around my waist then to my breasts the feeling of his hands on me while i rode his body was almost too much i moved my hips gently at first then faster i forced him into me hard and fast and deep until i wasnt sure if it felt good or hurt i felt the orgasm growing i felt it filling me up like warm water in a cup filling from the bottom up i felt it flow over me in small spasms richards breathing changed quickened and i knew he was close not yet i whispered not yet he dug his hands into the bed on either side of me i felt his hands go i felt them slip their skin i felt it like the small release it was like an echo of what his body was doing inside of me the claws tore into the bed like nails i heard the mattress material make that heavy ripping sound and it was too late the orgasm caught me in a burst that bowed my spine and made me cry out it washed over me in a skinshifting nervejumping dance as if every part of me were trying to leave every other part behind for a shining second i felt skinless boneless nothing but the warm roll of pleasure and the feel of his body underneath me only his body anchored me only the feel of him going inside me in one great release reminded me where i was who i was i opened my eyes and found his eyes brown and human he raised his hands to me and i fell against his body i laid my head on his chest and felt his heart beating against my cheek i lay there feeling his body pulse underneath me his arms holding me he laughed and it was joyous he raised my face to his and kissed me lightly and carefully i love you too he said warm he was so warm he my eyes were wide open and sleep fell away like a crash of glass i was left lying in bed with my heart pounding and a tanned arm flung across my stomach i stared up that arm and found richard on his stomach hair flung over his face like a curtain i was lying on my back sheets down past my waist trapped under richards arm i raised my head back and found van goghs sunflowers above the bed richards cabin wed done too much damage to mine i had a very strong urge to pull the sheets up and cover my breasts okay okay richard had seen the whole show last night but this morning i wanted to cover up i was embarrassed not big awful embarrassed but little confused embarrassed i realized i was lying there with my arms tucked across my chest as if i was hiding richards arm looked very dark against the pale white skin of my stomach jeanclaude had remarked that my skin was almost as pale as his id had enough moral problems with premarital sex with the undead my one comfort had been that i was monogamous now i didnt even have that whoredom had finally arrived just as my grandmother blake had always warned in a way she was right once you have sex with anyone sex becomes more of a possibility with others the drapes in the cabin hadnt been pulled completely morning sunlight fell through the white sheers and spilled over the bed id never seen a mans body by morning light id never slept with a man and awakened beside him oh once with stephen but fully clothed with guns and bad guys about to come through the door isnt quite the same thing i reached out towards richards arm tentative youd think after what we did last night id be braver but i was almost afraid to touch him id had sexual fantasies about richard but this this was the big one to wake up beside him warm and alive god forgive me but i valued that i touched his arm lightly so that all i really touched were the small golden hairs no skin i brushed upward just above the skin until there was nothing but the bare skin of his upper arm and shoulder i drew my fingertips over the warmth of his skin he was incredibly warm warmer than skin temperature almost fevered i felt him wake a tension in his shoulder and back that hadnt been there before i turned my head and his brown eyes were staring at me through the thick curtain of his hair he rose up on one elbow and smoothed his hair back from his face he smiled and it was the same smile that had melted me into my socks a hundred times good morning he said good morning i said i had pulled the sheets up over my breasts without thinking about it he wiggled closer which made the sheets at his waist slide down to reveal the smooth expanse of his buttocks he kissed me soft tender then rubbed his face along my cheek until his breath was warm against my ear then farther back into my hair he was giving me a wolf greeting he kissed lightly down my neck and stopped at my shoulder which was about all that was uncovered you seem tense he said you dont i said he laughed and the sound made me shiver and smile at the same time it was a laugh id never heard from richard it was very masculine very something possessive satisfied maybe i felt heat creep up my face being that embarrassed made me feel silly for being embarrassed oh hell what he asked he stroked the side of my face cuddle with me richard sex is great but when i thought of this moment i thought of you holding me spooning me his smile was gentle pleased he turned on his side and even spilled the sheets back over his waist he raised his upper arm i rolled onto my side so my back faced him and snuggled against his warm body he was a little tall for spooning but we wiggled around with much giggling and stupid comments until we found a position that felt right i wrapped his arm around me sinking into the warm curve of his chest and all the rest and let out a sigh the feel of his naked groin pressed against me wasnt so much exciting as it just felt right i felt possessive of his body of him i wanted to hold him like this forever his skin was almost hot you feel like youve got a fever i said its the full moon he said by tomorrow night when the moon is completely full my base temperature will be over a hundred and one he pushed my hair aside until he could nuzzle the back of my neck it made me break out in gooseflesh i squirmed that tickles yes he said it does i could feel him growing larger against my body i laughed and rolled over on my back why mr zeeman you seem happy to see me he leaned in for a kiss always the kiss grew becoming more i moved my body against his and had one leg wrapped around his buttocks when he scooted back going onto his knees whats wrong i asked wed already established last night after it would have been too late that i was on the pill hed been nicely horrified when he thought of it since werewolves cant get or carry disease once the pregnancy issue was addressed you were safe which also explained why i wasnt worried about licking blood off of the lycanthropes last night gross but not dangerous i cant richard said i looked down the length of his body oh id say youre ready he blushed for me you saw me last night anita one day closer to the full moon my control will be worse not better i lay back on the bed oh i was disappointed minutes before id been worried that wed given in to our lust and now i was sad that we couldnt do it again trust me to be logical about my men im glad youre disappointed too he said for a minute there i thought you were going to get up out of bed say it had all been a terrible mistake and go back to jeanclaude i covered my eyes with my hands then made myself look at richard while i said it he sat there looking too scrumptious for words but i couldnt let it slide if he was thinking this meant id dump jeanclaude i couldnt let it slide but i wanted to what do you think last night meant richard the smile faded around the edges but didnt disappear completely it meant something to me anita i thought it meant something to you it did it does but but what about jeanclaude richard said it softly but it had to be said by someone i nodded hugging the sheet to my chest yeah can you go back to just dating him after last night i sat up and reached for his hand he gave it to me ive missed you so much richard the sex is nice but he raised eyebrows nice just nice i smiled it was wonderful and you know it and you know thats not what i meant he nodded hair swinging into his eyes he brushed it back i know ive missed you too im lost on weekends without you i pressed his hand to my cheek me too he sighed so youre going to be with us both i let his hand fall to my lap still holding it youd go along with that maybe he leaned in and kissed my forehead ever so gently notice i didnt ask you to give him up and just date me i touched his face i know and im both relieved and surprised thank you for not asking he pulled back enough to see my face clearly he looked very serious you dont like ultimatums anita if i push you ill lose why do you want to win richard why dont you just dump me he smiled now she gives me the choice ive given you the choice before i said i mean i know why jeanclaude puts up with me i help his power base youd be better off if you picked out a nice safe werewolf for your lupa i hurt your power base im in love with you he said simply why do i feel like apologizing for that i asked ive been doing a lot of thinking about why i couldnt hate you why i couldnt let you go and i had pulled the sheets around me like a nest so i wouldnt be naked if somewhere in this conversation he did dump me i didnt want to be naked silly but true naked didnt seem to bother richard frankly it was distracting to me i need a human girlfriend i need someone who isnt a monster a lot of humans would be happy to be your snuggle bunny richard i found that out he said but i didnt have sex with any of them why not farther away from the full moon i have better control the eyes dont go let alone the hands i can pass for human but im not human you know what i am and even you almost couldnt accept it there was nothing i could say to that so i didnt try he looked down at the bed fingers playing along the edge of the sheet his voice grew very soft my first year in the pack one of the other new wolves had a human girlfriend he crushed her pelvis while they were making love my eyes widened a little too rough i said richard shook his head he let his hair fall this time hiding most of his face you dont understand anita strength is strength we can pick up small cars and throw them if you dont realize your own strength you cant control it he looked at me suddenly staring out at me through his hair it was a gesture that gabriel had been fond of as if the hair were comforting or reminded them of fur youre the first nonlycanthrope ive ever had sex with since i became one im flattered i guess i was still scared id hurt you like my friend had hurt his girlfriend or in a thousand other ways during sex you lose control thats part of the fun i can never lose control not completely unless im with another lycanthrope i looked at him what are you trying to say richard im saying you date both of us have sex with both of us i will hate it but i stared at him i didnt like that he didnt want to finish the sentence made me nervous what richard he brushed his hair back with both hands until his face was clean and tight you date both of us and ill keep dating other lycanthropes i just kept staring at him say something he said i opened my mouth closed it tried again you mean youll keep having sex with lucy not lucy shes youve met her she could never be lupa of our pack so youre going to keep auditioning lupas i dont know if i am or not but i know if you sleep with jeanclaude i have the right to sleep with other people i couldnt exactly argue with him but i wanted to youre still trying to get me to give up jeanclaude no he said im just saying that if youre not monogamous to me then why should i be monogamous to you no reason i guess except i thought we loved each other we do i do he stood and picked up his jeans from the floor but you dont love me enough to give up jeanclaude why should i love you enough to give up everyone else i stared at him and felt tears begin to fill my eyes you bastard he nodded he slipped into his pants without underwear zipping carefully the real bitch is that i do love you enough to give up everyone else i just dont know if i can share you with jeanclaude i just dont know if i can stand the thought of you in his bed the thought of him being with you like that drives me he shook his head im going to take a shower ive still got trolls to study i couldnt even begin to think about what hed just said it was too much all at once when confused concentrate on business i need to come with you and talk to the biologists we need to find out if franklin niley is the buyer for the land the guy who lost his arm last night was afraid of him it takes someone pretty scary to make a man hesitate when hes surrounded by werewolves your normal real estate types dont have that kind of juice richard strode back to the bed he picked me up around the waist and kissed me he crushed me against him like hed crawl in through my mouth and pull me around him i was breathless when he sat me back down on the bed i want to touch you anita i want to hold your hand and do silly goofy grins i want us to act like people who are in love we are in love i said then for today lets throw all the doubts out just be with me the way ive always wanted you to be if i want to touch you today i dont want to be afraid not to i want what happened last night to change things i nodded all right you dont look sure he said id love to go around holding your hand richard im just realizing that oh hell richard what am i going to tell jeanclaude i asked jeanclaude how much difference the marks made to you how much harder you were to hurt physically he figured out why i was asking i ended up telling him the whole sad story about my friend and his dead girlfriend i looked at him what did he say he said trust yourself mon ami you are not your friend with his sosad tale and anita is not human through us she is more than that both of us huddle around her humanity like it is the last candle flame in a world of darkness but by our very love we make her less human and more my eyebrows went up you remembered all that richard looked at me and it was a long considering look he nodded i remembered because hes right hes right we both love you in our ways for similar reasons it isnt just power that draws him to you you saw him as a monster the fact that you dont anymore makes him feel less like one it sounds like you guys have been having some long conversations yeah its been a real male bonding experience he sounded bitter tired it also sounds like you discussed whether you were going to make love to me with jeanclaude before you discussed it with me never directly he said never word for word it still sounds an awful lot like asking permission i said richard was back in the bathroom doorway what would you have done if wed made love and jeanclaude had tried to kill me afterwards would you have killed him protecting me i just looked at him i dont know i i wouldnt have let him kill you richard nodded exactly whether jeanclaude killed me or i killed him or whether you killed one of us even if we survived the death with the marks dragging us down to the grave even if you and i survived youd never forgive yourself for killing him youd never recover from it wed never have a life together even dead and gone jeanclaude would haunt us so you tested the waters i said richard nodded i tested the waters you asked his permission i said he nodded again i asked his permission and he gave it i said i think that jeanclaude knows if he kills me you would kill him that youd sacrifice all of us for one of us it was true it sounded sort of stupid put that way but it was still true i guess i would so if i can stand it and you want to do it you date both of us you share both of our beds his hands balled into fists at his sides but if i cant have monogamy from you you cant have it from me fair i looked at him and gave the barest of nods its fair but i hate it i hate it a lot richard looked at me good he said and closed the door a moment later i heard water running and i was left naked in his bed with everything id ever wanted offered to me on a silver platter so why was i sitting there hugging my knees to my chest and fighting not to cry i wanted to get dressed id brought my suitcase over from my cabin for just that reason but i needed a shower id had too much fighting too much sweating too much blood too much sex last night not to shower so i sat huddled in a nest of sheets that smelled of richards cologne my perfume the sweet scent of his skin and sex i had managed not to cry in fact if richard had just admitted undying monogamy to me id have joined him in the shower but he hadnt and i was confused there was a knock on the door it startled me and i almost just ignored it almost pretended we were still asleep or otherwise occupied but the second knock was more insistent the third was so firm the door shook police open up police im not dressed just a minute i really hadnt packed a robe but i also had a sudden bad feeling if he just wanted us out of town why come this early why wouldnt he give us time to pack and get out unless he didnt care if we left anymore at least not on our own maybe hed known about the hit last night maybe he meant to kill us id dealt with rogue cops before once it made everything harder if i met them at the door with a gun it would give them an excuse to shoot me if i didnt protect myself and they shot me anyway id be pissed open the fuck up blake i didnt pick up my gun i picked up the telephone i didnt call a lawyer carl belisarius was good but not good enough to help me stop a bullet i called dolph what i wanted was another witness that couldnt be shot a cop in another state seemed a good bet the phone was near my pillow the pillow had the browning under it but if i had to go for the gun i was dead dolph answered with storr its anita wilkes and his deputies are about to break down my door why dont know yet im putting a call through on the other line for the state cops there why because the cops broke down my door when i didnt open it if you dont want help why are you calling anita i want to be on the phone to another cop when they come through the door i could hear dolph breathe for a second or two then dont have your gun in your hand dont give them an excuse and the door burst open maiden was first through the door he cleared the door going low the tall deputy with the scar took high they both trained guns on me maidens big fortyfive looked right at home in his big hands i just stood there one hand clutching the white sheet to my chest the phone in my other hand i was very careful not to move i stood frozen with my heart beating so hard it filled my throat like air dolphs voice was in my ear anita im here sergeant storr i didnt yell it but i made sure my voice carried sheriff wilkes came in behind his deputies his gun was holstered put down the phone blake why sheriff wilkes fancy meeting you in richards cabin on such a lovely morning he strode across the room to me he yanked the phone from my hand and i didnt fight him i didnt think he was here to kill anyone but he was here to hurt i was going to try very hard not to give him an excuse to do it whatever he did today i wouldnt make it easier for him he put the phone to his ear just long enough to hear dolph then hung it up a phone call wont save you this time blake i looked up at him and gave him big brown eyes i did everything but flutter my lashes at him do i need saving sheriff wilkes the phone rang we stood there letting it ring seven rings and wilkes picked it up and hung it up again without putting it to his ear he was so angry he was shaking a fine tremor ran through his hands his arms his face was flushed with the effort not to do something violent or regrettable i stood there as neutral as i could manage looking as harmless as i could manage with my long hair tousled from sleep wearing nothing but a sheet it wasnt hard to look harmless the bathroom door opened and richard just stood there in nothing but a towel guns turned and pointed at him he froze in the doorway with steam curling around him spilling out into the room like clouds there was a lot of screaming cops yelling hands up get on the floor richard laced his fingers on top of his head and took it all pretty calmly hed heard them hed stepped out of the shower knowing they were out here he could have gone out the window but he hadnt of course if they really thought we were dangerous theyd have gone in after him but theyd let him come out to us they werent treating us like criminals they were acting like the criminals richard was on his stomach with maidens gun pressed to his back handcuffs went on the scarred deputy pulled him to his knees using his long wet hair the towel stayed on tough towel the phone rang it rang three times each one seemed louder than the last wilkes grabbed the entire phone and jerked it out of the wall he threw it against the far wall where it lay silenced he stared down at me breathing so hard it looked painful he spoke very carefully as if afraid to yell afraid that if he lost control of even his voice it would be over i told you to get out of my town i kept my voice very soft very unthreatening you gave me until sundown today wilkes its not even nine oclock in the morning whats the rush are you going today i opened my mouth to lie richard said no shit wilkes grabbed me by the arm and pulled me towards richard i tripped on the sheet and he dragged me the last few feet i put most of my effort into clutching the sheet to my chest bruises were okay being naked in front of them was definitely not okay wilkes halfthrew me halfdropped me on the floor beside richard richard tried to get to his feet and the scarred deputy hit him in the shoulder with the butt of the shotgun i touched richards arm its all right richard everyone just be calm the scarred deputy said god you are a cold bitch i just looked at wilkes he was the one in charge he was the one who would dictate how bad this was going to be if he stayed calm so would the others if he lost it we were in deep shit wilkes just stared down at me his breathing had eased but his eyes were still wild leave town mr zeeman leave town today richard opened his mouth and i squeezed his arm hed tell the truth unless i made him shut up the truth was not what we needed right now well leave wilkes youve made your point i said wilkes shook his head i think youre lying blake i think richard here is planning to stay i think youd say anything to get us out of this room right now it was the truth and that made it hard to argue wed be fools to stay wilkes i think richard is a fool a softhearted treehugging liberal its not you we have to convince anita its your boyfriend i didnt argue with the boyfriend part i couldnt anymore i leaned a little into richard how do you plan to convince him wilkes said thompson the scarred deputy gave up his place in back of richard to maiden maiden looked uncertain as if things were moving too fast for him but he kept his gun out not pointed at richard sort of resting against his face thompson we never patted ms blake down for weapons thompson smiled a big goodhumored smile no we did not sheriff he grabbed two handfuls of sheet and dragged me to my feet he jerked hard enough that i stumbled into him he locked one arm behind me holding me against him his sam brown belt pressed into my stomach but kept the rest of him from touching me i felt more than heard richard behind me i looked back maiden had traded his gun for his baton he had the baton underneath richards chin pressed against his throat above the adams apple so he wouldnt accidentally crush his windpipe it looked like maiden had had training thompson said dont struggle yet lover you aint seen nothing to get excited about yet i didnt like the sound of that at all he grabbed the sheet and tried to tear it out of my hands i fought him he stepped back from me holding the sheet and yanked it was hard enough i stumbled but i kept the sheet thompson wilkes said stop playing goddamn tugofwar and do it thompson slid his fingers down the front of the sheet and gave it all he had it pulled me to my knees in an ungraceful heap but i won i kept the sheet i was pissing him off not my best idea but im not good naked i never feel nude i feel naked he grabbed me by the back of the head and used my hair to throw me up against the bed i could have pulled away if i wanted to leave a handful of hair and blood in his hands but it would hurt and unless i was willing to start killing people this was going to happen the more i fought it the worse it was going to be as long as it was just a little slap and tickle for richards benefit i could handle it thats what i told myself while thompson yanked me half across the bed by my hair he held me down by my head putting enough weight on that one arm that it almost hurt the sheet had pulled down from my back to my waist he jerked it down farther exposing my butt i struggled just a bit then he pressed down so hard on my head that my face was pressed into the bed enough that it was difficult to get a full breath the mattress wasnt firm enough for this shit i lay very still i did not want him to push my face down into the mattress passing out would be bad you never wake up better off than you started stay thompson said or ill put handcuffs on you i did what he said richard could break a pair of handcuffs i couldnt as much as i loved richard i didnt want him to be the only person free in a room full of cops gone bad if it really came down to having to fight our way out it would mean killing to my knowledge richard had never killed a human being he was squeamish enough about killing other shapeshifters thompson pulled my arms out from under my chest and spread my arms to either side on the bed he slid his hands over my hands my arms as if bare skin could hide any weapons his hands slid down my bare back sloping along my waist and lower his hands slipped over my buttocks and between my thighs spreading my legs it was too reminiscent of last night with richard too intimate i raised up what is this a rape theme down here thompson slapped me on the back of the head be still or ill make you be still but his hands werent playing with my thighs he could hit me more and harder if his hands didnt wander lower this can all stop richard wilkes said this can all be over just leave youll kill the trolls richard said i turned to look at richard i wanted to scream at him just lie wed figure it out later but i wanted him to just lie now i couldnt say that out loud i stared at him and did something i had rarely attempted i tried to open the bond between us i reached out to him not with my hands or with my arms but it felt like reaching i moved out towards him with things i couldnt see but could feel i opened something inside him i felt it give i saw the widening of his eyes i felt the beat of his heart thompson grabbed my shoulder and shoved me back to the bed it broke my concentration there was a knock on the door the other deputy who had been with thompson that first day stepped into the doorway he gave the room a onceover eyes lingering on me on the bed but his face stayed neutral theres a crowd gathering sheriff a crowd wilkes said the treehuggers are out studying their precious trolls if its just the bodyguards fuck them the deputy shook his head its a shit load of people sheriff wilkes sighed he looked at richard this is your last warning zeeman he walked over to me and thompson backed off he squatted so wed be eye to eye i gathered the sheet and turned to meet his gaze where are chuck and terry he asked i blinked and kept my face neutral once not long ago i wouldnt have been able to do it now my face gave nothing away i was as blank and empty as the white sheet around my body who thompson wilkes stood i felt thompson move in from behind me does he do all your dirty work wilkes you arent man enough to abuse an unarmed woman wilkes hit me a backhanded slap that rocked me against the bed i tasted blood i probably could have blocked the slap but that would have made the second blow harder besides id asked for it i dont mean i deserved it i mean i preferred wilkes to thompson for abuse i never wanted to be at thompsons mercy without wilkes there to rein him in thompson wasnt a cop he was a goon with a badge the second blow was a slap the third was another backhand the blows were quick and hard and left my ears ringing i saw spots of light against my vision the proverbial stars and he hadnt even closed his fist wilkes stood over me breathing too hard hands in fists at his side that fine trembling was back again as if he was fighting not to close his fists we both knew if he did he wouldnt stop if he hit me even once with his fist it would be over hed hit me until someone pulled him off i wasnt a hundred percent sure that there was anyone in the room who would pull him off i stared up at him with a trickle of blood at the corner of my mouth i licked at the blood with my tongue and stared into wilkess brown eyes i saw the abyss down at the end of his gaze the monster was there barely caged id underestimated how close to the edge wilkes was i knew in that moment that this last warning was just that a last warning a last chance not just for us but for wilkes a last chance for him to walk away without any actual blood on his own lilywhite hands the deputy by the door said sheriff weve got over twenty people outside here we cant do this with an audience maiden said wilkes kept staring down at me and i held his gaze it was almost like we were both afraid to look away as if even that small movement would uncage the monster maybe it wasnt thompson i should be afraid of sheriff maiden said softly in twentyfour hours wilkes said voice squeezed down until it was almost painful to hear well file a missing persons report on chuck and terry then well be back ms blake well be back and well take you in for questioning regarding their disappearance what are you going to write down in the report as to why you thought i might know where they are he went back to staring at me but at least the fine trembling had stopped i kept my voice neutral but said im sure some of the treehuggers called the cops last night but no one came youre the law in this town wilkes youre all these people have between them and the bad guys last night you didnt come because you thought you knew what was happening you thought chuck and terry had gotten carried away so you come by this morning to pick up the bodies but there arent any bodies you killed them he said his voice soft and tight i shook my head no i didnt which was technically true i hadnt killed them id killed chuck but not terry youre saying you never saw them last night i didnt say that i just said i didnt kill them wilkes glanced behind at richard the boy scout didnt do them never said he did that little guy you were with jason schuyler he couldnt have taken both of them nope i said you are pissing me off blake you dont want me angry no i dont sheriff wilkes i really dont want you angry but i am not lying i did not kill them i dont know where they are that at least was totally true i was beginning to wonder if terry had ever made it to the hospital and i was beginning to think he probably hadnt did vernes pack kill him after i promised him we wouldnt i hoped not ive been a cop for longer than youve been alive blake you make my bullshit meter go off youre lying to me and youre good at it i didnt kill your two friends sheriff i dont know where they are now thats the truth he hunkered back down beside me this is your last warning blake get the fuck out of my town or i am going to dropkick you into the nearest hole ive lived here a long time if i hide a body it stays hid a lot of people go missing around here i asked missing people are bad for tourism wilkes said he stood but it happens dont let it happen to you get out now today if youre not gone by dark its over i stared up at him and knew he meant it i nodded were history wilkes turned to richard what about you boy scout you agree is this enough or does it have to get worse i looked across the room at richard and urged him to lie maiden still had a baton stretched across his throat the towel had slipped down and he was naked with his wrists still in cuffs behind his back richard swallowed then said its enough youre out by dark wilkes made it a question yes richard said wilkes nodded i cant tell you how happy i am to hear that mr zeeman come on boys maiden very slowly took his baton away from richards throat and stepped back ill take the cuffs off if you promise to behave yourself its over right richard wilkes said take the cuffs off they wont give us any more trouble maiden didnt look as convinced as wilkes seemed to be but he did what he was told he took the cuffs off richard rubbed his wrists but didnt bother grabbing at the fallen towel without clothes richard was nude not naked he was comfortable most lycanthropes were maiden followed wilkes to the door but he kept an eye on both of us as if still expecting trouble a good cop never turns his back completely thompson was the last to move towards the door he said lovers thing is almost as big as you are nothing else hed done had made me blush but that did i hated it but couldnt stop it he laughed i hope you dont leave town i hope you stay because i really do want another chance to be alone together my new goal in life thompson is to never be alone with you he laughed again he laughed while he walked out the door the deputy that kept complaining about the crowd left only maiden waited in the door for wilkes the sheriff said i hope we never meet again blake ditto sheriff i said mr zeeman he gave a nod as if hed just pulled us over for a traffic stop and let us go with a warning his entire body language changed as he moved through the door just a good ol boy talking to some strangers about that disturbance last night when the door closed behind them richard crawled to me he started to touch my face then stopped fingers hovering helplessly around my face are you hurt a little he hugged me pulling me gently in against his body go home anita go back to saint louis i pulled away enough to meet his eyes oh no if you stay i stay he cradled my face in his hands theyll hurt you not if they think we really left can vernes people hide us who do you think is outside in the crowd i looked up into his open face did they kill the other man did vernes people kill terry after they left i dont know anita he hugged me again i dont know i promised him hed live if he told us what he knew he pulled back holding my face in his hands you could have killed him during the fight last night and not blinked but because you promised him safety youre upset i pulled away from richard standing tugging the sheet out from under his knees if i give my word it means something i gave my word that hed live if hes dead now i want to know why the cops are on the other side dont piss verne and his pack off anita theyre all we have i knelt by the suitcase on the other side of the bed and started getting out clothes no richard we have each other and we have shangda and jason and asher and everyone we brought with us if vernes people went behind my back last night and killed terry we dont have them they have us because we need them and they know it i stood with an armful of clothes and shuffled towards the bathroom with the sheet still around me for some reason i just didnt want to be naked in front of anyone right now not even richard i made one stop on the way i got the browning out from under my pillow and piled it on top of the clothes no more going unarmed for the rest of the trip if someone didnt like it they could lump it that included my nearest and dearest though to richards credit he didnt say a word about the gun or anything else as i closed the door i wanted a long hot shower i settled for a brief hot shower id called dolph back first to let him know i wasnt dead but all i managed to do was leave a message i was hoping to give him the name franklin niley and see if there was any criminal connection dolph didnt usually share police info with me unless we were involved in a case together but i was hoping hed make an exception dirty cops are one of dolphs least favorite things he might help just to spite wilkes i put on white jogging socks blue jeans and a royal blue tank top id put a shortsleeved dress shirt over the tank top to camouflage the browning the holster would chafe a little around the edges but when it comes to summer wear for concealed carry the options are not limitless id have worn shorts if i hadnt planned on tramping through the woods after trolls and biologists i was trading being cooler for protection from the underbrush i smeared hair goop through my curls while they were still damp combed it and the hair was done since i didnt bother with makeup it was a quick shower i stared into the oval of mirror that id cleaned off with the towel the rest was still lost to steam the bruises from the original beating were gone swallowed into my skin as if theyd never been but my mouth was slightly puffy on one side and a spot of red sat on my skin near my mouth like a wound at this rate i could have a beating a day and be healed in time for the next one there were voices on the other side of the door one of the voices was richard the other voice had a low bass rumble to it that sounded like verne good i needed to talk to him there were more voices i heard nathaniels voice high and clear i didnt know what else to do the gang was all here i wondered what the topic of conversation was i had a few ideas i put the browning down the front of the jeans as long as i didnt sit down i was okay the barrel was too long for comfortable sitting i opened the door and the conversation stopped like id pulled a switch guess i was the topic of conversation nathaniel was standing the closest to me he was wearing silky jogging shorts and a matching tank top his long hair was in a thick braid down his back he looked like an ad for an upscale gym i was on guard anita but theyre cops i didnt know what to do he looked away turned away and i had to catch his arm to turn him back to me he turned those big lilac eyes to me next time just yell a warning thats all you could have done differently i suck as a bodyguard he said this was sort of true but i didnt want to say it to his face there really wasnt much he could have done i looked across the room at shangda he was sitting with his back to the wall balanced effortlessly on the balls of his feet he was dressed in black slacks and a white shortsleeved shirt the claw marks on his face had turned to angry red welts what should have been scars that he would carry for the rest of his life would be healed in a couple of days if youd been on duty shangda what would you have done differently i kept hold of nathaniels arm while i asked it they would not have gotten past me without your permission would you have fought them if they tried to handcuff you he seemed to think about that for a second or two then looked up at me i dont like being handcuffed i pulled nathaniel into a halfhug see nathaniel there are bodyguards who would have given them an excuse to start shooting dont worry about it but secretly i planned on nathaniel never doing guard duty alone again i also planned on the same for shangda for very different reasons i didnt trust either of them alone verne sat in the big chair by the window except for the tshirt being different he was dressed as id first seen him maybe that was all he had jeans and an endless supply of different tshirts hed tied his long greying hair in a loose ponytail richard had put on a pair of jeans and blowdried his hair but that was it hed go an entire day wearing nothing but jeans or shorts slipping on shoes only if he had to go outside the shirt only appeared when he was going out richard is comfortable with his body of course when youve got a body like his why wouldnt you be are you okay verne asked i shrugged ill live speaking of living how is ol terry did the hospital get his arm reattached richard reached his hand out to me i hesitated then took his hand i let him draw me to my knees beside him i took the browning out from my jeans so i could sit between his legs he folded me back against his bare chest jeanclad knees on either side of me his arms were warm and very solid i leaned my head back against his chest i kept eye contact with verne the entire time it didnt hurt that i had the browning naked in my hand richard kissed my damp hair he was trying to remind me to be a good girl to not start another fight he was right in a way we certainly had enough fights on our plate without starting another one answer me verne i said most of my pack passes for human anita do you really think some shithead would have kept his mouth shut he leaned forward in the chair hands clasped together mr sincere he was our only link to the other bad guys verne the only one that was willing to talk to us richards arms wrapped just a little tighter around my arms i realized that if he squeezed i wouldnt be able to point the gun im not going to shoot him richard chill okay couldnt i just be hugging you he asked voice so close to my ear i could feel his breath no i said his arms slid to either side loosely around my waist which put his hands almost in my lap since i had my knees up under other circumstances it would have been an interesting position but when i have a point to make i dont distract the pack is my priority anita it has to be i would never do anything to endanger your pack verne but i gave my word that if he told us what he knew wed take him to the hospital and let them try to reattach his arm i gave my word verne you take your word that seriously he said yes i respect that he said you killed him didnt you i asked not personally but i gave the order richards arms tightened around me i felt him struggling to relax against me he rubbed his chin against my wet hair hands rubbing up and down my bare arms like youd soothe a dog that you were afraid was going to bite someone and i gave my word i said what can i do to make this right between us verne asked i wanted to say nothing but richard was right we needed them or we needed someone and they were all we had what could he do to make this right raising the dead was my department and bringing him back as a zombie wouldnt be the same thing anyway truthfully verne i dont know but ill think of something you mean ill owe you a favor he said a mans dead verne it would have to be one hell of a favor he looked at me for a long measuring moment then nodded i guess so okay i said okay well leave it there for now verne but when i come up with something to ask for or of you disappointing me again would not be a good idea he gave a quick smile i dont know if im looking forward to you and roxanne meeting or dreading it whos roxanne i asked his lupa richard said verne stood richard said you and roxanne would like each other if you didnt kill each other first i know what he meant now he walked over to us he held his hand down as if offering to help me off the floor but call it a hunch i thought it was more than that richards arms opened and i took vernes hand he didnt so much pull me to my feet as just hold my hand while i stood the other hand still held the browning if you ask for something that harms my pack i cant promise that but short of that you have my word ask it of me and its yours he grinned suddenly then looked past me to richard god she is a tiny thing richard wisely did not comment verne knelt in front of me to seal my word im going to offer you my neck you understand the symbolism i nodded if i were a wolf i could tear your throat out its an act of trust he nodded and bent his head to one side so the big vein in his neck was just below the surface stretched tight under the skin of his throat he kept hold of my hand the entire time i glanced back at richard what am i supposed to do kiss the big pulse in his neck or bite gently over it the harder you bite the less you trust the person or the more dominant you see yourself to them i stared down at verne he was being very good no trickle of power escaped him and i was holding his hand skin to skin id felt how powerful he was he could have made my skin crawl if hed wanted to i squeezed his hand and moved to stand behind him i tossed the browning on the bed i ran my hand along his neck finding the big pulse with my fingertips i looked at richard you could almost see the no on his face the nearwarning not to do what i was thinking of which in a way made it all the more tempting verne drew me down towards him pulling my hand across his chest like i was hugging him it brought my mouth down to his neck as if hed done this before he smelled warm as if hed been out in the sun the scent of trees and the ground itself clung to his skin i ran my nose just above his skin i could smell the blood it was as if the skin on his neck was growing thinner and thinner until there was nothing between the smell of sweet blood but a pliable warmth as if the skin itself almost didnt exist my mouth hovered over that pulsing warmth i was drowning in the smell of his body the need to place my mouth over that pulsing living thing was almost overwhelming i didnt trust myself to do it or rather didnt trust myself not to do too much did richard go through life tasting other peoples blood could he feel their life like something fragile and touchable maybe i hesitated too long maybe verne felt the power that was trying to overwhelm me his power broke over my body in a shivering rush that made me gasp and it was too much too tempting a drink to offer a starving man my teeth closed over that evaporating warmth the meat of his neck filled my mouth my tongue found his pulse and i bit down trying to carve that jumping beating thing out of the flesh his power roared over me and something inside of me poured back like two tidal waves crashing churning destroying far below there was a land and a beach and it was all washed away in the pounding drowning depths i felt eyes open and they werent my eyes jeanclaude opened his eyes all those miles away surprised from a sleep that should have lasted hours yet shocked awake by his hunger my hunger our hunger being fed hands dragged me off of that pulsing warmth hands prying me away i came to myself with richard pulling me into the air completely helpless verne still had my hand he was holding on trying to drag me back his neck was bleeding a near perfect imprint of my teeth sat in his flesh his hand fell away as richard pulled me off of him vernes eyes looked heavylidded he drew in a large shaking breath and laughed the low chuckle made my body react god jesus girl what the hell was that i didnt fight to get back to him i didnt fight to finish it i lay passive in richards arms blinking in a spill of morning light staring at what id done to vernes neck and not understanding when i could talk i asked what the hell was that richard cradled me in his arms like i was a child since i wasnt sure i could stand i wasnt bitching about it i felt distant and light and horrible he hugged me against him kissing my forehead us being together has strengthened the marks jeanclaude thought it might i stared up at richard i was still having trouble focusing are you saying that us having sex strengthened his hold on both of us richard seemed to think about that for a second or two it strengthened our hold on each other put me down he did what i asked i slid to my knees unable to stand and pushed his hands away when he tried to help you knew and you didnt tell me would it have made a difference last night he asked i stared up at him tears threatening and i wanted to say yes but i didnt lie no i said no last night it would have taken a hell of a lot more than the knowledge that the marks would strengthen to keep me out of richards bed of course last night i hadnt understood what it meant last night i hadnt just tried to eat my way through a mans throat i got to my feet and fell a second time it wasnt lack of energy it was almost like being drunk but it wasnt a downer it was defiantly an upper what is wrong with me shangda answered ive seen vampires do this if they drink someone powerful or drink too much power shit im feeling pretty damn good myself verne said he touched the bite on his neck ive never let a vampire do me before if it feels that good maybe ive been missing out better nathaniel said it can feel much better than that it wasnt vampire richard said it was power vernes power mine anitas and jeanclaudes sort of a preternatural suicide cocktail i said and giggled i lay on the floor hiding my face behind my hands and fighting an urge to roll in the afterglow i wanted to take the feeling and wrap it around my body like a blanket and down the long glowing warmth i felt a darkness i felt jeanclaude like a black hole sucking in all our warmth all our life and in that moment i knew two things one that hed known when richard and i made love that hed felt it two that as he ate from our lives we ate of his darkness we drank that still cold death as surely as he tasted the sunwarmed flesh and pulse of our bodies and we all drew power from it the light and the dark the cold and the hot life and death as the marks drew us closer the lines between life and death would blur i felt jeanclaudes heart beat earlier than it had ever beat in over four hundred years i felt his gladness his joy in it at that moment i hated him two hours later richard shangda and i were tramping through the woods in search of biologists and trolls we had until dark to get out of town and since we really werent getting out of town we might as well continue with our original plans we left everyone else behind scurrying like ants packing packing packing we would pack and leave in fact we were supposed to call the sheriff when we were ready to leave wilkes had kindly offered us an escort out of town before dark after dark i think the offer was a bullet and a hole somewhere i followed richard through the woods he moved among the trees like he could see the openings or as if as he moved forward the trees moved around him i knew that wasnt true id have felt the presence of that much preternatural energy but richard made it look easy it wasnt being a werewolf it was being mr outdoorsman his hiking boots were nicely broken in his tshirt was blue green with a picture of a sea cow a manatee swimming on front and back i had the identical tshirt at home a gift from richard hed been disappointed that i hadnt packed mine even if i had i wouldnt have worn it i wasnt much into the bobbsey twin look for couples besides i was still angry with him in a vague sort of way i should not have been the only one of the three of us who didnt know what it would mean for richard and me to have sex i should have been told that it would bind us all closer of course it was hard to be mad at him when the tshirt clung to his body like a thin second skin his thick hair was tied back in a loose ponytail every time he passed through a bar of sunlight his hair glowed with streaks of copper and gold it was hard to be angry when the sight of him made my chest tight richard moved smoothly ahead of us i followed in my nikes not doing too bad a job im okay in the woods not as good as richard but not bad shangda on the other hand was not a woodsman he moved through the woods almost daintily as if afraid of stepping in something his black dress slacks and fresh white shirt seemed to catch on things that didnt bother either richard or me shangdas shoes had started the trip black and polished to a fine sheen they didnt stay that way dress shoes even mens dress shoes arent meant for walking in the woods id never met a city werewolf before but no amount of physical grace made up for his total lack of familiarity with the outofdoors there was a breeze today the trees rustled and hushed with the wind it was a cool sound high up in the trees but the wind never came near the ground we moved through a world of green heat and solid brown tree trunks sunlight glittered on the leaves hitting the ground in shining yellow patches before we moved into heavier shade the shade was a few degrees cooler but still heavy with heat it was almost deadup noon and even the insects had fallen quiet with the heat richard stopped just ahead of us do you hear that he asked softly shangda said someone crying a woman i didnt hear a damn thing richard nodded maybe a woman he eased through the trees in a movement that was almost a run crouched hands almost touching the ground his power spilled back from him like the bubbling wake of a ship i followed him i tried to look where i was going but i stumbled and fell shangda helped me to my feet i jerked away from him and ran i stopped looking at my feet or the trees i stared only at richards back his body i mimicked his movements trusting that if he could make the openings so could i i leaped over logs that i didnt see until he moved over them it was almost hypnotic the world narrowed down to his body speeding through the trees again and again i almost careened into trees pushing my body to move too fast i was moving faster than my mind could work if richard had jumped off a cliff id have followed because i was just moving it was like id given up everything to my body i was just muscles working legs running the world was a blur of green and light and shade and richards body sliding at a run through the trees he stopped like a switch had been thrown one minute running the next stopped no in between but i didnt bump into him i was stopped too it was like a part of my brain i couldnt access had known he would stop shangda was at my back he stepped close enough for me to smell his faint expensive aftershave he whispered how did you do that human i glanced at him what run i knew that run meant more to the lukoi than the word said i stood there covered in a light dew of sweat barely breathing hard and knew that something had happened that hadnt before richard and i had tried to jog together before and it hadnt worked he was two inches shy of being an entire foot taller than me a lot of that was leg his speed for jogging was running to me and even then i couldnt keep up with him add the fact that he was a lycanthrope and well he was too fast for me the only other time id kept up with him had been with him holding my hand with him pulling me along with the marks and his power i turned to look at shangda there must have been something on my face some soft astonishment because his expression softened to something almost like pity richard moved away from us and we both turned back to follow his progress as my pulse slowed i could hear what they had heard ages ago crying though that was too soft a word for it someone was sobbing as if their heart were breaking richard moved toward the sound and we followed him there was a huge sycamore in the middle of a clearing on the other side of the trees large patchy trunk a woman huddled she had squeezed herself down into a small tight ball her arms hugging her knees her face was thrown up to the sparkling sunlight eyes squeezed shut blind she had brunette hair so dark it could have passed for black cut very short she was white with a fringe of dark lashes pasted to her pale cheeks her face was small and triangular but beyond that i couldnt describe it her face was ravished with tears eyes swollen skin reddened she was small dressed in heavy khaki shorts thick socks hiking boots and a tshirt richard knelt in the leaves beside her he touched her arm before he said anything and she screamed eyes flying wide there was a moment of utter panic on her face then she threw herself against his chest wrapped her arms around him and fell into a fresh bout of sobbing he stroked her hair murmuring carrie carrie its all right its all right carrie could it be dr carrie onslow it seemed likely but what was the head biologist on the troll project doing having hysterics in the woods richard had slid completely down into the leaves hed pulled her into his lap like she was a child it was hard to judge but she seemed tiny smaller than i was the crying eased she lay cuddled in his lap held in his arms theyd dated i tried to feel jealous but i couldnt manage it her distress was too extreme richard stroked the side of her face whats wrong carrie whats happened she took a deep breath that shuddered as it escaped her lips then she nodded and blinked up at shangda and me shangda her eyes turned to me she seemed embarrassed that wed seen her lose control i dont know you anita blake i said her cheek rested against richards chest so all she had to do was roll her eyes upward to look at him youre his anita she made it a question he looked up at me when were not mad at each other yes i watched her rebuild herself gathering her personality back around her like layering clothes against winter weather her eyes filled while i watched until her face burned with intelligence with a force commitment a determination that shone so fiercely it seemed to thrum through her skin i watched her and knew instantly why richard had dated her staring down at her i was glad she was human glad he wouldnt be having sex with her because just a few moments in her presence and i knew that this one this one could be trouble that was the real danger with not being monogamous it wasnt really the sex though that bugged me a lot it was the fact that it meant the other person wasnt satisfied that they were still looking if youre still looking sometimes you find it whatever it is i didnt like staring down at this woman who was obviously in pain and thinking about my own problems i didnt like the fact that i was a little afraid of her i mean i was human and hed had sex with me i hated that this was what i was thinking before anything hated it a lot she started to push away from richards arms i said dont move on my account it came out dry and sarcastic good better than wounded and confused richard looked up at me i couldnt read his expression and i made sure mine was pleasant and gave him nothing dr carne onslow glanced up at richard frowned then finished pushing away she slid out of his lap to lean against the tree trunk small frown lines had formed between her eyes and she kept glancing from richard to me as if she were confused and didnt like it whats happened carrie richard asked again we went out today just before dawn as usual she stopped talking staring at her lap then took a deep shaking breath three breaths and she seemed better we found a body another hiker i asked her eyes flicked to me then back to her lap as if she didnt want any eye contact for the story maybe it was impossible to tell it was a woman beyond that her voice failed her she looked up at us small eyes shimmering with fresh tears i have never seen anything so horrible in my life the local police are saying that our trolls did it that this is proof that that hiker was a troll kill lesser smokey mountain trolls dont hunt and kill humans i said she looked at me well something did the state police wanted my expert opinion on what could have done it if it wasnt trolls she buried her face in her hands then raised her face like someone coming out of deep water i looked at the bites they were made by something with a primate jaw structure human i offered she shook her head i dont know i dont think so i dont think a human mouth could do that kind of damage she hugged herself shivering in the heat theyll use this to try and call in some bounty hunters and kill our trolls if they can prove that the trolls did this i dont see how we can stop them from either killing them all or shipping them to zoos our trolls did not kill a human being richard said he touched her shoulder when he said it something did richard something that wasnt a wolf or a bear or any large predator that ive ever seen did you say that the state cops are on site i asked she looked up at me yes did you call them she shook her head they arrived shortly after the local police id have loved to know who called them though if the local cops suspected it was either a homicide or a preternatural kill it was standard op for them to call either the staties or the local vampire hunter though admittedly only if they thought the kill was some form of undead was the body found near a cemetery i asked dr onslow shook her head why richard asked it could have been ghouls theyre cowards but if shed fallen and knocked herself unconscious ghouls would have fed on her they are active scavengers whats that mean dr onslow asked active scavenger it means if youre wounded and reduced to crawling you dont want to be in a ghoulinfested cemetery she stared up at me then finally shook her head no graves just in the middle of our land in the middle of the trolls territory i nodded i need to go see the body do you think thats a good idea richard asked he kept his voice as neutral as he could theyre expecting her dr onslow said it surprised us all what do you mean i asked the state police found out youre in the area evidently your reputation is good enough that they wanted you to see the body they were trying to reach you at your cabin when i left how convenient how weird who had called the staties who had put my name in front of them who who who ill go look at the body then take shangda with you richard said i looked up at the tall mans face the claw marks were still red and sort of gruesome looking on his face i shook my head i dont think so i dont want you going alone richard said funny how he wasnt offering to come with me himself he was going to stay here and comfort dr onslow fine i was a big girl ill be okay richard you stay here with the good doctor and shangda richard stood youre being childish i rolled my eyes and motioned him over away from dr onslow when i was sure she couldnt overhear us i said look at shangdas face he didnt glance back he knew what it looked like what about it i stared up at him richard you should know as well as i do that if you have someone eaten to death by a mysterious critter werewolves are always top of the hit list to blame they try to blame a lot of things on us he said so far wilkes and his men dont know what you are if we show up with shangda cut up like this and then he turns up healed theyll figure it out with a body on the ground you dont want them to figure it out shangda wont be healed by nightfall richard said but hell be more healed than he is right now it isnt human to heal that fast if wilkes finds out that we havent really left town hell use everything he has hell out you or charge you with this crime what could have killed this woman wont know until i see the body i dont want you going there alone ill go with you the police dont like it when you bring your civvie boyfriends to crime scenes richard stay here comfort dr onslow he frowned at me im not being catty richard i smiled all right not very catty shes shook hold her hand ill be okay he touched my face gently you dont need much handholding do you i sighed one night with you and i nearly eat vernes neck one night and i just ran through the woods like like a werewolf just one lovemaking session and you say you knew it was a possibility you should have at least tried to tell me last night richard he nodded youre right i should have i dont have any excuse good enough im sorry anita staring up into his sosincere face it was hard to be angry but it wasnt hard to be distrustful maybe richard had been learning more from jeanclaude than just how to control the marks maybe lying by omission was contagious i need to go see a body richard dr onslow pointed me in the right direction i started off through the woods richard caught up with me ill walk you im armed richard ill be okay i want to go with you i stopped and turned and stared up at him i dont want you with me right this moment i need you to be somewhere else i didnt mean to hide things from you everything happened so fast last night i just didnt have time i didnt think tell it to someone who cares richard tell it to someone who cares i walked away into the trees and he stayed where id left him i felt him watch me as i moved through the trees i could feel the weight of his gaze like a hand on my back if i looked back would he be waving i didnt look back i loved richard he loved me i was sure of those two things the one thing i wasnt sure of was whether that love would be enough if he slept with other women it wouldnt be fair or not i wouldnt survive it richard said he hadnt asked me to give up jeanclaude he hadnt but as long as i shared my bed with jeanclaude richard would sleep with other women as long as i wasnt monogamous he wouldnt be either he hadnt asked me to give up jeanclaude hed just made sure that i wasnt going to be happy in either bed i could have them both as long as richard slept around i could have richard all to myself as long as i gave up jeanclaude i wasnt ready to make the second choice and i couldnt live with the first unless there were a third choice we were in trouble the murder scene was in the middle of the woods five miles from the nearest road good enough to take even a fourwheeler according to dr onslow it was a great place for trolls but not for conducting a police investigation they were going to have to hike everything in and when the time came hike the body out not pleasant not fast one good thing about the isolated location was no gawkers id been to a lot of murder scenes but the only ones without an audience were either at really odd hours or in the middle of nowhere the odd hours werent enough if there were people nearby people would climb out of their beds before dawn to see a corpse even without the civvies there was a crowd i spotted the uniforms of wilkes and one of his men i was really looking forward to seeing them again today the state troopers were thick on the ground along with some plainclothes state detectives i didnt have to be introduced to them to know they were cops they moved around the scene with little plastic gloves on squatting on the balls of their feet rather than kneeling on the evidence yellow crime scene tape wrapped around it all like a ribbon on a package there was no uniform on this side of the tape because no one expected company from the direction opposite the road i was wearing the browning and the firestar and the knife down my spine so i dug out my license and held it aloft as i ducked under the tape eventually someone would see me and some uniform would get yelled at for letting me cross the perimeter without being spotted a state trooper spotted me before id come down the hill very far theyd made a wide circle of tape and hed been standing near the upper edge of it he had brown hair and dark eyes and a sprinkling of freckles across his pale cheeks he walked towards me hand out im sorry miss but you cant be in here i waggled the license at him im anita blake i heard you guys were looking for me something about a body you want me to take a peek at a peek he said you want to take a peek at the body he said it sort of soft not like he was teasing me his dark eyes stared past me for a second then he seemed to remember where he was he held his hand out for my license i let him take it look at it read it twice he handed it back to me he looked down the hill to the knot of people he pointed the short man in the black suit blond hair thats captain henderson hes in charge i just looked at him he should have taken me to the man in charge no way would a cop who didnt know me let me walk a crime scene unaccompanied vampire executioners arent civilians but most of us arent detectives either im one of the very few who deals so intimately with the police in saint louis where most of the cops knew me by reputation or on sight i could see it but here where no one knew me no way i read the troopers nameplate michaels is it he nodded and again his eyes werent looking at me he wasnt acting like a cop he was acting scared cops dont spook easily give them a few years on the job and they perfect jaded indifference been there done that wasnt impressed didnt bother to get a tshirt michaels had sergeant bars on his uniform you didnt get sergeant stripes in the state troopers by getting shook at every crime scene sergeant michaels he said is there something i can do for you ms blake he seemed to be rebuilding himself before my eyes it reminded me of the way dr carne onslow had recovered his eyes lost that vague glassy look he looked at me straight on but there was still a tightness around his eyes almost like something hurt what the hell was down at the bottom of this hill what could make a seasoned cop look like this nothing sergeant nothing thanks i kept my license out because i was almost sure to be stopped again without a police escort a woman was throwing up by a small pine tree she and the man holding her forehead wore emergency medical services uniforms its a bad sign when the ems techs are throwing up a very bad sign it was maiden who stopped me we stood there for a second or two just looking at each other i was standing uphill looking down at him ms blake he said maiden i said i left off the officer on purpose because as far as i was concerned he wasnt an officer hed stopped being a cop when he became a bad guy he gave a small odd smile ill take you through to captain henderson hes in charge fine you might want to prepare yourself blake its bad ill be all right i said he shook his head looked at the ground when he looked back up his eyes were empty cold cop eyes maybe you will blake maybe you will but i wont be whats that supposed to mean who the hell is she it was captain henderson hed spotted us he came up the hillside in his dress shoes sliding just a bit but he was determined and knew how to walk in the leaves even in the wrong shoes he was about fiveeight with short blond hair he had odd eyes that changed color as he moved through the dappled sunlight one moment pale green the next grey he came up to stand between the two of us he looked at maiden who is this and why is she inside my perimeter anita blake captain henderson maiden said he looked straight at me and his eyes were cool and grey with swirling flecks of green he was handsome in a cleancut ordinary sort of way he might have been more than that but there was a harshness to his face a sourness that robbed him of something likeable and pleasant no matter how funky the eye color when he looked at me the eyes were distant judging cop eyes so youre anita blake his voice was almost angry i nodded yes i didnt let the anger get to me he wasnt angry at me something was wrong something beyond the crime itself i wondered what he looked me up and down not sexual but as if he were taking my measure i was used to that though it was usually a little less blatant how strongs your stomach blake i raised eyebrows at that then smiled what in the hell is funny henderson said look i know its bad i just left your sergeant at the top of the hill so spooked he wouldnt come near it a second time maiden heres already told me its awful just take me to the body henderson stepped up invading the hell out of my personal space you that confident that you can take it blake i sighed no the no seemed to take some of the anger away he blinked and took a step back no he said i dont know if i can take it captain henderson theres always the chance that the next horror will be something so awful ill never recover something that stains my mind and sends me screaming but so far so good so take me to see the grisly remains the foreplay is getting tiresome i watched the emotions play over his face amusement then anger but finally amusement won lucky me the grisly remains are you sure youre not a reporter that made me smile im guilty of a lot of sins but thats not one of them that made him smile when he smiled he looked ten years younger and was more than just ordinarily handsome okay ms blake follow me ill take you to see the grisly remains he laughed soft low and deeper than his speaking voice as if when he sang he might be a bass i hope youre as amusing after youve seen the show ms blake me too i said he gave me a strange look then led the way down the hill i followed because it was my job an hour ago id have said the day couldnt get much worse i had a sinking feeling it was about to get worse much worse the body lay in a small clearing i knew it was human because they told me it was it wasnt that the body didnt look human exactly the shape was there enough that i could tell it was lying on its back it was more that my mind refused to acknowledge that this could have been a human being my eyes saw it but my mind kept refusing to put the pieces together so it was like looking at one of those pictures where you stare and stare until the hidden shapes spin out in d relief it looked as if there had been an explosion of blood and flesh and the body had been at the center of it dried blood spread out from the body in every direction as if when the body were moved thered be a bodyshaped clean spot like an ink blot i could see all that but still my eyes couldnt make sense of it my mind was trying to protect me it had happened before once or twice the smart thing would be to turn and walk away let my mind have its confusion because the truth was going to be one of those mindblasting moments id jokingly told henderson at the top of the hill that some things stain the mind it wasnt funny now i forced myself to look at it forced myself not to look away but the summer heat wavered around me in a sickening rush i wanted to cover my eyes with my hands but i settled for turning away covering my eyes would look silly and childish like blotting out the worst of a horror movie henderson turned when i did if i wasnt going to look at the body then he wouldnt either you okay the world stopped spinning like a ball that had slid to a stop i will be my voice sounded breathy good he said we stood that way for a few seconds more then i took a shallow breath i knew better than to take a deep one this close to the body i had to do this trolls didnt do this no natural animal did this i turned slowly around to face the body it hadnt gotten any better henderson turned with me he was the man in charge he could take it if i could i wasnt sure i could but since i was out of other choices id borrowed surgical gloves someone had offered me heavier plastic gloves to go over aids you know i declined one my hands would sweat two if i had to feel the body for clues i wouldnt be able to feel shit three with three vampire marks on me i didnt sweat aids anymore i was free from bloodborne disease so id been told i believed jeanclaude on this one because he wouldnt want to lose me i was a third of his triumvirate he wanted me safe in the back of my head a voice said he loves you the voice in the front of my head said yeah right can i track up the blood pattern i asked you cant get close to the body unless you step in the blood henderson said i nodded true so youve videotaped it gotten all your pictures we know how to do our job ms blake im not questioning that captain i need to know if i can move the body around thats all i dont want to fuck up the evidence when youre done with it well be bagging it up i nodded okay i stared down at the body and suddenly could see it all of it i hugged my arms across my stomach to keep my hands from covering my eyes the nose had been bitten off so that it was just a bloody hole the lips were torn away until teeth and the bones of the jaw were visible under the drying blood the muscles of the jaw were missing on the side facing me whatever had done this hadnt just taken a quick bite it had sat down and fed so many bites so much missing flesh but most of it too shallow to kill i said a short prayer that most of the bites were postmortem even as i prayed i was pretty sure i wouldnt get a good answer there was too much blood shed been alive through most of it intestines spilled out of the ripped jeans in a dried nest covered in thicker things than blood the outhouse smell of her lower intestines being ripped would have faded by now one smell dies but theres always another her body had started to ripen in the summer beat it is a smell that is hard to describe both overwhelmingly sweet and bitter enough to gag i took shallow breaths and stepped onto the dried splatter something moved through me like a phantom blow the hair on the back of my neck tried to crawl down my spine that part of my brain that had nothing to do with cars or indoor plumbing and everything to do with running and screaming and not thinking at all was whispering now it was whispering that something was wrong something evil had been here not just dangerous evil i waited to see if the feeling would grow stronger but it faded it faded like a bad memory which probably meant id walked through the edge of some kind of spell or rather the remnants of one a nasty one you didnt call something this evil without a circle of protection either for the sorcerer to stand in or for the beastie to be put inside of i searched the ground but there was nothing but blood the blood didnt form a circle of protection it was just splatter mess no pattern i should have known there wouldnt be anything that obvious the police arent practitioners of the arts though that is beginning to change but you cant be a cop long and not look for signs of magic when the shit is this strange the scene looked undisturbed but that didnt mean it was undisturbed if someone were really good at magic they could make you not see something not true invisibility humans dont do that physics is physics light hits a solid object and bounces but they can make the eye reluctant to see so that you keep looking past something and your mind doesnt register it like looking for a set of car keys that is sitting in plain sight lost for two days i squatted beside the body i didnt have the coveralls i usually wore at murder scenes and didnt want the blood to soak into my jeans i was still hugging myself there were things here that someone didnt want us to see but what henderson called we found the wallet do you want the id no i said no i wasnt being clever i just didnt want a name an identity for the thing at my feet id done the trick of turning the body into an it it wasnt real it was just something to be studied examined it had never been real to think anything else at that moment would have had me vomiting all over the evidence id done that only once years ago dolph and the gang had never let me live it down the eyes had been clawed out and left to dry into blackened lumps on the cheeks long hair was plastered along the side of the face stuck to one shoulder maybe blond hair from the color but it was hard to tell with all the soaked blood the long hair made me think female my eyes traveled down and found the remains of clothing the blouse had been reduced to a lump of cloth under one arm the chest was bare one breast torn completely off the other deflated like a balloon as if something had eaten the flesh out of the middle like a kid sucking the jelly out of a donut it was an unfortunate choice of metaphors even in my own head i had to stand up i had to walk away blowing air out very fast and too shallow i went to stand beside one of the trees that edged the clearing i had to take deep breaths but that meant the odor went down strong that sweet sweet smell slid along my tongue and coated the back of my throat until i couldnt stand the thought of swallowing but didnt know what else to do i swallowed and the smell slid down and my morning coffee inched up i had two comforts one id managed to get outside the blood pattern to vomit two i didnt have much in my stomach to come up maybe this was one reason that ive stopped eating breakfast i get a lot of earlymorning body viewing i knelt in the dry leaves and felt better i hadnt thrown up at a crime scene in a long time at least zerbrowski wasnt here to rib me about it i wasnt even embarrassed was that a sign of maturity male voices behind me sheriff wilkes saying almost yelling shes just a civvie she shouldnt be here she isnt even licensed for this state im in charge here sheriff i say who stays and who goes henderson wasnt yelling but his voice carried i grabbed the tree trunk to help me stand and my arm tingled so hard it almost went numb i stood pushing away from the tree nearly falling but i kept my feet i looked up the smooth trunk about eight feet up was a pentagram carved into the bark of the tree the cut had been darkened with blood with the dried blood rubbed into it it was almost invisible against the dark grey bark but there was also a spell of reluctance on it so that no one had looked not even me only when i touched the tree did i sense it like all illusion once you see it you know its there i looked at the other trees and found a bloody pentagram carved into each one it was a circle of power of protection a circle formed of blood and the land itself wiccans witches can use their power for evil if theyre willing to pay the price in karma whatever you do good or ill comes back to you threefold but even a wiccan gone bad wouldnt carve up a tree had the trees the land themselves been invoked that might mean an elemental they could be nasty but they didnt feel evil they felt angry if you messed with their land but they werent evil more angryneutral id gotten that whiff of evil as i passed through the circle evil with a capital e there just arent that many preternatural critters that trip that particular wire captain henderson i said i had to say it twice before they stopped arguing and looked at me they both looked at me neither looked friendly but at least i knew who they were mad at each other local cops dont like anybody horning in on their turf it was normal for the local police to resent outsiders but i knew that wilkes had more to protect than his turf he must be frantic having real cops here now but now wasnt the time to spill the beans i had no proof accusing a policeman of corruption tends to upset the other cops did you see the pentagrams on the trees the question was strange enough that they both stopped being angry and paid attention i pointed the pentagrams out and like all good illusion once i showed them they could see it the emperor has no clothes so wilkes said so this was a circle of protection of power something was called here to kill her the marks on the trees could have been here for days wilkes said test the blood on the pentagrams i said it wont be hers but it will be fresh why isnt it the victims henderson asked because they used the blood to seal the circle they had to have the blood before the death it was a human sacrifice then henderson said not exactly i said this was a troll kill wilkes said he didnt sound sure he sounded desperate henderson turned to him you keep saying that wilkes you keep saying it was trolls that biologist herself said it looked like primates it sure as hell wasnt a person there arent that many primates running around the tennessee hills she said humanoid i said they both looked at me again dr onslow said humanoid a lot of people assume humanoid means primate but there are other options like what wilkes said his beeper went off he checked the number then looked at me excuse me captain henderson henderson looked at me do you and the sheriff have some sort of history ms blake i frowned history how he was very certain that you shouldnt be anywhere near this body he was also very certain that this was a troll kill very certain who called you guys then an anonymous tip we looked at each other who suggested i get to join the fun one of the ems crew the mans usual partner met you last night i shook my head i dont know him his regular partner is a girl lucy something that explained lucys medical knowledge and why she wasnt working on the day of the full moon dont want to be around fresh blood with the moon almost full too tempting too chancy i remember her vaguely i guess i remembered her more than vaguely but the last time id seen her was just after id murdered someone so i was going to be fuzzy on the details for one awful moment i wondered if henderson had been trying to trick me and the body was really lucy but the height was wrong the woman had been tall not my size most of the women that richard dated were short i guess if youve got a body type you like you stick to it my choice of victims seemed to be a lot wider why did they need a power circle ms blake henderson asked to keep in what they called he frowned at me like you said before the foreplay is getting tiresome just tell me what the fuck you think it was i think they called a demon his eyes widened a what a demon i said henderson just looked at me why when i crossed the circle i got that feeling of evil no matter how monstrous the critter it doesnt feel the same as something dedicated to evil and no other purpose you see many demons while youre out slaying vampires ms blake once captain just once it was i stepped out of the circle of power and i felt better theyd done their best to hide the traces but things like this have a tendency to cling i was called into a case that they thought was a vampire but it was demonic possession the woman i stopped again because i didnt have words for it or no words that wouldnt seem silly melodramatic i tried to tell the story by sticking to the facts me and sergeant friday the woman had been an ordinary housewife mother of two shed been a diagnosed schizophrenic captain her particular brand of craziness was almost a multiple personality disorder but not that clearcut she was like the little girl with a curl in the middle of her forehead when she was good she was very very good a model churchgoer teacher of sunday school she canned her own vegetables sewed doll clothes for her girls but when she was bad she slept around abused the kids hung the family dog from a tree henderson raised an eyebrow at that for a cop it was pure shock why wasnt she in a hospital because when she took her medicine she was the good mother the good wife i talked to her when she was well and she was a very nice person i saw why the husband tried to hold on to her it was tragic in the true sense of the word that her own brain chemistry was destroying her life its sad but its not demonic henderson said neighborhood pets were vanishing showing up drained of blood i traced it to the woman her history of mental illness had raised flags with the cops so far just sad right i stared off up the hill at the cops and the techs and everyone they were not looking down the hill no one wanted to hang around this one even if you arent truly sensitive to the psychic we all have survival instincts that work better than we do everyone would be reluctant on this one and they wouldnt know why you still with me blake henderson asked sorry the night we arrested her two uniforms had had to drag her out of another mans bed handcuffed they didnt have another female on site that night so i rode in back with her she was loud and boisterous flirting with the men being snotty with me i dont even remember what i said but i remember the look on her face when she turned to me were riding in this dark police car and as she turns her head to look at me the hair on my body stood up there were no glowing eyes no smell of sulfur captain henderson but i felt evil rise off of her like some disturbing perfume i looked at him and he was scrutinizing my face like he was trying to memorize it i dont scare easy captain but for that instant i was scared scared of her and it showed on my face and she laughed and the moment was gone what did you do i recommended they do an exorcism did they he asked not the police but her husband signed the papers for it and henderson said and it worked if she stays on her medication the mental illness is under control the possession didnt cause the schizophrenia henderson nodded we all get the lecture in training that mental illness can open a person up to demonic possession ms blake its like pcp but weirder yeah i said pcp doesnt cause people to levitate he frowned at me did you witness the exorcism i shook my head i wont talk about it i especially wont talk about it here and now words have power captain memories have power i wont play into it he nodded are you positive humans didnt do this i shook my head they ate her to death it ate her to death a person might be able to bite your throat out and do some of this damage but not all of it if you told me this was a possession id call my chain of command and start looking for a priest but blake do you know how rare overt demonic attacks are probably better than you do captain i get called in for all sorts of weird shit have you ever seen a demon kill a person by straight attack not trickery no then how can you be so sure he asked i told you why im sure captain once youve been in the presence of the demonic you dont forget what it feels like i shook my head and fought the urge to take another step away from the body but im not an expert on demons captain henderson i suggest you contact a priest im also not an expert on this kind of magic call a local witch to look it over they may be able to give you more information the best i can do is general stuff could you have called a demon and made it kill her i frowned at him what are you talking about just answer the question ms blake i raise the dead captain i dont do demons a lot of people dont see that big a difference between the two great just great you call me down here i tell you its black magic and now youre going to blame me i dont feel like being the toasty end of a witch hunt captain henderson he smiled just answer the question could you do it no i could not do this trafficking with the demonic taints the soul i may not be a perfect christian but i am trying fucking vampires taints the soul too blake i stared up at him i looked at him for several long seconds because what i wanted to do was hit him or scream at him no hit him but i couldnt do that i settled for one of those smiles you get sometimes when what you really want to do is hurt someone fine captain fine this was powerful magic and i have a reputation for powerful magic its not your fault that you dont understand the vast difference between the two schools of magic lack of education cant hold that against you my voice said plainly that i wanted to but if i were going to kill someone id probably just shoot them that would at least put me near the middle of the suspect list not the top i heard that about you that you were a shooter i looked at him heard from whom cops talk to one another ms blake if shed shown up with a bullet in her head then i might believe you did it why would i kill some unknown woman but she isnt unknown ms blake he was watching me very closely i glanced back at the body i looked down the length of it there was nothing that i recognized of all the women id met since i came here none were tall enough for the body except one i turned back to him and felt the blood drain from my face who is it betty schaffer the woman who accused your lover boy of rape the world swam in stripes of color and heat someone was holding my elbow and only that kept me standing when my vision cleared henderson had my arm and wilkes was back are you all right ms blake wilkes asked i looked him right in the eyes and didnt know what to say betty schaffer had been worse than murdered if the ritual was done right and the person was in jeopardy not pure like being a traitor or a liar or lecherous then the soul could be taken with the life id only seen one body that had been killed in ritual for a demon and it had been nothing like this the sacrifice had been killed with a knife but the soul had been taken and i couldnt raise the body if a demon was involved with the death then the body was just so much clay i had no power here wilkes couldnt have called a demon none of his men had the power who could have done it no one id met since i arrived had that kind of power and that kind of taint before i could think of anything to say wilkes spoke first youve got a call i think you should take it he was afraid id talk trouble was i didnt have any proof of anything hell i didnt even know what was going on what was on this ordinary looking land that was worth killing over why did the trolls have to be gotten rid of was it just so the land could be sold or was there a darker purpose someone had called a demon to try to make it look like a troll kill i knew why theyd done it but not who i even knew why it was betty shed compromised herself put herself at risk for that kind of ceremony movies try to give us shit about needing virgins and purity for sacrifice but true evil doesnt want to kill and send purity to heaven true evil wants to corrupt good and once the good are dead they are beyond the devils reach but the impure to sacrifice them to kill them well the devil gets his due wilkes took my arm as if to help me dont touch me wilkes dont ever touch me again he let his hand fall henderson was watching us like he was seeing more than we were telling cops are good about that give them anything suspicious and theyll put two and two together and make ten to twentyfive to life wilkes looked at me could it be werewolves his voice was quiet i couldnt keep the shock off my face i fought to regain my nice blank face but it was enough wilkes knew what richard was somehow he knew and hed try to blame bettys death on richard werewolves were a good scapegoat and a lot more fun to believe in than demons he pulled a cell phone from his pocket he punched up a number shes right here he handed the phone to me henderson was watching us like we were entertaining i took the phone the voice on the other end was a man and i didnt know him i am franklin niley ms blake i think it is time we meet facetoface i dont think so i said wilkes told me that you have spoiled our little plan about blaming those pesky trolls for the death but it is not too late to blame your lover how many people will believe his innocence once they find out he is a werewolf i dont know what youre talking about i said i had to turn my back on hendersons alert eyes his attention was a little too intense wilkes wasnt watching me he was watching henderson unfortunately turning around put me back to staring at the corpse i turned to the side and stared off through the trees the voice on the phone was cultured almost too wellmannered for comfort come ms blake let us not play games the two of us i know what mr zeeman is and once hes accused a simple blood test in the jail will prove me right hed lose his job his career and perhaps be executed you have hired an excellent attorney my congratulations but if he is convicted then it is an automatic death sentence juries have a strong tendency to convict monsters im listening meet me at the diner in town a public place so youll feel safe why do you want to meet my voice was growing progressively lower whispering to beg you one last time to leave town ms blake i have no wish to come against you the spirits say that to come against you is death spirits i whispered meet me ms blake you and mr zeeman meet me and i promise you it will all be over you will leave town and all will be well i dont trust you nor should you niley said he laughed deep and rich but meet me at the diner ms blake ill answer your questions ill tell you why i want the land once my people have made sure youre not wearing a wire ill answer any direct question you have surely that tempts you you sound like a man who knows a lot about temptation mr niley he laughed again money tempts many people ms blake and i have a great deal of it id been walking slowly away from henderson you going to offer me money no ms blake that is what won a certain officer of the law to my camp and his men i do not think money is the key to your soul i didnt like the way he said that what do you want niley to talk that is all i would swear to you or promise you your safety but i do not think you would believe me you got that right come to me ms blake let us talk after i have answered your questions then you can decide whether to leave or stay now would you be so kind as to put the sheriff back on the phone i turned back to the waiting men and held up the phone he wants to talk to you again wilkes came for the phone it was just the two of us by the body when he tried to take the phone i held onto it i leaned in close to him and said money doesnt spend in hell wilkes the devil deals in a different coin he jerked the phone from my hand and walked away into the trees listening to the voice in his ear the voice that had offered him money to sell out everything he was or might have been the motive i understood least of all for murder or betrayal was greed but damned if it wasnt a popular motive for both richard hadnt said a word since we started the drive to the diner hed pulled the rubber band out of his hair and played with it stretching it wide letting it relax open close open close he didnt usually have nervous habits it wasnt a good sign i pulled into the parking lot and shut off the engine richard was sitting in the middle with his long legs drawn up hed wanted me to drive something about being more easily distracted this close to the full moon shangda sat on the other side his face calm every time i looked at him the horrible claw marks seemed to be smoothing out by nightfall tomorrow hed be clean it was impressive and it would mark him in everyones eyes who saw him as what he was a shapeshifter we sat there a moment listening to the engine tick youre not going to do anything stupid are you i asked richard the rubber band broke with a snap jumping for the floorboard whatever makes you think that i touched his arm he looked at me his eyes were perfect chocolate brown human but there was something in the depths of those human eyes that was other his beast crawled just behind those true brown orbs can you sit through this without losing it i asked i can will you i asked he gave me a tight smile and i didnt like the look on his face if i let this much anger out in public with the moon overhead i might shift dont worry anita i know how to deal with my rage he seemed very selfcontained as if hed pulled back into himself behind walls of careful construction but behind those walls was a vibrating menacing thing if nileys sorcerer were inside he or she would recognize something was wrong of course they knew what richard was so it was all right i guess shangda handed richard a pair of black wraparound shades he took them and slipped them on running his hands through his hair fluffing it around his shoulders another nervous gesture ive never seen you wear sunglasses i said its in case my eyes change richard said i glanced at shangda and his naked eyes what about you i didnt date the girl i didnt even like her ah great lets go the men walked at my back like bodyguards their energy swirled behind me like some kind of psychic wall it made the skin along my back tight and itchy i pushed through the glass doors of the diner and stood there for a moment searching for niley the diner was a s throwback long and narrow in front with a wider area to one side that looked like a later addition there was a long counter with little round stools the place was full of locals and families that matched the outofstate license plates in the parking lot the waitresses wore pink uniforms and small useless aprons a blond waitress came up to us smiling richard shangda havent seen you in here all week knew you couldnt stay away from alberts hash browns richard flashed her that smile of his that has been known to melt women into little quivering puddles the fact that hes unaware of the effect makes it all the more devastating shangda nodded at her which for him was a rousing hello hi aggie richard said were meeting someone frank niley she frowned then nodded theyre over there at the big table around the corner you know the way ill bring water and menus in just a sec richard led the way through the crowded tables we went around the lshape and at the end of it against a bank of windows that overlooked a very pretty mountain view was our party the african american bodyguard milo was one of three men at the table he stood when he saw us he was still tall leanly muscled with squarecut hair handsome in a cold sort of way he had a long coat on and it was too hot for long coats i grabbed richards arm slowed him please i said richard stared down at me from behind black lenses his eyes lost id never realized how much of his expression was in his eyes i couldnt read what he was thinking with some effort i might have found out but the last thing i wanted to do was activate the marks in front of nileys people richard let me walk a little ahead of him shangda had put a sport jacket on over the white shirt and black slacks hed surprised me by having a snubnosed thirtyeight chromeplated it had a paddle holster and fit at the small of his back without breaking the line of his jacket when id questioned the gun hed said these are not policemen the logic was sound and hed checked the gun automatically to see it was loaded he handled the gun like it was habit he was the first lycanthrope id ever met who carried and seemed comfy with it it was actually nice to not be the only person on our side with a gun there were two men still sitting one was under twentyfive with curly brown hair cut short and a wide almost surprised face not niley the other one was well over six feet and must have weighed close to three hundred pounds he gave the impression of size without being exactly fat his hair was black and receeding sharply in front hed done nothing to hide this fact rather the rest of his hair had been buzzed very close to his head making it all the more obvious the lack of hair made his face seem too small for his broad shoulders the dark pinstriped suit sat over his white shirt smooth and costly he wore a vest but no tie the wide white collar showed a curl of greying chest hair he smiled as he watched us move through the tables of tourists and their screaming children his eyes were pleasant and empty like an amused snake he waved large bluntfingered hands gold rings glittered from every finger ms blake so good of you to come he didnt stand for me which made me wonder what was in his lap a sawedoff shotgun maybe or maybe his overly mannered speech was an affectation and he didnt know the actions that went with it or maybe he didnt consider me a lady maybe shangda had moved to one side so that he and milo were facing each other i narrowed my focus to niley and the younger man he looked benign like he should have been sitting at one of the other tables surrounded by normal people doing normal things niley offered me his hand i took it his handshake was too quick barely touching this is howard howard didnt offer me his hand which made me offer my hand to him his big brown eyes got even bigger and i realized that howard was afraid of me interesting howard doesnt shake hands niley said hes a rather powerful clairvoyant im sure you understand i nodded ive never met a strong clairvoyant that would willingly touch a stranger too much crap to pick up niley nodded small head bobbing on his wide shoulders exactly ms blake exactly i sat down richard slid into the chair beside me nileys eyes moved from me to richard well mr zeeman we meet at last richard stared at him from behind dark glasses why did you kill her the abruptness of it made even me wince i must have made some movement because richard said i didnt come here to play games nor did i niley said if you will accompany me to the mens room i will check you for listening devices milo will check your bodyguard shangda richard said his names shangda niley smiled even more broadly if his smile kept getting wider soon his face would just split open of course who gets to search me i said howard niley shook his head my other associate is running a little late today he stood and there was nothing in his lap paranoia shall we mr zeeman may i call you richard no richard said voice deep and low as if he wanted to say more i touched his arm as he moved past me i looked up into his face trying to tell him with a look not to do anything stupid niley took richards other arm slipping it through his like youd walk arm and arm with your lover he patted richards arm my arent you a handsome fellow richard gave me a look as niley led him away id have given a great deal to see his eyes at that moment usually the bad guys make moves on me shangda moved back so milo could come out from behind the table they moved off together not touching the tension between them thick enough to swing on i was left with howard and my back to the door i changed chairs sitting where milo had been so i could see the entrance it put me closer to howard and he didnt like that much i smelled a weak link how good are you i asked good enough to be scared of you he said i frowned at him im not one of the bad guys howard i can see your aura he said in a voice that i could barely hear above the murmur of voices and silverware the waitress came with glasses of water and menus i assured her the others were coming back to the table but i wasnt sure if all of us were ordering she left with a smile i turned back to howard so you can see my aura so what i know how powerful you are anita i can feel it i cant see your aura howard i can feel a little of your power but not much dazzle me show me what you can do why maybe im bored he licked his lips give me something benign no weapons nothing magic that sort of cut down on my options i finally took the cross around my neck off and handed it to him i pooled the chain into his hand dont touch my skin with your hand he said i let the last of the chain spill into his hand and was careful not to touch him he closed his hand over the cross he didnt close his eyes but he wasnt seeing the restaurant he looked past it all and i felt his power ripple over me like a tiny electric current i see a woman older your grandmother he blinked and looked at me she gave you this when you graduated high school i nodded impressive id started wearing this particuliar cross just recently i valued it and id had a lot of crosses taken from me over the years but lately id felt the need of something special grandmother blake had given it to me with a note that said may your faith be as strong as this chain and as pure as this silver lately i needed all the purity i could get howards eyes went past me staring at something at the end of the room his breathing had stopped for just a second like an inaudible gasp i turned to see what had captured his attention so thoroughly the man was close to seven feet tall and had to weigh over five hundred pounds his face was totally hairless not just clean shaven he had no eyelashes nothing smooth and unreal his eyes were a nearly colorless grey too small for his large face he wore a black shirt untucked over black slacks black shoes the skin of his arms and face were unbelievably white as if the sun never touched him the man didnt make my skin creep with power in fact he was too empty walking towards us as if he were shielding himself i stood up partly it was his size partly it was the lack of anything from him like he wasnt there i didnt like it when someone worked that hard to shield themselves it usually meant they had something to hide if this was the sorcerer that had killed betty i knew exactly what he was hiding the man stopped in front of us howard hugged himself and made introductions linus this is anita blake anita this is linus beck howards voice was higher than it should have been like he was scared he seemed to be afraid of a lot of people linus beck smiled down at me his voice when it came was shocking a delicate soprano of a voice so happy to meet you anita so seldom do i meet a fellow practitioner of the arts we dont practice the same brand linus are you so sure he asked positive even standing i had to crane my neck upward to see his face why does niley need a firstrate clairvoyant and a sorcerer linus beck smiled and it looked genuine you know the correct term i am pleased glad to hear it now answer the question when i have checked you for wires then all will be answered i looked at those large white hands and didnt want him to touch me there was almost no hair even on his arms it was like a golden down like the arm of small child something clicked in my head and i stared up at him maybe it showed on my face maybe he read my mind though i dont think so my manhood was sacrificed many years ago so i could better serve my master i blinked at him youre a eunuch he gave a small nod i wanted to ask why but didnt there was no answer that would make sense so why bother what flavor are you sociopath psychopath or schizophrenic he blinked small eyes the smile fading misguided people have told me i was crazy anita but i did hear voices my masters voice yeah but were the first voices your master or just bad brain chemistry his frown deepened i dont know what you mean i sighed he probably didnt sorcerers were people who got their magic through demonic or worse power they bargained for what they got and bartered their souls for money comfort lust power but some were a version of possession people weakened by some flaw mental illness or even a flaw of character the right kind of flaws can attract evil niley led the other men back around the corner he and richard were not holding hands anymore richards face was tight and angry shangda and milos faces gave nothing away as if nothing had happened niley looked happy pleased with himself he clapped linus beck on the back and the eunuch raised the other mans hand to his mouth and kissed it maybe i didnt know as much about eunuchs as i thought i did i thought it meant sexless maybe i was wrong linus will search you for wires then we can talk i dont want him touching me nothing personal linus you fear my master he said i nodded you bet i must insist it be linus in case you have some magic or other about your person that would disturb us i frowned at him like what the holy hand grenade niley waved the comment away linus must search you but if you like you can have one of your men accompany you i didnt like it but it was probably the best offer we were going to get the waitress came to take our order and i realized i was hungry you learn to be able to eat in the midst of disaster and gore or you get another line of work they served breakfast all day i ordered pancakes and maplecured bacon richard looked shocked how can you eat you either learn to eat in the middle of disaster and gore or you get another day job richard very practical ms blake niley said i looked at him and felt a small unpleasant smile curve my lips just of late mr niley ive become very very practical good he said very good then we understand each other i shook my head no mr niley i dont understand you i know what you are and what youll do but i dont understand why and what am i ms blake the smile grew a bad guy mr niley youre a bad guy he nodded yes i am ms blake i am a very very bad guy guess that makes us the good guys i said niley smiled i know what i am ms blake and i am content with it are you content we looked at each other for a long moment my state of mind isnt really any of your business answer enough he said lets order i said everyone ordered finally even richard when the waitress walked away linus richard and i headed for the rest room so he could search me for listening devices and magical booby traps i only had one question which bathroom are we going to use we used the mens room linuss hands felt strangely soft as if there were no muscles under his skin just bones and flesh maybe hed given up other things to serve his master he was creepy but he was thorough he even ran his fingers through my hair which most people forget to do he behaved himself even when his hands were on delicate areas he didnt give richard any reason to grump at him me either we all trooped back out to the table the food hadnt arrived yet but my coffee had everything goes down better with coffee we were again in the chairs with our backs to the door if wed gotten there first theyd have had these chairs so it was hard to bitch linus sat on nileys right i realized why we werent in a booth linus wouldnt have fit you wanted to talk niley talk i sipped coffee it was bitter and had been on the burner too long but theres no such thing as undrinkable coffee i did hope the food was better i want you to leave town anita wilkes and his men already covered that we told them we were leaving by sundown i said i know what you told the good sheriff niley said he wasnt smiling now his eyes were cool the humor dying from his face like the sun sinking away leaving the world to darkness i dont think he believes were leaving richard i said i dont care what he believes richard said i glanced at richard he was sitting with his arms crossed staring at niley it would have been more unnerving without the manatee tshirt but he got the point across so much for richard playing clever repartee with me i left him to his quiet anger and plowed ahead alone why is it so important that we get out of town niley i told you the spirits say to come against you is death i shook my head what spirits howard uses the ouija board as well as his other gifts the spirits warned of a lady death a woman that would be my undoing we were warned of this in connection to this purchase when i heard your name mentioned i suddenly knew who lady death was the spirits say that if i come against you directly you will slay me so you sent wilkes and his bully boys around to scare me off yes and i hired two locals to kill you are they dead i smiled i didnt search you guys for wires now did i he seemed to find that amusing i suppose not but i assume the two men will not be coming back for the second half of their payment you can assume that i said the waitress came with our food we were all utterly quiet as she set the plates down she put syrup in front of me and asked if we wanted anything else we all shook our heads and off she went i stared down at my pancakes and bacon and wished i hadnt ordered them i wasnt in the mood to spar anymore i just wanted this over if youre not supposed to confront me directly then why the change of plans why this meeting he smiled and cut a piece of his country omelet anita do not be coy i think we both know that wilkes does not have the stomach for this work he may work himself up to shooting you but he is not up to truly scaring you away his threat shall we say lacks a certain fright factor he took his bite of omelet and chewed is the threat next i said pouring syrup on my pancakes he smiled dabbed at his mouth with a napkin and shook his head let us save that for last now ask your questions why do you want this piece of land richard shifted in his chair leaning forward hed been wondering about that particular question longer than i had there is a relic on that land somewhere i need to own the land so i can tear it up and search for the relic what relic i asked he smiled the lance that pierced christs side i stared at him i stared at him longer he didnt seem to be kidding that is a myth niley you dont believe in christ of course i do but a roman lance doesnt last for thousands of years it was lost long ago do you believe in the grail he asked the grail is a historical fact its been found and lost twice in recorded history the spear has never been authenticated its passed around like the bones of some saint but its just bait for the gullible do i look gullible anita no i said how did it get to the mountains of tennessee the spear was given as a private gift to president james madison i frowned at him i dont remember that from history class it is listed among the gifts from a certain mideastern principality one spear roman unfortunately it was one of the items that went missing after the british burned and sacked washington dc in i remember reading about the burning of the white house during the war of valuables went missing so say youre right how did it end up here i asked howard has chased it here through his psychic gifts the spirits have led us to this place we hired a diviner and he traced off the boundaries of our search area that area lies within greenes land search the land richard said you dont have to buy it to do that you dont have to disturb the trolls to search for a spear it could be buried anywhere on the land richard i dont think greene would appreciate us tearing up his property unless we owned it im amazed that greene is still alive i said we looked into his fathers will did you know that if the mans son dies the land becomes an animal preserve he was enamored of your trolls mr zeeman was the late farmer greene i didnt know that richard said why should you john greene the mans son is trying to sell to us he told us all the provisions of his fathers estate he was complaining about them but it saved his life so we must buy the land and the trolls must be gone for that unless you will simply stop fighting the sale in court niley smiled at richard would you do that for me richard would you just let us buy the land i promise we will disturb your trolls as little as possible richard leaned over to me and whispered are you running your foot up and down my leg i looked at him no richard scooted his chair back with a loud scrape he moved closer to me one arm going around the back of my chair once you own the land niley you can bulldoze it and we cant stop you the only thing we can do is stop your purchase richard you disappoint me after our little t–∫te–∞t–∫te in the bathroom i thought we were friends richard blushed almost purple from his neck to the roots of his hair why did you kill betty why to frame the trolls for the death of a person i thought you would have figured that out by now why betty linus answered in his high musical voice she was a liar a traitoress and a wanton thing she opened herself to evil power breathed off of richard from the arm against my back an almost visible aura of heat rose around him it clicked with something deep inside of me i put a hand on his thigh he jumped until he realized it was me then settled back i thought soothing thoughts at him but what he was thinking of was betty and the thought was strong enough that he made me flash on her body i had one quick visual of her torn breasts and he stood so abruptly his chair fell to the floor his hands were on the table and he swayed softly i thought he might faint i started to touch him but was afraid to afraid hed see more shangda came to take his arm the voices around us had quieted hushed everyone was looking please richard sit down i whispered shangda helped him sit we all waited quietly watching each other until the voices around us rose and everyone went back to eating howard whispered your auras converged for a moment they became one piece and flared what are you to each other richards voice squeezed out betty wasnt perfect but she didnt deserve to die like that he leaned his face down toward the table and i realized he was crying i touched his back tentatively rubbing it in small circles your plan to blame her death on the trolls is a bust now what it doesnt matter what were going to do next anita you will be out of town we told wilkes we were leaving i said richard took off the sunglasses and wiped at his eyes with his palms look at me please richard niley said maybe it was the please for just an instant richard looked across the table for an instant niley saw his eyes such pretty brown eyes you are a lucky woman anita richard started to push to his feet i laid a hand on his arm his muscles were hard and so tense they thrummed with i think a desire to jump across the table and hurt niley i want to make sure that you are gone lately the spirits have told howard of a beast that will aid the lady i think i am looking at the beast how did you find out i asked richard slid the glasses back in place and slid his chair back into the table his shoulders were hunched so hard the tshirt was straining at the seams the local vampires dont like you much niley said i approached them trying to gather information about the spear some of them have been in this area for long enough to have witnessed the event sadly they had not but they told me interesting things about you and richard and the master of the city in saint louis they said you were a m–πnage –∞ trois though richard seems reluctant to admit an interest in men dont believe everything that youre told niley especially from people who dont like us your enemies always make up better rumors than your friends niley pouted oh dear then my advances have been very unwanted indeed he laughed the smile faded i think it is time for the threat knock yourself out i said i think a tranquillizer dart from a distance for richard when he wakes he will be bound by silver chains and on his stomach naked i will rape him and i will enjoy it then i will let linus slit his throat and linus will enjoy that he turned cold eyes to me you anita i will give to linus for his master linus turned to me he looked the same but the skin on my back tried to detach itself and crawl away and hide every hair on my arm stood up in nervous rows evil whispered through that bright diner howard gasped hugging himself i stared at linus and didnt try to hide it i was scared of him and what lay inside him niley laughed deep and pleasant i think we understand each other at last anita richard turned and looked at linus the hair on his arms was standing at attention too he spoke looking directly at the sorcerer how you are fallen from heaven o day star son of dawn at the first line that awful power receded the skin creeping a little less linuss face was no longer pleasant richard said how you are cut down to the ground you who laid the nations low you said in your heart i will ascend to heaven above the stars of god i will set my throne on high isaiah with the last line the scent of evil retreated it lingered like perfume in an empty room but it was closed down for now impressive richard niley said so you are a true believer richard rose slowly from his chair he put a hand flat on the table and leaned across it i felt the prickling rush of energy like a hot thread pulled across my skin he lowered his sunglasses just enough for niley to see his eyes and i knew what he was doing i knew that niley was watching those brown eyes change to wolf amber richard spoke low and carefully and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not he slid his glasses back over his eyes stood and stepped away from the table he held his hand out for me i took it i let him lead me out of the restaurant shangda followed at our backs i risked a glance back i didnt turn to a pillar of salt but i saw nileys face and i knew knew without doubt that he would see us dead i didnt even ask richard if we were leaving town for real i knew the answer and frankly i was with him on the off chance that niley was right and the spear was here we couldnt let him have it but it was more than that richard had drawn a line in the sand good versus evil good cant tuck tail and run its against the rules it took about three hours for us to pack and pretend to leave town we put jamil in the back of the van with a coffin on either side of him to keep the stretcher from sliding around nathaniel had managed to get his lower back sliced up defending my honor though he admitted that he hadnt been fighting so much as getting in the way of an eager werewolf however it happened he got to ride in the back with the injured probably stretching on top of a coffin for all i knew cherry rode in back with them i think to act as a peace officer jamil didnt seem to like nathaniel much i drove the van richard followed in his fourbyfour with shangda and all the equipment hed brought for an entire summer of camping and studying large primates everybody else rode with me sheriff wilkes sent maiden and thompson to escort us out of town in a black and white or in this case a blue and white but the effect was the same thompson waved merrily as we drove past them out of the city limits it would have been childish to give him the finger so i didnt do it zane did it for me jason blew them a kiss we drove for over an hour to a prearranged rendezvous with verne we couldnt all stay at one house too many new people might raise suspicions so we divided up i didnt like it but i had to agree that all together we made too good a show i ended up driving to mariannes house i rode in the back of her truck with zane cherry and the coffins nathaniel got to ride in the truck cab because of his claw wound zanes gunshot wound seemed to be healing a lot faster than the claw marks i wasnt sure if it was because nathaniel was a slow healer or if bullet wounds just healed faster than claws the open bed of the truck was a very rough ride i wedged myself in the corner near the cab with damians coffin pressed against my ribs if i pressed my head back against the truck to brace my neck my teeth rattled if i sat up more my neck snapped with every pothole it was like an endless beating until my bones thrummed with it and i had a headache the size of idaho in the middle of my forehead the sun was like a smear of yellow fire in the sky it beat down unblinking unrelenting until sweat ran down my face and arms zane was in the corner opposite me shoved against ashers coffin his black tshirt had molded to him like a sweaty second skin cherry had chosen a white tshirt today the reddish dust of the road clung to the white material and mingled with the sweat until it was like dried blood my hair had turned into a mass of sweaty ringlets not those cute shirley temple ringlets nothing that neat just a curled mess zane and cherrys hair just lay slick and flat against their heads the three of us made no effort to talk we settled into the heat and bonejarring ride like it was a kind of coma something to be endured rather than shared the road spilled onto a paved road and the sudden smoothness was almost startling i could hear again thank god cherry said marianne yelled back to us car coming hide we all wiggled under the top layer of the tarp covering the coffins there was a second tarp and ropes underneath me the tarp smelled musty and dry it was a tossup whether it was cooler because of the shade or hotter because of the lack of air i thought i heard a car go by in a spill of gravel but marianne didnt tell us to get up so i didnt i could see zane through the hot dimness we looked at each other with dull eyes then i smiled he smiled it all started to be funny you just reach a level of discomfort where you either scream or laugh the truck lurched to a rattling stop in the sudden silence i could hear zane laughing cherrys voice came clearly what in hell is so funny were home boys and girls marianne said you can come out now zane and i crawled out into the open air still giggling cherry frowned at both of us what is so funny we both shook our heads you either got the joke or you didnt it could not be explained not even to ourselves marianne came to stand near me im glad to see youre in a better mood i ran my hands through my hair and could almost squeeze the sweat out of it might as well be in a good mood the days not going to improve marianne frowned pessimism is unbecoming in one so young she stood there looking cool and collected wearing a sleeveless white shirt tied off at the waist it wasnt a midriff but gave the illusion of one a pair of pale blue shorts and flat white tennis shoes completed the outfit her pale hair was in a bun the hair was all streaks silvery grey pale blond and white fine lines showed at her eyes and mouth that hadnt been visible last night over fifty but like verne her body was still thin and firm she looked cool comfortable and far too clean i need a shower i said i second the motion cherry said zane just nodded welcome to my home marianne said the truck was parked in a gravel driveway of a two story white house the house had yellow shutters and a pink climbing rose up one side of the front porch there were two tubs of white and pink geraniums at the bottom of the wide porch steps the flowers were lush and well watered the yard was brown and dying in the summer heat actually i approved i didnt believe in watering grass a small flock of speckled hens pecked in the dry dirt of the yard nice i said she smiled thank you the barn is over that way hidden by the trees ive got some dairy cows and horses the gardens behind the house youll be able to see it from your bedroom great thanks she smiled why do i think you dont care about my tomato crop let me take a shower and ill care i said we can unload the coffins then your two wereleopards can take a bath i hope theres enough hot water for three baths if two of you could double up it would conserve water im not sharing i said i looked at cherry she shrugged zane and i can share it must have shown on my face because she added we arent lovers anita though we have been it will be a comfort to touch each other its not sexual its she looked at marianne as if for help marianne smiled one of the things that binds a pack or a pard into a unit is touch they touch each other constantly they groom each other they care for each other i shook my head im not sharing a bathtub no one is asking you to marianne said there are many ways to forge a pack bond anita im not part of the pack i said there are many ways to be part of the pack anita i have found my place among them and i am not lukoi she left zane cherry and me to unload the coffins while she took nathaniel off to lie down cherry and zane helped stow the coffins in the basement then went off to take their communal bath the entrance to the basement was outside like an oldfashioned storm cellar the back door was all screen and wood it clanged loudly as the wereleopards went inside marianne met me at that door stepped through that door and blocked my way she was smiling and calm and seemed at peace in the center of her universe just seeing that content look on her face made me itchy and uncomfortable made me want to scream and lash out until her universe was as messy as my own how dare she be content when i was so confused what is so very wrong child i can hear your confusion like bees buzzing in the walls there was a stand of pine trees near the back of the house like a line of soldiers the air smelled like a perpetual christmas i usually like the smell of pine but not today i just wasnt in a christmas mood i leaned against the weathered boards of the house while she stayed on the small back porch looking down at me the firestar dug into my back i pulled it out and shoved it down the front of my jeans fuck it if somebody saw you saw verne i said she looked at me grey eyes calm unreadable i saw what you did to his neck if that is what you mean yeah thats what i mean your mark on his neck proves two things to all of us that you consider yourself his equal no small boast and that you are not happy with his hospitality to date are either of these untrue i thought about that for a moment then said i dont acknowledge anyone as dominant to me maybe they can beat the shit out of me or kill me but theyre not better than i am stronger doesnt mean better or more dominant there are those who would argue with you anita but i am not one of them and no im not happy with the hospitality to date i destroyed most of colins vampires for you guys verne was pleased as punch but he still didnt let me have my guns last night if id had my guns last night then the bad guys wouldnt have nearly killed jamil and jason and zane hell and me verne regretted last night or he would not have offered himself to you great fine but i didnt mean to mark him i didnt mean to do it do you understand marianne i didnt do it on purpose just like last night with the munin this morning i wasnt in control i was seduced by the scent of blood and warm flesh it was creepy she laughed creepy is that the best word you can come up with anita creepy you are the executioner and a force to be feared but you are still so young i looked up at her you mean naive you are not naive in the sense that it is usually meant i am sure you have seen more blood and death than i have it stains your power this violence you both attract it and pursue it but there is something about you that stays fresh and somehow perpetually childlike no matter how jaded you grow there will always be a part of you that would be more comfortable saying golly than goddamn i wanted to wiggle under the intensity of her gaze or run i am losing control of my life marianne and control is very important to me i would say that control is one of the most important things to you i nodded my hair catching on the peeling paint of the house i pushed away from the boards to stand in front of her in the dusty yard how can i get back control marianne you seem to have all the answers she laughed again that wholesomebedroom sound not all the answers but the answers you seek perhaps i know that the munin will come for you again it may be when you least expect it or when you need your precious control the most it may overwhelm you and cost the lives of people you hold dear as it could have last night all that saved richard from having to kill to get to you was vernes intercession raina would love that to drag one of us down to the grave i felt the munins pleasure in destruction you are attracted to violence but only as it serves a greater purpose it is a tool that you use well your old lupa was attracted to violence for its own sake as a destructive thing destroying was what she was about it is nicely ironic that someone so dedicated to negativity was also a healer life is just full of little ironies i said i didnt try to keep the sarcasm out of my voice you have a chance to make her munin her essence into something positive in a way you might help her spirit work through some of its karma i frowned at her she waved her hands my apologies ill keep the philosophy to a minimum i believe i can help you call and tame the munin i believe that together we can begin to harness all the different kinds of power you are being offered now i can teach you to ride not just the munin but this master vampire of yours and even your ulfric you are their key to each other anita their bridge their feelings for you are part of the binding that has been wrought between the three i can make you the rider and not the horse there was a fierceness in her face a force that made my skin react she meant what she said she believed it and strangely so did i i want to control it marianne all of it i want that more than almost anything right now if i cant stop it i want to control it she smiled and it made her eyes sparkle good then lets begin with our first lesson i frowned at her what lesson come into the house anita the first lesson is waiting for you if your heart and mind are open to it she went back inside without waiting for me i stood there for a moment in the summer heat if my heart and mind were open to it what the hell did that mean well as the clich–π goes only one way to find out i opened the screen door and walked inside lesson number one was waiting for me marianne led me to the room where shed settled nathaniel it was a large bedroom downstairs hours earlier the room would have been filled with morning light but now at nearly three oclock in the afternoon the room was dim almost dark the window was open and a breeze had finally found us spilling the white lacy curtains into the room a small oscillating fan sat on a kitchen chair so the fan could cool the bed the wallpaper was offwhite with a fine line of pink flowers there was a large brown water stain in the corner of the ceiling like a giant rorschach ink blot the bed was a brass fourposter that had been painted white the bedspread was quilted and looked homemade with a lot of purple and pinkflowered fabric marianne had folded the bedspread and placed it on top of a large cedar chest that was under the window too hot for quilts shed said nathaniel lay naked on the pink sheets marianne tucked the sheets to the tops of his thighs patting his shoulder in a motherly sort of way i would have protested his state of undress but i could see the wounds clearly for the first time something with claws had swiped him wide and deep starting about the middle of his back and slashing downward across the right side of his buttocks the wound was deep and ragged on his back growing more shallow as it worked down his body it must have hurt to have clothes over it hurt a lot i was surprised that nathaniel hadnt flashed me his wounds earlier he usually went to great lengths to show me his body what had changed marianne pointed to the phone beside the bed in case your police friend calls you ive got a cordless phone for normal calls but i use the bedside phone for pack business so no one can accidentally monitor the cordless phone i said marianne nodded she walked to the vanity which had a heavy oval mirror and marble knobs on the drawers when i was a little girl and i was hurt or lonely especially when it was so hot my mother would unbraid my hair and brush it shed brush it until it lay like silk down my back she turned with a brush in her hands even now when i am low one of my greatest pleasures is for some friend to brush my hair i looked at her are you suggesting i brush your hair she smiled and it was bright and charming and i didnt trust it no i am suggesting you brush nathaniels hair i kept staring at her come again she walked towards me offering me the brush that toocheery smile on her face part of what makes you vulnerable to raina is your own squeamishness im not squeamish prudishness then she said i frowned at her whats that supposed to mean it means that every time one of the lycanthropes disrobes you get embarrassed every time one of them touches you you take it sexually that isnt always what they mean a healthy pack or pard is built up of a thousand gentle touches a million small comforts its like building a relationship with a boyfriend every touch builds and strengthens it my frown deepened i thought you said it wasnt sexual it was her turn to frown a different metaphor then it is like building your relationship with a newborn baby every touch every time you feed him when hes hungry change him when hes wet comfort him when hes frightened the everyday intimacies forge a bond between you true parenthood is built over years of interdependency the bond between the pack is built much the same way i glanced back at the bed nathaniel was still lying there naked except for the sheets on his legs i turned back to marianne if he was a newborn baby id be fine with him being naked i might be afraid id drop him but i wouldnt be embarrassed and that is precisely my point she said she held the brush out to me if you could control the munin you could heal his wounds you could take his pain youre not suggesting that i purposely try to call raina no anita this is the first lesson not the graduation exercise today i simply want you to begin to try and be more comfortable around their nudity i believe that if you can desensitize yourself to the more casual sexual situations that raina will have less hold on you you draw away from situations like this and that leaves a void a place where you will not go willingly so raina spills into that void and forces you to go much farther than you would have gone on your own and what good will brushing nathaniels hair do she held the brush inches from me arms folded it is a small thing anita a thing to give him comfort while we wait for dr patrick to come patrick will give him a local for the pain but sometime before he is finished stitching him up the painkiller will wear off their metabolism is too fast for a local and giving more than that can be tricky it can be deadly in one with such a low aura of power as nathaniel i stared up at her meeting those calm serious grey eyes youre saying that hell be stitched up without a painkiller she just looked at me and thats my fault because i could heal him if i could control the munin marianne shook her head it is not your fault anita not yet but the munin is a tool like your guns or your necromancy once you learn how to control it it can do wonderful things you must look at the ability to call the munin not as a curse but as a gift i shook my head i think youve exceeded the lesson for the day marianne she smiled perhaps but take the brush do this one small thing not for me not for nathaniel but for yourself take back that piece of you that looks away from his body give raina less ground in your heart and if i cant help being embarrassed or thinking sexual thoughts and raina comes up and tries to eat me what then mariannes smile widened then i will help you child we will all help you that is what a pack is for nathaniel isnt lukoi any more than i am i said lukoi or pard it makes no difference to you anita you are queen of both castles growing comfortable with one will help with the other she actually took my hand and pried it out from under my elbow she put the hairbrush in my hand and closed my fingers over it be with him child wait for your phone call answer only the bedside phone only pack will call that number you cant possibly answer my other phone because you are in another state do not answer the door either you sound like youre going somewhere i said you must learn to be comfortable around your people anita that means without me looking over your shoulder she pulled me towards the bed by the arm she tried to make me sit on the bed but i just didnt bend with it short of pushing me onto the bed she had to leave me standing she tsked at me stand here and do nothing it is your choice child but at least stand here she left i was left standing in the middle of the room where id followed her like a child not wanting to be left alone on the first day of school the brush was still in my hand the brush looked as antique as the rest of the room it was wooden but painted white with a shine of varnish the varnish had a webbing of cracks but held i ran the pale bristles over the back of my other hand they were as soft as they looked silken like a babys brush i had no idea what the bristles were made out of i glanced back at nathaniel he was watching me out of those eyes of his his face was neutral as if it didnt matter but his eyes werent neutral they were tight waiting for the rejection waiting for me to leave him alone in the strange room naked and waiting for a doctor to come and stitch him up he was nineteen and lying there with that raw look in his eyes he looked it hell he looked younger the body was great when youre a stripper youve got to take care of yourself but the face the face was young and in the same gaze old nathaniel still had the most jaded eyes of anyone id ever met under the age of twenty no not jaded lost i walked around to the far side of the bed i laid the hairbrush on the pillow on the empty side of the bed nathaniel moved just his head turning to look at me no to watch me he watched me like every movement was important it was a level of scrutiny that made me want to squirm or blush or run it wasnt exactly sexual but it wasnt exactly not sexual either no matter what metaphors marianne used this was not the same thing as caring for an infant nathaniel was young but he was definitely not a child at least not childlike in the way that would have made this comfortable i slipped off the shortsleeved shirt there was no one to see the shoulder holster and it would be cooler of course it would really be cooler if i took off all the guns and the spine sheath but i wasnt that hot i did lay the firestar under the pillow it had a short enough barrel to sit or lie down with it but there is no such thing as a truly comfortable gun to wear if youre lounging around guns arent designed for comfort its one of the few things that are worn mostly by men that are as uncomfortable as a pair of high heels i crawled onto the bed kneeling still not within touching distance he was so easily hurt that i had to say it out loud im not upset with you nathaniel i just dont like playing student you like marianne but you resent her he said that made me blink a couple of times and stare at him he was right and it was more perceptive than id ever expected from nathaniel hearing him say something that smart made me feel better if there was a brain in that body then he wasnt just a submissive mess and maybe just maybe he was salvageable saveable it was the most positive thought id had all day i crawled to nathaniels side brush in hand i stared down at him stretched across the bed eyes watching me the look in his eyes stopped me it was too intense maybe he sensed it because he turned his head back so that i couldnt see his face all i could see was all that long auburn hair even in the dim light it was an incredibly rich color the darkest auburn id ever seen that was still truly auburn and not brown i smoothed my hand through his hair it was like heavy silk warm to the touch of course that could have just been the room the fan swept over the bed ruffling the sheets passing like a cool hand over my back nathaniels long hair stirred in the fans caress the sheet over his thighs blowing like a hand had moved them he shifted as the fan passed over his bare body then stillness his hair the sheet everything utterly still while the fan made its circuit it swept back spilling over everything in reverse the pink sheets nathaniels hair my chest this time blowing my own hair back from my face then past us and the heat wrapped around us like a suffocating hand the breeze from the window had died the white curtains lay like a painting until the small fan spilled over them i knelt in the hot room with the only sound the whir of the fan and the small tick it made every time it came to the end of its cycle i stroked the hairbrush through his hair and the stroke ended long before i got to the end of the hair id had hair down to my butt once upon a time when i was about fourteen but nathaniels hair was knee length if hed been a woman id have said his hair fell like a dress around him the hair lay in a soft silken pile beside his body so it wouldnt brush the wound i lifted the hair in my arms and it was like holding something alive the hair poured through my hands with a sound like dry water a rushing noise i had enough trouble taking care of shoulderlength hair i couldnt imagine the amount of effort that just washing it must take i was either going to have to divide the hair to either side and actually get up and move from side to side or sweep the hair back behind his head so it spilled across the bed i voted for that i pulled his hair behind his back and spilled it behind his head he moved his head as if snuggling into the pillow but other than that made no movement and said nothing how you doing i asked im fine he said his voice was soft neutral almost empty talk to me nathaniel i said you dont like it when i talk to you i leaned over him smoothing the hair back so i had a clear view of his face thats not true he turned his face enough to look up at me isnt it i leaned back from that direct gaze its not you talking i mind nathaniel its your choice of topics tell me what you want me to say and ill say it i can tell you what not to say i said what he asked dont talk about pornographic movies sadomasochism sex in general i thought about it for a second or two that hits the usual things you say to piss me off he laughed i dont know what else to talk about i started combing his hair across the bed the stroke was firm and flowing then i actually had to pick the hair up to finish the stroke the fan hit me with an armful of hair and the hair spilled around my face in a vanillascented cloud that tickled my face and neck talk about anything nathaniel talk about yourself i dont like to talk about myself why not i asked he raised up enough to look at me you talk about yourself okay then i didnt know what to say i just suddenly couldnt think of where to start i smiled good point forget i said it the phone rang and i gave a little yip nervous who me it was dolph anita yeah its me franklin niley unless its a different guy with the same name is an art dealer he specializes in mystical artifacts hes not picky about how he gets them either how not picky i asked hes based out of miami the cops there would like to tie him to at least half a dozen homicides but dont have enough proof every town he visits on business people disappear or turn up dead chicago pd nearly got him on the death of a wiccan high priestess last year but the witness went into a mysterious coma and hasnt come out yet mysterious coma i made it a question the doctors think it was magic of some kind but you know how hard that is to prove what do you have on his associates one hasnt been with him long a psychic named howard grant young no criminal record theres a black bodyguard milo hart hes got a seconddegree black belt in karate and has been in the pen once for attempted murder hes been beating people up for niley since he got out of prison five years ago the third is linus beck hes been in twice once for assault with a deadly second time for murder lovely i said it gets better dolph said better i asked how much better can it get becks murder conviction was a human sacrifice i let that sink in for a second or two how was the victim killed knife wound dolph said i told him about the body id just finished seeing direct attack by demons went out with the middle ages anita they wanted to make it look like a troll attack youve talked to them he said yeah why they wanted to threaten me i said i heard papers rustling on the other end why did they want to threaten you i told dolph almost everything i also told him i couldnt prove a damn thing i talked to a cop in miami he said that niley admitted two murders to him told him details but not under miranda and not useable in court he likes to taunt he thinks hes untouchable i said but the spirits say youre going to kill him so his pet psychic says when i put out the name and asked for info police all over the country and out of it are willing to give me anything they got if we can just nail this guy dolph said a bad guys bad guy i said hes not above doing his own killing anita at least two of the dead men down in miami they think were franks personal kills you watch your ass like a son of a bitch if you have anything that even looks like proof of a crime call me you dont have any jurisdiction here i said trust me on this anita you come up with some proof and i can get you somebody down there with jurisdiction ready and willing to put this guy away he on the blue hit parade hes made a career out of breaking the law and has never seen the inside of a jail cell for more than twentyfour hours a lot of people in a lot of states would like to see him gone ill see what i can do i said i dont mean dead anita i mean arrested i knew what you meant dolph he was quiet for a second i know you knew what i meant but i thought i should say it anyway dont kill anyone would i do something so illegal dont start anita sorry thanks for all the info its more than id hoped for after meeting him im not exactly surprised by any of it he is a very creepy guy creepy anita hes a hell of a lot more than creepy you sound worried dolph youre down there without a safety net anita the cops are not your friends thats an understatement i said but the state cops are down here on the murder now i cant come down there dolph said i would never ask you to he was quiet so long that i said dolph you still there im here he didnt sound happy you know how i told you not to kill anyone yeah i said ill deny this in court but dont hesitate anita if it comes down to him or you make the right choice my mouth was hanging open dolph are you telling me to murder him if i get the chance dolph was quiet again finally he said no not murder but i am saying dont let him get the drop on you you do not want to be at this mans mercy anita some of the bodies theyve found have been tortured hes real creative about it whats in that file that you havent told me about dolph they found one mans head floating in his pool there were no marks of a weapon like the head had been pulled off they never found the body it all reads like that anita not just violent but weird shit you going to post bail if i nail him and get caught you get caught we never had this conversation mums the word i said watch your back anita niley doesnt have any limits thats what all this paperwork means hes a total fucking sociopath anita and beck and hart are the same thing ill be careful dolph i promise dont be careful be ruthless i dont want to be identifying whats left of your body after he gets through with it you trying to scare me dolph yeah he said then he hung up i hung the phone up and sat on the bed in the hot hot room and i was afraid i was suddenly more afraid than i had been since we got here dolph didnt spook easily id never heard him like that not about anything or anybody nathaniel touched my leg whats wrong i shook my head i couldnt shake the bad feeling dolph mr law and order had encouraged me to kill someone unprecedented the police were telling me to break the law too weird but underneath the wonderment of it was the fear a fine trembling sense of unease demons i didnt like demons they didnt give a shit about silver bullets or much of anything else richard felt strong in his faith i envied him that i was having a crisis of faith right now i mean i was sleeping with the undead and had cheated on one lover with another i also had a few more kills to my credit than the last time id been touched by the demonic i wasnt feeling particularly pure and holy right now you needed that against demons you needed surety nathaniel laid his head on my thigh you look like youve seen a ghost i stared down at the naked man with his head in my lap no if i ran up against a demon now my house was made of glass and nothing throws stones like the demonic they know just where to hit so that the whole damn thing comes crashing down around your ears i was really not in the mood to find out how far from grace id actually fallen cherry came into the room shed slipped into a pair of jean shorts and a white midriff tank top her small breasts were pressed against the thin material i was a little too wellendowed to ever dream of going without a bra but small or not in that top she needed a bra i was a prude her short yellow hair was still damp she stalked into the room on those long legs managing to look both slutty casual and unnaturally graceful just watching her walk into the room made me want to move nathaniels head out of my lap force of will alone kept me from scooting away from him we werent doing anything wrong but it bothered me your turn cherry said ill wait with nathaniel is zane out yet i caught movement in the hall and it was zane he was wearing jean shorts too and nothing else the everpresent nipple ring was the only thing on his pale thin chest dont you ever take that thing out of your chest i asked he smiled if i take the ring out the hole will close up and ill have to get it pierced all over again i might get the other nipple pierced but i dont want to have to redo the first one i thought you liked pain i said he shrugged in some situations with naked women yeah he touched the ring pulling on it until the nipple stretched just a little the actual piercing hurt like a son of a bitch i looked at the slender toothin chest especially the part right next to his right arm there was a dark area where the shoulder attached to the chest but that was all is that all thats left of the bullet wound i asked zane nodded and sat down at the foot of the bed crawling onto the covers so he was beside nathaniel and far too close to me you can touch the wound if you want i frowned no thanks i started to back off the bed on all fours spilling nathaniels head gently to the covers i stopped myself marianne said that raina fed on my embarrassment my prudishness that if i could be more comfortable around small stuff raina would lose some of her power over me was it true i wasnt attracted to zane that moment last night had been pure raina she seemed to have been attracted to anything that had a pulse and some things that didnt i gritted my teeth and reached out towards zane he went very still face suddenly serious as if he had some clue how much it cost me to reach out to him i ran my fingertips over the wound the skin was smooth shiny like a scar but softer and more pliable i found myself running my hand over the wound exploring it it felt strangely plastic and at the same time soft like babys skin this feels cool zane grinned it reminded me of jason and that one thought relaxed a tension in my shoulders that i hadnt even known was there cherry came up behind him to slide her hands over his shoulders massaging them i never get over being amazed at how we heal i wanted to take my hand back just because cherry had touched him too i forced myself to keep my hand on the wound but id stopped exploring it just touching it was all i could manage the muscles can get tight when its healing cherry said you get spasms around it like the body heals too fast for the muscles to keep up i took my hand away slowly i sat on the bed watching cherry massage zanes shoulders nathaniel nuzzled my leg rolling his eyes up to me i didnt move away from him and he seemed to take that as permission to roll his head onto my thigh he nestled against me with a contented sigh zane rolled onto his back on the other side of me not touching me but watching me his eyes were very careful cherry stayed kneeling on the foot of the bed watching my face they all watched me like i was the center of their world id seen dogs in obedience trials watch their owners that way in dogs it was a good thing in people it was unnerving i didnt have a dog because i didnt feel responsible enough to take care of one now i suddenly had three wereleopards and i knew i wasnt responsible enough for them i laid my hand on nathaniels warm hair zane stretched his full sixfoot frame fingers and toes straining spine bowing like a big cat i laughed what am i supposed to do rub your tummy everyone laughed even nathaniel i realized with a shock that it was the first time id ever heard him laugh the laughter was young highschoolish lying naked in my lap with claw marks on his butt and he was laughing a fullthroated happy sound i was happy to hear it and nervous they were trying to make me their home because that was what an ulfric was supposed to be and a nimirra or nimirraj for a guy was the equivalent strangely there didnt seem to be a werewolf equivalent of a queen wolf sexism or some arcane shit i didnt understand yet id ask richard later ive got to go take my bath guys we could help zane said he licked my arm grimaced i like the taste of sweat but the gravel dust nathaniel raised his face enough to lick my other arm his tongue ran down my arm in a long slow glide i dont mind the dust he said voice low and soft i slid off the bed calmly slowly i did not go yuck or scream i was very calm and very relieved to be standing on the floor the bed had suddenly become crowded thanks but the bath will be fine dont answer any phone but the one by the bed and dont open the door to anyone but dr patrick aye aye captain zane said i slid the firestar down the front of my jeans and picked up my suitcase from against the wall i glanced back at the three of them from the doorway zane had lain down on the other side of nathaniel only propped on his elbow one hand touching nathaniels back cherry had curled at the foot of the bed she was running her hand up and down his thigh either the sheet had slid off or shed moved it so she could touch him there was nothing sexual on their faces nothing overt they looked like the opening scene for a porno movie to me but i was sure that when i left the room nothing would happen there was no anticipation between them no eagerness to have me gone so they could be alone their eyes still followed me they touched each other for comfort not for sex the discomfort was mine not theirs im sorry i went with mira nathaniel said suddenly that stopped me in the doorway youre a big boy nathaniel you had every right to find someone it was just your choice of partners that was bad zane began to rub his hand up and down nathaniels back like youd pet a dog nathaniel lowered his head so his hair slid around him like a veil hiding his face i thought you were going to be my mistress my top i thought for a long time that you understood the game that you were telling me not to have sex with anyone i was so good i didnt even touch myself i opened my mouth closed it opened it and didnt have a damn thing to say when you finally gave me permission to have sex with you it could have been straight vanilla it was the waiting the buildup the teasing that would have made it enough i found my voice i dont know what vanilla means nathaniel straight sex zane said normal stuff i shook my head whatever i am not playing with you nathaniel i would never do that he looked at me sort of sideways as if afraid to look me full in the face i know that now it was this trip that i realized you didnt even know we were playing a game you arent teasing me you dont think about me at all that last sounded sort of pitiful but i couldnt help that i keep having to apologize to you nathaniel half the time i dont even know what im apologizing for i dont understand how you can be my nimirra and not be my top but i know now that you see it as two separate things gabriel didnt what is a top i asked zane answered for him again a dominant to nathaniels submissive a submissive is called a bottom ah i am not gabriel i said nathaniel laughed but it wasnt a happy sound would you get mad if i said sometimes i wish you were i just blinked at him im not mad nathaniel you just puzzle the hell out of me i know im supposed to be taking care of you but i dont know how to do it he was like some exotic pet that id been given as a gift but the instructions didnt come in the box he lay back down on the pillow head turned so he could see me i went with mira when i realized you werent there for me i am there for you nathaniel but not in that way is this where you tell me we can still be friends he laughed and it was harsh you dont need a friend nathaniel you need a keeper i thought you were going to be my keeper i looked at cherry and zane how about you guys nathaniel is the most cherry hesitated the most broken of us gabriel and raina made sure we were all bottoms it was all we were trained for they were the tops always but but nathaniel she finally shrugged i knew what she meant nathaniel was the weakest of them the one who needed the most care i set the suitcase down and went to kneel by the bed i brushed his hair from his face so i could see his eyes well all be there for you nathaniel we are your pard your people well take care of you ill take care of you tears filled his eyes but you wont fuck me i took a deep breath and stood no nathaniel i wont fuck you i shook my head and picked up my suitcase id had all i could take for one afternoon if marianne wasnt happy with this little lesson then screw her maybe it wasnt supposed to be sexual but thanks to the way gabriel and raina had treated the wereleopards sex did keep coming up i was almost afraid to hear what mariannes solution to that one would be i ran out of hot water before i filled the tub and i didnt care the small whitetiled room was hot enough that a truly hot bath seemed a bad idea the single window was set high in the wall so if i was careful i wouldnt flash so i kept the window open even the drapes hoping for a stray breeze i sank down into the lukewarm water without a bubble in sight there was nothing but ivory soap and a partially burned white candle on the corner near the faucet i put the firestar on the small corner beside my head id tried the browning there but it was too big and kept trying to slide into the water i was completely underwater rinsing off my hair when i heard the door crash open i surfaced sputtering groping for the firestar i had the gun pointed before i even saw what was coming through the door even when i could see it didnt make any sense there was a woman in the doorway physically she was small about my size but she seemed to fill the room as if she took up more space than the eye could see her hair was long and brown the bangs had been allowed to grow and were thinned until the hair covered her face past her nose like a veil the hair was tinted ever so slightly blue she wore a jean jacket with no sleeves one bare muscular tatooed arm was holding the door so that the force of its being kicked in didnt send it flying back in her face under other circumstances id have been sort of disdainful except for the roil of power pouring from her she looked like shed gotten lost on her way to a punk biker bar psychically she felt like a wind from the mouth of hell hot and unfriendly there was so much power in the tiny room i felt like the bathwater should start to boil i kept the gun very steadily pointed at her chest i think it was the only thing that kept her just inside the door the look on her face was pure rage water dripped down my face from my hair tangling in my eyelashes i blinked resisting the urge to wipe the water away with my hands one step just one and i will pull this trigger i said roland appeared behind her in the doorway this just got better and better he was still tall tanned with his short curly hair his brown eyes swept the room and stayed on me crouching naked in the tub i kept the gun on the woman but it was tempting he touched the womans shoulders he spoke in that low rolling voice of his roxanne trust me she will kill you it made me not want to shoot him after all a second man peeked into the room he was taller than roland which made him over six feet i had enough of a glimpse to know he was native american and had long black hair then he ducked back eyes averted a gentleman he said roxanne this is not appropriate roxanne shook off rolands hands and started to walk farther into the room i fired the gun inches from her head the sound was thunderous the bullet took a bite out of the door and buried into the wall behind it was a glazer safety round so the wall stopped it i wasnt afraid of it going through the wall my ears rang with the shot in this tiny tiled room for a second if someone spoke i couldnt hear it i kept my eyes on roxanne she had stopped moving i had the barrel of the gun sighted in the middle of that pretty face it took a second or two of staring to realize that under all the tattoos the funky hair and the power she was pretty it was a traditional girlnextdoor pretty maybe it was the reasons for the tattoo and the hair when nature makes you look wholesome there are ways to cheat come on roxanne roland said back away she just stood there her power breathed around me like a warm cloud it was continuous and nearly suffocating id never been around any shapeshifter that had this kind of raw power or never around one this powerful who didnt even try to pass for human roxanne didnt vibrate with power she was power and i was about two seconds away from snuffing it out you would really kill me she said in a heartbeat i said i was getting tired of crouching in the water made it hard to be tough of course being naked didnt help either why didnt you kill me just now youre the lupa for vernes pack killing you would rain all sorts of crap down but i will do it roxanne now back out of the room close the door and let me get dressed if you still want to talk fine but dont ever ever pull shit like this again without that little gun you wouldnt be so confident yeah its a real confidence booster now get the fuck out of the room or i will shoot you marianne was suddenly in the doorway roxanne lets go have some tea and let anita get dressed i dont know what marianne did but even i felt calmer it was like she projected calm and peace into the room roxanne let roland and marianne drag her back through the door roxanne pointed a finger at me you insulted my ulfric and you will pay for that with or without the gun fine i said the door closed behind them the lock had shattered in a pile of splinters cherrys voice came through the door ill stay outside the door until youre out i can give you a warning if any more bad guys come bad guys was roxanne a bad guy or just psycho i was betting on the latter i got dressed in record time black jean shorts red shortsleeved knit top white jogging socks black nikes normally id have left off the shoulder holster inside a house but i threaded it through the belt and slipped it on the black holster looked very stark against the red shirt i put the firestar down the front of the shorts in the uncle mikes sidekick holster that it usually rode in i left off the spine sheath the leather was beginning to smell like sweat i was going to have to let it dry out before i could wear it again i smeared hair goop on the hair and let it go itd dry on its own call it a hunch but i didnt think roxanne was the patient type if i took the time for makeup or blowdrying my hair she might come looking for me i dont normally fuss anyway in truth the only reason id planned on it was the fact that richard was coming with dr carrie onslow and i was feeling insecure me insecure how sad richard had spent a great deal of the day with dr carrie onslow i was jealous and hated it of course first i needed to go confront a pissedoff werewolf i could figure out what the hell i was going to do with richard after i talked to roxanne one thing i was pretty sure of if i killed her it would be war between the two packs i did not want to bring that on our people not if it could be avoided anita the politician now that was sad i opened the door cherry looked up at me from her seat on the floor there was something on her face a hesitation that made me say what she pushed to her feet using the wall you just look aggressive you mean the guns the guns the red and black its all very stark and out there you think i should be wearing pink and something frilly to cover the guns cherry smiled i think that roxanne is almost psychotically dominant and if you go down there dressed like that shell take it as a sign that shes got to be just as aggressive you dont even know her i said she said very simply do you think im wrong put that way i dont have anything pink and frilly in my suitcase how about something not black not red i frowned at her will purple do it would be better she said i went back in and changed into a top that was identical cotton knit scoop necked but royal purple i had to admit that the purple was softer i kept the shoulder holster on but transferred the firestar to the small of my back theoretically i could draw it from there but it was not my favorite position the only shirt i could find to match the purple and cover the shoulder holster was thin and black and nylon which half defeated the point of wearing the cotton shirt to begin with but i had to admit that it looked better it was still black and not cheery but it wasnt so aggressive you couldnt see the guns i could have walked into any mall in the country and not gotten a second glance of course if i moved fast the shirt would blow back and flash but hey i wasnt planning to go jogging i opened the door a second time and said better cherry nodded smiling much better thank you for listening to me i know its not one of your best things i am not going to drag richards pack into a war because i couldnt tone it down a little the smile widened into something gentle and almost heartwarming you are a good lupa anita a good nimirra for a human youre positively excellent yeah but the human part is still true she touched my shoulder but we dont hold it against you i looked at her to see if she was kidding me but i just couldnt tell i think roxanne will hold it against me cherry nodded probably theyre all waiting in the kitchen the kitchen was tiled in black and white with some cracks starting in the hightraffic areas but the floor was mopped within an inch of its existence the tile gleamed softly in the indirect light that touched the windows like the bedroom nathaniel was staying in it would get morning light but not afternoon roxanne sat with her back to the door the edges of the white tablecloth trailed in her lap there was a stiffness to the way she held herself that said she knew i was there but she didnt turn around marianne sat across from her with a china teacup and saucer in front of her she looked at me like she was trying to tell me something with her eyes but i didnt know what that something was roland stood in the corner next to a hutch that held the china that matched the cup he had his arms crossed and looked very bodyguardish the other man id glimpsed stood in the opposite corner like a second bookend his arms were crossed and he looked very bodyguardish that was the only thing that was similar okay one other they both had great tans but i suspected like richard that the new guy wasnt just tanned his skin was a rich brown his brown eyes almost perfectly almond shaped they were almost too small for the rest of that face it was all angles high cheekbones broad forehead hooked nose every feature he had was aggressively male and ethnic his hair was long and black and moved like silky water as he looked at me the hair was a solid blackness like my own that black that has blue highlights in the sun he was also at least six foot two maybe an inch taller with shoulders to match he leaned against the wall exuding a sort of easy physical energy like someone who knew his potential and didnt sweat proving it thats ben hes your replacement sk—Üll until jamil is healed i wanted to turn down the offer of putting my life in a strangers hands but was almost sure it would be considered an insult i nodded hi he nodded back hello roxanne turned in the chair sliding her legs so she was sitting sideways in the chair verne meant our wolf to be an apology for allowing your people to be injured on our lands she looked full at me and those brown eyes were not friendly i think it is you who owes us an apology apology for what i asked she stood and that energy spilled through the room like water swirling around the ankles rising to the knees her power spilled outward upward as if she would fill the room with the breathing warmth of her presence she was so powerful it made my throat tight just standing this close to her shit i whispered you marked verne as if he were the least of us and not the greatest you mean the neck thing i said she slammed the chair back into the floor it fell with a loud crash i didnt go for a gun but it was an effort roxanne stood there breathing far too fast and far too shallow strong emotion makes the energy spill worse and her anger made the power bite and dance over my skin in a tight electric dance cherry moved up a little behind me zane appeared in the doorway and flanked her they stood to either side and a little back like bodyguards theyd do their best but i didnt want to test them against roland and ben i was pretty sure who would win and it wouldnt be us i am sorry that i marked verne i said lies roxanne said i truly didnt mean to do it she took a trembling step forward i didnt step back but maybe i should have she was too damn close at this range i might get the browning out but if i did id have to use it because shed be on top of me in seconds can someone please explain why shes so pissed and what we can do about it that wont end with one of us dead marianne stood slowly roxannes head pivoted and the intensity in that gaze even turned to another made my skin jump marianne held her hands palm out and advanced slowly around the table towards her lupa roxanne sees the marking as an insult to verne and the entire pack marianne said i got that i said i didnt mean it to be insulting i didnt mean to do it at all roxannes head turned slowly until she was staring at me her eyes bled from brown to a rich startling yellow while i watched i put my hand on the butt of the browning ease down wolfgirl a low rumbling growl crawled out of that slender throat marianne said if you truly didnt mean to be insulting then would you be willing to make amends i kept my gaze on roxanne but answered how would i make amends we could fight roxanne said i looked into her nearly glowing yellow eyes i dont think so marianne was standing sort of between us without actually standing between us you could offer your neck to roxanne in a public ceremony my eyes slid to marianne then back to the werewolf i am not letting her near my neck in public or private not on purpose you dont trust me roxanne said nope she took another painfully slow step forward marianne did step between us then if roxanne moved forward another inch her shoulder would bump marianne there is another ceremony marianne said i am not offering roxanne my neck i said no neck offering but you do exchange blows i felt my eyes widen i stared at the nearly snarling woman across from me you must be joking shed kill me ill let you hit me first roxanne said ive read this story no thanks roxanne frowned story sir gawain and the green knight i said she still looked puzzled the green knight lets sir gawain have the first blow gawain cuts off his head the green knight picks up his head under one arm and says my turn a year from now havent read it she said its not top twenty reading list i guess anyway the point is the same i can hit you as hard as i can and it wont hurt you you can flick your fingers in my direction and break my neck then we fight she said my hand was still resting on the browning ill kill you roxanne but i wont fight you coward you bet i said i felt richard brush over me through me like wind hed recognized roxannes car and was letting me know he was about to bring a human into the mess a human who didnt know who the monsters were i looked away to see his shape outside the kitchen door and i shouldnt have i didnt so much see roxannes fist as sense the movement my hand was already on the browning only seconds to pull it but that blur of movement caught me in the chin i had the sensation of falling but i didnt remember hitting the floor or didnt feel it i was on the floor looking up at the white ceiling marianne was beside me her lips were moving but no sound came out sound finally came through with an almost audible pop like a small sonic boom screaming everyone was screaming i heard richards voice and roxannes and others i tried to sit up and couldnt marianne touched my shoulder dont try to move i wanted to see what was happening but i couldnt make my body move i could feel it but it was like a great weight along my body as if what i really wanted to do was sleep i flexed my right hand and it was empty id dropped the browning somewhere frankly i was just happy to be able to move my hand i wasnt joking when id told roxanne she could break my neck without trying hard i kept flexing things waiting to be able to stand up i was finally able to move my head enough to see the rest of the room richard had roxanne around the waist feet completely off the ground roland and ben were trying to pull richard off of her shangda was trying to get dr carrie onslow to go back outside the kitchen door roxanne squirmed out of richards arms she strode over to me and zane and cherry moved like a wall between us she shoved between the two of them screaming your turn bitch your turn she was standing there sideways with the two wereleopards trying to hold her without hurting her her right leg was flexed forward i think only marianne heard me say my pleasure i kicked roxanne just below the kneecap aiming up the kneecap popped out of its socket and she went down shrieking i kicked her twice in the face blood blossomed from her nose and mouth i got to my feet no one tried to help me the room had suddenly fallen so quiet you could hear roxannes breathing too loud too fast she spat blood on the floor i walked around her and the wereleopards until i was close to the table ben and roland still held richard but it was like theyd forgotten why they were doing it shangda picked carrie onslow up and carried her out the door with her yelling richard it was one of those moments when time seems to slow and stretch and happen too fast all at the same time i heard roxanne say i will kill you for that but i dont honestly remember whether i picked the chair up before or after she said it i only remember having the chair and when she leaped at me i smashed the chair into her like youd use a baseball bat taking the arms way back throwing my shoulders and back muscles into it the shock of the blow left my fingers and hands tingling but i kept the grip on the chair roxanne was on all fours on the floor but she wasnt down i raised the chair for another blow as her power flowed over me like a scalding wind i smashed the chair down with everything i had she caught it and tore it out of my hands i backed up and pulled the firestar roland yelled no guns i glanced at richard he said no guns the look on his face was enough he was scared for me so was i no guns were they kidding roxanne tried to get to her feet but the knee wouldnt hold she fell and the chair thudded into the floor she screamed and threw the chair at me i had to dive for the floor to avoid it she came for me on hands and one leg in a movement almost too fast to follow i had plenty of time to shoot her but i wasnt supposed to shoot her i crab walked backwards trying to stay away the firestar was still in my hand i yelled richard the marks suddenly opened between us like a floodgate i was bathed in the scent of his skin and the distant musk of fur roxanne hesitated in that maniac skittering crawl her pretty face began to stretch outward as if a hand were pushing out from the inside a muzzle bloomed in the middle of that human face covered in human skin with a line of lipstick where lips used to be i reached down that line of power between richard and myself i wrapped the scent of him the feel of him the jittering play of energy i could suddenly feel the moon in the daylight sky and knew knew in every cell of my body that tomorrow night was it tomorrow night i would be free and for an instant i wasnt sure whose thought that was richards or his beasts i left the firestar on the floor and got to my feet with the window behind me i knew richard wouldnt let her kill me but i also knew she was going to hurt me id thrown a werewolf through a window once upon a time it had stopped the fight it was all i could think of of course roxanne had to cooperate and run at me like a maniac to set herself up for the throw if she came at me slower it wouldnt work she came at me slower in a limping run i was out of ideas one thing i knew if she touched me with those claws or that mouth i might be a lupa for real next month time was in that crystalline run slow and fast slow and glitteringly fast i thought of several things to do and wouldnt be fast enough to do any of them but id go down trying richard was yelling no claws roxanne no claws i dont think roxanne heard him she swiped at me with those monstrous claws and i ducked under the swinging arm i ducked blows that were too fast to see avoided her like i knew where shed be it was richard the marks but it was too confusing too new for me to be able to fight with it i could use it to avoid her but only for so long i ended up on my back on the floor pointing the firestar up at her she was coming with claws and teeth and i was out of options the door burst open and verne yelled roxanne no i felt his power crash through the room like the lid on a boiling pot something thrown over the heat to hold it contain it but it didnt stop it ben and roland were suddenly hanging onto roxanne dragging her back from me if verne had given an order to them i hadnt heard it roxanne was cutting them up slicing their arms open and they were taking it verne was still yelling i lied roxanne i lied she didnt proposition me roxanne went very still in their arms she spoke around that only partly human mouth what did you say lucy came in behind verne through the stillopen door she shut the door and leaned against it smiling enjoying the show i said i lied verne said im an old man and you are beautiful and powerful and thirty years younger than i am i told you when she marked my neck that she propositioned me she didnt roxanne relaxed in the grip of her bleeding bodyguards you could feel the tension seep away and with it her flesh her face her hands flowed until she stood human again her nose was bloody where id kicked her you can let me go she said i wont hurt her they didnt let her go they looked at verne how about me darling he said you going to hurt me when we get home ill kick the shit out of you but not here not now verne smiled roxanne smiled and both smiles were the same it was more than lust though that was mixed in with it it was a look that couples have like a secret language a look that excludes everyone else and cannot be explained i looked at richard they be crazier than we are he smiled at me and the smile warmed me down to my nikes i smiled back and realized with a jolt that tingled through my entire body that we had our own secret look god id missed him lucy stalked into the room on a pair of platform shoes purple shortshorts and what looked like a lavender bra but probably wasnt she sashayed up to richard slipping both of her arms through one of his hes rejected me for you sweetie she said in a voice that was too pleasant for the anger in her eyes i looked at richard i dont think he dumped you because of me she pushed away from richard to stand in front of me i had the gun in my hand i figured i was safe the marks with richard faded pulled back replaced with the knowledge that we were a couple again i valued that a hell of a lot more than the marks i can do things for him in bed that your human body could never do i can take every ounce of strength every thrust and it just feels good it doesnt have to be gentle with me careful with me which hit a little close to home which is my only excuse for what i said next gee lucy i dont know he spends one night with me and drops you like yesterdays news either youre not that good a lay or im better her face narrowed down eyes wide for a second i thought she might cry i didnt want her to cry that would spoil it and make me feel like a shit lucy turned away from me bringing her hands to cover her face damn i looked past her to richard the look on his face was not happy with me i couldnt blame him on this one i didnt see lucy turn i felt it i felt the air move as she whirled her hand caught me across the face i had the sensation of falling but if i hit the ground i didnt remember it i woke to darkness and the smell of clean sheets i blinked at the strange windows and the spill of moonlight on the floor i didnt recognize the room once i realized i wasnt anywhere id ever been tension filled me like water i heard someone behind me and that raised the tension another notch i tried to lie still but i knew my breathing had changed if they were human they might not have noticed but i just didnt know that many humans right now anita its damian i rolled over onto my right side and it hurt my right arm was bandaged from my palm to about the middle of my forearm it didnt hurt that much but i couldnt remember how id injured it the vampire was sitting in a chair by the door his long red hair looked a strange pale brown in the dark he was wearing the vest and pants of a very nice probably tailored business suit it might have been black or navy or even dark brown his skin glowed pale against the darkness of the cloth what time is it i asked youre the only one wearing a watch he said i raised my left hand in front of my face and hit the little button that made it glow the glow seemed brighter than it should have because of the darkness god its after eleven ive been out for hours i lay back on the bed did it occur to anyone to take me to a hospital the suns only been down for a little over two hours anita i dont know what choices were made when asher and i woke we were in the basement here we fed then i took richards place here by your bed where is richard i think hes at their lupanar but im not certain i glanced at him he seemed somehow distant you didnt ask any questions i was told to stay here and guard your rest what more did i need to know you arent a slave damian youre allowed to ask questions i got to sit here in the dark and watch you sleep what more could your pet vampire ask that last had a bitter edge to it i sat up slowly because i still felt wobbly whats that supposed to mean i tried to prop my back against the heavy wooden headboard but needed more pillows under me i tried to push them under me with my right hand and it hurt it was a nice sharp ache i remember lucy hitting me but what happened to my arm damian put one knee on the bed and helped prop the pillows under my back he even found an extra one for me to lay my right arm on richard said lucy tried to pull your arm off that bit of knowledge left me cold and scared jesus a woman scorned pillows better he asked yeah thanks he got to his feet and started to move back to the chair i said dont i held my left hand out to him he took my hand his skin was warm to the touch there was a light dew of sweat on his palm vampires can sweat but they dont do it often i squeezed his hand staring up into his face the moonlight was strong so i could see his face his skin was pale almost luminous those brilliant green eyes were just liquid darkness by moonlight i drew him to sit beside me youve fed tonight or your skin would be cold so why the sweat he drew his hand out of mine turning his face away you dont want to know yeah i do i touched his chin with my fingertips turning his face back to me whats wrong dont you have enough to worry about without bothering with me tell me whats wrong damian i mean it he let out a long shaking breath there youve done it a direct order tell me i said i was happy to sit here in the dark and watch you sleep i think if richard had known just how happy he would have made asher do it i frowned at him youve lost me you feel it too anita not as strongly as i do but you feel it feel what damian this he placed his hand against my face and i wanted to rub my face against his skin i had a momentary urge to pull him down on the bed beside me not for sex necessarily but to touch him to run my hands over that pale skin to bathe in the power that animated his flesh i swallowed hard and drew back from his hand what is going on damian youre a necromancer and im the walking dead youve raised me from the dead twice youve called me once from my coffin and once back from the edge of true death youve healed me with your powers i am your creature i have made vows of loyalty to jeanclaude as my master of the city and i honor them but you i would follow into hell itself not out of duty but out of desire i can think of nothing better than to be by your side nothing pleases me more than doing what you ask when im near you i find it very hard to do almost anything large like feeding or leaving your presence without asking your permission i just stared at him i didnt know what to say not uncommon for me today but with him sitting so close in the dark room i had to say something damian i i didnt mean for anything like this to happen i dont want you to be some sort of undead servant i know he said but i also understand why the vampire council made it a habit to kill necromancers i dont serve you out of fear i want to do it when i am with you i am happier than without you its a little like being in love but much more frightening i knew we had a connection i even knew why we had it i just didnt have any idea it was this strong for you i said i didnt realize you felt drawn to me as i am to you until last night you could have chosen asher he adores you and you remember being in his bed but you chose me to kiss me to hold i dont think it was an accident i shook my head i dont know i dont remember everything clearly from last night the munin is sort of like being drunk do you remember what you said to me i said a lot of things but my voice was soft and i was very afraid i did remember the phrase he was searching for you said dont bleed me fuck me yep that was the phrase just remembering it was so embarrassing i squirmed it was my turn to look away it was the munin talking i said youre one of the few males that i hang around with that raina never had sex with maybe she wanted something different he touched my face turned me back to meet his eyes that isnt it and you know it i pulled back from his hand look my plate is like full to overflowing with guys right now im flattered thanks for the offer but no thanks and how happy are you with the two men in your bed right now he asked youve had sex with richard now and the marks are binding you tighter than ever did everyone know that was a possibility but me i asked jeanclaude forbade me from telling you i thought you had a right to know i felt jeanclaude wake this morning before ten i felt him wake damian i felt the fierceness of his joy his triumph i tried to cross my arms over my chest and the right one wouldnt cooperate damn it to hell i was the servant of my original mistress for a very long time anita the thought of being your servant anyones servant terrifies me he touched the bandages on my right arm but i see them using you anita i see them withholding information from you he cradled my bandaged hand in both of his i swore oaths to jeanclaude but its your power that makes my heart beat your pulse i can taste like cherries on my tongue i drew my hand out of his what are you saying damian im saying that you shouldnt be the only one of the three that doesnt know whats going on and you can tell me i said he nodded i can answer your questions in fact if you make them orders i cant refuse to answer them youre handing me the keys to your soul damian why he smiled teeth a dim whiteness in his face because i serve you before i serve anyone else i tried fighting it but i cant so im through fighting i give myself to you willingly even eagerly if you mean what i think you mean didnt asher say something last night about if i had sex with you jeanclaude would kill you yes he said i looked at him i may be good damian but no ones worth dying for i dont think hed kill me jeanclaude has questioned me about the bond i feel with you he has has he yes and hes pleased he thinks its another sign of your increasing powers as a necromancer hes right jeanclaude knew you were obeying me without wanting to and he didnt tell me i said he thought it would upset you when was he going to mention this little fact to me hes the master of the city he doesnt answer to me i dont know what he plans to tell you or when okay what other powers can i expect to gain through the marks he lay down on the other side of the pillow hed gotten for my injured arm he propped himself up on one elbow long legs stretched out the length of the bed their physical strength their sight hearing you could gain almost every power they have without giving up your humanity though youd probably have to take the fourth mark to gain the full powers no thanks i said eternal life without having to die for it anita its tempted many over the centuries ive had too many surprises in the last two days damian im not tying myself any closer to jeanclaude you say that now but let a few more years pass and you may change your mind eternal youth anita its not a small offering i shook my head what else can i expect from the marks theoretically any power they possess thats not typical for a human servant is it they all gain some strength stamina healing resistance to injury immunity to disease and poison though again without the fourth mark im not sure how much of that youve gained im not sure jeanclaude or richard know either until you pull another rabbit out of your hat was the munin a surprise to them oh yes damian said he lay his head on the edge of the pillow i wasnt using he rolled onto his back so he was looking up at me jeanclaude knew of the munin but hadnt really thought that they were the spirits of the dead and what that would mean for you even necromancers of legend dont control the munin the necromancers of legend dont have a bond with an alpha werewolf i said thats what jeanclaude thinks too i settled lower in the nest of pillows its so great that hes talking about me to everyone but me damian rolled so that he was staring up at me i know how much you value honesty and in all honesty jeanclaude could not have known that you would gain these powers a human servant is a tool to be used so it is good if it is a powerful tool but you seem to be gaining such power that it may at some point be questionable who is master and who is servant perhaps it is the fact that you are a necromancer jeanclaude told me before i took the marks that he wasnt sure who would be master and who would be servant because of my necromancy but he didnt really explain it i guess i should have asked if hed told you all this before the marks were offered would you have taken them upon yourself i took the marks to save both their lives not to mention my own but if youd known would you have done it he rolled onto his side face so close to my arm i could feel his breath against my skin i think so i couldnt let them both die one maybe i could have lost one of them but not both not both if i could have saved them then jeanclaude has kept all this from you for nothing hes angered you for nothing yeah im pissed it makes you not trust him damian moved that one inch closer until his cheek rested against my upper arm yeah it makes me not trust him worse yet it makes me not trust richard i shook my head i never thought hed keep anything from me let alone things this important it makes you doubt them damian said i stared down at the vampire just his cheek rested against my arm the rest of his body stretched down the length of the bed but didnt touch me this doesnt seem like you damian what doesnt seem like me he asked his hand slid from where it rested on his side to the sheets that one pale hand lay between our bodies not touching just waiting this all this its not you you dont know anything about me anita you dont know what im like not really what do you want from me damian right now to put this hand around your waist and if i said yes is that a yes he asked what would richard say what would jeanclaude say fuck them yes i said he slid his hand over my waist until his arm rested across my stomach it would have been natural to cuddle the body after the arm but he didnt he kept that artificial distance between us i ran my left hand up and down that pale arm playing over the small hairs on his arm it felt terribly right to touch him as if id been wanting to do it for a very long time i didnt want him to hold me i wanted to hold him it was a very different feeling than what i felt for richard or jeanclaude damian was right it was the necromancy it wanted to touch him explore the edges of the power that bound us the power that animated him my own personal power is closer kin to jeanclaudes than to richards it is a cool power like an unfelt wind that plays over the mind and body i let that cool thread spill out through my hand down damians arm i thrust it into him like an invisible hand shoved it into that pale body and felt an answering spark deep inside him i felt my power flare and recognize a piece of itself whatever had animated damian before was gone i animated damian now he was truly mine which of course was not possible he slid his body that last inch so that the length of him lay against me from my waist to my feet he slid one leg over my legs pressing himself against me youre trying to seduce me i said but my voice was too soft too private he laid a soft kiss on my arm am i seducing you or have you already seduced me i shook my head get up and get out damian you want me i can feel it the power wants you not me i dont want you the way i want richard or jeanclaude im not asking for love anita just to be with you i wanted to run my hands down his body i knew that i could explore that body touch every inch of it and he wouldnt stop me it was both inviting and frightening i slid off the bed letting damian have the whole thing to himself i could stand no dizziness great we are not doing this damian we are so not doing this damian propped himself up on his elbows watching me if you give me a direct order i must obey you anita even if that order contradicts one that jeanclaude has given me i frowned at him what are you saying dont you wonder what else hes forbidden me to tell you damian asked you little bastard he sat up swinging his long legs off the side of the bed dont you want to know i stared down at him for a heartbeat yes damn you yes i want to know you have to order me to tell you i cant do it otherwise i almost didnt do it i was afraid of what he would say afraid of what else jeanclaude had been hiding from me i order you damian to tell me all the secrets that jeanclaude has forbidden you to tell me his breath came out in a long sigh free at last jeanclaude asher and even my master are all descended from the line of belle morte beautiful death she is our council master have you ever wondered why hundreds of years ago most personal accounts of vampires said they were hideous monsters walking corpses no and what does that have to do with anything ive waited a long time to tell you this anita let me tell it i sighed fine tell me no one thought of a vampire as a sexual object in the seventeen hundreds there were a few tales of beautiful vampires but they were all tricks not real but then things changed most personal accounts speak of beauty and great sexual allure he slid off the bed and i backed up i didnt want him too close i wasnt sure who i trusted less him or me when i backed up he stopped moving and just stood there looking at me the council decides which of them will send their vampires out to make more for thousands of years it was the queen of nightmares our leader or morte damour the lover of death and the dragon but they grew tired of the games and retreated inside the council chambers you rarely see them shewhomademe took me to court with her more than once its where i met jeanclaude belle morte beautiful death sent forth her people to populate the world with vampires jeanclaude asher and i descend from her line even her blood cannot make the ugly beautiful though all is improved by her touch but it is more than that some in her line have the power of sex they live on it breathe on it they feed on it like colin and my old master fed on fear they can gain power through sex and use it as a second lure for mortals he stopped and looked at me finish it damian i said jeanclaude is one of these in another time he would be considered an incubus asher and i are not like him it is a rare power even among those who descend more directly from belle morte so jeanclaude can feed off of sex like colin can feed off fear so what damian moved towards me and i let him touch my shoulder dont you understand jeanclaude gains power through sex not just intercourse but sexual energy lust it means that every time you have sex it is power that every intimate act between the three of you binds the marks tighter and increases your power i felt almost faint when was he going to tell me in jeanclaudes defense he says it didnt work this way the first time he marked you the sex wasnt such a strong power focus you were three marks deep before you broke away and it didnt work like this between you he thinks its the addition of richard thats pushed it over the edge what do you get out of this damian what do you get out of telling me all this i stared up at him in the dark my mistress controlled me for centuries with her fear and her sex you deserve the truth all of it i pulled away from him turned my back on him it made perfect sense jeanclaude gave off sex like other people wore cologne it explained why his first business was a stripper club lots of sexual energy to feed off did it change anything i wasnt sure i just wasnt sure i stared out the window forehead pressed to the cool glass the curtains blew gently in the night breeze does richard know that jeanclaude is some kind of incubus i dont think so damian said power breathed on the wind i could almost smell it like ozone in the air it raised the hair at the back of my neck it wasnt vampire or shapeshifter i recognized it for what it was necromancy somewhere close by someone was using a power very similar to mine i turned to damian colins human servant is she a necromancer he shrugged i dont know shit i cast outward searching for asher my power touched him and was thrown backwards out away i ran for the door damian followed me asking what is it whats wrong i had the browning naked in my hand when i hit the yard damian saw them before i did and he pointed at them colins human servant stood at the edge of the trees almost lost in shadows and darkness asher stood a few yards in front of her he was on his knees i fired at her as i ran the shots went wild but it broke some of her concentration and i could feel asher again his life was being pulled out of him like a fish on a string i could feel his blood thundering against his skin his heart leaped in his chest like a caged thing struggling to get out and it was her his heart was trying to get to as if she could pull his heart from his chest from a distance i forced myself to stop running i stood there and sighted down my arm i felt movement from above i looked up in time to see barnabys pale face coming at me like some giant bird of prey then damian was off the ground and the two vampires rolled into the sky struggling i was close enough to see ashers face now he was bleeding from every opening eyes mouth nose he was a mask of blood his clothes were soaked in it he fell forward onto all fours i shot the woman i shot her in the chest twice she fell slowly to her knees looking at me she looked surprised i heard her say were not allowed to kill each others human servants if colin hadnt known id kill you hed have come himself that made her smile for some reason she said i hope he dies with me then she collapsed facedown on the ground even by moonlight i could see the exit holes in her back like great gaping mouths asher stayed on all fours blood dripping from his mouth i knelt by him touched his shoulder and the shirt was bloodsoaked asher asher can you hear me i thought it was you he said in a voice thick with things that should never be in a living throat i thought it was you calling me he coughed blood onto the ground i looked up into the sky and there was no sight of damian and barnaby i screamed for help and no one answered i put my arms around asher and he collapsed into my lap i cradled as much of him into my lap as i could get i had to lean over him to hear his voice i thought you had called me out into the night for a rendezvous isnt that ironic he coughed so hard that it was hard to hold him thicker things than blood spilled from his mouth i held him while he bled his life away on the ground and screamed damian i heard a distant scream but that was all dont die asher please dont die he coughed until something dark and black came out his mouth blood poured out of his mouth in a near steady stream i touched his skin and it was cool to the touch if you fed off of one of the lycanthropes would it be enough to save you if its soon perhaps his voice was soft and thick i touched his forehead and came away with chill sweat how badly are you hurt he ignored me speaking very softly know this anita that seeing myself through your eyes has healed my heart my throat was tight with tears please asher dont a drop of pure blood slid out of his eye be happy with your two beaus dont make the same mistakes that jeanclaude and i made all those long years ago he touched my face with a hand that was slick with blood be happy in their arms ma cherie his eyes fluttered if he passed out we might lose him there was nothing in the night but the sounds of cicada and the wind where the hell was everyone asher dont pass out his eyes fluttered open but he was having trouble focusing i felt his heart hesitate skip a beat he could live without his heart beating but i knew that this time when the heart went it was over he was dying nikki had broken him inside too badly for healing i put my right wrist encased in white bandages in front of his mouth take my blood to drink from you is to give you power over any of us i do not want to be your slave any more than i already am i was crying tears so hot they burned dont let colin kill you please please i held him against me and whispered dont leave us asher i felt jeanclaude all those miles away i felt his panic at the thought of losing asher dont leave us not now not now that weve found you again tu es beau mon amour tu me fais craquer he actually smiled i shatter your heart eh i kissed his cheek kissed his face and cried hot tears against the harsh scars of his face je tembrasse partout je tembrasse partout i kiss you all over mon amour he stared up at me je te bois des yeux dont drink me with your eyes damn it drink me with your mouth i tore the bandages away from my right wrist with my teeth and put my bare warm flesh against his cold lips he whispered je tadore fangs sank into my wrist it was sharp and deep his mouth locked against my skin his throat convulsed swallowing i stared into his pale eyes and felt something in my head part like a curtain some shield shattered one moment it was one continuous ache almost nauseating then there was nothing but the spreading warmth i didnt even have time to panic asher rolled over my mind like a warm lip of ocean pleasurable caressing it burst over me in a skintingling breathstealing rush that left me gasping and wet then asher was kneeling above me laying me gently on the ground i lay staring at nothing riding the sensations up and down my body id never let any vampire do me like this never let them steal my mind while they stole my blood i hadnt even known he could do it not to me he kissed me on the forehead forgive me anita i did not know that i could embrace your mind i did not know that any vampire could he stared down at my face searching for some reaction i couldnt give him one yet he drew back enough to see my face clearly i feared you would possess me as you possess damian if i fed from your blood without using any of my powers i did try to scale your shield break your barriers but i did it to protect myself from your power i did not dream that i could breach such impenetrable walls he started to touch my face then stopped his hand falling to his lap the marks that bind you to jeanclaude protect you from him embracing your mind but he was never as good at this as i was i should have thought of that before i just lay there halffloating nothing was real yet i couldnt think couldnt speak he raised my hand and pressed it against his scarred cheek i drew back as soon as i realized what i had done it was just how do you say a quickie it was only a small taste of what it could have been anita please believe me he stood and i couldnt follow the movement i lay on the ground and tried to think jason knelt beside me i was aware enough to wonder where the hell hed come from he wasnt staying at mariannes or was he its your first time he asked i tried to nod but couldnt now you know why i stay with them he said no i said but my voice was distant as if it wasnt my voice at all no i dont you felt it you rode him how can you not love it i couldnt explain it it had felt wondrous but as the glow began to fade the fear welled up big and black enough to swallow the world it felt amazing and that had been a quickie as he put it i never wanted anything more from asher because if it was much better than this i might chase the rest of my days for another taste and jeanclaude could not give it to me the marks prevented him from rolling my mind it was one of the things that made the difference between servant and slave i would never get this with jeanclaude never and i wanted it i hadnt wanted asher to die now i wasnt so sure asher came back to stand over me we stared at each other there were people in the dark now someone had a flashlight they flared it over me i was left staring in the brightness nearly blind the light stood harsh on ashers face highlighting the reddish tracks of tears dont hate me anita i could not bear it if you hated me i dont hate you asher my voice still sounded thick and heavy with that golden edge of pleasure i fear you he just stood there tears sliding down his face the tears slid in reddish lines down the smooth skin of his left side the tears got lost in the scars on the other side and were beginning to collect in a reddish stain on the stiff skin worse he whispered worse i think i kicked everyone out except jason he got to stay because they started arguing that i couldnt be left completely alone had i forgotten that people were trying to kill me had i forgotten that jeanclaude had said hed kill them all if i died that last did not win friends and influence people with me my comment had been if we all died i guess thatd solve everything which sort of put an end to the arguments jason lay on the bed propped in the nest of pillows he tried to roll onto his side then stopped in midmotion with a small sound of pain he moved stiffly like things hurt which was what had gotten him a place on the bed instead of the chair i was pacing the room i had a little circuit mapped out foot of the bed windows far wall near wall with the door you know that youve walked past the foot of the bed twenty times and thats just since i started counting jason said shut up i said id put all my guns back on not because i thought i needed them but because they were familiar the tightness of the shoulder holster the digging of the firestar in its innerpants holster made me feel more like myself i was the only one of the three of us who carried guns it was one thing i knew that i hadnt gotten from either of them it was mine guns this particular brand of violence was all mine i needed something that was all mine right now jason moved over on his side slowly an inch at a time it took him until id made the circuit and was back at the foot of the bed before he made it to his side with a look of relief he and jamil had been moved to this house so that all the injured could be in one place roxanne was just down the hall with ben sitting guard apparently id been channeling enough of richards power that they thought she might have a concussion i wasnt sure if ben was supposed to be guarding her from me or the other way around dr patrick was down in the kitchen stirring the stew that marianne had left us zane and cherry were here but all the other shifters had gone to the lupanar they were going to finish the ceremony that had been interrupted last night bully for them asher was somewhere in the house i didnt know where and didnt want to know too much was happening too damned fast i needed some time to regroup and i wasnt going to get it there was a knock on the door who is it i asked its damian go away theres a vampire down here with one of sheriff wilkess deputies they say they have to talk to you or richard they arent treating this like police business that got my attention i stopped pacing and went to the door damian stood there still wearing the vest that barnaby had ripped all the buttons off of when colins human servant died barnaby had given up the fight and flown away damians suit was black in bright light and made his skin look unbelievably white what did they say exactly i asked just that they had a message for the two of you from frank niley fuck i said softly theyre sitting in the kitchen with dr patrick and asher tell roxanne and jamil that the bad guys are here ill go down and talk to them the man has a gun damian said so do i i said i walked down the hall and damian fell in step behind me jason called from the door wait for me follow at your own pace jason im not waiting for you to trip down the stairs dont let her get killed damian he said i called back over my shoulder hell do what i tell him to do an hour or so of thinking about everything i had learned had not improved my mood i clattered down the stairs damian followed like a soundless shadow at my back why hadnt wilkes and his men stormed the place id really expected them to just start shooting if they found out we hadnt left town what message could they have from niley and where did the vampire come in dolph hadnt mentioned anything about niley traveling with a vamp dolph hated vamps enough that he would have mentioned it so many questions and for once i was going to get them answered almost as soon as i thought of them how refreshing the kitchen looked normal theyd scrubbed the blood off the linoleum and placed a fresh lace tablecloth on the table deputy thompson sat in one of the kitchen chairs he was in civvie clothes no uniform a tall thin vampire that id never seen before sat in the chair beside him dr patrick sat in the chair facing them with his back to the hallway to us nathaniel took up the last chair he was staring at the vampire zane stood with his back against the sink asher leaned against the china cabinet close enough to thompson that he could have touched him and certainly could prevent him from pulling the gun the gun in question was a berretta mil in a shoulder holster same gun as on duty just in a different holster letting asher that close was careless but thompson didnt seem to think that he smiled at me and the smile was confident arrogant like he had me where he wanted me and i couldnt do anything about it what was going on howd you find me i asked he stuck a thumb in the vampires direction the local master of the city told us he could still feel you in town they helped us hunt you down evidently youre easier to find than your boyfriend something about your power attracts them i stared at the vampire his face was unreadable pale and empty his eyes were dark grey his hair straight and black it was cut short and smoothed back over his forehead in a pompadour that was what theyd called it in the fifties the hairdo matched the feel of him in my head he wasnt fifty years dead yet whats your name donald hi donald missed you at the wienie roast anger flared across the vampires face he wasnt old enough to hide it you told my master that you were here just to get your third out of jail once you had accomplished that you should have gone home you pretended to leave town but did not if you had simply left we would have accepted the murder of our people by staying you show that you intend to possess our lands and my masters power have you talked to your master lately i asked or more importantly has he talked to his human servant lately the vampire glared at me but there was no power to it colin is injured but not yet dead but the council will slay you for killing his servant asher said a human servant gives up their safe conduct if they attack another vampire directly that is council law anita did nothing that the council will hunt her for if colin persists in trying to harm us it is he the council will hunt down and destroy enough of the vampire crap i said i turned back to thompson so whats the message i thought if we were still here after dark frank was going to do us all personally ol frank seems scared shitless of you howard keeps mumbling that the signs are real bad that they need to leave town now that if they stay youll kill them all i raised an eyebrow having met niley and his crew im flattered at being their bogeyman now what the fuck is the message thompson brought a small white box out of his pocket it was like something youd buy an inexpensive necklace in he held it out to me with a smile that was so unpleasant it made me afraid to take the box it wont bite he said i glanced at asher he shrugged i took the box it was tacky on the bottom i raised it to see a brownish stain on the white cardboard the box was light but not empty whats in here dont want to spoil the surprise thompson said i took a deep breath and lifted the lid off there was a lock of hair curled over some cotton the hair was long and thick and chestnut brown tied with a bit of red ribbon like youd use on a present i lifted the lock of hair and it fell across my palm the cotton it had been resting on was stained at one corner stained reddish brown i fought to keep my face blank so i said dont you recognize it zeemans baby brother donated that you didnt get blood cutting daniels hair i said no he smiled laughed squirming in his chair like a kid who couldnt wait for the rest of the joke theres another little present in the box lift up the cotton i laid the hair on the table it lay there curled and gleaming i didnt want to lift the cotton i didnt want to see what else theyd cut off of daniel the one consolation i had was that of the many awful possibilities that flashed through my mind most of them were too big to fit into the box i lifted the cotton and fell to my knees like someone had struck me i knelt there staring down at the tip of a little finger that was far too delicate to be daniels the nail polish on the finger was still perfect smooth pale nothing d–πclass–π about richards mother dr patrick had to leave the table and throw up in the sink soft touch for a doctor and a werewolf what is it cherry asked i couldnt speak asher answered because he could see over my shoulder into the box its a womans finger jason had just entered the room what did you just say the vampire donald said what have you done human we have richards brother and his mother thompson said i thought wed just kill you but nileys paying the money he wants to give you a way out besides killing he seems to think if he doesnt try to kill you you wont try and kill him funny aint it i finally looked up away from charlotte zeemans finger what do you want you leave town tonight we release richards mother and brother tomorrow morning when were sure you really are gone if you dont leave this time niley will keep trimming pieces off of zeemans family maybe an ear next time maybe something bigger he was grinning as he said it thompson was a sadistic brute but he didnt understand me at all or he wouldnt have been smiling there was a look on donald the vampires face that said he did understand me i stood up very slowly i laid the box on the table beside the lock of hair my voice was amazingly calm almost empty of inflection where are they we left them safe and sound thompson said i did not know what they had done the vampire said i did not know they had mutilated your thirds family i shook my head you see thats the problem donald when you play with bad guys you cant control how bad they are you both just left daniel and charlotte just left them there yeah thompson said ol don here picked me up in his car i was staring at the finger i couldnt seem to not look at it i raised my eyes to donald the vampire so you both know where they are i said donalds eyes went wide he whispered i didnt know asher moved forward and laid hands on thompsons shoulders thompson wasnt worried if anything happens to us theyll do worse to both of them richards mom is a real attractive woman be a shame to change that donald said i am sorry about what they did but my orders are the same you must leave our territory tonight use the kitchen phone tell them we give tell them dont hurt them and were out of here thompson smirked no no phone calls theyre giving us two hours then if were not back theyll start cutting things off that will affect a lot more than her typing i nodded and pulled the browning i pointed it and shot it in one motion i didnt even remember aiming the vampires head exploded in a cloud of blood and brains the body rocked back and fell taking the chair with it asher held thompson in his seat some of the blood had splattered thompsons face a glob of something thicker than blood was trailing down his forehead he was trying to bat at the piece of flesh but asher held him i took the gun out from under his arm and pointed the browning at his forehead thompson stopped fighting and glared up at me i had to give him credit covered in blood and brains held down by a vampire staring at the barrel of a gun and he was putting on a brave show kill me it wont get you anything but them cut to pieces tell me where they are thompson and ill go get them fuck you youre going to kill me anyway i give you my word that if you tell us where they are and we get them out alive you get to live i dont believe you bitch problem with being a traitorous untrustworthy wretch thompson is you begin to believe everyone else is the same way i put the safety on the browning and reholstered it he watched me do it puzzled i keep my word thompson do you want to live or not niley and linus beck are a hell of a lot scarier than you will ever be chickie hed called me bitch and chickie he was either stupid or youre trying to get me to kill you if i talk my life is over and niley wont just shoot me thompson stared up at me and there was a knowledge in his eyes that he was already dead it was only a matter of how and who and he preferred me now to niley later he doesnt fear death asher said softly i shook my head no he doesnt we could call the cops jason offered if hes not scared of you guys he wont be scared of the state cops i stood staring down at thompson i dont know what im going to do with you thompson but ill tell you what i wont do i wont sit here for two hours and watch the time tick away i wont let daniel and charlotte die then leave town thompson said ive met niley thompson do you really expect me to believe that hes going to let them go he said he would you believe him i asked thompson just looked at me i didnt think so ashers fingers kneaded the mans shoulders almost like he was massaging them there are other things to fear besides death anita if you have the stomach for it i looked into that beautiful tragic face and couldnt read it what do you have in mind an eye for an eye i think the vampire said i stared into crystalline blue eyes and let the idea grow in my head like a horrible flower a lot of people who could face being shot quick death blanched at torture i was one of them and thats what we were talking about i believe the deputy will tell us where they are within the next half hour if we are ruthless asher said i will do the dirty work as it were you need only permit it thompson looked worried what the fuck are you talking about jason i said he came to stand beside me he stared down at what lay on the table he didnt say anything but tears slid silently down his face hed been over at the zeeman house for a lot of sunday dinners help hold thompson i said jason went to stand on the other side pinning one arm to the top of the table asher still held his shoulders i looked at asher and nodded do it damian if you would be so kind as to fetch me a knife one with a serrated edge would be best it will go through bone better damian just turned and walked across the kitchen zane and he started opening drawers what are you going to do thompson said guess i said i didnt cut anything off of that bitch i didnt touch them it was that strange goon that niley has linus beck he cut the finger off he did it i didnt do anything dont worry thompson well get to linus but right now youre all weve got damian had a big serrated butcher knife he stalked towards the table with it thompson was struggling now it was hard to hold him sitting better take him to the floor i said nathaniel helped they held him facedown one on each arm nathaniel pinning his legs thompson was a big strong man but he couldnt fight them they were too strong far too strong thompson was screaming fuck you damian held the knife out to asher ill hold him i touched damians arm and shook my head no ill do it damian looked at me the rule is never ask anyone to do something you wont do yourself if i cant do this then we wont do it at all well find another way jason looked up from holding the struggling man there is no other way id never seen such rage in his eyes could you do it i asked could you chop him up jason gave a slow nod i could bite his fucking fingers off one by one for whats in that box he seemed to mean it and it made me think i didnt know jason at all we can do this anita asher said and it will cost us nothing it should cost asher if were going to do something this evil it should bother whoever does it it isnt evil asher said it is practical it is even justice i held my hand out for the knife its evil and we all know it now give me the knife either i can do this or we do something else damian just stood there holding the knife let me do this for you anita please give me the damn knife he gave it to me because he couldnt do anything else i knelt down by thompson where are they thompson i asked no no niley told me what theyd do to me if i helped you hes fucking crazy wait zane said he had found a small cleaver this will work better thanks i took it checked it for balance i wasnt sure i could do it i wasnt even sure i wanted to be able to do it in fact i knew that i hoped i couldnt do it but if we were really going to do this i had to be the one i did it or we found another way charlotte zeemans finger was lying in a box in less than two hours theyd cut something else off id killed the vampire splattered thompson with blood and brains and he wasnt talking he was a mean son of a bitch but he was tough too charlotte and daniel didnt have time for him to be tough we had to break him and we had to break him fast i gave myself all the reasons they were good reasons real reasons and still i didnt know if i could do it well start with a finger thompson just like linus did i said he was screaming dont please dont oh god dont asher was leaning almost his full weight on the flat of the mans palm forcing his fingers to spread wide tell me where they are and it wont happen i said niley said theyd cut me open and make me eat my own intestines says he did it once in miami i believe him i believe him too thompson and you dont believe well do it do you you dont believe were as crazy as niley no one is as crazy as niley i raised the cleaver up youre wrong i stayed frozen for one long moment i couldnt make myself start the stroke i couldnt do it daniel charlotte has niley raped daniel yet i asked it in a voice that was so empty it was like i wasnt there thompson stopped struggling he lay very still he rolled his eyes upward please dont i stared into his eyes when i said the next did you rape charlotte zeeman i saw the fear in his eyes that flash that said hed done it it was enough i could do it god forgive me i got the little finger and the tip of the next one because he moved but they got better at holding him down and i got better at cutting thompson told us where they were keeping daniel and charlotte zeeman in less than fifteen minutes he would have told us the ingredients to the secret sauce or anything else hed have confessed to killing hoffa or dancing with the devil anything anything to make it stop i threw up in the corner until there was nothing but bile and my head felt like it was going to explode and i knew that id finally done something that i wouldnt recover from somewhere in the first blow or the second id broken something inside myself that would never heal and i was content with it if we got daniel and charlotte back i was content with it a hard cold knot filled me it was beyond hate i would make them pay for what theyd done i would kill them i would kill them all i felt strangely light and empty and i wondered if this was what it was like to be crazy it didnt feel too bad later when the shock wore off id feel worse later id wonder if there had been another way to get thompson to talk later id remember that i wanted to hurt him wanted him to crawl and beg that i wanted to take all the hurt that had happened to charlotte and daniel and carve it out of his flesh now we had to go rescue daniel and charlotte oh one last thing thompson was screaming high and piteously like a wounded rabbit i shot him in the head the screaming stopped i was driving the van down narrow gravel roads in the dark id insisted on driving because i wanted something to do i didnt want to just sit and stare out the window but i was beginning to think i should have let someone else drive because i didnt seem to be too real yet i felt light and empty shocky but not guilty not yet thompson had earned his death hed raped richards mother theyd tortured richards mother theyd raped daniel theyd tortured daniel they all deserved to die jamil and nathaniel were in the back of the van with roxanne and ben the lupa would not be left out of the fight even though shed had to be carried out to the van by her bodyguard i didnt have time to fight with roxanne so she got to come jason and dr patrick got to ride up front with me zane and cherry had been sent to the lupanar to get richard and the rest but we werent waiting i didnt trust niley not to get creative no i didnt trust linus and his master how much control did niley have over his pet psychopath theyd already raped them what else had happened to them by now niley had no rules i knew that i was gripping the steering wheel so hard it hurt the headlights cut a golden tunnel through the blackness trees crowded the road so close that they scraped at the vans roof with thick clawing fingers the trees seemed to squeeze down around us like a fist the headlights glowed over the dirt road but it wasnt enough light it would never be enough light there wasnt enough light in the world to chase away this darkness i cant believe you did that patrick said he was on the far side pressed against the passengerside door as if afraid to get too close to me jason was in the middle let it go patrick he said she chopped him up like an animal then she shot him this was the third time hed said pretty much the exact same thing shut up jason said i will not it was barbaric im not having a good night patrick drop it i said the fuck you say he said thompson was screaming in pain i said and you killed him patrick said someone had to finish it i said what the hell are you talking about finish it his voice was rising and i was beginning to debate how angry roxanne would be if i shot him after what id already done tonight it didnt seem like such a big deal how long have you been lukoi jason asked the question gave us a moment of surprised silence then two years and whats the rule about hunting jason asked which one dont be coy patrick jason said you know which one patrick was silent long enough that the only sounds were the whir of the engine the wheels on the road the van rocked softly over the rutted road was it just my imagination or was there a sound underneath the engines roar a high keening scream naw my imagination my imagination was not going to be my friend for a while patrick finally said never begin a hunt unless you mean to kill thats the one jason said but this wasnt a hunt patrick said yes it was jason said we just werent hunting the deputy whats that supposed to mean he asked i answered it means were hunting the people in that house patrick turned a pale face to me in the dark you cant mean that we are to kill all of them only one man cut off her finger only one man is guilty they watched they did nothing to prevent it its the same as doing it in the eyes of the law i said you are not the law he said oh yes i am no youre not damn it no you are not anyone who harms the pack without just cause is our enemy i said dont quote pack law to me human how do we deal with our enemies i asked jason answered death most packs dont hold to the old laws anymore and you both know it patrick said look patrick i dont have time to explain it all so heres the readers digest version niley and crew raped and tortured richards mother and brother we are going to kill them for that all of them what about sheriff wilkes and his men if thompson helped rape richards mom then he wasnt the only one anyone who touched either of them is dead do you understand that patrick dead i cant do it he said then stay in the car i said but shut the fuck up or im going to shoot you see he said see your conscience is bothering you i glanced at him huddled in the dark no my conscience isnt bothering me not yet maybe later maybe not but now tonight i dont feel bad about what i did i wanted thompson to hurt i wanted to punish him for what he did and you know what patrick it wasnt enough it will never be enough because i killed him too fucking quick tears were threatening at the back of my throat again when the numbness and anger wore off i was going to be in trouble i had to hold onto the adrenaline the rage it would see me through the night tomorrow well wed see there had to be another way patrick said i didnt hear you offering any suggestions at the time whats bothering the good doctor jason said is that he didnt say anything he didnt do anything to stop us i appreciated the us i didnt hold him down patrick said i didnt touch him all you had to do was say stop dont but you kept quiet you let us chop him up you let us kill him and didnt say a damn word jason said your conscience wasnt working so hard while he was still alive patrick didnt say anything for a long time we bumped over the road avoiding tree branches and dirtfilled holes there was nothing but the darkness the golden tunnel of headlights and the enginefilled silence i wasnt sure silence was my favorite thing right now but it was better than listening to patrick tell me what a monster i was i agreed with him which made it harder to hear then something filled the silence that was even harder to hear patrick was crying he huddled against the far door as far from both of us as he could get and cried softly finally he said youre right i did nothing and that will haunt me for the rest of my days join the club i said he peered at me through the darkness then why did you do it someone had to i will never forget the sight of you chopping him up this little girl the look on your face when you killed him god you looked blank like you werent even there why did you have to be the one to do it would it have been better if one of the guys had done it i asked yes he said please dont tell me this is some macho shit that youre this upset because a girl did it patrick snuffled i guess it is i mean i guess it wouldnt seem so horrible if one of the others had done it youre this pretty little thing you shouldnt be chopping peoples fingers off oh please i said i will go to my grave seeing the look on your face at the last keep it up and youll go sooner than later i mumbled what did you say patrick asked nothing i said jason made a small sound that might have been a laugh if he only knew how unfunny the comment had been i was having enough trouble with what id just done i didnt need a sobbing jiminy cricket to emphasize the fact that id fallen into the abyss the monster wasnt breathing down my neck it was inside my head inside my head fat and wellfed what made me so sure the monster was home was the fact that i didnt feel guilty i felt bad because i was supposed to feel bad and didnt i had to have some personal line that could not be crossed and id thought torture was it and id been wrong tears tightened my throat but id be damned if id cry it was done i had to let it go or at least push it back long enough to get the job done the job was to rescue daniel and charlotte if i didnt get them out then it had all been for nothing id added a new nightmare for nothing but it was more than that i couldnt face richard if i let them die id been angry with him pissed but now i wasnt id have given a great deal for him to hold me right now of course hed have probably agreed with patrick richard would be a very wise man if he didnt attempt to lecture me tonight but it wasnt just richard id met the entire zeeman clan they were so close to perfect that it made my teeth ache the family might never recover from a loss like this my family hadnt i was counting on daniel and charlotte to recover from the torture i was counting on them being strong enough to not let that alone be enough to destroy them i hoped i was right no i prayed i was right thompson had told us what room they were keeping them in it was in the back near the woods as far from the road as possible not a surprise there might have been information that thompson had that could have been useful maybe i should have used less torture and more threat maybe that would have gotten us more detailed info faster maybe maybe not i was new at interrogation by torture lacked the proper technique i suppose i would have said id get better with practice except i wasnt doing it again i might have the screaming meemies forever from just this one incident but if i did it again it was over theyd have to wrap me up and put me away i kept flashing on the feel of the cleaver biting into the floor i remembered thinking that i didnt feel it go through the bone i just felt it bite into the floor underneath i saw the fingers go in a wash of blood but not as much blood as youd think for some reason anita anita the turnoff i blinked and slammed on the brakes throwing everyone forward i was the only one wearing a seat belt i usually remember to have everyone buckle up careless of me jason peeled himself off the dashboard pushed back to the seat and said are you okay i backed the van up slowly im fine liar he said i eased the van back until i could see the white sign that said greene valley house you didnt expect to find a house with a name at the end of a dirt road but there you are just because the road isnt paved doesnt mean the people dont have style or maybe pretensions sometimes its awfully hard to tell the difference this road was gravel the gravel pinged against the underside of the van even at less than twenty miles an hour i slowed down further roxanne knew the house shed grown up with the greenes son theyd been best friends until the hormones kicked in and he started trying to play boy to her girl but she knew the house there was a clearing about halfway down the road where we should park the van the clearing was right on schedule i pulled the van into the weeds they whisked against the metal whipping the tires the black van was sort of invisible parked in the trees it was also sort of wedged we wouldnt be moving it quickly of course i wasnt planning on us having to make a run for it my priority was to get daniel and charlotte out as unharmed as possible i had no other priority it made things simple we secured the hostages then we killed everybody simple part of me hoped that richard got here in time for the assault part of me didnt one i wasnt sure how hed take the news about his family two i wasnt sure how hed take my game plan and i didnt want to argue id paid the price to get here wed play it the way i wanted it someone touched my arm and i jumped so badly i couldnt speak for a second my heart filled my throat until i couldnt breathe anita its jason you okay the passengerside door was open and patrick wasnt in sight i heard movement coming up on my side of the van it was nathaniel he tapped softly on the window i lowered it everyones out of the back he said i nodded give us a few minutes jason said nathaniel went back to the rear of the van without another word he did follow orders well talk to me anita theres nothing to talk about you keep staring off into space for minutes at a time youre not even here we need you for this to work daniel and mrs zeeman need you my head turned slowly of its own accord and i glared at him i have done my best for them tonight i have gone above and beyond my personal best for them tonight until theyre safe its not over i know that dont you think i know that if i dont get them out alive then what i did was for nothing and what do you think you did he asked i shook my head you saw i helped hold him down im sorry about that jason put a hand on each shoulder and shook me gently damn it anita get a grip it isnt like you to wallow in the horror youre a good soldier you kill and keep going like youre supposed to i pushed him away from me i tortured a man jason i reduced him to something that writhed on the floor mewling with terror and pain and i wanted to do it i wanted him to hurt because of what theyd done to charlotte and daniel i wanted to do it i shook my head ill do my bit tonight but forgive me if its a little harder to keep going than normal forgive me if im not superwoman after all not superwoman he exclaimed putting a hand on his chest in mock surprise youve lied to me all these years it made me smile and i didnt want to smile stop it stop what cheering you up or is life supposed to stop because you did something horrible ill tell you the real horrible truth anita no matter what you do or how bad you feel about it life just goes on life doesnt give a fuck that youre sorry or upset or deranged or tormented life just goes on and you gotta go on with it or sit in the middle of the road and feel sorry for yourself and i dont see you doing that i am not feeling sorry for myself you arent all broken up about thompson youre broken up because of what you did to thompson and how it makes you feel you dont give a rats ass about him youre just weeping and gnashing your teeth about how much of a monster you are well i get enough of that from richard i dont need it from you so get your act together weve got people we care about to save i stared at him you know whats really bothering me no what i dont feel bad about cutting thompson up i think he deserved it he did jason said no one deserves to be tortured jason no one deserves what we did what i did to him thats what the front of my brain keeps telling me it keeps telling me i should feel sorry about it horrified this should be something that breaks me but you know what what jason asked it wont break me because right now the only thing i regret is that i didnt have enough nerve to cut off his dick and keep it as a souvenir for richards mom killing him even torturing him wasnt enough the zeemans are like the fucking waltons to think that anyone could come in and take that away spoil it forever just makes me so angry so angry that all i can do is kill them kill them all theres no regret in me i looked at him in the dark there should be regret for something jason i can kill and not blink now i can torture and not regret it ive become one of the monsters and if it will save richards family i am happy to be one feel any better jason said yeah i do im a monster but its for a good cause to save richards mom id do a hell of a lot worse than cut a few fingers off jason said me too i said then lets do it he said we got out of the van and went to do it everyone had melted into the woods like stones thrown on the surface of some dark lake even ben who was carrying roxanne had vanished i moved through the trees at a slower more human pace nathaniel stayed with me like a welltrained dog i almost wished hed gone off with the others his company was not comforting because though he was ablebodied and a wereleopard i wasnt sure i should be taking him into a fight he crouched beside me hand on my arm pulling me down i went to my knees beside him gun ready he pointed to our right and i heard it someone crashing through the underbrush it wasnt one of us i put my mouth near his ear get behind whoever it is drive them towards me he nodded and slipped into the trees i got behind a large tree using it as a shield my plan was to shove the browning into whoever it was and find out what was happening in the house someone gasped and now they were running fullout i felt the movement in the trees without really seeing it the shapeshifters were driving him towards me nathaniel had found the others and spread the word if it was some innocent hiker i couldnt think of an apology strong enough oh well a figure crashed through the trees and right past me i had to grab his arm and spin him around into the tree to get his attention i shoved the gun barrel under his chin and only then realized who i had it was howard the psychic dont kill me he gasped why not i asked i can help you start talking i said milo and wilkess deputies are up there arguing about who gets to kill the man i pressed the gun barrel into his throat until he had to go on tiptoe he was making a wild sound high in his throat did you enjoy charlotte zeeman was she a good lay he tried to talk but couldnt do it around the gun barrel i thought about shoving the barrel through his throat until he gagged on his blood and died i took a deep breath and eased down enough for him to speak instead dear god i didnt touch the woman i didnt touch either of them im a clairvoyant for gods sake i couldnt bear to touch someone during a rape or torture howard said i believed him and i knew if later i found out he was lying the world wasnt big enough to hide him i knew with a cold certainty that if he were guilty he would pay you said daniels at the house wheres charlotte niley and linus have taken her to use her blood to call up his demon theyre going to have the demon search the land for the lance niley plans on leaving tonight you cant send a demon to find a holy relic i said linus thinks the blasphemy of it will appeal to his master why are you running away howard there is no spear i lied i eased up on the gun more and blinked at him what are you talking about you know how hard it is to make a living as a clairvoyant so many horrible memories and you usually end up working with the police for no money id been using my powers to get myself in good with wealthy people who werent so careful about the law id promise them something but it wouldnt be real then theyd be too embarrassed to go to the police about it or couldnt complain that they got cheated out of a stolen object it worked i only swindled crooks it worked until niley i said hes crazy if he ever finds out i tricked him hell kill me and have linus feed my soul to that thing theyre going to kill charlotte to try and find something that isnt even here you asshole i know i know and im sorry i am really really sorry i didnt know what he was capable of oh god let me go let me run away youre going to get us into that house youre going to help us rescue daniel there isnt time to rescue them both howard said theyre going to kill the man and sacrifice the woman now if i get you into the house the woman will be dead before you can get to her roxanne appeared on the other side of the tree just there like magic howard gasped i dont think so she said she opened a mouth full of fangs and snapped them near his face howard screamed she pressed clawed hands into the bark of the tree on either side of him and clawed long furrows in the bark howard fainted i left him with roxanne and the vampires and ben when he came to hed get them into the house and theyd rescue daniel id take the rest and rescue charlotte there would be no choosing no eitheror we would save them both i had to believe it as i threw myself into the black woods i unleashed that power inside me and sent it outward casting like a net to catch a faint ruffling scent of evil theyd know i was coming now but it couldnt be helped i ran like id run earlier in the day with richard i ran as if the ground told me where to go and the trees opened up like welcoming hands i ran in the dark and couldnt see and didnt need to i felt richard running running towards us i felt the hard edge of his panic and ran faster theyd chosen the top of a hill that had once been meadow but some time today theyd bushhogged all the grass and meadow flowers so that the hill was bare and broken under the moonlight in the movies there would be an altar and maybe a fire or two at least a torch but there was nothing but darkness and a silver wash of moonlight the palest thing in the clearing was charlotte zeemans skin she was tied naked to stakes driven into the ground i thought at first she was unconscious but her hands flexed and strained against the ropes i was both happy to see her still fighting and sorry that she hadnt passed out linus beck was wearing the proverbial black hooded robe i guess if it saved me from seeing him naked i could live with it niley stood by linus he was dressed in the same suit id seen him in earlier theyd drawn a circle on the ground with something dark and powdery charlotte was inside the circle she was food for the demon bait wilkes stood not eight feet from me to my right he had a highpowered rifle and was searching the darkness linuss voice rose in a singsong rhythm that filled the night with echoes and movement as if the darkness itself shivered at the words nathaniel and i lay on the ground at the line of trees watching jason and jamil were supposed to be on the other side of the clearing a moment of concentration told me where they were the marks with richard were open and roaring id never been so aware of the scent and sounds of a summer night it was like my skin expanded outward touching every tree and bush i was liquid and barely contained within my skin i felt richard and the others moving through the trees like a solid wind the lukoi were coming but they were miles away and the spell was almost complete i could feel it growing swelling like a dank unseen fog the evil was coming there were shots from the house echoing up the hill wilkes turned towards them and i went to one knee and sighted down my arms the first shot hit him in the middle of his back the second shot took him a little higher up the back because he was falling to his knees he stayed motionless on his knees for one of those seconds that lasted an eternity i had time to put a third bullet in his back a bullet hit the tree next to my head and i rolled back into the underbrush three more shots hit the bushes where i had been niley had a gun a semiauto that might hold eighteen bullets if hed modified the clip not good of course it might hold only ten hard to tell in the dark from this distance i sidled up to a tree leaned my arm against it and sighted on his shape in the bright darkness i pulled off one careful shot and he went down i wasnt sure how badly he was hit but id hit something he fired back and i hit the ground nathaniel crawled to me on his belly what do we do niley yelled you cannot cross the circle anita if you kill us all you can do is watch charlotte die i risked a peek niley had taken cover i could shoot linus but i wasnt a hundred percent sure what that would do to charlotte i didnt know what the spell entailed i just didnt know that much about sorcery what do you want niley throw your gun out you throw yours out too or i shoot linus what happens to charlotte if linus dies in midspell ill take my chances throw out the gun he stood and tossed the gun off the side of the hill i couldnt hear it hit over linuss chanting but hed done it i moved out of the trees and tossed the browning away i still had the firestar the other gun too niley said remember that linus searched you earlier today i tossed the firestar away into the broken grass it was all right this wasnt about guns anymore i felt the spell close linuss last word reverberated on the night like a great brass bell that had been struck slightly offkey but it echoed for all the flatness of the note it echoed and grew until the skin on my body tried to crawl away and hide creeping as if every insect in the world were under my skin for a second i couldnt breathe or move then nileys voice came you are too late anita too late charlotte was screaming through the gag on her mouth screaming over and over again as fast as she could draw breath i stared across the meadow and found that there was something else in the circle i wasnt sure if it was the blackness of it that made it hard to see or if it was like smoke never exactly one shape it seemed to be about man height maybe eight feet not much more it was so thin that it looked like it was made of sticks its legs were longer than they should have been bent wrong somehow i realized that the longer i stared at it the more solid it was growing the neck was a long serpentine bent back on its shoulders like a heron and it had a beak for a mouth if it had eyes i couldnt see them the face looked blind and only halfformed you are too late niley said again no im not i stood and walked out of the trees niley seemed terribly confident now that the demon was here only linus can send it back to whence it came if you harm him then it will certainly devour the fair charlotte i ignored him because i knew the plan was for the thing to eat charlotte let them think i believed they intended to save her let them think she was still useful as a hostage i wanted to get close enough to see the circle of entrapment theyd put up charlotte had stopped screaming i could hear her voice trapped behind the gag but she was speaking now not screaming a strong woman a very strong woman the demon paced the edge of the circle flicking a long thin whiplike tail it was becoming progressively more agitated moving around the circle like a prisoner trying its cell the circle is complete linus said you are mine to command the demon hissed at him and the sound made the inside of my skull ache it turned and gazed at me though it had no eyes i was on the edge of the circle now i could see that charlotte had closed her eyes and i knew now what she was doing she was praying i dropped to my knees beside the circle i didnt feel anything from it which meant it wasnt meant for me whatever it was meant to keep in or out i wasnt one of them shes pure linus shes pure of heart and soul she isnt a fit sacrifice for this thing the pure are a rare and fine treat for my master no you cant feed her soul to it linus her soul is spoken for and this thing cannot touch her the demon moved as far away from charlotte as the circle would allow it wasnt happy give it its orders linus niley said i offer you a sacrifice of flesh and blood and soul take this my offering and do my bidding the demon moved to stand over charlotte it snapped its beak next to her face and she shrieked the prayers stopped and it laughed a sound like grinding metal its a circle against evil isnt it linus just evil youre a necromancer niley said you are evil dont believe everything you hear or even read niley the demon raised fingers to the moonlight fingers that ended in black knives charlotte opened her eyes and screamed the lords prayer would have been reasonable but i blanked all i could think of was christmas and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over the flock by night i stepped over the circle it was nothing to me it was meant to keep out and in evil i wasnt evil and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid the demon was chattering snapping at me razor claws slicing around me like fan blades but it didnt touch me and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people i knelt and started untying charlotte when i pulled her gag away she started to recite with me for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord i cradled charlottes naked body in my arms she clung to me and cried and i was crying too and i knew i had to get us out of that circle because i only remembered about three more verses and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger charlotte couldnt stand and i had to half carry her we stumbled near the edge of the circle and the demon rushed us in a wave of clattering snapping horror and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying i stared down at the circle as i prayed that carefully constructed circle glory to god in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men i erased the circle with my hand i broke linuss circle of protection the demon threw back its head and shrieked the sound was like a roosters crow or maybe a growl or maybe something else it was as if even hearing it i couldnt hold it in my mind it rushed out of the circle and fell on linus it was his turn to scream and scream as fast as he could draw breath blood flew in a wash sprinkling us like rain and suddenly there were flashlights and men yelling fbi dont move fbi the flashlights found the demon the light glistened on the beak and blood shimmered on it as if it had bathed in it if they hadnt tried to shoot it i think it would have left them alone but they fired into it and i pushed charlotte to the grass hiding her body under mine the demon rushed into the feds and they started dying i yelled bullets wont work pray pray damn it pray i tried to lead by example and found finally that i could remember the lords prayer a mans voice echoed mine then another i heard someone else doing the bless me oh lord for i have sinned liturgy someone else was praying and it wasnt christian hindu i think but every religion has demons every religion has prayers all it takes is faith nothing like a real live demon to give you some of that oldtime religion the demon stood with a mans body raised to its mouth the neck was cut and it was lapping the blood with a long sticky tongue but at least it wasnt killing anyone else prayers rose up into the darkness and i bet none of them had ever prayed so hard in church or out the demon stood on its crooked legs and walked back to me charlotte was muttering a new prayer i think it was the song of solomon funny what youll remember under stress it pointed a long finger at me and spoke in a voice that was deep and rusted as if it wasnt much used free it said yes i said youre free the beak and the blind face seemed to waver for just an instant i thought i saw a mans face pure and almost shining but i would never be sure it said thank you and vanished feds were everywhere one of them gave charlotte his coat that said fbi on the back i helped her sit up and slip the coat over her it hit her at midthigh sometimes it was good to be small one of the feds turned out to be maiden i just stared up at him in shock he smiled and knelt beside us daniel is all right hes going to make it charlotte grabbed his coat sleeve what did they do to my boy his smile vanished they were going to beat him to death id called for backup but theyre dead mrs zeeman they wont ever hurt you again i am so sorry that i wasnt there earlier today to help you both of you she nodded you saved my boys life didnt you maiden looked at the ground then nodded then dont apologize to me she said what is a federal agent doing posing as a smalltown deputy i asked when niley came nosing around down here they put me under with wilkes it worked you called the state cops i said he nodded yeah another agent came over and maiden excused himself i felt richard arrive felt them slip through the trees and i knew that some of them at least werent in human form i called the agent over that had given charlotte his coat there are some werewolves in the woods they are friends they were coming to help dont let anyone shoot them okay he stared down at me werewolves i looked at him i didnt know the fbi was going to show up i needed the backup that made him laugh and he started telling everyone to put their weapons up and not to shoot the werewolves i dont think everyone was happy about it but they did what they were told a woman in ems gear knelt by us she started looking charlotte over shining lights in her eyes and asking silly questions like did she know the date and where she was richard was suddenly there still in human form though hed stripped down to jeans and his hiking boots charlotte flung herself from my arms to his crying all over again i stood up and left charlotte to her son and the medical crew richard grabbed my hand before i could wander off he stared up at me tears shining in the moonlight thank you for my mother i squeezed his hand and left them to it if i didnt leave them alone i was going to cry again another ems came up to me are you anita blake yeah why franklin niley wants to speak with you hes dying theres nothing we can do for him i went with him to talk to niley he was lying on his back theyd set up an iv bag and tried to stop the bleeding but he was cut up pretty bad i stood so that he could look up at me without straining he licked his lips and it took him two tries to speak how did you pass the circle it was meant to trap evil inside or keep it out im not evil you raise the dead he said im a necromancer i was kind of doubting where that put me on the scale of good and evil but apparently gods okay with it you stepped into the circle not knowing if you would be safe he was frowning clearly puzzled i couldnt just sit there and watch charlotte die you would have sacrificed yourself for her i thought about that for a second or two i didnt think about it that clearly but i couldnt let her die not if i could save her he winced closed his eyes then looked at me no matter what the cost to you personally i guess so i said he looked past me eyes starting to lose their focus extraordinary extraordinary his breath sighed outward and he died the ems crew fell on him like vultures but he was gone they never got him breathing again jason was suddenly beside me anita nathaniels dying what are you talking about he caught two bullets in the chest when people were shooting at the demon the feds were using silver shot because they knew what linus was oh god i took jasons hand take me to him there were paramedics on either side of him there was another iv and theyd set up a lamp nathaniels skin was pale and waxy in the light sweat covered him like dew when i knelt beside him and tried to push my way past the paramedics his pale eyes didnt see me i let the paramedics push me out of the way i sat there in the weeds and listened to nathaniel try to breathe through two holes in his chest the bad guys hadnt shot him hed gotten caught in stray fire from the good guys it was just a stupid accident he was going to die because hed been standing in the wrong place at the wrong time no i would not let an accident take him i would not lose another person i knew to bad timing i looked up at jason is marianne here ill look he went running into the chaos nathaniels back bowed upward his breath rasped out he lay back on the ground horribly still one of the paramedics shook his head and got up he took some of the equipment and went to help someone else i crawled around to take his place at nathaniels side i looked across at the other paramedic it was a woman with a blond ponytail is there anything you can do she looked at me are you a friend i nodded close i nodded im sorry she said i shook my head no i wont let him die i wasnt evil everything that id done and my faith was still pure when i spoke the words they were just as real to me as when id memorized them all those years ago for the christmas pageant the words still moved me i never doubted god i doubted me but maybe god was a more generous god than i allowed him to be jason was there with marianne i grabbed her hand help me call the munin she didnt argue just knelt beside me remember the feel of his body remember his smile the smell of his hair and skin i nodded he smells like vanilla and fur i knelt by him touching his skin but it was already growing cool to the touch he was dying i didnt feel sexy in the least i felt sad and frightened i bowed my head and prayed i prayed to be opened to raina i prayed to open my eyes and look at nathaniel and feel lust it was a weird thing to be praying for but it was worth a try i felt that measure of calm that i sometimes got when i prayed it doesnt mean youll get what you asked for but it does mean that someone is listening i opened my eyes slowly and stared down at nathaniel there were leaves in his long unbound hair i pulled them away i held his hair in my hands and buried my face in it it still smelled like vanilla i rubbed my cheek against his burying my face behind his ear into the silk of his hair i laid a hand over the wounds with my face still buried in his hair he made a small pain sound when i touched him i dont know if it was the pain sound the familiar smell of his body or the prayer but raina spread through my body like flame the munin rode me and i opened to it no fighting no struggle i embraced it and her laughter rolled out of my lips i rose up on my knees and stared down at nathaniel i wasnt horrified anymore raina thought it would be a grand thing to fuck him as he died i laid my lips against his and his lips were cool dry i pressed my mouth over his and felt that fire pour into his mouth from mine my fingers found the wounds in his chest and stroked them pushing my fingers into the wound the paramedic tried to pull me off of him and jason and someone else pulled her away i dug into the wound until nathaniels eyes opened and he moaned with pain his eyes fluttered pale pale lilac in the artificial light he looked up but didnt see me didnt see anything i covered his face in soft kisses and each touch burned i went back to his mouth and breathed into him when i drew back his eyes focused his breath eased out in something too low to be a whisper anita i straddled his body and laid my hands on his bare chest i covered the wounds with my hands but i touched the inside of his chest with something other than my hands i could feel the damage i could roll his damaged heart in the heat that fell from my hands that sank into his skin that filled his flesh i was burning alive i had to feed the heat into him had to share this energy my hands left the wound on his chest and fumbled at my shirt the dress shirt came off and vanished into the grass but the tank top was trapped under the shoulder holster hands helped me slip the holster off my shoulders it flopped heavy and awkward over my hips i undid the belt and i think it was marianne who helped me slip the belt out of the loops i know it was marianne who stopped me from undoing my pants raina snarled in my head hands caressed up my bare back and i knew it was richard he knelt behind me legs straddling nathaniels legs but putting no weight on them he cradled me back against his body i was suddenly aware that we were the focus of the pack they surrounded us like a wall of faces and bodies richards hands slipped off the spine sheath and the blade down my back his hands found my bra strap and undid it i started to protest started to hold it and he kissed my shoulders sliding his lips down my back and sliding the bra away he whispered bare skin is best for this that prickling rush of energy filled the watching lukoi filled them and spread into me the energy of the munin fed on that power grew until i thought my skin would burst with it richard guided my body to nathaniels my bare breasts touched nathaniels chest a brush of velvet skin against the torn flesh of his smooth chest i shuddered against him and that heat spilled from my bare skin at first it was as if my naked flesh rode above his skin on a pool of sweat then i felt the flesh give my body fell against his with a sigh and it was as if our bodies became plastic liquid our bodies melded together into one flesh one body as if i were sinking into his chest i felt our hearts touch beating liquid against one another i healed his heart closed his flesh with mine nathaniels mouth found mine and the power flowed between us like breath until it raised the skin from my body and there was nothing but his arms around me his mouth on me my hands on his body and distant like an anchor i felt richard and beyond him the rest of the pack i felt them offer their energy their power and i took it and beyond that distant as a dream i felt jeanclaude i felt his cool power join with ours and strengthen life from death i took it all and thrust it into nathaniel until he tore his mouth from mine and cried out i felt his body give under mine and his pleasure rushed over my skin and i threw it out into the waiting pack i took their energy and gave them back pleasure the munin left me in that rush of startled voices raina had never been able to take power from others that was my doing so even the bitch of the west had never pleasured this many people at once i sat up still straddling nathaniel he looked up at me with his lilac eyes and smiled i ran my hands over his chest and there was no wound only a healing scar he still looked pale and awful but hed live richard offered me the dress shirt id dropped i slipped it over my breasts and buttoned it i didnt know what had happened to the rest of the clothes jason had my shoulder holster and knife the important stuff when i tried to stand i stumbled and only richards arms kept me standing he helped me through the crowd they touched me as we moved through running their hands along me i didnt mind or didnt care i put my arm around richards waist and accepted it for tonight id worry about what it all meant tomorrow or maybe even the next day verne stepped out of the crowd damn girl you are good roxanne was at his side im healed how did you do that i smiled talk to marianne i kept walking the paramedics were rushing forward i heard the woman say holy shit its a miracle and maybe it was richard said i wont be looking for another lupa i hugged him no more auditions you are my lupa anita together we could be the most powerful mated pair ive ever seen its not just the two of us that make us powerful richard its jeanclaude he kissed me on the forehead i felt him when you called the power i felt him give his power to us wed stopped walking i turned to look at him in the moonlight we are a threesome richard like it or not a m–πnage –∞ trois he said i raised my eyebrows not unless youve been doing more than just talking with jeanclaude richard laughed and hugged me he hasnt corrupted me quite that far glad to hear it we walked down the hill holding each other charlotte was lying at the bottom of the hill on a stretcher she reached her hands up to both of us one of the hands was thickly bandaged she smiled up at us why didnt you tell me richard i thought it would make a difference i thought you would stop loving me silly ass she said thats what i told him i said charlotte started to cry softly pressing richards hand to her lips i just smiled and held her hand life wasnt perfect but standing there watching richard and his mother holding their hands it was close daniels nose was badly broken the perfect profile isnt quite as perfect he says the women love it makes him look tough daniel has never spoken to me about what happened neither has charlotte but on the first sunday dinner after they both got out of the hospital she broke down and cried i was the one who went into the kitchen first she let me hold her while she cried saying how silly she felt that everything was all right why should she be crying if i could do resurrection for real id bring niley and all the rest back and kill them more slowly richards family thinks i can do no wrong and they are not being subtle about their plans marriage we should get married under other circumstances not a bad idea but we arent a couple were a trio hard to explain that to richards folks hard to explain that to richard howard grant the psychic is in jail for fraud he confessed to some things hed done in the past i told him if he didnt spend some time in jail id kill him his greed had started everything he didnt touch charlotte or daniel he was horrified at what niley was and what was happening but his lies set it all in motion he couldnt get away scot free i just gave him a choice of punishments the police think deputy thompson fled the state theyre still looking for him and none of us are talking i dont know what vernes pack did with the body maybe its hanging on their tree waiting for a christmas that will never come maybe they ate him i dont know and i dont want to know the vampire council didnt send anyone to kill us apparently colin overstepped his bounds we were within our rights to kill him and his people he didnt survive his servants death there is no new master of the city yet verne and his pack are in no hurry for colins replacement i wake from dreams that arent my own thoughts feelings not my own it is overwhelming enough to be in love in that first heat of lust but the marks are sucking me inside both of them theyre swallowing me up every act of sex makes it worse so no more sex i have to get control of the marks first when i was sleeping with both of them richard catted around now that ive gone celibate so has he jeanclaude i think knows im still looking for a good excuse to say hah see you dont really love me so hes behaving himself like some dark angel i took a month off and went back to tennessee to learn from marianne learning to control the munin is helping me to control the marks jeanclaude as my only teacher is just not a good idea he has too much invested in me im learning to put up barriers barriers so tall so wide so solid that im safe from both of them safe behind my walls but sex brings all the barriers crashing down its like drowning i think if i allowed it and they allowed it we could become like one organism with three parts richard doesnt seem to see the danger hes still naive or perhaps i just dont understand him i love him but even thinking his thoughts feeling his emotions hes still a mystery to me jeanclaude knows the danger he says he can keep it from happening but i dont trust him i love him sort of but i dont trust him ive felt his chortling joy as the power of the triumvirate grows he told me once he loved me as much as he was able maybe he does but he loves power more so celibate again damn it how to be chaste with the two preternatural studs of all time at my beck and call be out of town ive taken every animating job out of town that i could for three months i spend weekends with marianne i have a great deal of power inside me not the marks but me ive avoided confronting that power as much as possible but jeanclaude has forced me to face it i have to learn how to control the magic it sounds silly that someone who raises the dead for a living has been ignoring that she has magic inside her but i have ive always learned the minimum to get by thats over marianne tells me that i have the tools to survive in the triumvirate until i feel confident in those tools im avoiding the boys three months of not touching either of them of no one sharing my bed three months of not being lupa i had to leave the pack to leave richard but i couldnt leave the wereleopards they dont have anyone else but me so im still nimirra marianne is even teaching me how to forge the leopards into a healthy unit she and verne ive abandoned as much of the preternatural stuff as i can i have to find out whats left of who i thought i was i faced a demon with my faith and prayer does that mean god has forgiven me my sins i dont know if he has forgiven me hes more generous than i am
