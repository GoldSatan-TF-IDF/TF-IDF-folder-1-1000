shadow of the warmaster jo clayton i two hours before zeropointthe meeting of swardheld quale and adelaar aici arash from which events will be dated backward and forward as circumstances warrant prin daruzetelffer sometime round midmorning on the third day of the second week in the spring month calftime nuba treviglio freetrader and free soul set her ship down on the stretch of metacrete telffer laughingly calls its star port discharged one passenger and droned into town on the ships flit to see what the world had to offer her adelaar aici arash watched her leave to the ground treviglio said what you do after that is your business and by god she meant it adelaar bent over her case and thumbed on the aglift straightened and looked for some means of transport metacrete flat filthy chalk white seemed like there were kilometers of it on every side reaching out to touch the mountains in the west the blue glitter of the sea in the east and the long dark line in front of her the city that serviced this desolation a brisk wind blew from the distant seashore dragging with it pungent sea smells seawrack dead fish iodine and brine it lifted off the crete a heavy white grit that it drove hisssssing against half a dozen shuttles and a massive barge against a battered wreck being stripped for parts against two tenthhand stingships snugged close like linktwins against some ancient flickits gray and vaguely insectile against adelaars boots in a soft continual patter against her tan twill trousers the closefitting tan twill jacket against her face forcing tears from her halfclosed eyes she flattened her shoulders tugged on the cases tether and started walking moving with an easy contained stride toward the city ahead except for the diminishing dot that was treviglio on the flit nothing but the wind and the grit moved in all that shimmery white glare she was short slight neatly made hovering about early middle age with the help of ananile drugs she wore her tan hair trimmed close to her head so she could run a comb through it and forget it the wind was teasing it twisting it into a ragged halo about her face angering her though she wouldnt permit her annoyance to show except in the slight deepening of the shallow crowsfeet at the corners of her eyes large eyes gentian blue cold eyes in a face adept at concealing what went on behind it after twenty minutes of brisk walking she reached the edge of the field and stepped onto telffers starstreet starstreetprin daruzetelffer had a fuel dump a shipsupply store that from the look of it operated by appointment only a short stretch of pavement and a very tall fence adelaar angled toward the gate and stopped before a wooden kiosk painted black with a battered plastic window so scratched by windborne grit it had lost any transparency it had ever had the gate was shut there were eyes and heat sensors soldered to the fencewire melters perched on swivelposts atop the wire she looked from them to the kiosk tk tk sweet sweet she located the outside palmer a dullmetal oval freckled with old black paint slapped her hand against it a wall section shuddered squealed pleated itself until there was an opening wide enough for her to edge through tugging the case inside with her she crossed to the heavyduty comset screwed onto the back wall and inspected it as the door squealed shut behind her closing her in with an unpleasant smell a mix of ancient sweat dead moss and dryrot fungus grew in scaly patches on the greasy metal of the comset there was an ugly oliveocher film on the coms thumbglass she touched the glass her face rigid with distaste rubbed her thumb repeatedly along her side as she watched a holdpattern shiver over the plate a minute passed she glanced at the ringchron on her left hand glanced again again if i was paying you youd be out on your ass yesterday two minutes three five a loud ting a face in the plate male functionary a slash of a mouth a thin nose so long it approached the grotesque name origin ship purpose of visit a bored monotone adelaar aici arash droom in the heggers she slipped her dicarx from her belt touched it to the reader slid it back in its squeeze pocket when the pinlight flashed red passenger tradeship niyitnit ownercaptain nuba treviglio business with a resident of telffer what business who adelaar hesitated as shed built up her client list shed dealt with men like this and knew how unproductive annoyance was push at them and they set their feet like mules on the other hand she wanted to say as little as possible to local authorities she didnt know what their underthetable ties were there was a man on aggerdom asking questions about her the day she closed with treviglio for passage here the niyitnit lifted before she learned more but she had little doubt who he worked for less doubt that there were people in prin daruze with the same ties bolodo had stringers wherever there was a market for their contractees and raw worlds like telffer always needed more hands hmm throw him quales name if he keeps pushing me no point trying to keep that quiet soon as i hit the directory who wants to know will thats my concern not yours she said her voice neutral nonaggressive despite the implicit challenge of the words should licenses be necessary i will apply at the proper time and place what business who

severe penalty for attempted removal any questions none gate open the com went dark tk tk sweet sweet she tugged on the cases tether slapped her hand against the interior palmer when the panel shuddered without budging she gave it a kick with her boot heel that sent it sliding open squealing and whimpering as the pleats formed wanting to kick the functionary where hed feel it she booted the door again then swore at her folly as it died on her the opening barely wide enough to let her waggle the case through and squeeze after it outside she brushed at herself tucked away her annoyance and strode through the gate as it clanked shut behind her she looked about she was on the outskirts of a gridded cluster of low blocky windowless buildings gray and brown scratched dingy not a bush or blade of grass to break the monotony automated factories deliveries of raw materials already made production in process everything tucked neatly out of sight and sound the patched dusty streets were empty as far as she could see there wasnt an intelligent entity within kilometers of her no transport he hadnt given her the chance to call a cab tk animated spleen she started walking there was a tall octagonal tower lifting like a raised finger over the city a flagpole stuck in the top with half a dozen tattered banners flapping in the wind she assumed it marked some sort of official center and used it to guide her through the factory section after another twenty minutes without seeing anyone a ground car like a black beetle hummed around a corner and sped past her its driver stared at her but went on without stopping friendly more of the humpy little vehicles zipped past drivers and passengers staring no one offering a ride a word a favor great little world uhhuh bolodo would have a market here selling closed contracts that took the laborers away when the job was done probably why the settlers came way out here in the first place five generations of hermits misanthropes and social inadequates whose idea of a good time had to be something like masturbation in a hot tub solitary masturbation hah might as well put out a sign saying stay away we dont want you leave your coin but leave she fumed a while longer then laughed shook her head eheh adelaar youre just annoyed because your feet hurt multiple maledictions on those perfidious perjurous unprincipled bootmakers who foisted these instruments of torture on me the streets widened lost their ruledrawn rigor as they turned and twisted among lush greenery trees shrubs grasses flowers a thousand versions of fern from great graceful clumps fanning overhead their shadows a dark lace on the pale gray pavement to gossamer cilia hanging from the trees in this tangle tossed down haphazardly she saw bits and pieces of small freestanding structures some domed some with peaked roofs some like tumbled toy blocks living places the silence of the factories was gone she heard birdsong and bug hum childrens laughter and their screams as they played among the ferns voices of men and women talking a mans shout now and then she saw the telffs they stopped what they were doing and stared at her but no one spoke the beetle cars came more frequently and were no friendlier than before several times she had to jump for the gutter when a driver swerved at her shouting obscenities sweat beaded on her skin and stayed there adding to the discomforts this world laid on her the moment she set foot on it if it had been anything else but aslan thatd brought her here aaah hed better be good quale damn well better be good the streets straightened and grew wider the vegetation thinned she glanced up kinking her neck to see the top of the tower stood watching the banners flutter as she smiled in weary anticipation of a bed and a bath and food in her belly traffic was heavier and less aggressive the drivers too involved with their own concerns to let their xenophobia loose on her she went round a final curve and found herself trudging up a short ramp onto a raised walkway a real live sidewalk civilization at last she moved past a clutch of small stores offering everything from stacks of fruit to electronic gadgets the stores changed to eating houses then taverns then she was in a grimy rundown area stepping over men sprawled sleeping on the walkway around vomit and splatters of urine she jumped down into the street several times to avoid clusters of lounging idle males who when they saw her whistled popped their lips made suggestive sucking noises groped their crotches and shouted offers of assorted body parts twice a man grabbed at her but she managed to avoid his hand and move on without having to damage him they were telffs and by functionarys warning onus would be on her to justify whatever she did and she knew from frustrating experiences elsewhere that her presence here unaccompanied would be excuse enough for whatever they tried on her despite her growing fatigue she set a quick pace for herself her heels clicking briskly on the boards she looked directly ahead of her her face impassive ignoring the taunts counting on her peripheral vision to warn her of anything coming at her from the side on her ears to warn her of an attack from behind drop female voice loud coming from the street without hesitation adelaar went down curling round as she dropped landing on hip and elbow shenli darter out and ready she didnt need it two men lay crumpled on the walkway some five or six meters off she swung her legs under her and was on her feet a breath later a flit curved over to her its offside door open jump same voice she grabbed the cases tether and jumped as soon as she was inside before shed sorted herself out the driver slapped in the lever and the flit took off as if shed goosed it adelaar straightened up clipped the darter back under her arm and arranged the case by her feet thanks nada ahhmm kill them nope stunned em didnt know maybe they were friends of yours playing a prank not takes all types the driver swung the flit round a corner and slowed to a more decorous pace that should be enough to keep us clear of lice you just in thought so you want to believe the shit they tell you at the gate mess with a local and you lose you got credit they suck blood no credit bolodo gets you reason i yelled one of your unfriends had what looked like an ifklii yagamouche if he was a pro he couldve fried your brain fore he went down i loathe those things adelaar shivered i owe you let me moving her hand slowly so she wouldnt startle her rescuer she eased a business card from her belt here give me a call sometime shove it in the abdit there in front of you no need though i know nonetheless she dropped the card into the hollow thats a quiet stunner youve got i didnt hear a thing built it myself any place you want to go city center the directory youre not a local sweet lot arent they no but ive a friend here and a map on call center directory it is or mmmm nothing like a long hot bath after hard traveling theres an ottotel not too far from center got a com plate in the more expensive rooms thesere tapped into the main directory you can bypass most of the hassle that way let your fingers do the talking she grinned dropping more years off her absurdly childlike face barely past puberty if looks counted a pretty child kafolay skin kaff brown eyes light browngold hair in an exuberant halo of tiny curls there was a brown tattoo on the cheek nearest adelaar a detailed drawing of a hawks head a sudden dimple made the hawk dance as the girl broadened her grin when she caught adelaar staring at her adelaar drew her hand down the side of her face looked at the smear of mud in the palm ottotel she said please know what you mean shadith my name adelaar aici arash mine pleased to and i adelaar locked the door activated a sweep from the case to ensure her privacy local authorities legal and otherwise tended to ignore regulations when it suited them calling blessings on shadiths head from every god saint and holy force she knew she scrubbed off telffers grit grime and sticky sweat and with them the greater part of her irritation pulled on a robe tailored from midnight silk dialed up a pot of nara tea and settled in front of the plate whistling a snatch of an old song she fed tokens into the slot quale quale where are you when youre home if youre home she scrolled through the directory let treviglio be right let him be home wherever that is wherever ah here we are swardheld quale quales nest tk tk how cute god help me suppose his mind really works like that lat deg min w long deg min n in residence open for offers blessed be whatever im running out of time and money damn if i could handle this myself she thumbed off the directory and sat sipping at the tea taking a moment to relax before she dressed and looked for transport out to quales nest ii a short while before the meeting less than an hour quales nesttelffer i was out in the back yard working on a harpframe lovely wood dark and resonant didnt have a name herby snagged the tree out of the river and took it to his curing shed herbys a neighbor upstream he belongs to one of the settlement families his lands tax free so long as he or his kin own it got the temperament and habits of a mudweasel but he keeps to himself unless he scavenges something he thinks he can sell me so hes not all that bad as a neighbor where was i ah the harp the shape sang under my hands and looked like music whether it would sound as good well i was hoping it was almost ready for stringing i was carving a design into it most complex pattern ive attempted double spirals and woven lacings amarelo buds and leaves in oval cartouches took concentration and more patience than i thought i had until i started working on it id put together frames before this one trying one thing and another different shapes different woods you get the idea i wanted to make the sound as perfect as the shape far as i could tell my ears not so bad but my fingers are all thumbs the last one before this had a warm rich tone i was quite pleased with it when shadith sent word she was coming i got it out with a couple more and tuned them i wanted to know what she thought back yards a comfortable place i spend a lot of time here working reading contemplating my navel whatever got a plank fence around it to keep the vermin out flowering thornbushes grow in stripbeds against the planks a sight to see they are come spring when every cane is thick with bloom no roof but theres a deflecter field for when it rains keeps the wet out without ruining the skyview which can be spectacular during summer storms one of them was blowing up the day im talking about clouds were gathering over stormbringers peak theyd be down on us in an hour or so ive got the ground under my worktable paved with roughcut slabs of slate some of them are cracked griza grass grows in these cracks and between the slabs thats a native grass dusty looking graygreen puts out seedheads in the spring not the fall they stand up over the blades like minute denuded umbrella ribs beyond the stone theres mute clover griza doesnt have a chance against it there are stacks of wood sitting around some roughcut planks some stripped logs ive got a largish workshed in the south corner the roof is mostly skylight i store my tools in there but dont work inside except in winter when its too cold to sit in the garden or when i need to use the lathe or one of the saws there are two viuvars like short fat willows growing beside the shed and a tendrij in the north corner the tendrij was here on my mountainside before i built my house the trunks a pewter column a hundred meters tall and thirty around branches start about fifty meters up black spikes spiraling around the bole the leaves if you can call them that look like ten meter strips of graygreen and bluegreen cellophane when the storm winds blow them straight out they roar loud enough to deafen you on lazy warm spring days like this one they shimmer and whisper and throw patches of shifting greens and blues in place of shadow my worktable is a builtup slab of congel wood tough that wood takes a molecular edge to work it but it lasts forever a benefit to living on telffer you pay in blood for congel offworld mottled medium brown with patches of gold like a pale tortoiseshell pretty stuff which is a good thing because it wont take stain any way you try it and even paint peels off something about the oil they say i had the gouges i was using laid out on a patch of leather close to hand the tool kit beside it the frame i was working on set in padded clamps the finished harps down at the far end waiting for shadith to try them butterflies flittered about lighting on the thornflowers feeding on their pollen a sight to add pleasure to the day but it meant id got worms in the wood and i was going to have to fumigate the yard there were quilos squealing in the viuvars quilos are furry mats with skinny black legs six of them and deft little black fingers on their paws never been able to find any sign of eyes ears or nose on them though theyre fine gliders and can skitter about on the ground like drops of water on a greased griddle they drive the cats crazy how can you prowl downwind of a thing thats got no nose or chase something that can switch direction without caring which end is front i had five cats last time i counted and theyre all neutered so that should be that but none of them are black and two days ago i saw this black body creeping low to the ground going after a quilo who was chewing on a beetle it picked off a thornbush its why i tolerate a few of the things about they keep the bug population down i threw a chunk of wood at the cat and it streaked off a young black tom pels says he thinks theres something mystical about black toms theres never an assemblage of cats without one of them showing up he says hes convinced theyre born out of the collective unconscious of cats structures of unbridled libido created to assuage cat lust he may be right pels kurkorso lets see hes my com off and aux pilot hes got a thing with plants and keeps my slancy green hes heavyworld born and bred mevvyaurang not many have heard of it aurrangers arent much for company or traveling g where they have three sexes sperm carrier rau seed carrier arra wombnurse maung hes rau hmm theres a heavy burden he has to bear drives him into craziness sometimes females of every sentient species ive come across even the reptilids want to cuddle him they all think hes devastatingly cute fluffy little teddy bear with big brown eyes barely up to my belt which is small even among his own people talking about the aurrangers theyre agoraphobes in a big way live in huddles underground funny theyre frightened of just about everything and theyre the best damn predators ive met you ought to see pels stalking something that fuzz of his isnt fur at all when hes up for hunting it kicks over into a shifting camouflage that beats hell out of a chameleon web thing is he was born a misfit always going out on the surface fascinated by space and the stars that gave the night sky a frosty sheen he was different enough to be miserable with his own people he applied for a workstudy grant to university and got it being very very bright but once he got his degree with an honors list a km long no one took him seriously enough to hire him he was too damn cute when his money ran out he had a choice between scavenging for scraps and a life of little crimes or living in luxury as a family pet he was a reasonably competent burglar by the time i put my slancy orza into orbit park over adminuniversity i was finishing a job for some xenobiologists delivering a cargo of rare plants the com off i had on that trip she had a sweet paper trail and was a golden goddess for looks but she was a whiner kumari and me we came close to strangling her but we held off till we reached university we fired her without recommendation it was safer than pushing her out a lock if not so satisfying we turned over the plants and went out to celebrate our freedom from that rockdrill whine sometime round dawn we got tangled up with pels who was committing mayhem on what looked to be half the thugs on starstreet amazing thing to watch we hauled him loose and took him home with us because kumari was curious about him no she wasnt about to go motherly over him i talk about her as she because she looks female but shes a neuter got the sex drive of a rock and her maternal instincts could be engraved on a neutrino with a number ten nail most of her energy goes into curiosity we needed a com off he needed a job we took him on for one trip to see how he fit in that was seven years ago pels was digging around the thornbushes pulling weeds cleaning away sawdust and bits of paper and old leaves loosening the earth about the roots he keeps after me about the plants in the back yard says im neglecting them but those thornbushes could use a little neglect theyre volunteers blown in by the hefty winds we get in the thaw storms if i pampered them the way he wants theyd take over the yard hey theyd take over the world he was about threequarters finished with the thorns baroombrooming along happy as he could get on a miserable oneg world kumari was stretched out on a padded recliner leafing through a book of poems composed in interlingue and interlarded with local idiom she read snatches of them to me when she came across something she thought i ought to like mostly i ignored her being too concentrated on gouge and wood to have much mind left for other things all the same it was a pleasant noise shadith came about an hour after lunch shadith brushed aside curls and chips of wood swung onto the table she set her hands on her thighs waited until i finished the cut and ran my thumb along the line i need a sneaky lander she said lend me slider hmm see what you think of those harps you like one you can have it she laughed at me old bear put down your ax hooking a foot around a table leg she leaned back ran her eyes over the three harps chose one not the best i thought but a start with a treble grunt she straightened settled the harp against her shoulder and drew her fingers along the strings interesting tuning well why dyou want it she wrinkled her nose at me concentrated on her playing even i could tell the tone was dull the song was dying on her one dud i think the wood was the problem there no resonance to it grays disappeared she said im off to see what happened i see want help this is a loser bear she did her lean again switched harps straightened dont think so it was my favorite she had this time she smiled at the sound of it played a snatch of some tune or other moved on to another then another my first chance to go off on my own she said after some minutes of noodling about in my own body got a tuning wrench around i want to try something in the kit i lifted the tool kit over the harpframe i was working on and pushed it toward her keep it if you want easy enough for me to pick up another you might be too busy where youre going i watched her as she began retuning the harp this was the first time id got a good look at that new body couldnt really count the web signal the picture flats out here on telffer its a long way from anywhere and the color bleeds runs round the image like lectrify jelly lot of dumps and glitches around us i found myself thinking whats a baby doing jumping into something hairy as that then i had to laugh shadow little shadith sitting inside that head she was what three four thousand years older than me thing is its hard to remember that looking at her i was glad id had the nous to keep my mouth shut i doubt having a body has changed her that much she had a nasty turn of speech when she was annoyed she finished the tuning began to play weird resonances tried to do things to my head if id listened harder i mightve had visions like some flaked out holyman hmm nice once you got used to it i went back to carving the music made the cuts seem easier kumari closed her eyes laid her book open facedown on her stomach pels stopped his humming but kept on with his digging remember his ears they were up as high as they went spread out and quivering he had them turned toward the table i like the tone of this n she said thats the one i thought came out best but try the other why not she traded harps played with the new one a little set it aside youre right the second ones by far the best you neednt sound so surprised poor old bear that rubbed at you eh put your fur down i didnt mean it that way the lander i looked at kumari she managed to shrug without moving pels sat on his haunches and gave me a slitted look he didnt say anything but i got the point take it shadow anything happens the cost comes out of my share of profits kumari has a sound she makes when shes amused it isnt quite laughter its a combined rattle and hiss like the noises a kettle makes when the waters about to boil damn right she said pels grinned baring a pair of fangs that almost made him uncute yes he said if anythings sure in this unsure universe that is he voices his sibilants and shifts or drops his plosives its those teeth but im not going to try to reproduce how he sounds shadow be sure you get the sikkul paems to run you through the basic finger patterns the paems and me we havent finished working on her so the codings a nightmare dont get yourself in a spot where you have to switch about fast slow and sneaky gotcha grr he went back to fiddling in the dirt she slid off the table this harp have any kind of case in the workshed on the table by the lathe thanks old bear call it a comingout present she laughed and went trotting to the workshed kumari raised a brow a bit young to be running loose isnt she crew knows my history makes things easier when i get down and dark so they knew what i was talking about when i said shes older than me comingout kumari pinched her nose shame swar before i could answer that the incom tinged and the housekeep came on one adelaar aici arash to see swardheld quale business no appointment the plate showed a small woman with a determined face while housekeep waited for me to decide what i wanted to do eh i know her shadith came to stand beside me swinging the harp case when i was coming from the port i saw her walking along sterado street two men were going after her locals i think on the street not pros then well one of them had a yagamouche so they were serious about it i stunned em took her to that ottotel on fejimao her business cards in my flit if you want an extra check on her um i got fots of the men theyre in the flits memory you want you can have them she frowned if this is business coming up wont you be needing slider a deals a

best do that in the office while were up there you can give me the access code ill have housekeep tap your flit if theres local talent after her i nodded at the plate i can use the fots to place them might even recognize them myself who knows better i have some idea what wed be getting into before i close with her i told the housekeep to let the woman in and take her to the living room i wiped my hands off brushed at the wood chips on my shirt and trousers and for maybe ten seconds thought about changing my clothes decided if she wanted a three piece suit she could buy one kumari pels ill open the com you keep an eye on what happens give me a call if you see something im missing aukma harrees blessing on her little head kumari yawned i was getting bored doing nothing lean on her swar someone that close to being offed should have a strong idea of how much her life is worth she made her happy noise a lean for a lien the one on your share thats not even worth a groan you finished shadow come on lets find some air without verbal farts in it i like towers so i built myself one taller than the tendrij it is faced with fieldstone and paneled with the finest wood on telffer makes you want to reach out and caress it and im not saying i dont if im alone so i dont embarrass myself my office is on the top floor of the tower got a desk and all the gadgets i need to keep my peace unruffled a pair of tupple chairs for my clients a stunner or two in the walls in case one of em gets ambitious a droptube under my chair same reason handknotted rug from gomirik couple of paintings i like a stone sculpture by a man on university whats his name ah sarmaylen place looks nice if i say it myself the towers tucked into the southeast corner of the main house you get to it through the living room theres no outside entrance at least not one i show an ordinary visitor the guest rooms are freestanding connected by a walkway theyve all got outside doors for my privacy and theirs harpcase bumping against her backside strap over her shoulder shadith followed me in the woman was standing in the middle of the living room prissy disapproval in the curve of her downturned mouth hmm there was a bit of a mess in there so what nothing to do with her her eyes flickered when she saw shadith but the expression on her face didnt change looked like she was plated with stainless steel a lot of anger underneath though no passion no warmth only anger and a hard control as if shed explode if she let go her grip a single instant come i said and palmed the tube open my office is the towers top floor she nodded a taut economical jerk of her head then followed shadow and me into the lift tube iii approaching zero quales nesttelffer the flickit was battered rusty with an intermittent eructation in its field generator that jolted a grunt out of adelaar every time because it wasnt regular enough to let her get set for the drop the seat she sat on was dusty streaked with ancient grease and sweat polished to a high gloss by years and years of antsy behinds when the driver pulled open the door for her and she smelled the interior for the first time her stomach lurched and she couldnt help flinching from the filth but she climbed in without comment she couldnt afford to antagonize the driverowner he was the only one willing to take her out of prin daruze the only one if he dumped her shed have to do her negotiating over the com circuit and that would be like broadcasting her woes to the world specifically to bolodo neyuregg ltd besides she had to see quale to know him so much depended on him the driver was a dour and silent man pressed to go faster he slowed to a crawl she recognized defeat and kept her fuming internal the trip wasnt all that long only about an hour but his stubborn silence meant there was nothing to distract her from her fretting the past three plus years had been a heavy drain on her resources shed taken her best researcher off markets and tech breaks set him hunting out mercenaries shed put in escrow a sum for hiring the most reliable of them once she located her daughter shed left adelaris ltd in halashs hands he was a good manager hed keep things going but he wasnt up to finding new markets or people the company would be treading in place shed drawn her travel and research expenses from adelaris current account the search had taken far longer and was more costly than shed expected the account was dangerously low now she really couldnt pull more out without destroying her business bankrupting herself and her partners theyd been patient with her they more or less had to be she was adelaris without her patents and processes without her energies adelaris security systems wouldnt exist but there was a limit to how much she could ask of them if quale didnt work out shed have to tap into the escrow fund and that might start a hemorrhage that would kill all chance of getting aslan back the drivers fee was one more stone on the pile which didnt make it easier for her to tolerate his sour misogyny the flickit flew west and a little south labored along a steepwalled river gorge which cut deep into mountains that rose and subsided like waves of stone each wave higher than the last narrow grassy valleys dividing them mountains thick with trees and brush with fortress houses scattered widely along the slopes it labored through a pass and came out into a broad valley turned several degrees farther south and followed the river to a house on a mountainside a rambling structure with scattered suites like nodes on an angular vine a tower at a corner of the largest node the telff circled wide round the house set down at a detached landing pad at least two hundred meters off clanked the door open for her and settled himself to sleep while he waited for her to finish her business or send him away whether she went back with him or not hed gotten a roundtrip fee from her when she was out he cracked an eye stay on the path he said you wont like what happens you go off it thanks she shut the door looked around there was a sleek black flickit on the pad a ships flit beside it she frowned walked over to the flit nodded that girl shadith ticks blood was that a setup she shivered feeling trapped and loathing it banged her fist against the side of the flit shivered again with rage this time impatient with herself she shoved away her apprehension and went striding off along the metaled pathway there was no time for this nonsense she was here shed know what she needed to do once she met the man everything else was unimportant aslan ayyy three years gone she could be dead no i wont think that shes a survivor she let herself be trapped but killed no she followed a small floating serviteur along a hallway past several closed doors the wood of the walls and ceiling had a deep shimmering glow the grain was a subtle calligraphy flowing like music under the buttery shine of lightberries on golden bronze stalks she narrowed her eyes at the serviteur eased closer to the leftside wall drew her fingers along the wood after a few steps she dropped her hand and walked faster the serviteur led her into a room full of light gray light from the gathering storm spidery with distant lightning a room without corners irregularly shaped with a bite out of one side where the tower was huge windows ran from floor to ceiling a ceiling more than ten meters high with cathedral beams a distant richness of texture and line polarizing glass in them pale now the windows looked out across the valley or up toward the mountains peak chairs were clustered about these windows comfortable leather covered ancient design trays on the floor remnants of todays noon meal congealing on plates and bowls books and papers piled haphazardly about drifts of them next to the chairs set into the wall opposite the door there was a huge fireplace meant to take logs not limbs or splits a table in front of it littered with several pieces of wood and some gouges chips and curls of wood scattered about a glass with a sticky residue coating the sides and hardening in the bottom a bowl of fruit with a halfeaten apple turning brown a tea tray with a plain pot and drinking bowls teaset windows walls chairs the nubbly dark green rug on the floor stone and wood sculptures scattered about tapestries paintingsfrom the moment she came through the outer door shed been bombarded with texture and color that said something about the man she wasnt quite sure what also clutter she looked around and silently sneered at the debris of living in what might have been an elegant room he had serviteurs he wouldnt have to lift a finger to clean up after himself once hed properly programmed them that he didnt could mean he was comfortable with this mess maybe even preferred it to order cluttery mind cutesy mind quales nest she began to feel a little sick he came into the room followed by the young girl who may or may not have rescued her a tall man thick black hair a streak of white running through it extending the line of a scar which touched his eyebrow with a dot of white skimmed past his eye and swung down to the corner of his mouth pale graygreen eyes droopy eyelids nose like a predators beak mustache beard both clipped short broad shoulders long arms a loose easy body easy body easy man if you left him alone at least that was her first response to him he wore scuffed old sandals with bronze buckles heavy tan trousers cut off above the knees a shirt made from the same cloth sleeves ripped out faded softer than velvet after many washings wrinkle on wrinkle frayed at the seams and edges unimpressive she told herself unprofessional she didnt believe it he moved like a man comfortable in his body not an athlete or a dancer nothing so selfconscious just one who expected it to do whatever he required of it without fuss or lagging he crossed to the bulge of the tower looked over his shoulder at her come he said and palmed open the entrance to a lift tube my office is the towers top floor at least the office was neat he gestured to a tupple chair hanging soft and shapeless beside a tall window waited until she was seated before rounding the desk and settling himself a moment he said theres some business i have to finish he beckoned shadith to him tipped up a sensor plate touched a sound barrier between adelaar and them he looked up at the girl raised a brow said something his mouth blurring so adelaar couldnt read it shadith smiled made a quick curving gesture with one hand spoke rapidly leaned on his shoulder as he worked the sensor plate adelaar watched his hands they moved with the controlled clumsiness of a craftsman no flash to them easy slow sure long scarred fingers tapering to spatulate tips nails cut short clean but scratched he didnt take care of his hands too bad they were the best part of him as far she was concerned she sighed and looked away the storm had broken outside rain streaked the window glass the valley was green swept with silver the river cloudblack and rainsilver soundless rain the office was too insulated from the outside to let the patter through too bad still the storm gave the room a cozy feel especially when she looked around again and saw the girl was gone ambiguous uncertain figure that reminded adelaar how little real control she had over events quale leaned forward forearms on the desktop another of telffers jewel woods hands clasped watching her waiting for her to tell him what she wanted from him she touched the controls and brought the tupple chair humming closer to the desk slipped the dicarx from her belt laid it in front of him adelaar aici arash droom in the hegger combine he collected the dicarx and fed it into the evaluator glanced at the plate ah adelaris security systems he looked up his eyes laughing ive heard about you never could afford you she lifted a hand let it fall i have a daughter she said tenured associate university xenoethnologist awarded a grant permission to study the unntoualar on kavelda styernna framed torture of a subject perversion sentenced death sentence commuted to thirty years contract labor bolodo neyuregg ltd the contractor i want her out of that whats it going to cost me depends on where she is do you know that no i know how to find out it took me more than three years to get that far those men shadith stunned the directory placed them looks like you annoyed bolodo sometime during those three years and they managed to id you shame that he drew his thumb along his bearded jawline ruffling the short black hair theyre not too worried yet or theyd ve sent pros instead of depending on local talent the ends of his mustache lifted subsided a shadowed smile assuming theres something theyre twitchy about that involves your daughter otherwise theyd ignore you it doesnt cost them anything if you peel her loose theyve got their fee looks to me like bolodos up to something thatd give them big trouble if it came out give us trouble if they think were getting close hmm he sat back his eyes fixed on her face you know what it is no youve got some idea yes he lifted a brow terse so hmm his eyelids drooped until his eyes were slits he brushed the tip of his forefinger slowly back and forth across his mustache as he thought that over after a moment he leaned forward tapped in a code that brought a large viewplate unfolding from a slot in the desk top kink he said kumari pels conference he looked up bring your chair round here he told adelaar but keep your mouth shut if you dont mind unless youre asked something the plate split into three cells furry cuddly type with twitchy ears set high on its head she didnt know the species milkglass maiden pale hair thick and silky pale skin pale gray eyes cool and intelligent hadnt come across that kind either interesting ropy coils clusters of succulent black eyes colored pulse patches hairy exoskeleton sikkul paems them she knew adult with a yearling bud crouching by ves head quales crew bolodo neyuregg quale said you heard we start this thing wed better be prepared to dodge a lot whats this adelaar thought ticks blood do i have to sell all of them multiple maledictions on my miserable luck i hadnt planned on letting any of this out not until after we closed the deal anyway why did that girl have to be tied up with him the milkglass maiden opened her pale pink mouth what species not one of the cousin races must be some backwater bunch that never made space snatching she had a husky purring voice more life in that than in her face slaving undisguised what else considering what jaszaca ti vnok told us her voice was cool her cool eyes distant spotchals has to suspect something chancy is going on but they wont press it as long as no one rubs spotchallix noses in the mess id say the trade is small but enormously profitable otherwise bolodo wouldnt risk it theyve got a strong base in spotchals but theyve got to be careful they own some pols and some career functionaries even so theyve got potential for problems remember the fuzzy one lifted a black lip exposed a yellowed tearing tooth four centimeters long carnivore she thought deceptive little thing yeah i was in this bar the night before we left couple of bolodo security come in hunh one minute you wouldnt ve noticed a grenade go off in your lap next you could hear your hair grow spotchallix they like the taxes bolodo pays but they hold their noses when they hear the name if it came out bolodo was slaving id give them a year at most before they were gone quale brushed at his mustache nodded why doesnt he just ask is this meant to impress me pompous idiot oh god how long do i have to sit here keeping my face straight kinok he said you know them the hard way what do you think the bud kahat skittered along a heavy tentacle perched on the voice box ves umbilical pulsed ves hairfine digits manipulated the minute sensorboard they are very careful the synthesized voice was a sweetly musical tenor quietly absurd a paem playing gentle jokes on vesself the heavens should open they hold records on the meat back to creation or as close as they can get keep it legal keep the record trail clean if theres anything gray wash it white or bury it deep vewhospeaks was sold and sold again without diminishing ves debt one ounce gold they charge for air they charge for transport food sewage removal soilage anything they can imagine and their imaginations are vast vewhospeaks must agree with kumari the profit is beyond conjecture great to tempt bolodo across the line vewhospeaks also believes very few an inner circle of execs know of this operation and this circle will not allow information about it to escape their hands even their nervousness they will clutch tight to their bosoms for beings who suspect trouble such urgency would be damning vewhospeaks thinks that is why aici arash has escaped serious difficulty till now this is speculation swar errors are likely say it is this way in her search for her daughter aici arash leaves traces behind that are used to id her after she is gone if such happened before she went she would be dead so the circle knows her name connects her with her daughter realizes her daughter is involved with the secret thing they do not know precisely what she has discovered but they must fear she had enough to go looking and that is dangerous they send word to their stringers to locate and remove her as a matter of swatting a nuisance no great urgency in it only a chance for an ambitious outerling to earn company points they woo luck but will not trust her vewhospeaks believes they are now organizing something more serious vewhospeaks says deal with aici arash it is no longer possible to stand aside the bud kahat went still kinok turned his eye clusters from the screen turned them back jolted kahat into renewed activity shadow comes byol tok swar consider the cell went dark kumari nodded i agree active or passive were in it i prefer to be paid for working pels said nothing showed his teeth in a feral grin that unfortunately made him look like a naughty cub quale tapped off the screen sent it folding into the desk turned to face adelaar you pay fuel and reasonable expenses that is not negotiable my base fee is fifty thousand helvetian gelders you being adelaris i have a proposition ten thousand only escrowed the rest ill take in trade adelaris systems for my house and my ship supposing we come out of this with skins intact and brain in working order generous i dont think two thousand house or ship not both mmmh think of it as a professional discount the ship gets a complete workover the house an appraisal with suggestions for improvement i do the actual work five thousand gelders three thousand done you like storms what storms he waved a hand at the window where the rain was sheeting across the glass she looked from him to the shifting silvery streaks i suppose i do as long as its not raining down my neck then well have tea in the garden he came out of his chair with that loose ease that continued to stir things in her she didnt want stirred she didnt like him he was too chaotic and cluttered for her taste too wild undisciplined a weed too young she kept thinking of negatives but as she gave him her hand and he lifted her from the clinging tupple chair they kept fading on her a serviteur will take you there he said if you dont mind ill start shutting the house down be with you shortly pels and kumari are there ask them anything you want well be leaving soon as the rain quits he walked with her to the tube opened it for her twitched his mustache at her as she stepped silently into the tube damn the man he had to know the effect he had on women that creature kumari his leman the serviteur was waiting for her in the living room the debris from the meal was gone but the rest of the clutter was untouched was likely to stay untouched for however long it took to find aslan shaking her head she followed the small bot as it hummed away gliding a meter off the floor pels and kumari sat at a table in an open structure of stressed wood molded into a round of arches with a circular roof of roughcut shakes its floor was raised shoulder high off the grass and looked out over scattered beds of brilliantly colored flowers and convoluted variously textured banks of fern the deflector field shunted aside the rain as the clouds boiled black and wild overhead and lightning walked along the valley floor some distance below the house adelaar smiled with pleasure as she heard the hoom of the wind the steady hiss of the rain the crack of thunder and lightning quale said the storms were spectacular that was rather an understatement she climbed the steps gave pels and kumari a nod a stiff impersonal smile and settled into the chair kumari pulled out for her quale said something about closing down the house up close kumari looked less human her skin was white and translucent as milkglass milkglass maiden and delicately scaled no eyebrows her nose was a low knife blade slightly turned up at the tip with narrow nostrils small mouth a pale pale bluish pink narrow jaw pointed chin she was narrow and angular as a primitive sculpture her hands were extravagantly long and thin there was a faint drag on her flesh that suggested shed been born and reared on a lighter world than this he means well probably get away clean but bolodo is apt to slag the place out of sheer snittishness hes setting the automatics may work may not depends on what they send planetaries wont keep them out what planetaries oh adelaar looked round then why dont worry about it kumari made an odd little sound a rattling hiss that adelaar eventually interpreted as laughter he spent half a dozen years building the place he was worse than a wounded auglauk when he had to admit it was finished hes been walking around muttering to himself about redoing this or that but he cant convince himself he could do better if bolodo levels it hell have the fun of rebuilding right pels the furry person produced a rumbling chuckle improve his temper no end adelaar watched the storm a while she was intensely curious about these two but couldnt in courtesy ask for their life histories courtesy aside they were not likely to bare their souls for her a stranger and a mere client youre quales crew pels answered her two thirds kumari broke in one half youre forgetting kahat shoosh kri kahat thats the third kahat ves had since ve came he dug into his face fur with short black claws that looked as formidable as his tearing teeth explained to adelaar what he meant kinok eats the current kahat every two years when the buds about to complete separation sacrifice to the drives ve says you know sikkul paems i know me im com off and kumari shes ships mom she knows everything about everything fool kumari patted him on the cheek cuteness has warped your pea brain he growled at her fell silent as a pair of serviteurs came humming up with large trays spice tea crisp wafers small glass bowls with sections of local fruit glass skewers to eat them with the tea service was native clay rough glazed a warm dark brown with hints of rust and a deep blue shadow where the glaze was smooth the drinking bowls generous with a restrained elegance of form adelaar lifted one of the bowls cupped it in her hand enjoying its weight and texture local one of my neighbors downstream shes got a patch of kaolin shes been working for the past thirty years quale came through an arch and dropped into the fourth chair do anything for thirty years and you tend to get good at it pour for us kumari he sat sipping at the tea and watching the storm adelaar skewered a slice of ruby fruit ate it it was good a mix of bloodheart plum and citrus firm fleshy full of juice she closed her eyes swallowed the fruit savoring the blend of flavors in her mouth and the drama of the storm against her ears she thrust the skewer through a rosepink wedge sniffed at it crunched her teeth into it smiled at the spurt of sweet tart flavor alternating bites of wafer and fruit washing them down with sips of tea she took the edge off a hunger she hadnt noticed before after several minutes of silence quale turned his head you send your driver off tk i forgot him i left him sleeping in his flickit she grimaced at the rain i hope the thing doesnt leak who sour type called oormy sounds unlikely but thats what i made of his mutter ha the worm no one else would bring you no she smoothed her fingers over the textured glaze of her bowl what do you want me to do go back to daruze and wait i dont think that would be a good idea no of course not ships lander is coming down here were not going anywhere near the city unless you have something there you need to retrieve my case in the flickit thats all i have hmm let worm sleep till the storms over he cant fly in that stuff anyway he reached under the table pulled up a servitrage ordered the housekeep to fetch adelaars case the moment the rain stopped and tell the driver oormy to go home after he clipped the trage away he set his elbows on the table clasped his hands about time you did some talking mmm time how much longer will this storm last an hour maybe a little more ah she closed her eyes weariness sweeping through her three plus years working alone never knowing if the next day next hour next minute would see her banging her head against a barrier even she couldnt get through or around or in a trap that got her ashed three plus years until quale said done and the deal was closed three plus years stretched taut then the elastic broke it hadnt hit her up there in the office but now now soothed by the sounds of the storm the tea and fruit a warm comfortably heavy lump in her middle a need to talk washed over her frightening her at the same time luring her to say things shed never said even to herself to say more than shed said to anyone since churri the bard she understood what was happening to her the euphoria that came from a sudden release of tension but understanding was no help at all mind if i ramble a bit why not i need to get the feel of things his voice was distant almost lost in the storm noises as seductive as her exhaustion just talk whatever you feel like saying mmm eyes still closed she slid down in the chair until her head rested on the back she never sat like this in public never but she was too tired to care just moving a finger made her body ache you know anything about the saber worlds i can understand that still people did go there especially to sonchйren sunsets and opal mines chasm falls and tantserbok hunters came from all over to hunt the tantserbok i never understood those types going after beasts no one could eat or use their flesh was poison their skin wouldnt tan it rotted in three days no matter what you tried and more hunters died than tantserboks five hunters out one back the ratio changed now and then never in favor of the hunters but all those dead seemed to make the next ones more eager can you explain that to me quale can you make it make sense i think stupidity cant be genetic it has to be a birth defect or something like that why else with the kill rate like it is are there so many idiots around ah that was a long time ago churri came to see the sunsets churri the bard he called himself a poet of sorts im no judge he moved me but my brothers laughed at him he was a little man im not tall and hed tuck under my chin he got me so messed up i didnt know which end was where god i hate that phrase i dont know why i use it one of my brothers caught us nearly killed churri he took off and didnt stop till he was on a ship going somewhere else a month later i was being sick in the morning and bloating up like a milaqq in a cloudburst her voice trailed off she opened her eyes a slit and examined quale there was something about him that reminded her of churri she couldnt decide what it was but then she wasnt all that good at reading people not his looks churrid been bald as an egg and dark amber all over with bronze cat eyes that laughed a lot though never at himself a streak of cruelty with little malice in it like the cruelty of a cat a spinoff of the curiosity passion detachment that fueled his poetry aslan had inherited the curiosity and the passion but hadnt yet acquired that detachment probably never would quale what was it about him something of that same detachment that playful painful digging into the others well call it soul quale had an easy way of moving but churri was made of springsteel and sunfire to look at him made her shiver quale was amiable competent enough but low in energy tepid that was the word churri was restless and unpredictable he seemed easily seduced into tangents but was not no that was his cunning he was a stubborn little git when he wanted something he got it her for one that was something else their daughter had inherited she was about as biddable as a black hole before she could walk or talk ahh it didnt matter probably just a question of hormones i was upset and tired let my guard down she shut her eyes my father was a man of great honor hmm he shut me in a cell and brought in whores to tend me because no decent woman should have to look at me its a miracle or good genes take your pick that i lived through that time and aslan was born healthy my father left her with me till she was weaned then he gave her to a baby market if shed been a boy he might have kept her though i dont think so she looked too different skin was too dark eyes were goldlike churris not washy blue like his me he sold into contract labor not to bolodo to a smaller contractor one you could get loose from if you had the brains and drive i dont like thinking about that time but it taught me what it took to survive when you didnt have a family back of you after three years i managed to buy out and i went looking for aslan seems to be a habit that found her too things were fine for a while i was doing this and that pulling in enough credit to keep us comfortable apprenticed myself to a minor genius and learned everything he wanted to teach me and a lot he didnt want out of his hands until aslan hit puberty and i turned into my father tk we had some royal fights aslan was smarter than id been no roving poets for her but she didnt like my friends she found them boring nauseating unethical she had an obsession about ethics dont know where she picked it up it was bad as a deformity for scaring people off she didnt like what i was doing ethics again she wanted no part of my friends or my business the rows got worse nothing physical we werent that sort but we were clawing at each other with words and she was very good with words better than i was i sputtered and yelled and got frustrated but she never lost her tongue we loved each other but we couldnt live together so aslan went to university adelaar sighed she couldnt stand my friends but she took up with some of the worst nannys there flatulent bores maybe intelligent but ignorant of anything to do with real life id visit her shed visit me wed be polite a while about each others friends and oh everything until the facade broke and we had another row wed give it a rest till next time but we kept in fairly close touch by submail funny we had our best conversations on faxsheets though maybe not the most private we set up a code of sorts words that meant trouble but i can handle it trouble help fast that kind of thing she has this fixation about recording cultures for the poor destroyed native species whod probably skin her and roast her if they got the chance she was always poking into places no sane trader would go near we had rows about that paranoid mama she called me you get what you expect she said expect people to be nice you get nice i told her she was an idiot she just laughed then this unntoualar thing came up a chance to be the first researcher into kavelda styernna she stopped by droom on the way there she was full of it the first time shed gone in alone shed got five student assistants and a manager duncan shears she said he was the best there was at handling logistics university was going all out for her i was scared out of my mind for her id heard nasty rumors about the styernnese and the unntoualar i warned her she wouldnt like what she was going to find out and she should be damn careful what she looked at university was no good to her if the oligarchy decided to off her what could they do about an accident however fatal i told her to yell if things looked murky id come and get her hell with styernna and everything this time she didnt argue she knew it was going to be touchy the oligarchy was only letting her in because of long hard pressure from their homeworld bradjeen kiell and from university and they were going to watch every move she made its a filthy universe and were about the filthiest things in it if it was up to me id say sweep the debris into the nearest sun and get on with todays business knowing how sick and perverse we can be is useless doesnt change anything except maybe it encourages the freaks i told her that i dont know how many times but shes a passionate creature aslan and she believes time can repair the damage we do if given material to work with and its her mission to collect that material i said that didnt i ah well my minds not tracking im too tired so she went i got a submail letter from her a month later bright and chatty saying how helpful the styernnese were no doubt for benefit of the censor she expected to read it but she worked the code in and that told me it was a bigger mess than even i thought and she was scared but hanging on and if i didnt hear from her by the last third of each month i should come get her come quiet and careful i started tying knots in things so i could go as soon as the mail didnt come it happened so fast got a letter one day where the undertext said she was picking up stories that nauseated her that she was nervous but coping three weeks later university subbed over a transcript of her trial and an apology because they couldnt do anything directly for her but she was still alive thered been a death sentence but it had been commuted to thirty years contract labor alive under involuntary contract you arent alive youre walking dead the time i was under contract i was tougher than asland ever be but those three years came close to killing me be damned if i left her in that mess shed been trashed university said as much but i didnt need them telling me they were going to try buying her clear if they could find out who had her and they were going after styernna oh they were hot against styernna gnashing their bitty teeth shuh i didnt care what they did i wanted my daughter besides that lot of nannys couldnt find their assholes without a map getting into styernna wasnt easy theyd closed down the ports not even homeworld types could land and they had the satellites on alert for snoopers but given the coin anythings available i knew this smuggler he put me down and arranged to lift me off a month later i nosed around kay strenn thats the capital trying to sniff out what theyd done with aslan it wasnt easy aslan calls me paranoid mama but im a lamb beside those shits i have this medkit which is probably unlegal on just about every world i know of but its useful at times like this i suppose i shouldnt tell you that what the hell i went after the trial judge he was the only one i could get at without more preparation than i had time for and local muscle which i had no access to he didnt know much except that aslan must have found out something really ugly because the oligarchy wanted her dead and ordered him to take care of it like always he did what he was told and drowned what qualms he had in the local version of hipo brandy he was involved in the commutation he had to sign the papers i got bolodos name from him and something peculiar if the oligarchy wanted aslan dead why sell her to a contractor who might take what he learned from her and blackmail them didnt make sense officially my babbling judge knew nothing about why it happened but hed picked up rumors bolodo had paid certain members of the oligarchy bribes and promised them aslan would disappear so thoroughly shed be better than dead why aslan not for her body shuh shes my daughter and i love her but even i wouldnt call her a beauty shes attractive enough but there are thousands of women more so not all that sexy either shes more interested in scrungy natives and putting together culture flakes than she is in men theyre for recreation when shes not busy with something else and that shows to be honest quale shes a very boring person secrets everything shes done has been published one way or another shes a xenoethnologist for gods sake whod pay a pile of coin for a xenoethnologist there it is what it says to me is this bolodo had an order from some crawly who has the hots for a scholar and aslan dropped into their fingers scholars do tend to have a lot of backing colleagues and so on who yelp when something happens to one of them i give the nannys that i dumped the judge and got off styernna with lice hot after me ready to do me worse than they did aslan that must have been when bolodo discovered someone was snooping into their business there was enough left of the judge for that i suppose i should have offed him but the easy life ive had the last few decades has made me soft couldnt do it he was such a miserable little worm i just couldnt squash him i went home for tools visited some old friends by the time i reached spotchals i wasnt me had distorters on my bone structure and twisters on my body stinks just as well bolodo had spotters out bloodoons looping over every port sniffoons trundling through the streets dont know if they were looking for me or what they thought they were doing but it was a nuisance local lice were irritated by all this that was points for me they tended to knock down the oons whenever they came across them after i got dug in i didnt have too much trouble keeping hid you know spotchals the police there are nothing special they do what they have to and not much more and the governments less corrupt than most and there are thousands of ships going in and out busy place and a huge population getting through security around the bolodo compound was something else it took me three years of digging slow tedious dangerous digging dancing tiptoe around the sleeping tiger to get close enough to work the mainbrain you dont know how many dead ends i banged into but i finally wormed a way through perimeter security and set up a protected corridor that would let me nest in the walls each night and gnaw away at the records hunting for aslans file in and out living on my nerves feeling for traps moving a hair at a time day by day week by week month by month twice i joggled something it wasnt exactly a trap but it alerted security and there was a general alarm i stopped breathing didnt move and they missed me they ran all around me but they didnt find me and i started again hair by hair looking for aslan they were tense for weeks after each of those brushes jumping at shadows it made things easier and harder for me all that activity covered a lot i was doing on the other hand someone could stumble on me any time if my luck went bad it was enough to give me permanent shakes after two more months of this i found her she was listed as part of a special shipment to a world so secret it wasnt identified except by a code name this was in a limited access file you needed five keys entered simultaneously to release it if you didnt have a shortcut like my crazyquilt and still that worldname was coded i duped a part of the file the part about aslan all the shipments were there fifty years of kidnapping and slaving i thought about duping the whole thing but i was afraid of staying in there too long besides i didnt care about those others what i wanted was aslan oh yes i got something else note this quale this is important those shipments are assembled at a substation off weersyll they go out roughly twice a year theres one scheduled for three months from now i hope you can follow it lyggad says you can hes the one researched you for me you know youve got a very odd history dumb i dont have to tell you about your life where that ship is going is where well find aslan ive got the flakes with me i thought you might need to see them that night i didnt try for the code i took the flakes out of the compound and stowed them in my case i gave myself three more nights to break the code and identify the destination i set up passage off spotchals didnt care where to on half a dozen ships each night different hours i wanted to be out and off fast you know spotchals there are what fifty a hundred ships leaving every night if i was quick enough slippery enough id get ahead of the guards the oons even if i tripped alarms all over the place as long as i got clear of the compound that was the trick getting clear security hadnt come close to my corridor not once in all those months it was worth taking the chance i went in set things up to collapse behind me if i had to run slipped into the limited files and started hunting for the key to the code that concealed the world and its location i thought i was being very very careful but that particular line was loaded with traps almost the first move i made set off alarms turned the compound into a bomb waiting to blow this time they knew they had a rat in the walls and they werent going to quit till they got it i jerked my taps and went away fast the corridor shutting down behind me erasing my backtrail i thought i got away clean i collected my case and was offworld before bolodo security finished flushing the compound and turned their search on the ports i dodged about for several months shifting ids until i was me again there was no sign of interest in me before aggerdorn that was where i got passage here with treviglio i shouldnt be surprised though should i it isnt that big a step to tie the agitator on kavelda styernna to aslan and aslan to me and given what happened on spotchals adding in adelaris well there i was kinok and kumari were right bolodos little sideline is nasty dangerous and profitable the net on aslans shipment was close to a billion gelders and remember thereve been two shipments a year for more than five decades she opened her eyes yawned the storm was still yowling outside the deflectors though the winds were dying down the rain slackening you know the most frustrating thing i was on spotchals two months before aslans shipment left weersyll two damn months she glanced at the storm with impatience all pleasure in it gone sat up and ran her hands over her hair pulling control like a coat around her you can follow that ship if we can set some ticks well know more about that shortly pels get on to kinok have him start a run on weersyll then you get hold of some of your dubious friends see what they can give you if they need time have them message you at our drop on helvetia kumari see if you can get through to ti vnok say well make helvetia three weeks on if he wants to meet have him leave time and place at the drop quale got to his feet stood back to let the others move past him he glanced after them turned to look down at adelaar helvetia first we have to settle the escrow and register the services contract his mustache lifted in a smile reflected in his pale eyes even bolodo wont mess with helvetia they could wait beyond the limit jump us there slancy orza has a trick or two hmm give you a few hours sleep and the world wont be so grim he bent reached under the table ill have a serviteur clear the table anything youd like the storm to end wont be long now relax she made an impatient gesture if your lander cant work through this little disturbance what good is it its being droned down no use taking chances for a miserable half hour that we can make up with no trouble once were insplitted a brow lifted another smile then he too was gone she sat and watched the rain thrum down watched it diminish abruptly to a trickle the clouds raveled paling thinning patches of sky appeared vividly blue in contrast to the shadowed whites and pale grays of the vanishing clouds shafts of sunlight shot down touching droplets of rain into blinding glitters the greens outside the garden shimmered like polished jade quale read her too well curse the man her gloom dissipated with the storm her ambivalence remained action was on hold for the moment once it began itd go with a rush out of her control before shed been in charge now hed be quale enigmatic man she smiled a wry tight thinning of her lips as she remembered lyggad stroking his pile of faxsheets wrinkled atomy bigeyed elf the first part of his life quale was a violent brute with a strong skilled body and enough intelligence or maybe it was cunning laced with luck to acquire a ship and hold together a motley crew of scavs a sleazy crude scavenger whose idea of subtle attack was rip and run then hed tangled with the hunter aleytys and suddenly he was something more a clever man quiet calm cutting ties to his former well you couldnt call them friends say associates pals buddies whatever a man who kept clear of trouble lyggad said it was like aleytys gave him a brain transplant he giggled when he said it but obviously more than halfbelieved it aleytys was part vryhh and who knew what those types could do when they put their minds to it he said some of quales exbuddies got nosy and demanded to know what happened implying in forceful though limited language that was lyggad being prissy that the woman had castrated him they didnt ask twice in that quale hadnt changed he was fast and nasty when the occasion required so lyggad said slancyorza rummul empire trooper lyggad said mostly shell and drives when quale acquired it a wreck flying on kicks and curses the drives used to be huge clunkers that ate fuel like it was free quale yanked those and put in new drives they were nothing standard according to the few folk who got a look at them and were willing to talk huge sleek powerful slancy orza lyggads voice went wistful his tongue caressed the words she can outrace a sutt aviso sit down on a g world without bursting a seam and lift cargo nearly equal to her own weight she heard a quiet rumble went down the stairs to stand on the grass looking up at a small lander as it dropped toward the ground the pad she thought worm must be gone by now she drew her hand down over her face sighed started for the house iv three years std earlier aslan aici adlaar daughter to adelaar aici arash riding to an unknown destination in the hold of a salado transport aslan muttered and blinked as she came out of a dragged sleep she lifted her head let it fall back as pain lanced from ear to ear stinking what now dim blue light a cylinder she was on a cot inside a tincan cots spreading out on either side above and below she was catheterized but was not uncomfortable with it the appliance was more resilient than most there were restraints on her wrists and ankles but they had sufficient play to let her sit up even hang her legs over the cots edge she was surprised that she wasnt under full automatic care her body processes reduced to a low hum this waking restraint was wasteful and from what she knew of contract labor transports unusual she tried again and this time made it up when her head stopped pounding she looked around the other contractees no she thought dont funk the name slaves some of the slaves were stretched out sleeping some were sitting up staring morosely into the blue gloom others were talking together still others had books and were reading or earphones listening to flake players she hadnt seen any of them before bolodo had kept her in solitary for months probably so shed have no chance to pass on anything about the oligarchy and what they were doing to the unntoualar she had two coveralls one clean each day whatever flakes or books she asked for but nothing from her own gear shed asked for that but no one bothered to listen to her and she decided theyd ashed her things just another paranoid precaution hmm my own personal paranoid was too too right mamall beat me over the head with that for the next hundred years she clicked her tongue smiled as she remembered her mothers habitual tk tk that used to irritate her so much when she was a teener she went back to inspecting her companions they were past adolescence none of them old making allowances for ananiles and mutational differences all of them seemed to be sprouts on the cousin stem and there was a more intangible likenessthey were all professionals or artisans no slogworkers in the mix wearing the kind of gear experienced travelers chose plenty of zippered pockets and easy to take care of she looked down she was back in her own tans boots and all the ridaar unit in its belt case evidently they hadnt ashed everything refusing to think about that she slid off the cot stretched the tethers stretching with her the catheter giving her no trouble her equipment cases were strapped beneath the cot where she could get at them if she wanted to she edged around and stared at them despair cold inside her they are by god sure im not going to get back unless she uncased the ridaar ran through the overt index then called up the last of the hidden files report deepfile ridaar re unntoualar code icy eagles child damn you tamarralda i am not sub e minus one one half im sure of it now subject zed has opened up enough to feed me some songs its the usual thing theyve made an accommodation with the new powercenters and theyre not about to endanger their survival to help a transient female of more or less the same species as the invaders who took their world from them the unntoualar im living with are confused on the one hand i seem to be here with the blessing of the invaders on the other theyve been quick to see the notsohidden hostility to me ive been careful to limit my inquiries to their songs and the story tapestries connected with these with those dozens of thready fingers its no wonder theyre marvelous weavers no color vision so line and texture dominate almost but not quite writing from what ive seen so far which i admit is severely limited they never did develop a written language which was another clue since most races with a high psi quotient dont concepts are too complex for the forced simplification of the written word why am i deepfiling this their psicapacity is the hot spot whenever i get anywhere near that zed wye even crazy tau start sweating blood mike and sigurd have done wonders with the language its a stinker tam youd guess it would be since a good half the nuance comes from esp fringes duncan lived up to his reputation by producing a crystal set so the youngsters could record a good portion of those fringes and give us access the unntoualar and the styernnese dont suspect i hope theyre projective telepaths thats clear from the songs one of the few such capable of transferring images into the minds of species alien to them physically nonaggressive but not passive their aggressions came out in psychic attacks before the colonists came they were the dominant species on styernna having more or less wiped out all competition zed pulled a sneak on the censor included a song in the first batch he let me flake about the arrival of the colonists and the short depressing settlement war i havent any idea why he did it theres no evidence he can read me maybe a gesture of rebellion one he understands is probably futile the unntoualar tried their standard attack on the invaders but the full force and flavor of it was blunted by the stolidity of those alien minds their single weapon was not only useless but proved to be disastrous for them their most vicious attacks were perceived as surrealistic and erotic dreams the last part of the song is one long wail against fate as the unntoualar realize this and begin dimly to see what it means for them yesterday he brought in rho and nu alpha males like him they picked out a new tapestry and started singing but the song had shitall to do with the images it was about what was happening to the unntoualar now since the final dispossession the oligarchs have hoarded for their own use the most powerful of the pts their name in the song is a complex combination of dream dancer custodian of race memory spear of the unn verbal shorthand stahoho idam kaij parceling out the lesser pts for the entertainment of their favorites all very secret of course the homeworld has rules for handling the natives and styernna cant live without help yet besides they know the ordure that will splatter over them if what theyre doing gets out plus the fact that half the scavs in the universe will come zooming over to harvest their share oh tam what theyre doing its a lot worse than forcing a pt to do his thing theyre torturing the miserable creatures to get more piquant dreams out of them sickening i didnt want to hear that tam makes me nervous i dont know what the hells going on i thought id better get this deepfiled before zeds plot whatever it is starts fruiting question is this a setup are the oligarchs using zed to snooker me into accusations i couldnt possibly substantiate is zed doing this on his own is he working with or for other unntoualar what do i do well ive got the kernel down up to you to see theres heavy pressure put to investigate the oligarchy and how its using the unntoualar distorted bleeding the unn staggered into the circle shrieking with voice and mind ululating interling and unnspeech flopping in front of aslan accusations foaming out of him curses on the name of the oligarch who owned him tortured him stole his dreams out of him guards surrounding her taking her away taking away the unn dead unn twisted tormented dead too late for her at least she was alone duncan and the others were at the base camp two sectors away oh god she was alone mama was right she shouldnt have come she stood looking at the palmsized plate for a long sick moment then she sighed and canceled the read if theyd bothered to locate and erase those files shed have had a sliver of hope that she could get out of this they hadnt even the overt record was untouched she crawled back on the cot and sat with her legs dangling the fingers of her right hand moving around and around the old burn scar on her left wrist a scar shed gotten when she was nearly four and being punished by her foster mother for something or other she couldnt remember what but it was about two months before adelaar came for her when she noticed what she was doing she stilled her fingers and smiled at the scar a fierce feral grin bolodo doesnt know you mama nooo indeed youll blow the bastards out of their skins before youre finished with them hmm better for my selfesteem if i dont sit around sucking my thumb waiting for you to show up problem is what do i do and how do i do it she pulled her legs up onto the cot pushed herself along it until she was sitting with her back against the hold wall then started thinking about contract labor like everyone else shed accepted its existence as something morally reprehensible but generally necessary blessed be the contractor for he takes away the ugliness of life societies always have those they class as criminals anything from mass murderers and big time thieves to heretics and skeptics who question the way things are your average citizen hes more comfortable if he doesnt have to look at the poor the handicapped the mildly crazy and wildly crazy the drunks and druggers the different the dregs why not keep your citizens happy reduce taxes remove focuses of disturbanceall that in one fine swoop a way of using what would otherwise be a drag on the economy a way of protecting the comfortable assumptions of the majority from any sort of challenge besides new colonies need labor they can eject when the job is done so the workers wont pollute the paradise heavy worlds need miners whose health they dont have to worry about everywhere an infinity of uses for workers who cant object to miserable conditions and miserly pay and there you have it contract labor a marriage of greed with respectability blessed be the contractor but dont let him live in my neighborhood on her left a youngish man was stretched out sleeping some time ago his hair had been sprayed into lavender spikes there was a lavender butterfly tattooed on the bicep next to her his hands were square and muscular with short strong callused fingers there was a heavy silver ring on his little finger she couldnt see much of it but the design looked familiar a friend of hers on university had hands like those and a habit of giving rings like that to his students sarmaylen he was exploring an ancient and long neglected form of sculpture working every kind of stone he could get into his studio threatening the neighborhood with silicosis from the dust he was raising she leaned over tried to see past the collapsed spikes as far as she could tell she didnt know the boy she smiled getting old woman when you look at a man like that and see a boy he was young enough to be only a year or two out of school and she wasnt much into sarmaylens life these days snuffling marble dust didnt appeal to her besides she wasnt really interested in the more exotic varieties of the arts couldnt talk to him about them because he snorted with disgust at every word she said that was one of the reasons sarmaylen was only an occasional sleeping companion though she found the touch of his callused workroughened hands electrifying she smiled at the memory of them smoothed her fingers across and across the burn scar his hands were eloquent his tongue was not at least in the public sense a pleasant change from her other friends and lovers she was fond of him if she never saw him again shed hurt a lot but she could no more live with him than she could with her mother their casual off again on again relationship seemed to suit him as well as it did her though she sometimes wondered what he was getting out of it besides the sex which was something hed have plenty of without her she frowned at the boy a student of sarmaylen a sculptor how did he wind up here artists and artisans like him never signed with contractors not voluntarily trashed like me i suppose or was he just out and out snatched her neighbor on the right was a small fair woman huge eyes in an oval angular face with prominent cheekbones energetically thin sitting she seemed in flight like some birds aslan had known her hands were narrow and bony rather too large for her slight form though she managed them gracefully her feet were narrow and bony distorted by the stigmata of a professional dancer she was turning a music box around and around in her fingers though no sounds issued from it if she disliked the dull muttering silence in the hold the tension in her body and the finedrawn look of her face suggested that she did the music of the box would remind her of the restraints that kept her tethered to the cot so she left it silent her mouth twitched into a smile so brief it was like the flash of a strobe light kante xalloor she said her voice was deep husky easy on the ears dancer bolodo must have kept you stashed somewhere aslan aici adlaar xenoethnologist yipe whats that when its home aslan tapped the ridaar unit sitting around listening to native remnants tell stories about how the world began weird xalloor looked past her at the sleeping youth you know him no i dont know anyone here back there i saw four walls and an exercise mat bolodo didnt want me talking about some things i got mixed up in snatched you not exactly bought me out of a trashing i suppose i should be grateful the maggots that did it were going to top me you i was on estilhass id finished a situ with the patraosh and had an offer of another on menfi menfur maybe you know the feeling mishmosh and jigjag hard to sleep no reason to stay awake nothing to do but wait for the ship to take me off there was this stringman i met in a bar one night i woke up in restraints on a bolodo scout no stringman in sight just a pilot who looked in on me to see i was still alive then ignored me he wore bolodo patches made no mystery about who had me which was hellishly depressing if you thought about it and i didnt have much else to do the next bunch of weeks till we got to the substation she shrugged with her whole body a vivid electric summation of her feelings well see what we see when they drop us him you were watching hes called jaunniko he says he thumps rocks for a living her thin brows wriggled skeptically then rose in wrinkled arcs as aslan nodded agreement the big lump on the other side of him the one with his nose in a book thats parnalee hes always reading he says hes out of proggerd thats in the pit the omphalos institute whatever that is he got drunk the first night in the pens he had a bottle of tiggah in his cases he says hes the best designer in fifty light years any direction didnt say what he designs the three women next him theyre a group the omperiannas you heard of them ah well its a big universe they were my music the time i was touring the dangle stars the little bald man whos doing all the scribbling the one who looks like hes made of tarnished brass hes churri the bard she arched her mobile brows and converted her limber body into a question mark as aslans eyes snapped wide aslan twisted around leaned forward and stared at her father curiosity seethed in her and a bitter anger against him for abandoning her though she knew it was idiotic to think like that he didnt know she existed adelaar had been careful to tell her that her mother had a sentimental attachment to him which was both amusing and peculiar in a woman so icily unsentimental in other ways that the man whod fathered her could be sitting here so close to her absorbed in his tablets completely ignorant of their relationship was absurd it was the god she didnt believe in playing games with her life she sighed settled back gave xalloor an encouraging nod the little dancer grinned shrugged a ripple of her body that said what the hell its your business i got tomperianne to set one of his poems to music lightsailor you know that one ive read everything i could get hold of it was the truth it was a way of getting close to her father without intruding on his life something she was afraid of doing afraid of what shed find afraid she wouldnt like him afraid she would afraid he wouldnt like her she suppressed a shiver as she contemplated weeks maybe months in this sealed womb having to look at him and wonder it made a great dance i got the dangles tour out of it why bolodo snatched him i cant imagine i mean if he ever gets loose and raises a stink theyve got more trouble than a swarm of vores up their backsides she shivered dont look good for us eh she shivered again exaggerating her fear fighting it that way a glint of laughter in her eyes as she watched herself perform then she went back to naming the captives those close enough to be visible in the pervasive blue gloom bolodo man live in love gold fine gold bolodo man live in love pearl and emarald churris rich resonant baritone filled the hold around beneath above it the omperiannas improvised a driving support tomperianne lectric harp nymperianne tronc fiddle lamperianne the flute tribulation sufferation boring blaggard bolodo man sing i sing thee sing we bloody bane

soloing their curses growing more extravagant more surreal as each dipped into his or her culture to surpass the contribution of the last the rest belted out the refrain until the hold rocked with it round and round churri playing variations on his verses the omperiannas adding flourishes round and round until finally the transportees collapsed in exhaustion and laughter and fell into extravagant speculation about where bolodo was going to dump them yo i remember you mays ass aslan abruptly realizing what hed said jaunniko went bright red so red his ears and the tip of his long nose were nearly purple ah he said thing is he said may sort of went round saying you had the neatest ah um derriere he uh he turned even redder the time we met he went on hastily it was at a party you probably dont remember me you brought your mother along and that wasnt being too successful i talked to her a while she was bored out of her skull one icy lady he sneaked a look at her her expression must have been rather daunting because he stopped talking altogether after she calmed down she took pity on him and changed the subject howd bolodo get you he stretched out on his cot crossed his ankles laced his fingers over his flat stomach id just got my papers junior master may found me a commission hes good about that you know jeengid in the blade the keex of jelkim i was one of about fifty she hired she liked my part of the piece well enough to give me a little bonus i was feeling whoooo no pain when this stringman came on to me woke up in a bolodo scout tied down and sick as a well sick any idea where were going none except we arent coming back from it so xalloor thinks i expect youre right v still two years till aslans mama meets quale four months after she woke in the belly of the transportthe voyage is finished lake golgagilisim gililinimperators palace afternoon the bolodo transport decanted aslan and the others on tairanna four months after it collected them at the weersyll substation smallish dark men with cold eyes supervised their transfer others of the same type loaded their gear on carts pulled by stocky stolid beasts with horns like half smiles curving up and away from round twitchy ears aslan stepped onto the ground braced herself to endure the extra weight and found a moment of quiet while their new guards prodded them into line theyd been stuffed with the local language and a sketchy outline of local customs so they had no trouble understanding the terse commands despite the circumstances she was momentarily happy there was an infinity of possibility stretching out before her new worlds always did that to her she stood docilely where the guards put her sniffing at the wind that whipped around the base of the transport sampling the smells it brought to her fish and rotting flesh dung and mud and the sharp green bite of trampled grass the dank musky odor of the beasts the subtler odors of cart woods and working metal over all this the faint burntcabbage stink of the men that wind wailed and whined the carts rattled her fellow slaves snapped irritably when impatient guards shoved at them barking guttural monosyllabic orders behind her the drones servicing the ship clanked and hissed overhead racy white birds circled in flittering flocks their eerie cries a most proper accompaniment to the debarking of slaves into the land of their servitude the extravagance of word and image made her laugh xalloor looked a question flinched from a guards goosing prod an elastic grayish cane a meter long and in her indignation forgot what she was going to ask aslan sighed and started walking as the guards marched them toward the towered city a kilometer or so away nothing to laugh about she had no control over her life whatever happened to her depended on persons and events she had no way of manipulating not now not until she had sufficient grasp of local verities to do some planning her first flush of interest and excitement quickly wore off she was a slave here not a scholar she rubbed at her lower back though the gravity of this world was uncomfortable rather than unbearable she was already feeling fatigue and fatigue made her depressed diminished her ability to deal with her problems she risked a look over her shoulder winced as a guard stung her with his prod there were other ships down on the pad three of them cargo transports insystem ships not good apparently the only way home was through bolodo she clung to a faint hope that her mother would be able to find her because there wasnt much else to keep her from the black despair that sometimes overcame her she couldnt afford that now it sapped her will worse than any gravityinduced fatigue once the bolodo transport left she scowled at the rutted track if she could organize some sort of group she was enough of a pilot to get them back to busier starlanes we cant be the only shipment of slaves to this place the guards are too casual were nothing special why not take the ship security was lax it was obvious the bolodo crew werent worrying about their cargo turning on them surprise them if i can get the right people weapons well need weapons of some kind she strained to get a look at the guard without letting him see what she was doing the prods knife in an external bootsheath some sort of pistol in a leather holster clipped to his belt what kind depends on the technology here i doubt if bolodo is supplying weapons selfinterest would say no i dont know what is the level of technology here hard to estimate nothing from bolodo on that and what she saw around her was ambiguous the carts had shock absorbers bearings in the wheels and pneumatic tires but they were pulled by beasts and the road itself was little more than ruts and mud no sophisticated land traffic here despite the landing field and the size of the city ahead of them they were led round the edge of the city past walls about twice manhigh pierced at intervals by pointed archways where aslan could look down narrow crooked lanes meant for walkers not wheels lanes paved in carved and painted stones the simple repeating design echoing the pattern of bright glazed tessera set into the creamcolored bricks of the walls her steps slowed as she tried to see more fascinated and frustrated by the tantalizing glimpses she got into the life of this world one of the guards laid his prod across her shoulders reminding her once again that she wasnt here to studythough why she was here the guards took them across a narrow section of wasteland where they walked a beaten earth path between shivering silvergreen walls of waist high grass grass that buzzed with hidden insects and rustled gently in a soft erratic wind xalloor grimaced and scratched at her thin arms rubbed at eyes beginning to water and redden she sniffed and spat glared at a guard who whapped her with his prod because her spittle had just missed the toe of his boot ahead of them was a massive wall more than thirty meters high a wall that rambled over the grassy hummocks and dipped into the water that spread out to the horizon on three sides aslan decided it was a lake because the smell told her the water was fresh not salt the lead guard thumped with his prod on an ogeed gate it swung open in heavy welloiled silence the line of slaves marched through arcades and colonnades and formal gardens manicured to an order and an artificiality that seemed to deny the ordinary processes of change and decay jaunniko was just ahead of aslan she could hear him muttering under his breath as he looked around his shoulders were pulled in and his fingers were twitching she thought she knew what he was feeling because this dead place grated on her too figures appeared in the promenades posed in the arches showing a flicker of interest in the newcomers that faded almost as it was born they were uniformly taller and fairer than the guards with a high degree of physical beauty male or female it made no difference in their own way they were as unalive as the garden mobile ornaments as clipped and trained as the hedges were never she told herself ill die first make them kill me outright before they drain the soul out of me she shivered and knew the words were whistling in the wind if luck wasnt with her a few steps on she smiled amused at her vanity she wasnt young enough or pretty enough to qualify as an ornament whoever bought her wasnt apt to want her body there was a hint of comfort in the thought her usefulness and therefore her value wouldnt depend on how soon her owner tired of her she made a face at the taste of that word owner a tower grew out of springing arches like a tree rising from its roots the guards herded them through one of the arches and stopped them in a paved courtyard dusty and barren a pen for twolegged beasts xalloor edged closer to her minds me of a casting call i dont think i like the roles were up for or the audience xalloor flashed a defiant grin at one of the guards who slapped his prod against his leg but showed no sign of coming to shut them up she turned her shoulder to him shivered and rubbed at arms roughened with horripilation fools they shouldve told us we were going to freeze our assets aslan looked up at the tower with its ranks of narrow windows glittering in the light of the lowering sun at least theyve got glass in them i wonder if were going in there hmm far as im concerned they can take their time no joy for any of us in that place i want to know now the dancer moved restlessly fighting against gravity working the muscles of her shoulders arching her feet inside her boots tightening and loosening her leg muscles youve led a sheltered life working the trancircuit isnt all that different from this once i know the terms i can root round and finagle a way to live with them you dance the omperiannas are musicians parnalee designs largescale events yad matras a machinist churris a poet appel jaunniko naaien go down the list youre all techs or artists or both but me theres nothing i can do that has any meaning outside of university or a place like that nothing i like to think about what can they want with a xenoethnologist its ridiculous mebbe so xalloor laced her hands behind her head bent cautiously backward straightened with an effort visible in the tendons of her neck i loathe these heavy worlds move wrong and you tear up your legs there was a loud clapping sound of wood on wood they turned a man had come through a door in the side of the tower he stood at the top of the steps that led up to it a clipboard in one hand its bottom braced on the ledge of a hard round belly i am the imperators madoor he said when i call your name come here stand at the base of the stairs you will be taken to your posts there will be no argument no protests no threats no struggling awake or drugged you will go we have no preference as to the manner of your going but consider well how you begin is how you will go on you have no voice in your destination or what happens to you there i want that very clear you are not beasts you are less than beasts you are worth only what services or instruments you can provide if you choose not to provide them you will be beaten or otherwise persuaded to change your mind if you still refuse we will get what value out of you that we can you will serve as bait for our fishermen or food for our hunting cats do not think to escape and hide yourself among huvved or hordar you cannot you do not look like us you do not sound like us no matter how well you have got our language you do not know custom or rite you have no family here no one will help you cooperate or suffer the consequences he looked down at the clipboard kante xalloor tomperianne nymperianne lamperianne jaunniko he named five others all performers of one sort or another then waited while two guards and an escort of exquisitely robed and tonsured males sorted them into a proper line and took them off they went without creating fuss they went with prowling steps and narrowed eyes plotting as they moved too cool too controlled too experienced in the exigencies of surviving to waste their energies in a futile rebellion aslan watched them go and saw her vague notion of assembling a group to take one of bolodos transports go with them the vision fading like a memory of a dream as she passed through the arch xalloor risked a wave and a grin and got away with both aslan waved back then waited her turn feeling bereft and lonelier than she had in years churri dilan aslan aici adlaar parnalee pagang tanmairo proggerd aslan moved as slowly as she dared toward the steps during the trip here shed done her best to avoid attracting churris notice not too difficult because he was tied to his bunk and except for the times when he added verses to the curse song and belted them out for the edification of his fellow captives he was either asleep or scribbling in his notebooks she was afraid of getting closer to him she didnt want to be linked with him she didnt want him playing areyou arentyou games with her she saw his head jerk when he heard her full name the matronymic that linked her with adelaar and made sure the parnalee stood between him and her but she couldnt miss the nervous dart of his yellow eyes as he leaned forward and looked around the proggerdis bulky body no robed and perfumed types came for them a guard prodded aslan toward the far side of the court herded the three of them through a bewildering cascade of arches and into a holding cell of sorts the guard looked around the room his eyes passed over them as if they were less important than the dust on the floor he grunted and left barring the door behind him once the light from the doorway was cut off several strips pasted on the backwall began to glow producing a bluish twilight that hid more than it revealed parnalee sniffed smells like dogshit in here he strolled to the door leaned on it it creaked and shifted a millimeter or so balked thought so he rested his massive shoulders against the planks folded his arms across his chest yawned and let his eyes droop shut aici adlaar churris voice aslan twitched the voice was a large part of the bards reputation a mellow flexible baritone capable of turning a nuance on the flick of a vowel on the trip here shed listened with pleasure when he talked to his neighbors when he chanted his verses to the hold now that voice was turned on her it was only a part of her name that he said but folded into those syllables were question speculation a touch of fear a touch of wonder a demand for an answer and other less identifiable implications she drew her tongue across her lips so soncheren i was born there i knew a girl on soncheren long time ago one adelaar i know how aslan hesitated decided there was no point in hedging shes my mother so ogodon got her married off that hamfisted cousin of hers i suppose he was hot after her more nuancecasual overlay eagerness beneath sharp tang of anxiety all of which turned into laughter she ignored that married a spoiled virgin dont be stupid not on soncheren he sold her to a contractor after i was weaned sold me into the baby market youre mine so she says i didnt know she told me that why didnt she send me word not much point considering how fast you cut out before i went back how nice of you she heard the acid in her voice she felt ugly she knew she was making him despise her but she couldnt help it years of anger and pain were erupting from the darkness where shed shoved them i did all i could to find out what happened to her without getting my head taken i assume you know the habits of your male relatives of course you did cool steady and very bitter youve got an adders tongue you know that she shook her head though she knew he couldnt see it anything she said would make things worse my name gets around she could have found me if she wanted to yes ah she could feel him staring at her his short stocky body vibrated with what something that made demands on her she didnt want to answer after a moment of thick silence with a whine in her voice that appalled her when she heard it she said adelaar made a good life for us she didnt need anyone she didnt want anyone sticking his nose in he stirred but before he could speak the door rattled parnalee moved away to let it open aslan jumped cursed under her breath shed forgotten he was in here the guard whapped his prod against the door out parnalee ambled out not about to hurry himself at the order of some snirp who didnt reach past his ribs aslan followed him struggling to regain control over her emotions wanting a mirror to see what was written on her face she heard churri behind her though he was softer footed than a thief perhaps heard wasnt the right word felt was more apt she was intensely aware of him part of it was a sexual awareness that she halffeared halfunderstood shed never known him in the role of father she had to keep reminding herself who he was for the first time she understood why her mother kept such fond memories of him part of her reaction was a mix of needs that were more intense than sex she needed a father she didnt want to she wasnt a child she hadnt missed him when she was or so she told herself refusing to acknowledge the old angers that drove her into sniping at him a few minutes ago now with him there so close too close she ached for what she hadnt known it seemed somehow a betrayal of her mother of herself but she couldnt deny the feeling the guard took them high into the tower left them in a sixsided room with wall to ceiling windows in four of the sides windows that looked out across the city and the lake churri went at once to one of the windows and stood staring across the lake toward mountains on the far side mountains that were little more than a ripple of blue in the paler blue of the sky their peaks touched with pink from the sunset he couldnt see parnalee walked to the middle of the room looked casually about eyes halfshut his face sleepily bovine then he went to inspect the two walls that had no windows only tightly pleated drapes woven from a fiber like raw silk and dyed a matte black drapes meant to be drawn across the windows when the sun was coming up and its light struck directly into the room he ran his hands across wood panels behind them thick short fingers that seemed clumsy but were not rather like sarmaylens hands aslan thought and shivered with the memory when she realized what she was doing she swore under her breath and crossed her arms over her breasts as if she were trying to shut herself away from him and everything else a low backless bench angled out from the wall near the door aslan dropped onto its black leather cushions a moment later parnalee joined her anything interesting she crossed her legs turned a little away from him built into the walls if there is he inspected her chuckled she looked round what nothing aslan scowled at her feet angry at him and herself he was too perceptive and what he saw mattered too little to him the same thing happened when she visited her mother adelaar ended up hitting her in every one of her vulnerable spots the door theyd come through opened again and two men walked into the room aslan got to her feet before the door closed behind the men she saw guards lounging in the triangular antechamber beyond churri came away from the window and stood beside her he was vibrating with anger but managing to control it his hand closed over her shoulder tightened hard parnalee sat where he was one of the newcomers moved to the last window and settled his shoulders against the glass folded his arms across his chest he was a tall man as handsome as an addiction to biosculpture could make him he had skin like thick ivory smooth and unblemished his hair was a burnished silvergilt helmet brushing his broad shoulders he wore trousers and tunic of djumahat spider silk immaculate pewter gray with crisp white accents bolodo rep aslan thought and no junior on the make not him slaver you pretty shitface she blew him a mental raspberry and turned to the other he strolled to a large armchair beside that window settled himself waved a longfingered hand at three smaller chairs arranged in a shallow arc facing him come he said sit in tone it was an invitation not an order but ignoring it would be stupid when they were seated he said i am fangulse tra yarta the divine imperator pettan tra prans chief security officer in effect your slavemaster subject of course to the will of the divine with that proviso always in mind i tell you this contract law doesnt rule here i do how you live depends on me whether you live rests on my good will he smiled at them tapped his fingertips on the chairs arms he was a broad man not fat only big he had a lined square intelligent face a long square torso heavy arms and legs large hands with tapering fingers rather beautiful hands he posed them m ways that showed off their elegance you are of course indulging in the fantasy of escaping and capturing a bolodo transport forget it you wont get near that field and even if you do the bolodo guards have had much experience in puncturing such fantasies the dreamers that survive their attentions spend a few months working in the mines and emerge quite anxious to cooperate parnalee shifted his feet gazed dully at tra yarta now that weve had the obligatory warning what do you want tra yarta reached inside his overrobe pulled out a sheaf of folded fax sheets you are parnalee pagang tanmairo proggerd parnalees eyelids drooped amazing tra yarta ignored the sarcasm you design spectacles and propaganda campaigns he riffled through the papers stopping to scan several before he set the sheaf aside and posed his hands in a narrow steeple you will have noticed that two peoples share this world hmm share is not the precise word of course however it is close enough for the occasion the hordar make up most of the population the huvved rule them we can discuss the history and mechanics of that later it is sufficient i think for the moment to say that the civility between us a civility that had lasted for nearly three centuries and was profitable for both sides this civility is falling apart you will be required to provide spectacles and other campaigns to reverse this rot i want celebrations of past glories i want idealized versions of life on tairanna i want heroes to make the blood thrill i want good feeling to replace the current rancor i want the hordar made happy with who and what they are i want them made comfortable with the way the world is run i want huvved to be seen as elder brothers wise and caring elder brothers you understand i do not wish to teach you your business merely to indicate my desires as to the results tra yarta did not wait for an answer but turned to churri you churri dilan will use your talents to underscore the impact of tanmairos spectacles the hordar are a people drunk on words and a poet is more powerful than a hundred guns according to my information you are adept at using whatever language is appropriate to your audience and part of your gear is a learning device that is supposed to be rather remarkable in its sensitivity to the nuances of those languages i understand you will need time and access to information sources you will have whatever you need subject to security requirements again he left no time for response but turned to aslan aslan aici adlaar skilled though they are these men are strangers to this culture you are a student of cultures i expect you to study the hordar and advise parnalee tanmairo proggerd and churri dilan how to accomplish what i require of them i asked bolodo to provide someone like you to know a society as you can know it is to understand how to manipulate it if i could do this i would i cant i have some practical experience but its limited to pulling the strings on one or two people at most a family i dont know how to drive masses without having to slaughter half of them people never jump the way you expect when you squeeze them aslan leaned forward held out a hand palm facing him please yes she dropped her arm onto the chairs arm straightened up i dont think you understand precisely what it is i do i record and to some extent translate the histories the various artistic expressions of dying preor nonliterate cultures this has nothing at all to do with manipulation of those cultures i wouldnt know how to start you want a number cruncher a sociometrician who can put his thumb on the swivel points tra yarta smiled at her amusement softening the harsh yellow of his eyes im sure you realize i had to take what i could get scholars dont ordinarily come onto the contract market lists and university is regrettably from my viewpoint alert as to what happens to its people however he shuffled through the fax sheets i am not all that displeased with what bolodo has provided he found the ones he wanted glanced over them according to your university records aici adlaar you have had considerable training in that direction admittedly you have not used that training for the past several years but i doubt that a scholar of your ability will have forgotten so much so soon aslan looked past him at the bolodo rep saw him smile and pressed her lips together to contain her fury before she could say anything parnalee closed a hand over her arm stared at her until she had to look at him he shook his head she pulled her arm away but kept her mouth closed he glanced at churri who was simmering but silent then laid his clumsy shovel hands on his massive thighs and gazed thoughtfully at tra yarta after a moments silence he said why should we do this why not these arent your people you have no responsibility for them again he looked through the sheets folded them into a sheaf and tapped the sheaf against his chin considering some of your other clients hmm this is a commission like any other not quite true you dont have the luxury of refusing that isnt what i meant and thats not true either there is no way you can force us to perform if were willing to back our refusal with our lives are you i am if im driven to it i cant speak for them he held up a hand pulling tra yartas attention back from aslan and churri thats rather beside the point isnt it what i intended you to understand is that you should give us inducements not threats youre asking us to dirty our selfimages to engage in acts of betrayal and cynical manipulation you should at least make it profitable for example you could send us home after weve done the job tra yarta lowered the sheaf of fax sheets looked at it with raised brows cynical manipulation well tanmairo you should know it when you see it hmm send the three of you home im sure you understand that isnt possible even if i were willing to betray my kind bolodo would never agree they have too much to lose short of that what do you want if we have to live here then let us live well you say we are slaves if so free us pay us provide us with a way of sustaining ourselves once the job is done he lifted his hands let them fall turned his head with massive dignity to omni then aslan either of you have anything to add nearly strangling on the word churri muttered no aslan gazed past tra yartas head at the man silhouetted against the darkening blue of the sky outside she looked away no there you have it you get what you pay for your companions show little enthusiasm for your bargain enthusiasm costs more than you can afford to pay tra yarta youre buying competence not complicity competence hmm your request is a trifle vague necessarily hmm in principle i accept your terms it is obvious to a minimal intelligence he steepled his hands raised heavy blond brows that difficult and complex projects requiring creative solutions he cleared his throat a distant amusement gleamed in his dark blue eyes cannot be solved by applying whips to reluctant backs eyelids drooping he contemplated parnalee it will be some time before your workproduct reaches any sort of coherence during that interval i can evaluate your efforts and you can acquire sufficient local knowledge to shape your proposal to your needs at that time its quite possible that we will be able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory arrangement he got to his feet at the same time be very sure you keep in mind your circumstances be very sure the degree of nuisance you produce does not exceed the value of your services if i cant use your proper skills ill find other employment for you he ran his eyes over parnalees powerful body the mines can always use a strong back i have had a small compound cleared out and made ready for the three of you i expect you to start work immediately there is a com at each of your work stations preset to the offices of certain of my aides who will be directing you in this enterprise if you need anything call on them with a valedictory nod tra yarta strode briskly from the room the bolodo rep who hadnt said a word during the interview kept on saying nothing as he hurried after the security chief the compound was a walledin oval of garden and walkways fountains and arbors with a small onestory structure at one focus of the oval a delicate airy house with pointed windows and walls of wood not stone from the security arrangements and the look of the place it seemed reasonably clear that the imperator had stashed his favorite courtesans here and spent more than a little time with them there were four bedrooms with bathrooms attached set like beads at the corners of an oblong brooch the centerpiece a large welllit common room tra yarta had moved most of the furniture out of the common room and set up three work stations for them these waited under dust sheets a fire was crackling behind a pleated glass screen and comfortable leathercovered chairs were arranged in a shallow arc about the hearth behind these there was a dining table with a number of open backed chairs about it a cold supper was set out on the table several kinds of salad fruit shrimp and other seafood bread and butter and a selection of jams and jellies and finally a hot fruit punch steaming in a large ceramic urn with mugs clustered about its base aslan ran her hands through her hair stretched groaned clean clothes a bath food she laughed and went into the bedroom assigned to her parnalee patted the solid slab of muscle over his stomach i like a good meal he chuckled a basso rumble yes indeed its why i usually travel worldship the e corini by choice they raise the most succulent crustaceans known to palate he skewered a giant shrimp inspected it with satisfaction and popped it in his mouth churri shoved his chair back its legs squealing painfully across the floor he bounced to his feet glared at parnalee with a scornful tk of tongue against palate he stumped to the urn scraped out enough punch to fill his mug and crossed to the hearth though the alcoholic content of the punch was more imagination than reality hed eaten almost nothing and was awash with enough of it to exacerbate a mild misanthropy he dropped into one of the easy chairs and sat glowering at the flames refracted through the folded panes of the firescreen parnalee swallowed the last shrimp and got to his feet he crossed to one of the many windows and pushed aside a translucent white curtain decorated extensively with delicate blackwork it was a warm spring night with mist drifting in threads around the fountain and clouds blowing in from the west though they were not yet clotted enough to diminish the soft pervasive glow from the moons i need exercise he said take a walk with me the two of you aslan joined him at the window its getting damp out there ive had one bath i dont need another you wont melt she leaned against him patted a yawn way i feel i might a little exercise will fix that i can think of pleasanter ways to get it aslan use your head will you think she giggled tsa he scooped her up dumped her head down over his shoulder and carried her to the door it was locked but he closed his fingers about the latch handle and applied force the latch creaked and gave he shoved the door open and stalked outside with her at first aslan was too startled to object then too amused she was giggling when he set her down and went back inside still giggling though mistwater dripping from the eaves rendered her considerably damper when he came out with churri tucked under one arm before the bard woke up enough to react he was on his feet beside aslan swaying and blinking sputtering as a large drip landed in his left eye building up to an explosion we need to talk parnalee rumbled at them cant inside aslan nodded the fizzy good feeling born out of the food and the bath and having space to move in so her elbows could come away from her sides drained from her she scrubbed a hand across her face pushed dampening hair out of her eyes churri got rid of his anger and insult peeling them away as if he peeled off his face to show another face beneath he didnt say anything but parnalees words had gotten through to him hands clasped behind him parnalee trudged off big head swinging as he hunted out a place where hed feel secure enough to talk churri plunged after him aslan scratched her nose looked over her shoulder at the warm red glow shimmering through the curtains she sighed hunched her shoulders against the strengthening wind and followed them parnalee continued his prospecting until he came to one of the fountains a slender column of water rose broke tumbled noisily from basin to basin scattered like bronze petals down a manufactured slope he climbed halfway up the slope knelt beside a rough wooden bench without a back and ran his hands over it he stood frowned at the bench then dropped onto one end of it the end nearest the stream churri clasped his hands behind his back and stood facing parnalee teetering atop a rock aslan settled herself beside parnalee put her hand on his arm it was rock hard he looked as relaxed as ever but she could feel a tension in him which surprised her in the belly of the bolodo transport hed seemed such a casual easygoing man she took her hand away if you expect me to lay down and let that deviate clean his feet on me i expect you to do what youve been trained to do use your reason youre supposed to be intelligent what i was buying back there was time churri grunted kicked at the rock with the heel of his sandal aslan sniffed you really think tra yartas going to keep his side of the bargain look at it this way we produce the trouble whatever it is goes away what happens to us aslan dug a hole in the dirt with her toes watched it fill with water dripping over the edge of the nearest basin what i know from cultures like this says wed be an embarrassment to him so she knifed her hand across her throat and if we dont produce all right if you have to hear it same thing a lot sooner aslan how long were you at weersyll six months less three days churri the short bald man didnt answer for a minute he frowned past parnalee then he nodded two months something like that he stuck his thumbs behind his belt and teetered on the rock you were already there right theyre a methodical bunch bolodo id say they go out twice a year which means itll be somewhere around six months standard before the next transport arrives we need information weapons some kind of plan like i said we need time churri looked up as a brief flurry of raindrops blew into his face i say we take advantage of this slop and go over the wall therere mountains on the far side of the lake we can go to ground there live off the land aslan snorted you think huvved and hordar both wont turn on us except for bolodo this is a closed world you want to see some raging xenophobia she frowned at her mudsplashed feet its a thought though if things get difficult here parnalee yawned with you and the bard glowering like twin fumeroles maybe tra yarta took my offer seriously lets hope he did and turns his attention elsewhere the rain was coming down harder he brushed at his hair soft brown hair that shed the water like seal fur his hand covered his face for a moment lingered a breath longer than the gesture required aslan wondered about that remembering the tension in his arm the first part is up to you aslan you have to be convincing i can play with this and that work up projections but until ive got your data i cant get down to serious work at least i can make a good case for idleness find out mm well need a pilot someone who can handle the engines someone who can figure out where the um hell we are and how to get back to civilized parts if no one else turns up we can trust i can get the ship back close enough anyway to put out a mercycall aslan scraped rain off her face something id better say whatever tra yarta thinks whatever the records say i cant do what he wants i can describe analyze compare societies tease them to bits under the scope of technique if you want it in the pretentious jargon the man seems to prefer manipulate them nonsense i wouldnt know the first thing about that she got up went a short way up the slope came back what happens when he finds out parnalee brushed at his hair again when his hand dropped he was smiling you werent listening thats my part of the job you analyze i put your data to work churri adds the frills thats what the man said not altogether a bad idea comes close to my usual practice maybe bolodo told him maybe he thought it up his little self he did say you were a propagandist event designer sounds better all that talk about dirtying ones selfesteem he wanted to hear that so i gave it to him bargaining chip ah all right a bit more than that i do not like being coerced the last phrase was spoken slowly with an angry emphasis on each word i choose where and when im going to work not some tin god on a backwater world aslan folded her arms across her breasts rubbed her fingers slowly up and down her biceps um maybe i dont need to say it she scowled at him maybe i do dont underestimate the locals par ive seen a lot of that places i was working travelers come through and just because the locals dont think the same way or know about the same gadgets they think theyre stupid my mother talks like that i think its because she knows it irritates me she and her friends have been around a lot it gives them illusions of she laughed tasted ram on her lips you said it tingodishness according to them the locals havent got the brains or the getup to suck a tit these huvved maybe the hordar too theyve been isolated a long time but theyre not stupid and i doubt if theyre unsophisticated in the art of the cabal tra yarta wouldnt be sweating like he is if they were easy to handle he thinks hes got us locked that we cant make trouble for him whatever we get up to i hope hes wrong but wed better be damn clever she pushed at soggy hair drew her hand rapidly back and forth across her nostrils and im catching pneumonia out here cant we go in where its warm right parnalee stood ive said what i had to say aslan i agree with you on most of that we wont fool him if we fake it we have to do it straight until were ready to jump whether we jump at the ship or into the mountains otherwise were in shit to our eyeballs im going to get out of this one way or another dont either of you screw me up ill twist the neck of the one who tries it aslan began working reluctantly these werent her people she had no responsibility for what happened to them but what tra yarta wanted was a profound distortion of her work and she was ill at ease whenever she thought of what parnalee was going to do with the data she provided but she had to do the analysis she needed the information she didnt trust either parnalee or churri but there was no one else she drove herself at her preparations with disgust distrust and a bellyload of fury she made abortive gestures at first feeling about like a blind worm starting lines of investigation letting them trickle from her fingers she wasnt accustomed to working without a staff to help interview the subjects collect data samples do a preliminary sort on them and much of the slog work thereafter not having those eager ambitious students she had to reshape her habits and find a way to do that work herself after a week or so of aimless dipping into the palace library she called herself to order and spent several days working with and cursing copiously the computers tra yarta had provided setting up procedures protocols and questionnaires then she began interviewing the hordar who worked as gardeners servants cook cathandlers musicians poets entertainers of all kinds and last of all the few hordar who made it into the guard every hordar working inside the wall they talked with her because they were ordered to and were very cautious in their answers to her questions but she expected that and had long experience in setting up a series of questions that would give her much more information than they knew they were providing all that took time more time than usual because she had no staff because she had to do all the analysis herself without any of the software she needed on computers not designed for that sort of work because she was deliberately doing about three times as much interviewing as she needed because above all she wanted to be very careful about what she actually passed out of her hands tra yarta grew restless but could not fault her for not working besides as shed guessed from the first he was a thorough man himself and they were only a minor part of his plans for suppressing dissent and disturbance she sank her apprehensions and anxieties in a halfwilled amnesia and let the work absorb her she enjoyed everything about her profession even the dullest part where she was going over and over material arranging and rearranging bits of information to discover patterns and unexpressed meanings aslan yawned recrossed her ankles wheres churri getting drunk somewhere spinning stories picking up more recordings whatve you got parnalee took the lid off the carafe hed brought with him chugged down half the ice water inside it was an unusually hot day and the house wasnt equipped with any kind of air conditioning not even a fan so aslan was spending the hottest part of the afternoon outside under shade trees near one of the dozen fountains stretched out on a lounge chair she brought from a slatted toolshed tucked away behind some flowering shrubs ive started getting the history sorted out see what you can pick up on a couple of prophets they seem to be important to the hordar so you might be able to use them pradix and eftakes better be careful though i suppose you know how tricky that kind of thing can get for outsiders pradix hmm center to the local religion he was born some two millennia ago standard years not local on a world called hordaradda which was on the edge of the huvveddan empire by the time he died or was translated or whatever you want to call it one half of hordaradda was swearing by him the other half at him and the huvved were agin the whole thing ended up with the pradite faction buying a colony transport and lighting out for parts unknown shaking the dust off usual reaction like a lot of fanatics they didnt know what they were doing but they were sure they were sharper than any mundane so they got cheated on the ship paid hard cash for junk the transport went blind in the insplit if you believe in that kind of thing it was their holy prophets intercession or maybe it was luck anyway when they tinkered their way back to realspace there it was a nice yellow dwarf of a sun with a coolish but comfortable planet waiting for them no intelligent life as far as i can tell from the look i got at contemporary records but otherwise a flourishing biota land and sea they named the sun horgul and settled on the fourth planet out to breed and argue over the teachings of pradix ive printed up a few of those you might be able to do something with them eftakes was born here about five hundred years later im not all that sure just what his differences are with pradix but the hordar had a sharpish little war over them and the eftakites moved down to the south continent guneywhiyk silly name isnt it north continents no better kuzeywhiyk sounds like a sneeze got some of eftakes sayings listed too be careful how you use those up here on kuzeywhiyk she giggled i dont know if tra yarta wants you doing anything down south if so youd better have a look at eftakes and his faction parnalee rubbed the carafe back and forth across his brow then gulped down a good part of the water left in it never mind the sayings any hero tales yeh but most of them are set on hordaradda ill print you up some summaries let me know which you want to look at closer um some narrative verse cycles from the war of the prophets havent had time to do more than look at the titles she sipped at the fruitade wiped her mouth ive come across mention of popular verse tales about the conquest the kind of thing that conquered peoples pass around more or less mouth to mouth naturally the huvved didnt record any of them though i suppose they knew about them the mention was in a trial transcript of a hordar accused of theft and murder huvved definitions of both i think it likely he was some sort of rebel you might ask churri to see if he can dig up some of them they should be still floating around in manuscript and memory that kind of underground snootcocking can hang on for centuries he smiled a tight sour twist of his lips ill enjoy that the smile such as it was vanished insolent stupid arrogant shitheads i could break them over my little finger gods one more mincing cretin treating me like a dog she filled a second glass with iced fruitade got lazily to her feet and carried it to him it was your idea par he reminded her of sarmaylen when one of his pieces was rejected the thought made her smile and feel more tender toward him than she was wont to do you thought up the party catering bit you went to tra yana and got him to rent you out here take this while he drank from the tall glass she smoothed her cold hand along his face and neck then moved around behind him and began kneading at tight shoulder muscles youre just not used to being a slave that kind of stagnant society couldnt afford you lucky you uh ive been on one or two feudal backwaters uh no slaves but some of the peasants might as well have been bonded to the soil sold with it uh youre all knotted up ive seen the way their socalled betters treat them uh to these highborn huvved youre not as valuable as a dog you cant be dropped into a pit and live out their fantasies of manhood for them with your blood and pain she stopped talking clicked her tongue hmm i wonder any smell of pitfights with men instead of dogs she stepped back from him thats a bit better my hands are getting hot might as well stop for now she strolled back to the lounge chair stretched out on it and took up her own glass resting it on the firm flesh over her stomach her shirt was open except for a single button holding it together across her breasts well have you he lifted his head looked at her with dislike that melted into a smile more professional than warm though that might be her own attitudes getting in the way ive arranged several such entertainments she slid the sweating glass back and forth across her bare midriff ah she was silent for a breath or two then she said be careful par dont angle for a promotion up to dog you got it she heard the tinkle of ice cubes then he grunted when he spoke he changed the subject the change landed on her ear with a loud clunk that said he didnt want to talk about this any more howd the huvved get here is there anything in that for me hmm depends on what you want you might be able to touch in undertones of hordar pride and anger and take the curse off them as long as you dont get so explicit you rub up against huvved paranoia she glanced at parnalee saw his annoyance trying to teach him elementary tricks of his own trade hah she swallowed a grin but enough was enough shed gotten a small jab in for that look he gave her time to be serious lets see about three hundred years ago again thats standard not local years when the good folk in the huvved empire got tired of their bloody rulers or maybe desperate enough not to care all that much what happened to them they rose up on their hind legs and kicked out the current imperator came within a hair of putting their hands on him too close enough they scared the shit out of the creep he ran for his life in his last warmaster wrapped in her cloud of stingers made the insplit just ahead of a swarm of harriers when they didnt give up and dived after him he ordered a random course punched in ran along it full out until he lost them then popped back to realspace so he could find out where he was poor old pradites either pradixs holiness had worn off or luck was out to lunch because where do you think he was when he stuck his nose up a spit and a half from horgul they come all this distance to get away from home fights and bloody huvved spend seven centuries getting comfortable with their new world and here comes the huvved imperator and his hopeful court to sit on their necks again hmm one of those coincidences nobody believes but they happen um shall i go on this is printed out minus a few editorial comments that might annoy the spy who reads my hard copy he squinted up at brilliant white sunlight glittering through interstices between the undulant leaves of the low broad tree spreading out above them leaves like overlapping slices of translucent green jade ive got nothing better to do until it cools down go on thanks a lot she sipped at the fruitade it was still cool enough to be drinkable though the ice had melted she wiped away the sticky trickle spilling from the corner of her mouth and wished futilely for a little wind to stir the hot still air with the outer curtain wall and the inner walls that shut in this much smaller space any breeze around would give up and go home right picture our imperator and his bunch sitting up there in that monstrous warmaster drooling over what looks like a sweet setup for plunder picture their surprise when they tune in on the local comsets and hear a version of hordar speech it apparently hadnt changed all that much in the centuries since the pradites left hordaradda the hordar are a pretty conservative bunch far as i can gather there was an odd mix of technology a lot like theyve got now in fact minus some flourishes laid on by the slave techs the present imperator has been importing functioning comsets the landers from the colony transport some stray robotics some sophisticated filters touches here and there of tech theyd brought with them and managed to hang onto they did some mining in the asteroid belt dumped their worst criminals on the next world out that kind of thing otherwise they were pretty well early industrial with large feudal patches out on the grasslands what they call the duzzulkas no ground traffic but a busy sky airships hydrogen lift all sizes all over the place cheap and reliable dont have to build roads by the by ive convinced tra yarta that i should visit a sea farm soon tell you about that later anyway where was i all over the place if im boring you academic maundering which i suppose you cant help being an academician go on i have to get this one way or another and it might as well be now so kind remind me to poison your next drink hmm yes the huvved came roaring in over tairanna and took her fast and bloody poor old pradites and eftakites hadnt a chance against a warmaster stories from that time have her melting down whole cities in a single hour she sat up wiped at her face like im going to melt in a minute she poured more fruitade into her glass tasted it grimaced it was warmish all the ice long gone she dumped the pitcher out filled it at the fountain and emptied it over her head filled it again emptied it again and dripped back to the lounge chair from all i can find out the hordar were a peaceful lot then they did more fighting with words than with fists theyd rather go somewhere else when things got tense didnt mean they wouldnt fight but they werent much good at hopeless battles even then though you didnt want to push them too hard back them into a corner and you had trouble serious trouble capital t trouble you get the hordar surge coming at you parnalee broke open the fastenings on his tunic wiped at his face and his neck with a damp handkerchief i presume this will eventually reach some endpoint aslan ignored him what it is its a sort of mob action that turns a collection of individuals into a single being with a single mind and a single purpose which is basically to stomp a threat into mush she lifted the damp ends of her shirt and flapped them idly trying to stir a bit of breeze along her sweaty body to trigger a surge she broke off yawned you put a minimum of twelve hordar in some sort of enclosed space and apply extreme stress involving the survival of a genetic group she closed her eyes after a minute cracked the eye on parnalees side he was flushed with heat and visibly uncomfortable she couldnt tell if he was listening oh well what the hell might as well finish her recitation a surge grows in lumps of twelve dont know why but there it is she yawned again bridges from group to group until most of the population is involved it doesnt quit until the danger is gone or every unit in the surge is dead she pushed sweatsoggy hair out of her eyes and thought about going inside for a bath but it was hotter in there than it was here too bad the fountain was in full sunlight be nice to sit in it a while and cool off but she didnt want a case of sunstroke she didnt much trust the doctors on this primitive world wonder if there are any umbrellas inside i could tie an umbrella to one of those upper tiers and make my own shade hmm havent got the energy to move after i came on the term in the early histories i tried talking about it in my interviews every hordar had a powerful nonverbal response to the word and put up barriers whenever i tried to move beyond abstractions to the actual mechanics of the thing and the emotional and physical responses she sighed you getting any of this par im listening hmm you think theres any chance if its this hot tomorrow for us to go out on the lake do some swimming no why freshwater eelanalogs very hungry this time of year shit yeh wondered why i didnt see any boats out there thats why swimming pools huvved no slaves or hordar allowed as my mother would say sweet sweet go on with your lecture whats the rest of it i forget dont be stupid all right you noticed that hordar and huvved are related closely enough to permit interbreeding i noticed probably no pureblood huvved left they didnt bring that many women with them when they skipped out lets see surge huvvedhordar mixes dont seem to have the capacity for that melding but they exhibit much the same reactions to the word a lot of fear there pride rage a whole witchs brew boiling away down deep i suppose anything that intense is useful in your business he grunted a noncommittal sound she took for assent i came across the phenomenon when i was reading about the early years seems that the imperator then was a bit gaga about hordar it was a band of hordar rebels who came within a hair of removing his head he and his happy band of sycophants had a fine old time running down and disposing of the locals got so bad the hordar believed he was going to slaughter them all there you have it extreme stress involving the survival of a genetic group the thing that tipped them over the edge was a sort of autodafe he put together outside a littoral city called ayla gul inci the incers were driven into a fenced enclosure and forced to watch their relatives burn about ten minutes into the barbeque they began melding into a surge about half of them were killed but the imperator barely got away with his skin intact not long after that his security chief took a look around at what was happening to his men and materiel and convinced the imperator to abdicate in favor of his most competent nephew thats what the histories say you can draw your own conclusions the grand sech worked out a schema that gave enough to everyone to keep them relatively contented and things settled down like i said the hordar those days werent into mass suicide once the surge was defused they adapted and there was a fairly easy peace for the next two centuries then a free trader arrived they dont have his name but it seems he had connections with bolodo neyuregg the imperator before this one he needed techs because his warmaster was deteriorating and that threatened his power he didnt want to hire anyone whod give away tairannas location he was charmed by the thought of shall we say hirepurchase of those techs he didnt stop with them slave holding seems to be addictive hmm either that or bolodo reps are very persuasive anyway two transports a year for over fifty years that adds up to a lot of slaves she yawned thats about it except the reason theres trouble now is simple enough when you consider the impact of cramming maybe a thousand years worth of technological development into fifty years and dumping this onto what was a stable nearly unchanging society basic stupidity always makes trouble parnalee passed his handkerchief over his face again wiping away the file of sweat and the trickles that were dripping into his eyes surge he said you cant makea noble icon out of a mob i need stories of individuals looks like youre telling me im not going to get them not from the conquest she said drowsily she kept flapping her shirt ends not putting much energy into this but you dont want those do you i mean i doubt that tra yarta would let you make huvveds out as what villains of the piece no matter how much the hordar might enjoy such a treat there are ways he brooded a moment im getting a feel for the huvved but ill be depending on you and churri to bring me something i can use for the hordar i dont see anything yet after i think about it maybe she dropped her arms over the edge of the narrow lounge chair began playing with the short stiff grass well while youre thinking what have you picked up about what happens when a transports due she paused but he lay like a sunstruck log saying nothing i hope its more than ive got any time i go near anything about the ship im warned off sometimes hard sometimes subtle but the end is i know the twiceayear thing and thats about it lock down what he sucked in a long breath trickled it slowly out finally he said all techs anyone they suspect might be able to fool around with the ship theyre locked into the pens he lifted heavy reddened eyelids means me and churri probably not you he spoke slowly wearily as if he were too fatigued to push the words out tra yarta aside these clotheaded huvveds have only one use for women he pushed himself up got heavily to his feet stretched slumped im going to get some sleep churri wants to talk to you tomorrow he said he yawned didnt say why no spring in his step with none of the massive force that usually hung like an aura about him he stumped off wiping at his face and neck with the sodden handkerchief she frowned after him wondering if he was going to crack up before they got out of here she couldnt do much without his backing might as well follow xalloors advice find a way to live as well as possible within the limits allowed her and maybe keep alive a shriveled forlorn little hope that mama adelaar would come and get her out of this mess he was a proud man his size and strength and well shrewdness had insulated him from the kicks and pratfalls that life delivered regularly to ordinary folk one of these days he was going to explode and tell some home truths to whatever huvved creep it was giving him a bad time he didnt understand what it meant to be powerless he didnt feel in his bones he was a slave she had a strong impression that hed never been in a situation he hadnt eventually dominated he played with irrational emotions and used them to manipulate people but he was essentially a rational man despite his experience he kept expecting people maybe shed better say men to act out of reasoned selfinterest that wasnt happening here it didnt matter how strong how skilled how valuable he was at any time for any reason no matter how absurd he could be flogged or even killed his lack of control over his life was beginning to eat into him she frowned at the brilliant glitter of the water droplets leaping up to fall down and fall again from basin to basin wondering if churri was right maybe they should go over the wall and try hiding in the mountains churri wanted to see her tomorrow huh well he was going to have to wait she was getting out of here tra yarta had set up a visit to a sea farm she sighed straightened her legs and lay with her eyes closed listening to the music of the falling water after a while she dropped into a doze the sea was a hard blue glitter reaching into a white glitter near the horizon where water merged with sky the blue interrupted with undulant ribbons of what appeared to be shiny blackgreen plastic the largest several meters long and a meter wide leaves of the primary crop of the sea farm the freestanding alga trees called yoss acres and acres of leaves fans of supple strips rising and falling with the lift and drop of the sea narrow blue lanes cut through the black openways spread in a web about a large collection of broadbottomed barges with low structures built on them the living quarters of the farm family and its affiliates storage buildings generator sheds processing sheds and open areas filled with bales of yoss leaves and piles and piles of brownish eggshaped pods with heavy nets tied down over them water areas and barge areas alike the farm seethed with activity children busy at small tasks adults moving continually in and out of the water off the barges and out of small brightlycolored boats scattered through the leaf fans others busy at exposed machinery moving in and out of work structures doing assorted housekeeping chores hanging out wash working around exterior ovens where heat rose in wavery lines vertical mimicry of the leaflines on the water a floating village close to selfsufficient the small airship droned in a wide circle about the perimeter of the farm the inert and disapproving young huvved seated beside aslan came reluctantly awake zarkzar efi musvedd though he discouraged her using his name with a lofty glare when she tried to start up a conversation yoss he drawled average stem length fifty fathoms average diameter fifty feet leaf length thirty to fifty feet valuable in bulk because they contain a fiber used in most areas of hordar activity rope the outer bags of airships he jerked a thumb upward toward the glistening ceiling of the gondola a tightly woven obviously very tough material one of the imported techs has developed a process to condition those fibers fining the threads to produce a soft silky sheen he pinched at the muted blue fabric draped over his arms the side stalks are harvested mulched macerated and the juices distilled into the fuel for the engines of this airship and those runabouts he pointed down at the small shells darting about like waterbugs the main stalks are home for edible parasites animal and vegetable youve eaten some of them im sure and tucktla tucktla shells are crushed to make red and purple dyes also a very powerful glue hordar use it a lot in building the chair youre sitting on is held together with tucktla near the surface the subsidiary stalks produce large clusters of pods eggshaped maybe three feet wide five long you can see piles of them down there filled with hydrogen extracted from seawater the fanners harvest those slap glue over the stems to prevent leaks and sell them ashore to the airship companies the lift in this ship is provided by yoss pods having such a resource available when they arrived the hordar didnt bother developing any other transport there was a casual contempt in the huvveds voice as he went through his guides spiel aslan glanced at him decided there was more of her mother in her than shed thought she wanted to put a knee where itd hurt most and wipe the smug off that painted face she suppressed a smile at the thought and went back to looking out the window as the airship spiraled in to a stubby pylon she felt the small jolt as the noselock clicked home a louder hum from the motors then silence then a few twitches she could see small dark figures moving about below them hauling on ropes shoving home the levers of friction clamps a moment later the pilot came from the cockpit door walked past them and used a rodkey to open the exit door efi musvedd stalked from the lift leaving aslan to trot along behind like a pet on a leash which annoyed her again scraping the bottom of the situation she dredged up a spoonful of humor dark and ropy the man had a genius for destroying any possibility in any situation he pushed his nose into three dignified grayhaired matrons ommars and a silent man with a long white beard elaborately braided an ollan had gathered about the base of the pylon as the chief ommar began a courteous though nonenthusiastic setspeech efi musvedd walked rudely past her stopped at the narrow footbridge which joined the pylon barge to the much larger living barge next door he didnt like hordar aslan suspected he was afraid of them and overcompensating for that fear with an arrogance both ugly and all too familiar he wasnt going to tolerate anything but meek compliance from any of the farmers no matter how senior you were informed he said as to the purpose of this visit i see no point in wasting time he scowled over his shoulder at aslan what are you waiting for doctor the last word was packed with contempt and impatience ask your questions aslan rolled her eyes up spread her hands silently urging the hordar officials to believe she had no part in his actions there was no response but she didnt quite despair maybe the chance would come to push him overboard maintaining a dignified and respectful sobriety she explained to the hordar elders that she was there to study their life patterns that she wished to see how their limited living space was organized the different kinds of work needed to keep their settlement viable how they educated their children samples of artforms poetry music that sort of thing she didnt expect to note down all of that today merely an overview she smiled suddenly finished and why your storage barges dont fly off on you considering how many hydrogen pods youre storing under those nets there was no response to her attempt at humor a feeble attempt at best but shed hoped for some reaction none only the ancient everplayed story conquered and conqueror hating and fearing on both sides shame on both sides the shame of enduring humiliation the equal but less recognized shame at inflicting it she sighed and asked to be taken about the floating village efi musvedd strode along moving ahead of them opening any door that caught his fancy ignoring protests the ridaar unit which aslan wore on her belt was flaking everything around her including whispered conversations not meant to reach her ears or the huvveds she couldnt check it because she didnt want huvved or hordar to know what she was doing but she was sure she wasnt getting much useful except the whispers and shed have to erase those she wasnt about to give the grand sech a handle on these people the farmers were focused exclusively on efi musvedd vibrating with a resentment and loathing that blanked out all other body language after about twenty minutes of this she grabbed hold of her tempers tail disciplined her face and turned to the whitehaired ommar the official greeter before she could say anything efi musvedd jerked open a door and went through it it was the bedroom of a young woman who had apparently given birth not long before when he burst in she was lying half asleep with the baby in the curve of her arm she gasped with alarm when the door slammed open pulled the baby to her and struggled out of bed the ommar was going to protest aslan took hold of her arm closed her fingers tight about it if i may use your comset the woman was hard with fury but like aslan she contained it after a gesture that sent the other elders into the room to interpose themselves between the huvved and the girl she led aslan rapidly toward one of the processing barges opened a door and ushered her into a smallish office when she reached the aide who handled her for the grand sech she didnt waste time on tact whoever assigned that supercilious little cretin to me ought to have his brain scrubbed hes generated so much hostility here it makes me wonder if someone planned it theres no way i can accomplish anything with him in the same hemisphere the aide was a fat old man with empty eyes hed supplied her needs without comment the several times shed called on him he seemed to be an efficient administrator she never had to ask twice or reject any of the supplies he sent her and subjects for interviews were on time and forthcoming now he smiled at her briefly amused you didnt object to him before you left i hadnt been exposed to the full glory of his personality what do you want me to do get him away from me far away you know what the sweet thing just did he barged into a bedroom where a girl was with her new baby and nearly scared her into a heart attack terrific she scowled at him am i supposed to be some sort of agent provocateur no im sure your energies will be fully engaged by the work sech tra yarta has given you which brings me back a hand clamped on her shoulder and jerked her out of the chair efi musvedd flung her at the floor put a boot in her side then panted and cursed as he swung his czadeg at her that limber gray cane which guards used to herd slaves and huvved used whenever they were annoyed with someone of lesser status the beating went on and on as the huvved gradually worked off his rage aslan huddled in a tight knot rolling and wriggling slipping some of the kicks and taking most of the whipping on her shoulders and buttocks the hordar elders watched silent and impassive aslan caught glimpses of them standing in the doorway the aide watched from the comscreen when efi musvedd dropped his arm he called him over zarkzar efi musvedd return immediately to gilisim gillin the aides voice was crisp flat report to the grand sech as soon as you reach the palace the wild energy drained from the young huvveds face and body he looked tired and there was a glint of fear in his narrowed eyes what about the woman forget her shes no business of yours i hear he reached to click off the set no leave it start back now efi musvedd slapped the czadeg into its clip smoothed his hair down and stalked out the door the watching hordar melting like smoke before him ommar tirtky presij come here the elder walked to the comset stood in front of it i am here seref the woman what is her condition with your permission seref she stepped away knelt beside aslan and went carefully over her body prodding at flesh and bone with strong knowing fingers drawing groans and a film of sweat from the injured woman she stroked her fingers in a brief caress along the side of aslans face nothing broken she murmured a last pat then she went back to the comset she is badly bruised and bleeding from several cuts there might be internal injuries if you want her intact and reasonably healthy youll have to leave her with us for a while if theres nothing seriously wrong she can travel in three or four days i will want a report each evening i hear seref the screen went dark aslan woke late in the night her body one massive ache that disintegrated into dozens of agonies when she tried to turn over her throat was dry one eye was swollen shut her upper lip was sore and so thick it seemed to be pressing against her nose a young hordar woman sat in a rocking chair a short distance off she was reading by the light from a dim lamp her face in shadows only her hands and arms lit clearly the scars on them like broken wandering threads that started on the backs of her hands and wound along her forearms to trail out above her elbows the white vividly clear against the bronze of her skin when aslan began moving about she lowered the book to her lap and waited a moment before she spoke making sure her patient was awake and aware thirsty aslans tongue rasped across dry lips yes she managed when the glass was empty the young woman set it on the table and pulled the chair closer to the bed you havent been a slave long have you aslan tried to smile but her mouth felt like wood and the cut on her lip burned and broke apart no she lay back stared at the shadowy ceiling no are you angry at us for not trying to help you no you couldnt do anything with her mouth in its parlous condition her articulation was so mushy even she had a hard time understanding herself but she wanted to talk she needed to talk do you know what touched him off you shamed him before hordar sea farmers we are too valuable to the imperator he couldnt do what he wanted and wipe out the insult by killing us all so he lessoned you aslan nodded grimaced as the movement sent dull pain bouncing between her temples i should have known that i wasnt thinking too angry she lay silent a moment then lifted a hand and let it fall a gesture of futility echoing the confusion in her mind the grand sech you know hes the one who sent the slavers looking for someone like me out there she tilted her hand up waggled a finger at the ceiling hes no fool or he wouldnt be where he is or am i the fool no not this time and i doubt he tolerates fools working for him why did they send that clown as my escort how could i possibly accomplish anything with him bulling about tra yarta paid a hefty price for my skills why why why did he undercut me like that she stopped blinked then tried out a painful laugh funny not long ago i was thinking about an acquaintance i was telling myself he didnt know what it was to be powerless that he was going to run himself into trouble because of it that he expected power to be rational and was he going to be surprised when he found out how irrational the powerful could be i could have been describing myself sending that um person wasnt irrational there was a quiet bitterness in the young womans voice what wasteful maybe not irrational how can weve had a long time to learn the convolutions of huvved thinking and i dont understand what the sech wants from you a graceful flutter of scarred hands silenced aslan it doesnt matter whatever it is its trouble for hordar you see she stopped talking shifted position in the chair folded one leg up so the foot was resting on the other knee clasped her hands about the ankle she was leaning forward intense filled with anger and need you see he doesnt trust you hell break you first thats what this was a start toward smashing the part of you that wont submit to him its like breathing not something you can control you just do it he wants you sane he wants you healthy and he wants you coopted complicity not competence what the reciprocal of something my acquaintance said i think i see i have to be his from the marrow out not just from selfinterest yes the huvved have done that to us you saw what happened here and were the most independent hordar on tairanna our first reaction was withdrawal no one challenged that bastards right to put his hands on anyone or anything he chose one of the lessons of power it is exercised everywhere supported to excess everywhere no matter how stupid or mindless or destructive the act no hordar is ever allowed to triumph over a huvved not even in the smallest degree the huvved might be punished for his act by other huvved but no hordar will ever be allowed to know it why are you telling me these things i could report you to the sech the young woman laughed again more anger than humor in the barking sound dont you understand im the second act im the voice of despair the councilor of passivity the object lesson how to survive and prosper under the rule of the huvved you dont seem to have learned the lesson all that well oh dont fool yourself i might talk a good fight but thats empty air i am pittipats footmat and thats all ill ever be uh pittipat the imperator word goes round that hes so woollyheaded hed lose in a game of pittypat played with any healthy three year old makes us feel brave to call him that subversive but its smoke and nonsense i cant believe listen to me doctor whatever your name is do you know what hangs over our heads right now no dont bother answering ill tell you a battleship called a warmaster if the imperator or even the grand sech decided we were expendable and they needed an object lesson to enforce their demands on other sea farmers thirty seconds on wed be a cloud of steam and theres not a single thing we could do to prevent it her hands closed into fists then she forced them open splayed her fingers across her thighs apply that to yourself if you defy him if your capacity for giving him trouble begins to match the value of your skills pouf she sighed shifted position again i suppose you and your acquaintance are planning to seize a bolodo transport and escape thats happened you know or perhaps you dont the year before i was born a band of determined slaves made it on board a transport they even managed to take off the warmaster didnt bother leaving orbit it ashed them and the hostages they took with them everyone who helped them everyone in the families of those who helped them everyone who could be accused of helping them by local enemies whether they were guilty or not altogether more than a thousand people were hung in iron cages and left to die no food no water no shelter from heat or cold the strongest lasted fourteen days no whoever sent that lunatic with you knew what he was doing and hell do more the young woman fell silent she frowned thoughtfully as she inspected aslans face and body i suspect you wont last more than six months a quick brilliant smile warm amused far from the despair in her words no you wont give in i dont think you can poor baby youll be dead cheerful thought um dead isnt all that bad when you come back maybe the world will have changed any change will be an improvement the way things are now aslan made a small noncommittal sound there was no point arguing the tenets of a religion she was unacquainted with my name is aslan she said aslan aici adlaar aslan the young woman touched eyes lips spread her hands palm out i am the dalliss gerilli presij dalliss um diver thats what the word means yes im missing something gerilli presij stood why dont you shift onto your stomach and let me give you a back rub we dont want you stiffening up she glanced at a mechanical clock whose faint regular tick aslan had dismissed as part of the noises endemic to barge life not time yet for your next shot shot aslan stiffened the dalliss chuckled it wont hurt im very good at this aslan didnt answer just began the painful difficult process of rolling onto her stomach in the morning she was still sore and moving was difficult but she was completely free of fever apparently the gel that gerilli presij used as a rubbing compound and those shots were effective against infection she was also healing faster than she expected her lip had deflated almost to normal and the other cuts on her face had closed over nicely in one of the baths hot and cold water fresh and abundantly available something she found rather remarkable in these conditions she inspected her face and relaxed though she hadnt protested hordar attentions the thought of that primitive goo in her veins had made her very nervous apparently itd done a great deal more good than harm she made a note to get a sample of those preparations to a friend of hers in the bio department at university another girl brought aslan her breakfast younger with a tendency to giggle she nudged the lamp aside and set the tray on the table youre looking pretty good hanifa she whispered put her hand over her mouth startled at her own boldness thanks to the excellent nurse i had aslan lifted the cover off the platter looks good mind telling me what everything is oh the girl thought that over nodded i suppose they eat other things where you come from a lot of other things aslan chuckled very other ah well these theyre krida fried in batter crunchy youll like them these theyre havya fisheggs this is jatine its a sweet we make out of jata fruits they grow on the yoss this is fresh jata mmm youd better try a nibble first its kind of powerful for someone whos never had any this is a fulla a kind of bread roll its got nuts and bits of cheese in it we get the milk and cheese and flour from the landfolk and for drinking this is cimenchi its an infusion of a kind of watergrass it grows on the yoss the girl grinned much more at ease doesnt everything theres some milk here and some water over here for if you dont like the cimenchi when youre finished just leave the tray where it is someonell fetch it i hear um would it be possible to find me some clothes musvedd the creep just about ruined what i was wearing you sure you should maybe stay in bed a little longer i can fetch some books or something if you dont want to sleep id rather start working if thats all right sure its all right if you feel up to it oh my names cinnal samineh im geris cousin and one of her isyas she whisked to the door turned ill bring the clothes soon as i can find some thatll fit youre kinda tall she darted away aslan listened to her sandals pattering lightly on the reed mats nice child she touched her lip winced from the bare flesh where the skin was split isya isya i remember seeing something yes tra meclins hordar dictionary a kind of blood sisterhood or oathsister closer than kinship five to eight per isya wonder how close he comes to being right wonder if i can spot the other isyas in the group she picked up one of the krida and bit into it yum rather like fried shrimp but her mouth was too sore to enjoy it and the salt on it stung the cut on her lip some day some day she nibbled cautiously at more krida some day im going to pull that shitheads teeth and make him eat nuts or starve she grinned at the image winced again as the stretching widened the cut ram sandburs up his asshole carting a faldstool on a strap cinnal samineh took aslan on a slow tour of the village shed unfold the stool sit aslan on it and bring her anyone she wanted to talk with there was a very different feeling to the village as if everyone on the barges and in the boats had been let out of prison the farmers were still wary but inclined to be as friendly as they could in the circumstances aslan responded this was the atmosphere she was accustomed to for a moment she could dream herself free again working again studying a culture she found intriguing though it wasnt her usual area of concentration the village was compact and complex recycling was almost an art form and certainly a passion you will be back dont trash your homeplace they told her all things are god give them honor they said they said these things lightly amused when she sighed as she heard them for the tenth time but under the lightness they were very serious about this pradix wasnt a prophet confined beneath a roof or shut between the covers of a book wistfully filled with regret because she couldnt share it she observed their deeply internalized belief and made her notes her usual objectivity was gone she wanted these people set free she wanted that even more passionately than she wanted the unntoualar protected from the foul things being done to them when she was lying on the bed in the room they gave her cinnal samineh insisted she rest for an hour after lunch and aslan was tired enough to make her argument perfunctory she contemplated her own reactions picking them to bits a habit of hers that was one of the things her mother used to flay her with identifying thats what she was doing the enemy of my enemy is my friend maybe because they liked her maybe because they were intelligent and interesting people with a basic kindness to them maybe because the huvved shed met were such miserable oppressive dreeps the kind of people shed hated from the moment she could walk her foster mother was a toelicking social climber who ignored the contempt of the people she was trying to associate with and the callous way they used her then dropped her the huvved were using her with that same kind of contempt for everything she valued about herself using her learning and her intelligence to further enslave these hordar shed hated that when it was first proposed now she loathed herself for giving in to parnalees arguments for letting herself be seduced by the work she wasnt sure what she was going to do what she could do but she wasnt going to log data any longer nothing accurate anyway uncomfortably aware of the naivetй her mother deplored she frowned at the ceiling was distracted momentarily because she noticed for the first time the fine plasterwork it was sculpted into intricate geometric patterns then scolded herself back to the problem she was contemplating adelaar wouldnt hesitate to cook the data and shed know just how to do it indetectably that was the problem she had to fool tra yarta who knew these people a lot better than she ever would and parnalee who no doubt could smell a fix from fifty paces intellectual integrity was devalued currency these days she had a thought and started laughing she had efi musvedd to thank for the time she needed he was worth something after all tra yarta got what he wanted yes but he lost far more than he gained i hope i hope she told herself she held up both hands with all her fingers crossed a little trick she hadnt practiced for a while an omen she thought this is going to come out right she laughed again and let her hands fall what do i need paper and pen i cant do this in my head and i cant trust the computers here she rubbed at her temples its been what ah thirty years since studied sociometrics i need references out of the question have to depend on my memory and my smarts built up from the bases im familiar with rule of thumb i hope my thumbs not broke i always thought i was cleverer than most have to prove it now parnalee said hed wring the neck of anyone who messed up his chances his chances she thought about what gerilli presij had told her that was the end of her escape plans she wasnt getting aboard any ship liable to be vaporized the moment it got beyond the atmosphere over the hill and off she thought parnalee or not soon as i can manage it hmm one of the cities of the littoral i need to go there next ayla gul inci why not i can make a good case for it thats the city where the surge began must be some old memories there hmm maybe i can find a crack to crawl through yes all right from now on im working for me cinnal samineh flattened her hand on the desalinizer we bought this about ten years ago it gives us all the fresh water we need she slanted a sly glance at asian a tech slave the imperator brought in built them for him one of the few good things that came with the slaves what did you do before then let me show you its just next door it was a long narrow barge with slat blinds over lots of glass cinnal samineh cleared one section so they could look inside water was being pumped along deep glasslined channels around and past thick stands of remarkably ugly twisted plants the stems were broad and pulpy the leaves were stiff dotted with thorns succulent coated with a thick waxy substance they were brilliantly colored red and purple orange gold and bluegreen poison colors aslan inspected them and decided she wouldnt go in that place for a ticket home she wasnt about to suck in any air they polluted with their exudates and exhalations saltplants cinnal samineh said they extract minerals and salts from seawater its slow but sure by the time theyre finished with it and we pass it through a bit more filtration its almost pure enough to drink we used it for washing and that kind of thing what we needed for drinking water we passed through a still even now on holy days and jubilations we drink water from here not from the machine sort of celebrating the past and linking with the future you see dont you i see cinnal grinned we have other reasons for keeping this going those leaves give us some of our best dyes poisonous sheeh you have to be very careful handling them but the results are worth it and the roots you cant see them but they are very very important our best filters are made from the pulp and membranes in those roots matter of fact the zerzevah farm its out around the bulge south of here thats their main source of income their merm bed was wiped out a couple storms ago and the new bed wont be producing for a decade or more merm bed cinnal samineh wrinkled her nose i cant talk about that can anyone geri maybe ill ask her thanks how much water could this um plant produce in a day enough for all of us we had to be careful of course and we used seawater for things we use freshwater for these days interesting you said i might be able to visit a school i talked to my familys ommar she said fine schooling is family business nothing to do with the council its quite a walk from here we could take it easy or maybe i could whistle up a shell why not its a lovely day for a boat ride that night aslan worked until long after midnight sketching out the distortions and outright falsities she wanted to incorporate indetectably into her data files when she was too tired to make sense of the numbers and symbols she tore the pages into small bits and burned them when she finally slept she slipped in and out of nightmare dreams where she was endlessly running unable to reach a shapeless goal that seemed to represent safety it hovered continually just in front of her kept vanishing on her and reappearing a little farther on other times she was under something dark and heavy that came rushing down at her that was a fast dream it recurred several times and each time she managed to wake up just before the thing crushed her she lay bathed in sweat her heart pounding her head throbbing the halfhealed bruises and cuts adding their own dull misery to a night that was beginning to seem endless rosepearls gerilli persij dipped her hand into a soft pouch and pulled out half a dozen rounds she tilted her palm and let them trickle onto the square of black suede the smallest was about the size of a small pea it was a pale pinkish cream the others went from cream to deep rose from cherrypit to plumsized they shared a fine luster with a glow that seemed to reach down and down drawing the eye after it gerilli persij took a midsized pearl between thumb and forefinger held it out to aslan close your hand around it for a moment then smell your skin the pearl warmed quickly aslan opened her hand sniffed at her palm there was a delicate floral fragrance very pleasant though nothing startling another moment though and she noticed something odd happening to her she felt tension dropping from her her body was vibrating with finetuned energy yet she felt no need to move or speak that rang an alarm in her mind a distant flutter that immediately started fading but not quite fast enough chewing on her lip amazed at how difficult it was she set the pearl on the suede gerilli persij smiled and began putting the rosepearls back in the pouch one like that probably bought you she said depending on how expensive you were and they come from merms i can say that yes and a dalliss is the only one who can locate and handle merms yes her mouth twisted into a wry selfmocking smile i wouldnt say that if tra yarta didnt already know it i see thats what you meant when you said you were too valuable to the imperator to be slaughtered at a whim thats what i meant she shrugged if we dont push it too hard that malignancy in orbit if there was just some way we could get rid of it we from what you said im stuck here as long as its up there gerilli persij gazed at her a long moment then she shut the pearls into a small lockbox and got to her feet you said youre a good swimmer i spent five years on vandavrem my first field assignment after i was accepted in the graduate program on university it was a waterworld almost no land there was a very strange culture of intelligent bubble nesters never mind it would take too long to explain but yes i got to be very adept in the water would you care to visit the yoss forest yes of course do you freedive or use airtanks depends on how deep were going and what kind of works involved i think tanks for this expedition right lead me to them again aslan worked until her mind was numb slept badly and woke with despair and fear a sickness in her belly it was hard to get up to get on with living but shed done all she could in the time given her the airship was coming for her shortly after noon and in a few hours shed be back in the palace pen a slave again with all that meant she comforted herself with the thought that the sooner she was gone from the persijsamineh farm the sooner tra yartas attention would be taken off them they threw a feast for her danced the seadances for her tumbled and juggled and at the end of the little jubilation a woman with a husky voice filled with the pain and joy of a fully lived life sang a song that the farmers listened to with a verve that seemed more than it was worth sly eyes watched aslan halfsmiles teased at her said to her we know we know itsa bit of a risk but who can always live safely the womans hair was black and long shiny and sleek as a tar slick she stood on a wooden dais flute player on one side a fiddler on the other and drummer at her feet one a two a moon rising high dream and illusion sharing the sky three a four a stone and a bone what does the stone say my oh my what does the bone say by an by moonlights for love for dreams never spoken of dreams that wont die five six seven what do you leave in when youre singing just a little lie sweet lie silly lie pass on by eight and nine look for the sign ten eleven fall from heaven all those devils dark and sly riding the shoulders of you and i high be low and low be high twelve a thirteen what does it mean bone come walking shimble shamble place your bets and let the wheel spin all the little angels grin and gambol tip a toe tap a toe atop a little pin stone say watch it round they come again the angels are dancing wild and tame tap a toe tip a toe atop a little pin hey bone ho bone want a little game bound for heaven never try it thats a place they let too many in fourteen fifteen what does it mean all the little angels wild and free asquat around a gamble stone playing for we sixteen seventeen whats your fancy nothing chancy let the wheel spin eighteen nineteen what does it mean moonlights for love for dreams never spoken of dreams that wont die twenty a score not no more whats a number for start the game again aslan joined in the storm of applause appreciating the skill of the singer as she turned what seemed to be a minor little counting poem into something daring and portentous the performance was safe in the ridaar unit and she could study it in more depth laterif she decided she could trust the computers at her work station and if she wanted the responsibility it wasnt all that difficult to understand the overall message of the song even this stranger could hear the call for a continued resistance to huvved rule but there were some trigger words and images that drew a response which seemed disproportionate to their content there was something going on here something more dangerous than what gerilli persij had called talking a good fight aslan kept an open appreciative smile on her face as the woman stepped down and another singer took her place a man this time alone except for the pilot and his co aslan watched the grasslands sliding beneath her the silvery greenbrown grass blowing in the wind that was pushing the ship along and making it shudder now and then i could like this world she thought these people well not the huvved hmm its worth studying wonder whod apply and whod get the grant aaron could be he must be nearly finished with the darra saseru seeing that theyre just about finished killing each other off or maybe tkraaketkx tk i wonder what the hordar would make of him hmm are they shapephobic or is that a huvved trait all the slaves brought in with me were from the cousin races only slight variations from the two types living here but that was just one shipment hmm if i were the imperator and reasonably sane the techs id import would be so different from the locals that thered be no place at all for them to hide she yawned settled back in the chair and dropped into a doze aslan dropped her gear on a newly replaced grass mat hey everyone im back parnalee churri anyone here one sec lan be right out aslan raised her brows startled xalloor uhhuh the dancer slammed the door to parnalees bedroom and threw herself down on a couch trying to turn me into a blisterin nurse tchah she wrinkled her nose i suppose its better than being drafted as a whore for those mignish guards what drooling ol dreep aslan dropped onto the couch who him xalloor jerked a thumb at a window that looked out on the great tower him with his bony ass planted on this world what happened dumb me xalloor banged a fist against her chest one of her sudden brilliant grins lit up her tired face nah not so bad as that stupid madoor wouldnt let me see the client i always do that so i know what the git wants i was flying blind hmp went to the trouble to snatch me didnt they i figure here he is he owns the whole stinking world he mustve paid one tartrish price for me so i go all out and give him my most marvelous dance i told you about it the lightsailor piece her shoulders jerked with her short barking laugh so turns out his idea of art rises maybe to paper dollies another abrupt laugh trouble is the lightsailor things pretty abstract i lost him about five minutes into it been anything less id ve seen that and played to him but that piece is a chunk of my heartsoul and i wasnt noticing anything until the finish there was a very long loud silence she shrugged too bad oh well what goes around comes around aslan caught her hand held it a moment then she sighed and shook her head i go away four days xalloor caught hold of her chin tilted her face to the light you get crosswise with someone my escort switched into monster max when he thought i was being uppity you and parnalee what happened i never got it straight all i know is from his mumbles when i was washing the blood off lessoning he said at least thats what i thought it was whoever worked him over got in some good licks at his face and he wasnt talking so clear place he say that a lot his place he kept going on about knowing his place all right and teaching some tofty prick his i figure one of these snotheads he was catering for thought he was getting above himself like you say uppity one of the guards hauled me out of the pen and told me to take care of him he was bleeding all over the mat nearest the door you maybe noticed one of thems new someone gave him one tartrish going over his back was hamburger a local medic shot him with some stuff and gave me some goo to rub on the bruises that was late last night hes still sleeping so you found out yet what they want a that thing you said what they want you for theyve got me studying the hordar why trouble they want us parnalee and me to poke around and figure out how to calm things down without killing everybody i can see why these mignish nothi would starve to death if they killed off the hordar how is he really hes going to know it when he moves for at least a month but hes a chunk of ax jerky it wont kill him if i know men hes going to bitch a lot but you just ignore it what about the bard anything happen to him not yet and maybe never what ive picked up you dont mess with poets round here i see xalloor you know anything about computers deary dai do i know about computers do you know about dancers

sytha outlet and itd fry you eggs for breakfast right ill see if i can work it so you come over here and help me with my data if youre willing read dy da willing pretty dull stuff this mome dull sounds marrrvelous come take a walk with me aslan got to her feet smoothed her hands down her sides ive been sitting all afternoon and i need to get the knots out ah hah that high wattage grin flashed again then her narrow face was primly serious they strolled along a shady path that more or less paralleled the section of creek that ran through the enclosure so we figured bolodo would show up again in about six months standard and weve been looking about for ways to take the transport and run for civilization maybe not this time but the next for sure xalloor flicked a woven grass fan back and forth in the futile hope that moving air would be marginally less oppressive i heard talk in the pen a snatch here another there youre not the only ones so what happened its obvious you arent all that hipped on the idea ive been thinking about it and trying to plan something from the minute i put foot to ground and saw the transport was the only insplitter around that isnt what i asked i know i just wanted you to aslan pushed sweaty hair back from her face one of the people at the sea farm she told me itd happened before slaves took the transport got it flying she put her hand on xalloors arm stopped her you hear anything about whats up there hanging over us huh ever seen one of those battleships they call warmasters sheeit yeh a client once took me through one it was defanged though you telling me yeh it got the transport fffft think parnalee knows havent told him maybe i should change my mind about moving over nice having someone to talk to there is that they started walking again after several minutes aslan said i dont like helping tra yarta put the boot to the hordar nothing much you can do about it and keep your own skin whole i can um put a twist on what i tell him get yourself whomped some more maybe turned into fish bait ive already started you might not want to be involved daarra dai lan do me good to practice my kicks xalloor chuckled could even be fun vi half a year before aslan lands on tairanna three years before adelaar hires quale and crew airshipover the duzzulkascloudless summer night karrel goza tugged a length of wool from the skein draped a few loops over his thigh ruya was brushing the horizon directly ahead of him fatly gibbous gorruya was nearly out of sight overhead an anorexic crescent riding a fan of stars that were particularly brilliant this night the wind was still even the veil of dust that generally hung over the southern duzzulkas had settled for the moment the land was flowing dark and silent beneath the airship the watchfires of the herders were scattered pinpricks of red beside spreading shapeless blotches yunk herds nubby black against the ripples of silvery black grass the clock on the panel gave him another twenty minutes before he made koy tarla the pylon lights should be visible soon he was a thin dark man short neatly made a man at peace with himself as his hands manipulated the needles and the bulky gray wool slid steadily about his fingers and the sleeve grew longer his mind drifted without effort from image to image three sweaters by the time i get home not bad ommar keeps hinting i should get married hmm i dont want to shift houses whoever it is will have to adopt in gily ommard eat her alive her fathers taverns doing good be a nice add to the family business no shes all right to warm a

percin hizmet left last month hasnt found a place yet thats odd hes a top mechanic he shouldnt be having trouble getting on somewhere casma wonder if shed be willing to stay onshore i doubt it being shes a diver divers are too scrappy for me i can do without fights when im home way she dances would make a statue stand maybe we could work out something im gone so much she could spend those days at the farm be on land a couple weeks when im home affiliated to a sea farm mmh the needles clishclashed small clicks and ticks came from the instrument panel a ghost of wind noise filtered through the windows wire stays sang sustained sweet notes into the shifting creaks of the gondola cables burred deeper stronger notes into the cargo bales hitched beneath it inside the cockpit the light was dim bluish mostly from the panel though a small spotlight shone on his hands and woke watery gleams from the seaivory needles girls faces fragmentary musings dim apprehensions drifted in an unhurried stream through his head until the alarm chimed he set the knitting aside looked out lights in two columns above the much fainter glows from cracks in curtains and the occasional yellow square where an unshuttered shopwindow announced the business was still open koy tarla he patted fuds panel good old girl he cut out the automatic pilot began matching maneuvers and hit the pylon latch dead center first try the noselock wouldnt click home he swore under his breath and made another pass slipped loose again fud hadnt been properly serviced for months there were a lot of parts that needed replacing nose gear was so worn it was near unusable the third time he tried he revved the motors up more than he liked and held her vibrating against the pylon until the instruments gave him a go swearing some more he brushed the back of his hand against his sweaty brow swiveled a rotor and nudged the side of the gondola against the platform extending from the pylon watching the panel anxiously until the readouts told him he was set in solid he released the rearend cable felt the gondola shudder as it unreeled when the hook hit the ground a buzzer sounded and he shut off the motors with a sigh of relief and a fleeting suspicion that he wouldnt finish this long haul with bag and self intact a thought he immediately suppressed he rolled up his knitting stuffed it in its bag clicked off his harness and got to his feet the locks held the gondola stable besides fud was heavy with bales of yunk wool itd take more than his weight to knock her about karrel goza pulled the lift door shut checked the cable out it was taut and locked to the eyebolt birey tipis was reliable as an old boot bless the man rubbing at his back he crossed the stretch of beaten earth to the office pushed open the door and went inside alo bir hows it go slow and slower you better get that nose fixed kar dont tell me tell sirgыn what you got for me two passengers for koy vaha six bushels orps with the rind on and five sacks tarins dried old muntza tefrik he brought in some hanks of unbleached kes yarn and he wanted to know if his package had got here passengers karrel goza grimaced they always wanted to come up and talk to him fuds musty cabin started closing in on them the minute he shut the door nuh nothing for here this trip geres duvvar is due along in a couple weeks coming from the west he might have it if he makes it here hes got hav and that bag makes old fud up there look like a yearling hows it on the coast like here slow and slower karrel goza took the manifest checked the weights nodded fud can handle this he set the clipboard down smothered a yawn whats open i need to eat and catch a few hours sleep sirgыn laid my co off for the duration you too eh too you havent heard ive been short hauling along the coast thats why you havent seen me for a year or so weve been getting singles since the thaw navlun bol and ilkan bol just like sirgыn cut way down on the schedule too i get an earful of complaints from the fehz and everyone else their goods sit and rot waiting for a hauler to come along everyones notching their belts for the duration they say im getting an earache from hearing the word i ask myself whats it mean and i answer me nothing birey tipis lifted the flap came through the counter food hmm you remember annie arkaday he waved karrel goza to the door lifted the key ring off the counter and slipped the keys about hunting for the one he wanted yeh not many forget her cooking she had to shut the cafe the rent got to be too much for the trickle of customers to cover she petitioned the fehraz to lower it for the duration a soft chuckle sounded over the clinkclank of the keys for the duration he repeated but he wouldnt so he gets nothing intelligent eh he shut the lights off crossed to the door followed karrel goza through folks stay home these days or stake out a table in mahannas tavern with a couple cups of kave its still open but thats because mahannas got freehold on the building and only pays a ritseed rent he finished with the pair of locks thrust the ring into a side pocket of his jacket annie works out of her house now same reason its freehold shes piled her kids one on top of the other and hires out their rooms and fixes meals for whoever can pay and the kids run errands when they can shes doing all right so far he pointed down the street that way he said across town from here its not far he walked beside karrel goza as they went down the middle of the villages main street you heard anything been rumors the lines are going to drop half their stations let the clerks in them go ive been in that office near a score of years no one tells us pilots anything except which route were on or were laid off till godknows when karrel goza kicked at a pebble watched it bound along the worn pavement until it disappeared into a pothole its a long low but must ve about hit bottom dont you think karrel goza looked around the village didnt seem to have changed much since hed seen it last shabby onestory buildings red tile roofs showing above the packed earth walls that went round the house and the bit of garden that only friends and family ever saw here and there trees rustled in the sometime wind and the shutters over the front windows of those shops that were closed for the night rattled with the gusts the dark was kind and concealing there was a lot he wouldnt see a lot hidden behind housewalls he wished birey tipis would shut up about all this it made him sick thinking about it and more than a little scared cant say kar you and me weve still got our jobs knock wood but what do we do if skein and the others go broke nuh bir they wont let the carriers fail tairanna would fall apart if they did dont be too sure the fehz would survive and the divers would still be bringing up rosepearls so i cant see pittipat sticking his fingers in whats he care about a bunch of surrish grubbers i dont see any light ahead birey tipis glanced at karrel goza wiped sweat off his forehead wouldnt say all this if i didnt know you dont run off at the mouth kar the tip of his tongue flicked along his lips used to be we didnt worry ourselves about what we said used to be yapyap thats what we call the sechs nose he let folks know when he was coming around so they could stop talking about anything hed have to report he caught hold of karrel gozas arm stopped him listen kar i dont know about other koys but watch what you say to folk here yapyaps gone serious got a bodyguard a couple scrapings imported from tassalga hurum deval got drunk last week and wouldnt shut up he started spouting all those jokes about the imperator youve heard em im sure he didnt mean anything by it he always gets a mouth on him when hes reeling thing is come morning he was gone we havent seen him since the fehraz he sent some men over and packed up the family shipped em to gul brindar on the west coast we got word a few weeks later they were doing scut work for the fehdaz there and hoping hur would show up he hasnt so far and hes a long way from the first to slide down a dark hole without a bottom he started walking again what say you let me buy you a beer mahannas come up with a tarin brew that slides down sweet as honey dont worry about annie shell whip up something for you doesnt matter how late it is why not old fuds still a lady in the air one thing though whos going to be wrestling the cargo come morning if its me i pass you got a spare goum or two i can scare up some strong backs for that i could put in a requisition for expenses dont suppose skein would honor it theres another way wouldnt cost you or show on the books huh theres some brothers who need a lift to the coast off the manifest what else this yapyap of yours wont he be hanging around the pylon theres ways for handling that karrel goza walked on at first he was sure he didnt want anything to do with the proposition running like that it must be serious what theyd done if something went wrong he could suck his family into their mess the ommard eat me raw he glanced several times at birey tipis the old man was strolling along eyes on the road ahead face placid as a ruminating yunk no sign of the nervousness hed showed a moment before karrel goza was suddenly sure he was going to do it he wasnt quite sure why he was so scared of it thinking about what could happen tied his stomach in knots and pumped acid up his throat but somehow he couldnt not do it familyll divorce me if this comes out it wont um birey tipis dug his thumb into the soft folds of skin hanging under his jaw the boysve done this before maybe youd better tell me some more the less you know kar the safer you are i am you got a point everyone is safer i mean i can say this its not thievery or anything like that make sure you take care of yapyap and his friends we will no fear of that my friend we karrel goza thought thats interesting he didnt say anything just followed birey tipis through the taverns swing door four months after the duzzulka flight speakers circleayla gul incl karrel goza rubbed his back against the stone of the wall watched the clot of heavily robed men mill about atop the minaret a thirtyfoottall column of stone with a round shingled roof rising to a graceful point above the broad arches that went round the speakers platform he was listening to the talk around him soft muttered voices punctuated with slitted suspicious glances at everyone else angry voices kept murmurous by the fear that a wrong word at a wrong time was deadlier than poison a fear justified by the events of the past months almost everyone knew someone whod vanished as quietly and completely as a sailor washed overboard in a summer storm almost everyone thought he or she knew why there was the unexpressed hope that the missing were in prison somewhere not dead there was the equally unexpressed fear that theyd been airshipped out over the ocean and dropped in saaders cleft geres duvvar came threading through the crowd in the circle in each hand a paper cone smudged with grease from the estani nuts inside he gave a cone to karrel goza who moved over so his cousin could lean against the wall beside him you got some change coming kar there was a little war going on over there tween the peddlers karrel goza grunted dug cautiously into the hoard of hot nuts geres duvvar swallowed hurry up and wait huh he waggled the cone at the group on the speakers platform yeh dont look like theres much good to say or theyd be saying it the clacker sounded the crack of wood against wood reverberating through the dull mutter of the crowd silence spread like fog the stentor separated from the other robed men spread his arms sim o kisil sim sen hear o people hear thou thy ollanin return to report the outcome of their petition there was a pause behind the stentor one of the ollanin murmured to him he nodded faced out again sorrow sorrow the petition was heard the petition was denied the crushed nut in karrel gozas mouth was suddenly bitter he spat it out ignoring the scowl of the woman whose skirts he spattered with the bits geres duvvar beat his hand slowly steadily against the stone cursing under his breath sim o kisil sim sen this is the imperators reply let those among you who are needy apply to the houses for bread and work a groan rose from the crowd sim o kisil sim sen if you who are needy are turned away give word to the fehdaz every house and every farm who turned you away will be assessed two score rosepearls or the equivalent in tapestries and art pieces a swelling of sound with a double center on one side those who have on the other those who have not sim o kisil sim sen two of thy ollanin lifted their hearts against this and spoke the divine one cast them down into a dark and stinking cell the ollanin who murmured but spoke not the divine one had them taken from him and sealed into their rooms for two days thy ollanin saw not the sun nor the moons for two days thy ollanin drank only water for two days thy ollanin tasted not bread nor meat risingfalling moan filled with fear and rage sim o kisil sim sen the divine one spake unto your ollanin thus it has come to me that the merm beds and the rosepearls are a state resource it has come to me that it may be wrong for such a resource to remain in the hands of families not the state be warned o kisil thus the divine one spake i will cease my wondering for this moment i will not act as my heart requires if i am not stirred to it by thy unruly importunities sim o kisil sim sen and then it was that the divine one cast at the feet of thy ollanin the two of them whose hearts had rebelled and then it was the divine one spake again take these and let me not see them let me not hear their names let them be as nothing in my sight and thine sim o kisil sim sen thy ollanin have come to thee in sorrow ashes in their hair and heart thy ollanin say to thee we have failed thee what is thy will the stentor folded his arms and stepped back robes pulled tight about them cowls drooping over halfhidden faces the ollanin started down the stairs when they reached the pavement the crowd in the circle silent impassive gave way before them opening a corridor so they could cross the circle and pass into the fekkri they didnt wait for an answer they wouldnt get it then that was coming three days later karrel goza and geres duvvar wouldnt bother coming back to hear it at least the city ollanin had tried to help that was more than the fehdaz had done he was old and sick and about to die his sons had died before him there were rumors about that how they died and why incers were very nervous about the character of the next fehdaz his grandsons and the nephew were all there waiting like vultures no one in the place bothering their heads about anything else karrel goza counted the coins in his hand closed them in his fist gidders should be open by now what about a beer geres duvvar slipped his watch from its pocket clicked it open do we have time old niffiz is getting touchy about checking in he shut the watch shoved it back hes immel hes got a thing about us in gozaduvvarmemeli you dont want to give him an excuse to boot us not the way things are these days may he fall in yunkshit up to his honker karrel goza put the coins away lets get back that wormy old skink wont give an inch ayla gul inciwaterfrontone year and six months after the return of the petitioners the bay was gray and leaden an echo of karrel gozas mood he took out the notice reread the single line of print his head throbbing with resentment and fear his body cold and sick with the horrible emptiness of failure he tore the paper into small hairy pieces and dropped them into the water one breath he was angry at geres duvvar for holding onto his job with sirgыn the next he was dead ash wondering how he was going to tell the ommar he was a drag on the family not a support out on the bay he saw boats coming in he straightened stared hed played in these waters when he was a baby when he was older hed taken girls out sailing if he could talk a cousin into lending him a boat he knew enough of the seas caprices and her moods to understand what he was seeing there was a bad blow coming he watched the gray waters heave beneath the pier and hated her mother of storms treacherous unfeeling bitch stealing from him his last respite from shame he had to get back to the house and help tie down for it no time to get a little drunk to pillow the pain he cursed softly bitterly cursed sirgыn and the huvved the kabriks and their obsession with new products the mushbrained imperator and his mushbrained advisors the fehrazes and the fehdazes the city council the sneaks and most of all the alien slaves who made all this trouble for workers they are that a girls voice he swung around what you heard what happened you laid off he looked her over she was small and dark brilliant eyes not exactly pretty but coming into a room shed be the first you noticed the fine wandering scarlines on her arms were very white against the dark gold of her tan a dalliss no one ever completely tamed a dalliss even when her diving days were finished his mouth curled down with dislike but he touched eyes and mouth and spread his hands in polite acknowledgment of her presence blessings dalliss he turned and started past her oh my the little mans soul is bruised she closed her fingers about his arm said youre a pilot i need a pilot for what disgusted with the leap of hope he couldnt help he pulled free storm coming im going home couple hours before you need to start tying down stop a while and give me a listen you might like what im going to say she stepped back from him swung herself onto a bitt and sat kicking her bare heels against the agatewood watching him with a hard bright expectation that sent warning tremors along his spine he lowered himself to the planks and sat with his legs hanging over the edge his back against another bitt job not for taking home to ommar we could come up with some coin if youve got to have it she swept her arms wide waggled her small slim hands as if to say you can have what you want it doesnt matter long as you do the thing whatever the thing was she had beautiful hands he noticed that with a small jolt of surprise delicate supple wrists and fine ankles like a lot of women these days shed taken to wearing trouserskirts widelegged things made out of the new yosscloth its silky flow clinging to her legs in a way he found exciting the top she wore was a tube knitted from black kes yarn it had a square neck no sleeves she wanted to display her arms with their scars the badge of her achievement used to be pearlers wore long sleeves and lace mits to hide the merm marks not this one he found himself approving her pride he looked away frowned out across the heaving water just tell me what it is remember jamber fausse he started went still why show you i know a thing or two you lifted him south after he hit the fehraz ene karrads strongroom and dropped half the coin to the kiks that karrad pushed off his raz youve been a busy little man the past few months the cold was back in his bones he stared at the water and said nothing no need to sit there shivering like an ishtok out of water karrel goza this isnt a noose about your neck if you dont want to fly for us forget it he turned his head she was leaning toward him hands braced on her knees taut eager willing him to accept the proposition she hadnt yet made he was interested it would be immensely satisfying to hit back at something instead of going meekly home to mama same sort of business not quite this could get you killed the pilot we had before is in saaders cleft no the bitbits didnt drop him there he died we didnt want some asslicking official eager to make points getting curious about how that happened he was shot bad but he got us away and the ship home before he died her eyes were suddenly bright with tears he was impatiently she scrubbed the tears away could happen to you so youre the ones what youre the ones that hung the nephew naked from the minaret painted insults on him hair to heels i wondered how someone got him there without being caught you fixed him up in his paint and harness i suppose and waited until ruya and gorruya were down then you dropped the noose over the roofpeak and left him dangling ktch your pilot mustve had pradixs hand on his neck to operate blind in that battlerose of winds he did besides there isnt a man alive or dead who can match his touch wish id seen it geres duvvar was home he told me about it he said the fehdaz was howling mad not that he liked the nephew that much it was the idea that some hordar would have the nerve to lay hands on one of his family on one of the holy huvved ktch herk the jerk yeh he wanted to top every hordar he could get his hands on but his sech talked him out of it old grouch id have thought hed be sharpening his ax for hordar necks hes scared of a surge youve been away a lot i dont think you really know how bad things are getting hmm so what are you plotting now she scratched at her forearm rubbed a bare foot against the bitt herky jerkys been hatching ideas again three months hes had his hands on the daz he keeps thinking that ought to mean something but every time he has a flash old grouch digs the ground out from under him i suppose hes tired of it from what we could find out he maneuvered so the grouch had to go to gilisim gillin to talk to the grand sech soon as the old mans back was turned herk snatched some farm boys whod come in to gul inci to visit relatives and carted them off somewhere who knows why probably something to do with merm beds and rosepearls doesnt matter what maggot he has in his head weve got to pull them out it was just luck really finding out what happened to them a friend of mine was over the wall meeting me we saw the bitbits make a snatch we were too far away to stop it but we managed to follow them to where a miniship was moored they shoved the boy in the gondola and left we thought about trying to get him out but there were more bitbits around guarding the airship no way we could reach it next day some other friends of mine managed to find out who was gone and where they might be some others and me were going in after them but we need a pilot thats it thats what we want you for in where mountain place ive flown out of inci in that direction not over the place the winds there are tricky its the steam out of the crater that does it fehdazs pilots know the currents even so they pick their way and go in round noon when thingsre quieter whats your ship like a mini she grinned at him used to belong to herk hmm the instruments crude and crudest thats how muhar teget described them i didnt know he was still alive hes not hes the one in the cleft he gazed at her a long time then looked away get me fired no you followed me here yes i was going to see if you were off for a few days and might be able to fly for us muh said after him you were the best on tairanna she combed her hands through her hair spread them again waved them she seemed to like waving her hands about maybe someone told her sometime they looked like little white birds pushing my luck she said she dropped her hands into her lap laced her fingers together i saw you shred that paper and made a guess thats all you know my name ah her mouth twisted into a halfsmile thats a bit of a difficulty she searched his face for a moment then shrugged why not grouch knows me well enough he doesnt need a name elmas ofka family indizofkatanggаr farm indiz she hesitated shrugged again divorced outlawed hed half suspected who she was but it was a shock all the same elmas ofka they said she killed a huvved who thought he was going to rape her sank a knife in his belly and opened him up like a yunk carcass hed always thought that was somebodys dream that she probably stole some pearls or sassed a touchy tributecollector every now and then the huvveds got antsy and took hunting parties out searching for her but they never saw hair nor heels of her so they shot a few erkelte and pretended that was what they were out for youre crazy to be here in daylight like this crazy has its advantages he laughed he didnt quite know why at least it seems to be working he rubbed thumb against middle finger not sure what to say next ah who else is coming my isya cousins some friends women that bother you not if you know what youre doing we know tonight right herks had them three days already she was silent a moment one of thems my brother ah sorry her mouth tightened they will be one of these days well hang herky jerky from the minaret and we wont use a harness i need a little time to get used to the ship you know the bay better than i do what about the storm by the time we leave it should be mostly blown out enough rags left to give us cover at mountain place any of the sentries supposed to be on the walls theyll more than likely be inside with a fire no ones going to be miserable for herk the jerk if there are some mushbrains outside we wont have any problem spotting them she hesitated made up her mind between one breath and the next some aliens are living with us they jumped the wall at the palace and happened onto us at a delicate moment her hands fluttered sketching metaphors for the embarrassment of both parties when she noticed the expression on his face she smiled and shook her head they wont be coming with us she folded her hands again one of them was the imperators own weaponsmith strange creature he doesnt like people much and i got spanked for that kind of language when i was a girl so i wont try telling you what he thinks of our esteemed divine one hes been making gadgets for us stunners and spotters you could wear in a ring almost sniperguns she narrowed her eyes at the sea then the sky chewed her lip a moment you can get away without eyes on you yes when and where you know the dance floor in the watergarden out north of inci been there a time or two he tried a quick grin she grinned back her eyes narrowing into crescents her nose flattening i expect you have she sobered ill bring the ship down an hour after midnight give or take five minutes each way i can manage that much theres room for mistakes out there we need to be at the mountain place around three hours before dawn will that give you enough play to get the feel of her before we start too much if i cant learn her in twenty minutes i might as well give up make it second hour unless youve got a reason otherwise seconds better but i wanted to make sure you had plenty of time for test runs she slipped off the bitt stretched yawned anything else what you expect me to do besides flying nothing you wont be coming in with us youre the only one who can get us away from there good enough see you tonight then a flutter of a hand and she was running away down the pier her vitality printing her on his mind even after she vanished into an alley between two warehouses he smiled he felt a lot better now he couldnt tell anyone about this but it went a long way toward erasing the sense of failure thatd been the worst effect of the layoff notice his dread was gone he could face the ommar without feeling like a lump of yunkshit the wind was picking up two fat raindrops splashed down on his head trickled past his ears home and fast from the look of those clouds and the height of the swells theyd need all hands to get ready to ride this one out another raindrop broke on his nose he wiped it away and started running toward the alley approaching the dance floorwatergardens outside ayla gul inciboth moons down like crawling through a room lined with black felt tezzi ofka braced herself on her arms leaned forward until her nose touched the curving window um elmas ofka scowled at the trembling lines scattered across the panel in front of her trying to balance the ship in half a dozen directions and get somewhere at the same time took most of her attention the storm didnt help blessings be the winds had died to a whisper shed flown the miniship a few times before mostly in daylight though and tethered so shed be able to manage it in an emergency she hadnt realized how tricky this short jump was going to be thank god karrel goza gave her the extra hour it would have been easier for him to come to the place where theyd stowed the ship but she wasnt about to trust him that much not yet anyway he probably realized she didnt he wasnt stupid though it was hard to remember that when he put on his dumb hardboy look good camouflage i hope tez any sign of those lights not yet you sure were heading the right way sssa half maybe keep looking around mm they droned on for several minutes then a sudden gust of wind caught the small airsack and rocked it perilously elmas ofka fought the miniship straight exploded out the breath she was holding tez turn a little left i thought i saw something when we were tumbling about elmas ofka eased the nose around bit her lip as she felt the gondola tremble in the swirl of winds that grew stronger as she got closer to the water two faint greenish spots swam past some distance in front of her she tried to stop the turn overcorrected overcorrected again went toward the lights in a series of diminishing arcs elli im getting airsick dont talk so much she ran the pump that sucked air into the ballast sacs the ship sank steadied as the added weight helped the motors hold against the erratic push of the wind a moment later it lurched nosed down as it hit a powerful downdraft she swore fervently and vented the air shed just pumped in elliiii i didnt know you knew those words shut up tez sssaaa i cant see the lights slid inexorably beneath her she pumped in more air shifted the stabilizers so she was edging downward then swung carefully around tez get ready to drop the ropes she fumbled over the switches finally got the hover configuration right swore again as she saw she was several meters away from where she wanted to be this is as good as it gets toss the marker tez then let the ropes go the gondola rocked as tezzi moved from side to side shuddered as the hatches opened the weighted glowglobe whirled away caught by a gust whose fringes reached the miniship a moment later and started it tottering elmas ofka chewed on her lip drummed her fingers on the chair arms waiting as long as she dared before she did anything the ship jerked steadied she started breathing again drop the ladders tez she left the chair and went to help balance the gondola as dark figures began swarming up the ladders karrel goza was first up he came in with a quick neat twist of his body and went without a word to the cockpit settling himself at the controls and began running his fingers over them touching the switches but changing nothing for the moment if you can recruit him theres a flyer working for sirgыn bol muhar teget said names karrel goza hes a natural if he manages to get as old as me he might just be better than me a natural she thought yes muh was right she relaxed some more some have the gift muh said lots dont youve got one diving it is flying itll never be some folk can get along quite well without any special talent for what they want to do if theyre willing to work their asses off and never stop training dont you put down the ones who go that route sometimes they do a helluva lot more than the naturals theres the drive you see without the drive even the best dont go far the one weakness theyve got though they dont adapt fast to radical new situations you need that kind of thing in what you and your isyas are doing when you have to replace me no no gengen a stroke or a bullet one of ems going to get me and let me tell you id rather the bullet what was i saying ah yes when you replace me make sure your pilot is one of the naturals theres too much that can go wrong too fast for the other kind you want inspiration rather than intelligence when theres no time for thinking harli tanggаr swung in threw elmas ofka a salute and a broad grin and began reeling up the ladders elmas moved forward all up she murmured run through this for me let me take us out over the bay first weve been here too long already she slid into the cos seat tez signal them cast off the miniship leaped free began drifting sideways elmas ofka worked uncertainly through the configuration shift vented air too slowly at first then too suddenly swore under her breath at her clumsiness as she changed settings she explained what she was doing in a rapid halfdistracted murmur all too aware of his eyes on her she loathed doing things badly where people could see it especially men when they were at last out over the water and there was nothing for miles around to threaten the miniship she sat back with a sigh and let it drift you want to ask questions or do i give you the lecture muhar teget pounded into me he set a forefinger on a switch i touch you name it all right why not for the next twenty some minutes he worked with her gaining skill with a speed that astonished her shed been told by more than muh that he was good too good for the stodgy hauls sirgыn was giving him it looked like her informants werent exaggerating before she thought she said why in forty hells did those godlost execs lay you off he laughed it was a pleasant rumbling sound deeper than his speaking voice ill take that as a compliment her face burned prophets blessing it was dark up there except for the faint glow from the instruments it was so meant she said yeh trouble is i never took the time to spread the old oil around but flying being good is a frill on most hauls adequate does just fine adequate gets you killed down deep he blinked raised his brows if old pittipat in gilisim gets serious about taking title to your merm beds hell fetch in slaves that can whomp him up a minisub or something like it before you can say spit elmas ofka think about it a minute while i get set up here he worked in silence for a short while tapping in the course then he swung his chair round to face her youve kept hold of those beds up to now because no one can get at them but a dalliss how long do you think thats going to last he touched the nearest switch let his hand drop onto the chair arm he was serious frowning seemed to be groping for a connection between the two of them his words came in quick spurts with long pauses between them muhar said crude and crudest hes right you ever been up front in a longhauler theres stuff in there stuff no one was dreaming of just a few years ago when i was in school look at me im what one year two not that much older than you i tell you elmas ofka what with the skills the slaves bring in from outside and the fiddling the mechs do in their offtime well the ships are smarter than some of the pilots these days she stared at the blackness outside and at her face mirrored like a distorted ghost in the curving glass herk the jerk she said softly but why boys they dont know anything he pinched his nose dropped his hands onto his thighs his thumbs were twitching maybe he thinks they do but everyone knows its the ommars and the dallisses who control the beds he shifted restlessly crossed his legs everyone in inci he said everyone in any city with a sea farm handy yeh youre probably right about them he managed a kind of allover shrug he was a smallish man his body limber and relaxed as a sleepy cat she got glimpses now and then of another kind of person inside mostly though he kept everyone away from that man things get shuffled around a bit differently in different places you ever hear huvveds talking about women i heard one talking to a woman once a hordar woman she could see him remembering the stories about her and feeling like a fool then deciding that a continued ignorance would be the most tactful face he could put on what im saying is herk spent most of his time in gilisim thats inland on the lake freshwater no merm beds there and since hes been back whos he talked to ollanin and kabriks all men and whos he got close to him other huvveds all men and knowing our beloved leader do you think hes going to bother asking anyone about how hordar run their lives see what i mean of all the stupid arrogant thats our herk she settled to a simmering brood while karrel goza put his feet up tilted the chair back and dozed as the miniship droned on toward the mountain place the winds around the fehdazs mountain place were clawing at each other and coiling into knots while an icy rain hammered verticals and horizontals alike karrel goza tried sliding from one current to another fighting to get close enough to the hold to let the women down inside the walls the rain blinded him the winds knocked him away again and again driving him toward the ground skidding him toward the walls and the threehundredfoot cliff behind the hold coming close to flipping him end for end he backed off climbed into a region of comparative peace shes a sweet ship he said tougher than i thought plenty of power but she is little not enough weight another thing that lightning if were struck goodnight all i dont know elmas ofka frowned at the clock on the panel looked over his shoulder at the silent women sitting on the floor behind her we can wait maybe half an hour maybe threequarters if we really push it some of us have to be back in our beds before sunup lets see if the storm will calm enough to let you take us in he nodded even a half hour could make a big difference he reached under the chair and lifted up the shoulderbag hed brought with him took out a mass of knitting and settled it on his lap hands busy eyes flicking back and forth between the needles and the panel his face intent he knitted steadily the warm brown wool dancing through his fingers she watched him fascinated by this stranger who without intending it was showing her just how little she knew about her own kin and landfolk everywhere it was disturbing it was challenging it was infuriating because she knew all too well that she couldnt do a thing about the forces that kept her pinned where she was mostly she was too busy to fret about her limitations she had other things on her mind now there was nothing to do but think and she didnt much like what she was thinking even when she was still indiz farms premiere dalliss her life was circumscribed by her talent and her duties and everything her family expected of her she fidgeted wishing she had something to keep her hands and her mind busy he knew he was going to wait maybe an hour for us damn him hes set why didnt i get ready for a delay sssa woman youve got to do better forethought ommar ayrinti beats her finger in the air forethought saves aftertrouble if youd just think before you stepped in something elli just take a meesly second and think a little ay girl the gnarly forefinger like a bit of dried floatstem beat beat beating at the air before her face sssaa she moved her shoulders impatiently swung her chair around so she wouldnt have to look at the man pulled her legs up and settled herself to doze away the wait if she could half an hour later the winds were still gusting but the worst of the knots were teased out and the rain had diminished to a few spatters karrel goza took the miniship in a ragged spiral about the largest structure inside the walls brought her low and hovered her over an open stretch in the kitchen garden elmas ofka knelt by a hatch swept the spotter in a wide circle slipped it back in the case snapped to her belt no guards she said pitching her voice so she could be heard above the thrum of the motors the whine of the wind harli tanggаr lirrit ofka go she watched them slide down ladders that twisted and bucked with them and went streaming away at an angle when they dropped free they landed in rows of hanannas and moved quickly into the shelter of tall groaning beanpoles melly birah hessah indiz go she counted a dozen breaths watched them jump free when they were more than a manheight from the ground they landed on the trampled hanannas and ran for the hedge that circled the garden they went to their stomachs behind coldframes there merging with the inky shadows binna tanggаr jirsy indiz go she turned her head see you karrel goza our turn tez she tipped through the hatch caught the ladder and began dropping the ropes whipped through her gloved hands the wooden rungs slammed into her knees her breasts her face by the time she reached the ground she felt like shed been beaten with rods her isyas came out of the shadows and drifted around her shadows themselves knitted hoods over all but eyes black gloves on hands narrow black trousers knitted tops that clung like tight black skins they were armed with deadly little darters the weaponsmith made for them and cutters that went through metal like a wire through cheese braided leather straps that came away from their belts with a quick jerk daggers thin and sharp as a wicked thought and broader allpurpose knives at the kitchen door she looked over her shoulder at them and was filled with pride she pulled her hood away from her mouth flashed them a grin then waved harli tanggаr up to deal with the door elmas ofka checked the sketch toma indiz drew for her it was hard to make out even with the pinlight held close to the crumpled paper the lines were shaky and pale left from the kitchen done that two turns door probably locked could be barred from the inside theyd taken care of that no resistance at all as the cutter sliced through the locks bolt bit of leather folded up and shoved under the door to hold it shut because it had a tendency to swing open and they didnt want to attract the attention of any insomniacs who got a notion to ramble you want to watch out for those elli they can wreck the best plan there is scared the shit out of me when i was busting out prophet bless he was as scared of me and a lot less ready and i tunked him on the head before he could yell left again keep going past five doors stop at the fifth there should be a sharp curve ahead round that curve the corridor splits into three branches if herks just holding the boys until a ship leaves for tassalga theyll be in a tank at the end of the right arm there see where i drew the circle if he had them under question and is finished with them and theyre still alive then theyll be in the infirmary thats here along the middle way cells here and here treatment room there if hes still working on them go left and down keep going down the question chambers are deep enough so herks guests if he ever has any cant hear the screams theres a sentry on each level at least there was when old grouch was working on me i doubt little herk has changed things much you have to take them out you dont want them there when youre leaving youre apt to be in a hurry and maybe carrying one or more of the boys first though everything past that curve is being monitored camera eye in the ceiling the guards are watching the screens down in the anteroom to the question chamber you cant get at them without passing the pickup so youll have to take it out one thing youve got going for you the wiring in that place is hopeless things are always shorting out theres a good chance the guards wont bother trying to fix the system before morning she touched lirrit ofkas arm the isya nodded dropped to her stomach close to the wall she extended a collapsible tube painted black eased it around the bend put her eye to the viewer she lifted her head wriggled forward a few spans looked again repeated the process until all elmas ofka could see of her were feet in the soft black mocs with a gray dust smear like a crayon rubbing on the soles footprints clinging to the bottom of her feet lirrit ofka rolled over there was a faint hum a tinkle she rolled back crept forward again her feet vanishing for several seconds there was a tense silence broken only by the near inaudible rub of cloth against stone then even that stopped then the isya came trotting back she grinned gave them a thumb salute keeping her voice low but not bothering to whisper she said there was just the one i spotted the guard took him out dart this time you hear it uhuh how fast got him in the neck i think he thought a bug had bit him he started to raise his hand poop down he went alert nah leaning against the wall half asleep i see she thought a minute we wont change plans question chamber first the other cells on our way back any objections good lets go elmas ofka and her isyas took out the drowsy sentries as they came on them with as little trouble as lirrit had with the first they left the men propped against a wall as if they slept sitting with their weapons beside them down and down the women went through latched but not locked doors running silent as hunting cats through the dimly lit corridors and down the spiraling stair flights empty corridors not even a rat prowling them let alone an insomniac the door into the lowest level was locked and barred elmas ofka waved the others back swung the spotter in a wide arc watching the bright green line that trembled across the readout the walls were thick stone nceegh had warned her she couldnt fully trust the sensors if that stone had traces of metal and most of the stone the old fathers used was like that the line wobbled in one place but she didnt know if that was her hand or a sign she swung the spotter back held it still where shed seen the tremble after a moment she was sure she was seeing a spike she moved the sensor array a hair to the left another spike she counted four spikes and a wiggle that might have been another or a rat in the wall she thumbed off the spotter and slid it away four she said maybe another off that way she pointed hri cousin you and lri cousin be ready to jump soons we get the door open ti cousin you and may cousin and hay cousin back them up ji cousin handle the cutting then you and bi cousin stand watch out here questions right lets move the two isyas ran down curving stairs their mocs scuffing minimally on the stone they took the last four steps in a flying leap landed braced on the stone flags of the chamber floor darters snapping up four men sat at a battered table playing cards and drinking from a skin they passed around they looked sleepy bored uninterested in anything even the money riding on the outcome of the game the eyes on the man facing the foot of the stairs went wide and he opened his mouth to yell as he shoved his chair back and started to dive away harli tanggаr put a dart in his cheek another in his arm and shot the man at the left end of the table as lirrit ofka took out the other two while elmas ofka walked to the table to inspect the dead and make sure they werent shamming the other three isyas ran silently from cell to cell opening each grillwicket and shining a light inside ondar tez ofka called her voice low and angry come here please melly birah was on her knees by the lock using the cutter carefully its lightblade angled toward the ceiling so she wouldnt inadvertently slice into the occupant of that cell she finished as elmas ofka reached them got to her feet and pulled the door open the boy sleeping heavily on the chainbraced plank moaned and twitched but didnt wake elmas ofka shone her light on his face sucked in a breath let it trickle out too shocked to say anything his nose was broken his face bruised and swollen there was something wrong with one eye the lid sagged inward he was breathing through his mouth so she could see that a number of his teeth were missing with a secret guilty relief she knew it wasnt her brother she leaned closer tried to fit the battered features into a shape she knew all the boys whod vanished were her brothers friends shed seen them with him more than once angrily she shook her head straightened and stepped back who hessah indiz pushed past her knelt beside the bed fazil she said its fazil birah we were going to elmas ofka frowned nodded see if you can wake him isya weve got to locate the others she moved out of the cell any more here lirrit ofka scraped her moc across the filthy floor harli tanggаr fidgeted and wouldnt look at elmas ofka the other isyas stood with their hands behind them eyes shifting toward and away from a cell near the stairs tezzi ofka came from behind the door ondar elmas ofka stiffened for a moment she stood very still then she ran past tezzi into the cell she pulled up gulping as her stomach convulsed at what she saw bodies stacked on the floor like firewood bodies so torn and battered they werent even butchers meat she moved the light over the faces visible stopped it on one her hand trembled tangus she whispered tangus indiz tezzis hand closed on her shoulder tugged at her ondar fazil birahs awake he wants you elmas ofka shuddered she wanted to scream she wanted to swing round clawing and kicking she squeezed her eyes shut and willed herself calm feeling brittle as a sheet of sugar candy she turned with slow care and walked out of the cell without really seeing the door or tezzi ofka or anything fingers just touching the wall needing the contact with stone and wood to keep in mind where she was and what she had to do she moved toward the first cell tangus indiz was her baby brother shed raised him from the time he was weaned taking care of the youngers was one of her jobs before she went to diving of all the toddlers she bathed and clothed cuddled and taught he was her favorite a fey baby happy terribly bright with the accent on terrible too full of jagged energies to fit comfortably inside the settled outlines of farm life shed felt the kindship of his spirit which was more to her than the kinship of the blood and bled for him as time passed and took him out of her hands she was a diver and gifted enough to know she was going to be dalliss with all the freedom that meant her energies were funneled that way she didnt have to fight to breathe he did he had a dozen talents but none of them seized hold of him like diving did her he drifted and used his energy on mischiefs things that were giggles at first puncturing pomposities to the general applause of the middlers in school or early apprenticeship he was punished pomposities dont appreciate needles clever or not or those who use them and generally have the power to enforce their disapproval except for elmas ofka and a few others the middlers who laughed at his antics and urged him on left him dangling when he was caught the past year shed seen him turn bitter and his fancies take on malicious overtones she worried about him she couldnt reach him anymore he wouldnt listen to her no more worries now tears stung her eyes no i wont cry not here not now she stopped walking closed her eyes and fought herself calm again then moved into the cell with fazil birah and knelt beside the plank the collapsed eye was still shut sealed with blood and mucus but the other eye was open and filled with pain and triumph herk he i know well hang the bastard for this his mouth stretched in a shaky gaping grin fazi whatd he want whyd he grab you rozh earlz wwere he wanted to know where the beds are yyeh din know wwe cuunt tell him he didnt know he shouldve taken women nu no wwe dint ttell him tan tangz curse him wwunt tell him nothin he was breathing hard growing visibly weaker when he tried to speak again elmas ofka shushed him ive got it she said tangus cursed him wouldnt tell him spit none of you told him anything look fazi the isya is going to give you something so we can get you out of here he stirred agitated a broken hand clawed at her arm no he managed lea me nzide buzted he closed his eye his mouth moved he said something she couldnt hear it had to bend down until her ear brushed his lips kill me she pushed away from him pressed her fingers to her eyes after a moment she sighed nodded yes she unclipped her darter thou my brother thou my lover may thy return be in happier times she shot him sighed again and got to her feet hessah indiz was trembling her eyes glazed elmas ofka wrapped her arms about her isya held her tight until she stopped shaking then she stepped back lets get out of here after a quick look at elmas ofka karrel goza busied himself with the controls holding the miniship level in spite of the erratic winds bouncing off the cliff as soon as all the isyas were climbing the ladders he began venting air taking the ship gradually higher until they were inside and the hatches were closed then he sent the ship angling steeply upward where he caught a tail wind and went whipping back toward gul inci the sky was clearing rapidly starsprays newly brilliant in the rainwashed air touched the seaswells below with subtle grays elmas ofka watched the wrinkled water pass beneath them until she saw the shore approaching she glanced at karrel goza he was catquiet again knitting steadily at a sleeve he had a gift for silence she hadnt appreciated it before but it worked to ease the pain in her they were dead all but one and he was dying ah you were right herk didnt know and he still doesnt mmh the boy said they didnt tell him i dont know you going to warn the families not me how can i someone will ill see to that going after herk she sat rubbing her hands back and forth along the chairarms her eyes fixed on his face yes she said finally you in yes she nodded its time to do something hell be expecting it herky jerky never whod dare whatd you do with the guards dead thought so then hes got a pile of dead men inside his palace and a litter of footprints in his veggies might be enough to shake some sense into him doesnt matter well just have to be cleverer you know what worries me most ive a suspicion the sech yeh we all better keep our heads down while hes nosing around your brother being in it hell be after the indiz and the families of the other boys um sorry i didnt think about this before your footprints theyll be too small for men the grouch hell probably bounce the dallisses around all the divers she smiled weve been doing this a while karrel goza things being the way they are it doesnt matter that much about me the sech will have more than a suspicion who ran the raid still no use presenting him with proof so he can make trouble for the others we took care of that little problem before we called you back sorry about that we appreciate the thought dance ground coming up a couple minutes she looked at the clock we made better time than i thought tailwind she smiled at him it felt good to smile again the tight thing in her chest was beginning to open up good pilot is more like it could be he grinned back at her you can give us a little extra time sure put windskimmer to bed for us windskimmer her name nice sssaa you nah i mean it things i was flying had names like fud and kek you cant do much with fud he reached for the panel wait we usually dont land where we took off theres an old wharf out east of inci no one uses it any more let the isyas down there gotcha id better make a wide sweep round dont want to wake the nightwatch yes she swung the chair around in the dim gray light she saw her isyas sitting with their knees drawn up arms crossed on them looking very different now theyd changed from their blacks and were back in blouses and skirts and sandals there was nothing on them to show where theyd been or what theyd been doing tomorrow evening she said those of you who can come to yuryur beach unless theres trouble ill meet you we need to say avvedas for our boys say them in your soul if you cant be with us as i might have to do if i cant be with you i will be thinking of you all my blessings my sisters forget herk until the avvedas are said then my sisters my loves think how we can pay him without destroying our families my blood is cold my sisters my blood is ice he will not live to boast what he has done there is no hurry to it there is no urgency in it there is certainty beyond all question herk will pay it may take years but herk will pay vii three months std after the meeting on telffer helvetia it took the usual day and a half to work through the helvetian perimeter fortifications and stash slancy orza in the parking grid there was also the usual argument over leaving kinok and the current kahat on board but everyone knew the idiosyncrasies of the sikkul paems so the objections were perfunctory i bought an exception permit and that was the end of that getting onto helvetias surface is tedious tiring and at times humiliating but nobody complains in a chaotic universe where currencies are wildly various and often of dubious value helvetia offers a means of assessing and balancing values plus the register circuit for contracts and other services no single government or group of governments can provide access to helvetia is sometimes vital and at all times useful to anyone trying to trade beyond the borders of hisher local hegemony if you want helvetian services you play by helvetian rules whistling snatches of songs id picked up here and there a habit of mine that kumari never appreciated but she wasnt there at the moment i ran through slancys defenses making sure she was thoroughly buttoned up before i left her even with helvetian security watching the grid and kinok nesting down in the driveroom i wasnt going to underestimate the talents of the types bolodo could afford to hire especially after watching adelaar work over those defenses on the way here like most of us she found insplitting a complete bore and preferred to have something to occupy her so she was paying part of her fee ahead of time what i was getting at after watching her i wasnt as happy as i wanted to be anybody with her talent could peel my poor slancy like an overripe orange given time which i hoped security wouldnt give them so having gone completely round the circle there i was playing with what id got i was finishing up when adelaar came onto the bridge i looked over my shoulder and smiled when i saw the rapier shed buckled on no fancy ornament it had a used and useful look youre well prepared i said ive been here before she touched the bone hilt of the sword and had to use this before helvetian rules no weapons except knives or swords allowed downsurface they catch you with a gun a lightlance whatever youre fined and its no fleabite they catch you again and you go to work on one of the farms or in the mines never heard they caught anyone three times result of all this is its a dueling society the little daytime clerks become nighttime rogues and swaggerers living out byzantine fantasies with an edge of real danger to them outside the trucegrounds youd better hire a bodyguard or be able to defend yourself the faceless seven who run the place refuse responsibility for anything that happens to idiots who should know better colorful place i rather enjoy my visits here they take me back to my first body when i was earning my living with a twohanded broadsword my daddy gave me actually he made it for the local lords braindead whelp but when i had to hit the hills to keep my neck in one piece he booted my backside for old times sake and gave me the sword to remember him by which is by way of explaining that the sword i take downsurface is a twohanded broadsword with a poraini stressed crystal edge bonded onto the lightweight byttersteel alloy not that im challenged much these days after i acquired this body and slancy and had been trading in this and that for a year or so time came i had business on helvetia i knew how things worked there so i went to an acquaintance who was a metalsmith in his spare time with highly irregular access to some very special alloys and had him make most of harska i named her harska after an old old sometime friend i did the bonding myself a little trick i picked up from the rmoahl and i fixed up a sheath that could hold her so i wouldnt slice my butt off if i had to do some dodging that was kumaris first trip with me and we went out celebrating after we finished business when shes dressed for playtime shes beautiful in her eerie way shes got no more figure than a teener boy but what there is of her is elegant some local hotshot decided he was the answer to her dreams and wouldnt back off when she informed him she wasnt interested so she told him in a voice that cut like harskas edge that he had the intelligence of a sea slug that she wouldnt be interested in him or any other man since she belonged to another species and was neuter besides and even if she werent he smelled bad i wasnt going to interfere id seen her in action a couple of times with the dozen or more small knives she has tucked away here and there about her body she was willing and more than able to handle that character herself though she looked fragile as thistledown but he wouldnt have it that way probably didnt suit his selfimage he challenged me instead i took his arm off and an ear with it in the first thirty seconds of that duel one of his friends tried to cry foul but there was nothing in the rules about fancy touches like that edge it said sword and sword she was and sword she is kumari came in she raised her brows not dressed yet she meant harska i grinned just making a last gothrough got us on a shuttle twenty minutes on so dont waste time primping the next opening is six hours from now theres a bubble in the lock ready for the transfer ive booked us into an ottotel trucehouse and set up a tentative appointment with onioni tomorrow to get the contract working and settle the escrow ti vnok wants to talk to you tonight if possible he says a shielded room at the treehouse and come blankshield which means pels and i will be there ahead of you working the house if you think its worth the trouble lets see whats waiting first we might have to do some tailcleaning right if pels nose is as sharp as he thinks adelaar clicked her tongue a sharp impatient sound what are you two talking about pels thinks we have ticks on our tail followed us in after we surfaced out beyond the limit i see must have guessed we were heading here and messaged ahead no doubt right kumari take our client to the bubble ill collect pels and my gear and meet you five minutes i swear right kumari drawled the word turning it into a sarcastic comment have you ever noticed aici arash she touched adelaars arm and nudged her toward the exit how much men talk about women dawdling and how long it takes them to get themselves together the shuttle platform was a towertop that looked down on clouds when there were any and south across the great glittering city a city that grew on the edge of an ocean and spread inland to jagged young mountains in the trucegrounds and the business sectors sunlight ran like water along slickery surfaces flickered erratically off shattered diamante walls was thrown in white hot spears from mirror to mirror mirror mirror on the wall whos the costliest city of all mirror mirror everywhere and never a one to look in go blind if you tried the spears going here going there constantly altering direction as the mirrors changed orientation and the sun rode its customary arc across the sky it was a city of light beautiful in its imperious way meant to intimidate the visitors stepping unaware onto the glassedin platform even those whod been there before were affected by it no matter how blasй a face they wore we touched down late in the afternoon when some of the glitter and slide was muted not quite blinding and still it was a breath stealing thing to stand there and look out across it to a sea bluer than blue melding into a misty blue sky down on ground level the light was even more intense shooting past you through you around you dissolving wall and street alike into more light until you began to wonder if anything was real including yourself it was disturbing uncomfortableand very practical among other things it kept streets and walkways clear no matter how many visitors descended on the city scattered haphazardly at all levels from roof to cellar there were small arbors with mossy fountains and cool air rustling through the leaves of lace trees and pungent conifers where shadows flicked across the face of the person sitting across a table from you with the intimacy of a caress the contrast was a killer punch more subtle than a drug and did they know it those buyers and sellers those agents and facilitators who were parasites on the primary business of helvetia those citizens and business agents who lived in the city and on the city year round year on year more contracts were registered from the arbors than in all the offices cabinets bureaus put together we bought visors from a robovender in case we needed to hit the streets dropped to the terminal and fought the swarm at the tube cars until we managed to snag a car bound for the ottotel trucehouse where kumari had booked us in kumari and i kept adelaar sandwiched between us and pels rode rearguard pulling after him a mob of females of every shape and size bipeds tripeds and even a hairy monopod they all seemed to want to catch him up and cuddle him the monopod too which presented an interesting problem in logistics they giggled when he snarled at them a daring octoped with blushing tentacles scratched behind his ear you wouldnt think these were harddriving highpressure businesswomen capable of metaphorically or even actually cutting a rivals throat with zest and panache it must be some pheromone he gives off if you could package it and sell it as perfume youd make a fortune it was as effective as it always was his peculiar defense those females made a fine and fancy shield for the rest of us anyone who had mayhem on his or her or ves or its mind generally backed off from performing in front of that many interested spectators and give this to the faceless seven we didnt have to worry about long distance sniping pels wriggled loose jumped into the car as the doors were sliding shut his growl when i grinned at him was more heartfelt than usual i think its time he had a vacation probably back on mevvyaurrang making triads with arras and maungs he comes back from those visits with his notfur shivering and his eyes glazed and not talking to anyone but his plants for a month or more i signed a question to kumari we assumed everything public was online to the mainbrainhad she seen any unusual interest in us she had a smile for pels but shook her head pels grunted one maybe two he signed in the next module over on this car i didnt like it but i expected it i swung my chair round to face the back of our module in case theyd figured a way to get through it and i waited for the trip to end wed be on truceground when we came out so we could hang around and see who emerged with us stupid planning maybe i exercised a few brain cells running that one round but in a breath or two it was obvious i was counting angels and pinheads so i let it drop maybe pels was wrong but i didnt think that was any too probable like i said before aurrangers are predators and good at it and not all that long ago semicannibals by which i mean one of the ways they kept the population stable was to hunt down and eat any excess raus when they were young and tender and about to hit puberty a few millennia of this and the descendants of those raus who escaped the pot were very very hard to track half a dozen came out of that module more from the third say around thirty bodies altogether but the two we wanted werent hard to spot idiots they were so careful not to look at us not pros no way like the two going after adelaar back on telffer the ones shadow dropped local computer jocks trying to earn points with the head office making sure we went where we told the world we were going they scuttled out of the lobby like startled mice wonder what theyd do if i sneaked after them and yelled boo in their bitty ears mmh kumarid got a sealed four body unit for us which she charged to the clients dicarx when we got inside adelaar didnt comment just marched her gear into her cubby and did her best to slam the door on us its not that easy to work off a snit in an ottotel the doors ooze shut at the same speed whenever theyre pushed or left alone theres nothing much you can break or throw and the walls are padded so beating your head on them doesnt make much sense she wasnt annoyed about having to pay expenses that was part of the deal it was being shut into a tincan for three solid months with the same people that got to her especially kinok arguing with a sikkul paem was an exercise in frustration when ve decided ve didnt want to talk any longer ve shooed kahat away from the translator board and dug ves roots in one of ves earthbeds after that you might as well try arguing with a dill plant which is more or less what ve smelled like slancys workshop was down in ves region and ve insisted on knowing everything that went on in that part of the ship adelaar was furious at ves interference and loathed having ves snooper cells everywhere she went her methods were part of her business assets she said they were emphatically not part of the deal and if i thought they were i was soft in the head kinok wasnt talking when i went round to see him so i told her to set up distorters in the workshop and i stationed pels outside the door to keep our pet paem from barging in on her ve took it well enough ves the only paem ive met who has something resembling a sense of humor which is probably the reason ves lasted so long with us something i didnt tell adelaar and id really rather she didnt find out ve budded off a kahatclone and sneaked the little creature into the shop it pretended it was one of the plants that kept the air fresh i found it a couple of days before we flipped back to realspace and got it out of there kinok just rubbed two of ves coils together to make that squeaky sound ve thinks is laughter and ate the clone which if i understand anything about paem physiology transferred all the clone knew into kinoks own nerve cells after a bath a change of clothes and a reasonably edible meal we met in the parley to decide how we were going to work this situation sealed units are supposed to be free of snoopears but anyone who trusts official noises about such things doesnt last long on helvetia or anywhere else we swung tupple loungers around one of adelaars choicer distorters and stretched out on them for a breath or two no one said anything pels was digging his claws into his chin fur kumari had a dreamy look as if she were contemplating a favorite poem adelaar had lost her frown and was a lot more relaxed than shed been in days prospect of action i suppose sooner or later each of us is going to be challenged i said no adelaar looked like she wanted to start an argument over that but i shook my head at her and wonder of wonders she shut up i knew that sound kri was running on a mix of hunch and logic that was almost never wrong no she repeated not all of us you and adelaar stink too much of setup if they went after all of us theres a limit how far a pro can go it flexes some i doubt that much the seven want to avoid any smell of ambush not good for business and theres no need anyway its your ship swar should they get you wed have to go through all that business of transferring title could take a year or more plenty of time for bolodo to clean up their act and its adelaars daughter without her around to pay the bills bolodo might think wed say hell with it and go on to something else she waved a hand at pels wriggled her fingers in a kind of digital grin us you could replace in half an hour or less pels growled well as far as jobs go i looked at adelaar she lifted a hand let it fall but didnt say anything right i said how good are you with that sword of yours im still alive one challengers dead another cant walk very well i cut a few nerves in his left leg one was pro one wasnt the dead one the pro was middling good it was a business matter hmm bolodo wont be fooling around this time theyll buy the best there is no more amateur talent i thought about that a while if we cant avoid a challenge maybe we can maneuver the ground you up for taking a chance aici arash if theres a point to it she tapped on the pneumatic arm beside her you mean bait them tonight catch em before theyre set and if they dont bite then they dont and we have some fun playing before we get serious sounds good more tiptapping on the soft resilient plastic tiny scratching sounds her nails were pointed and painted with a metallic film that turned them into small knives i wouldnt be all that surprised to learn they had poison packed behind them shed fixed them up that way before we left slancy that was one of the reasons i started thinking it might be a good idea to force the pace what ground she said darkland the rabbid babbit you know it ive been there why that house what about tinzys amberland or some other place amberlands too establishment too many high level execs and bankers in the crowd i want room for some creative cheating those types are either a bunch of halfassed romantics with an inquisitors touch with heretics or a bunch of snobs who want to keep um ah the creative interpretation of rules as an executive privilege not something available to the working slob or us common visitors those fingernails of yours as an example theyre apt to rule them illegal given a protest im sure youd rather keep them as is babbits different as different as the seven allow a lot of duelists base from there she laughed startled into it for the first time she seemed pleased with something i said and thats a recommendation right she thought that over a minute then nodded what works as long as its not flagrant enough to be nailed on right and that gives us an edge me yes you i dont know she laughed again a real laugh bubbling up from her toes i didnt know she had it in her for a minute i almost liked her all right i can go with that one thing though she hesitated then pushed herself up ill give you a signature thatll release the escrow account to you she slipped off the tupple lounge stood with her arms crossed day after tomorrow if youll give me your word youll fetch aslan out even if im killed or put down for a long stretch at the meatshop you got it she waited her eyes on me all right ill spell it out i said whatever happens long as im alive and reasonably intact ill fetch aslan aici adlaar home to university satisfied quite when do you want to leave mmh suns down id rather wait till after midnight things get looser she examined me eyes narrowed black leather with studs lots of studs not leather i grinned synthaskin elasticized better shirt or bare arms white silk billowy to cover possible deficiencies i looked her over imaginary deficiencies right she grinned earrings rings wristbands fake gems wherever theres a place to hang them she touched her forehead pearshape ruby dangling here if it wont bother your moves i can always shuck it before things get serious right hair silvergilt both of us a matched pair two minds with but a single thought kumari she was fizzing and rattling with her kind of laughter i ignored that put off vnok till tomorrow and order us a jit we might as well let whoevers interested know were coming when we came out of our cubbies and struck a pose pels and kumari fell out laughing we left them holding their sides and whooping and droptubed to the lobby where we climbed in the jit wed ordered and took off for the darklands the jit dropped us at the dusky gate city drivers wouldnt go into the darklands for fear of losing their machines no law past that heavy arch only darkland rules which said what you had was yours as long as you could keep it and only that long whatever someone was sly enough quick enough or brutal enough to take belonged to them under the same rules once you made a house though you could rent protection and be reasonably secure from muggers cutpurses and assassins that was a matter of business there had to be an edge of danger but nothing too threatening or the slummers wouldnt come and the game rooms would lose their pigeons the psychodromes would spray their putchemeio dreammist on props not people which meant we were safe from ambush only when we reached the rabbid babbit we walked through the gate mainstreet was wide paved with thin slabs of roughcut stone right now they were wet it must have rained while we were getting ready with puddlets in the chisel gouges shining yellow and red as they reflected the light from the luso torches that lined the sides of mainstreet the torches looked real enough until you noticed they never seemed to burn down the smell of hot tar and burning oil the crackle and snap of the fire the heat they were all there a little too much there tonight i expect the nerp who ran the illusion was high on something and got carried away with the effects the houses were set back a short distance from the street leaving room for sidewalk cafes with tables under markvdomes where anyone interested could watch the action on the street without any danger of that action spilling over on them there was a middling crowd out walking from house to house for the thrill of flirting with thieves and budding duelists and because there was no other way to change houses you walked or you stayed where you were the air was cool and damp though it wasnt raining now the strollers seemed more subdued than i remembered but maybe this was just a more inhibited bunch the body paint on a lacertine group we passed was a mix of earth colors dull reds and grayeddown yellows last time i was here the lacertines had gone for brilliant primaries a slim green back could be like a shout of laughter now those backs were more like smiles subtle smiles that might speak either pleasure or mockery times change and who can read the branches if he hasnt watched them grow adelaar walked half a pace ahead of me no more joking for her made me a little sad shed let an imp show briefly then shooed it home i liked that imp a bit more of her in the woman would improve the mix a lot but i think she was afraid of that side of her and i think she was already regretting the impulse that stuffed her into that costume we went past amberland adelaar glanced at the holofemales of half a dozen species moving through a complex and beautiful melange of half a dozen ancient dances swaying through the air across the front of the house larger than life gaudy garish downanddirty seductive there was a little blonde well i dragged my mind back to where i was and what i was doing i could see adelaar preferred the company in there to mine poor little imp deep inside her never let off its leash we werent going to be friends adelaar and me maybe pleasant acquaintances if we kept off politics there were several shadows drifting after us but they kept back ready to vanish down the nearest alley if either of us took a notion to chase them which made me think they were just making sure where we went it wasnt the crowd in the street that stopped my attack no one in his right mind interfered in a fight not in darklands if you or your party werent involved you got out of there fast no lingering to gawk at the pretty fight we passed several other houses each with its identifying holo crezmir tarkitzdom bullleapers and vodi slayers and antique idols surrealismo hmm indescribable and constantly changing ive never seen that holo repeat itself and its always weird when i have a moment with nothing else to occupy me i wonder about the minds that come up with some of the things ive seen there wildwood tranqworld the rabbid babbit its holo was the same as before a collection of assorted uglys and hairys barbequing a banker over a lusty pile of coals a primfaced character with an immaculate tunic and stovepipe trousers chained to a spit which the ugs and hairs were turning and turning wringing sweat of a sort from him gold coins dropping like rain adelaar made a face at the thing gave me a dark look and pushed through the gate onto the babbitwalk i waved the doorman off and followed her into the house we werent buying protection tonight around three hours later after bar hopping a while and wandering through the drome and sitting through six or seven acts in the music hall we left the hall and started for the casino i was beginning to think those shadows id spotted were either my imagination or a mugger gang enticed by the fake gems we were loaded down with and the dumb getup we were wearing adelaar was looking tired and depressed and uncomfortable if no one took our bait i had a suspicion she was going to make me regret the time we spent trolling it adelaar hit my arm a tap but it stung havent we wasted enough time just about i said there was only a chance theyd bite i suppose it couldve worked she yawned dont mind me i get cranky when im bored the imp peeped out again and she smiled up at me aslans told me that often enough right you want to call a jit to the gate or try a few games first games after tonight we get serious again she raked the headband off here you carry this i dont want to feel as moronic as i look she started stripping off the chains and bracelets and excess rings i stuffed them down my shirt as she handed them to me thats our motto the clients wishes come first it was damn uncomfortable though they were sticky with her sweat and some of those gems had sharp corners we werent paying attention to what was happening around us wed both given up the stalk maybe it was the watched pot thing but about ten seconds into that strip act adelaar was doing with the fake jewelry someone slammed into me spraying grushajuice everywhere it was a mess i was dripping my shirt was sogged against me stinking sweet and slimy adelaar was cursing and using her sleeve to wipe her face as she ignored the attempts of a female duelist to set the challenge going i got my back against a wall fast just in case but the man whod collided with me was intent on doing this the proper way he slapped a glove in the direction of my face called me a mannerless clod and invited me to redress my honor on the dueling ground babbits android guards were there theyd come out of the walls as soon as the mess started stunners ready to make sure babbits version of the rules held fast droid guards dont come under the weapon ban when theyre hired from the city council by respectable home firms to protect the premises a comforting sight they were too i managed a bow of sorts proclaimed my innocence of all malice and inquired if an apology would be acceptable naturally it wasnt so there we were bait taken all we had to do now was win our respective fights and damage our opponents so badly that other duelists would be disinclined to take up the gage no matter what the prize it wasnt going to be a pretty fight not one of the epic duels that songsmiths celebrated but i never had much time for that kind of thing anyway hra trewwa harona he sketched a bow but didnt take his eyes off me he was tall and wiry skin like polished walnut not a hair on his head not even eyelashes one of the cousin races but nothing about him to say which world he whelped on way he moved he was fast and agile swardheld quale i said lugat haza the woman said touched lips and heart and spread her hands palm out she had a shock of bright red hair green eyes and a spray of freckles across a beaky nose another cousin equally anonymous adelaar aici arash adelaar put her hands palm to palm in front of her bobbed her head and shoulders in a quick dip the four of us were standing on the broad oval of the dueling floor the tiered seats outside the lighted area were filling quickly i could hear the sounds of scuffling feet and a growing mutter of conversation it was as if the walls had sucked in the challenge and spat it out in every section of the house enticing to this vault most of those who heard it we were going to have a large and interested audience its what i wanted what id planned to get why i was forcing the fight in here rather than leaving it to chance in a brangle on the street without witnesses anything could happen and the survivors could say what they wanted without contradiction adelaar stepped away and started wrapping the remnants of her shirt around her right arm shed laced up the vest so it didnt flop about her either and twitched her swordbelt round so the rapiers hilt was on her left from what id seen she was ambidextrous with a slight tendency to favor her right hand apparently she was going to start this thing off as a lefter ive had a few skirmishes with lefters and i knew how they can throw you off your pace i relaxed some more and got rid of the soggy shirt leaving the wristlets which werent as flimsy as they looked they wouldnt turn harskas edge but there wasnt much else they couldnt bat aside the house referee came up the ramp and stumped to the center of the oval ordering us to follow him with a sweep of a muscular arm adelaar and i stopped a few paces apart on his left lugat and hra trewwa faced us on his right he was a chunky coldeyed frajjer a long pole in his left paw its end beaten into a knifeedged half circle any flagrant infringement of babbits rules and he took out the offender no recourse his judgment was final there might not be many rules in babbitland but they were serious about those they had when i say final it was sometimes exactly that said offender was cremated the next day he faced adelaar and me you are challenged they say asis you two got the veto so asis thats fine with me del asis she said caveats none i said lugats nose twitched she looked scornful and delighted a mix of expressions that did nothing much for her face she stood shaking her arms lightly beneath the stretch silk you could see her muscles shifting she was sleek and feral as a hunting cat firstblood or final final i said adelaar nodded he looked over his shoulder at the other two agreed agreed hra trewwa said the woman shrugged agreed she said the frajjer waved us apart adelaar and lugat to the left end of the oval trewwa and me to the right he beat the end of his pole against the floor three solemn thumps while he was announcing the terms of engagement hra trewwa took off the long cape he was wearing and stripped out the lining a weighted net shit i hated netmen looks like bolodo did their homework got someone to tell them about the last mixup i had here i slid my lady from her sheath brought her past my head the light catching the crystal edge and making a minor glory of her i handled her as if she had the mass her size suggested rested her blunt end on the floor and stood waiting with both hands closed round her hilt trewwa probably knew she was a slasher not a stabber what i hoped he didnt know was how nimble she was looking at her size and conformation youd think shed be a heller once i got her wound up but shed be slow as a sleepy bumphel trewwa snapped the net open from the way it shimmered it was menavidetin monofilament he flipped it around his neck and let the ends hang while he gave me a cocky grin and began working on his walking stick after a bit of twisting it extended into a twopronged lance not much longer than assegai traditional the points of the prongs glittered in the strong light like bluewhite diamonds double shit i was going to spend most of this dance running like some fieldsport jock after a speed record lugat produced a pair of kduries wrist bands with two chains on each about the length of her arms at the end of the chains were soft lead balls the size of a green peach she spread her fingers the nails glittered adelaar wasnt the only one with a fancy for claws i hoped she knew how to deal with a kduri expert i had a mixup with one a few years back and felt lucky to come out of it with some broken bones and an aching head that femme wrapped a chain around my stunner and jerked it away fast you wouldnt believe how fast she could whirr those things then she got my boot knife broke my right arm and was playing pattacake with my head when i left through a window i didnt bother to open the ref blew his whistle and retreated to the edge of the oval adelaar and lugat circled warily adelaar kept back watching the sweep of the balls reading the kdurins body lugat was gripping the chains about midpoint one emerging between thumb and forefinger other between the last two fingers each hand moved separately the chain loops clinking and burring as they swung the balls whispering round with lazy swishes her arms shifted out and in a cadenced minidance like the sway of a cobra as hypnotic and as potentially lethal without any indication of where the attack would come from adelaar feinted feinted again testing the space about the kdurin with the point of her rapier retreating always before one of the chains could wrap about the sword and pull it from her or sneak around it and break a hand or an arm i held harska angled out before me swaying her a little camouflaging her nimble nature my first sword you swung her a couple times and you went and lay down and breathed hard for a while of course if you knew what you were doing and had reasonable armor once or twice was about all you needed trewwa was as quick as he looked slipping back or sideways with the ease of a man running at you he had the bident in his left hand the net in his right bunched into a thick loose rope which he kept flicking at me face then ankles whipping it away before i could get harska after it he was wary of her edge even with the monofils toughness he darted the bident at me weaving it into the flickretreat of the net testing me trying to read how fast i was and what i knew about netmen and he was maneuvering me closer to lugat this was a doubleduel nothing against one of the partners breaking off his or her fight to help the other adelaar eased closer the lefthand lead balls shot out their chain loops suddenly released she ducked away one sphere whistled over her head the other hit but not solidly it would have cracked her skull if it had it grazed her temple slid off her hair banged into her shoulder catching for an instant on one of the pointed studs on the back of her vest in spite of the dizzy dark that blurred her vision and slurred her mind she took advantage of that brief catch turned the duck into a low attack and managed to carve a piece out of lugats left leg only a deep scratch but it started bleeding sluggishly she dropped flat rolled frantically away before all four of the lead spheres slammed into her she scrambled onto her feet outside the limit of the chains and began prowling once again watching lugat as she drew the chains in and brought the balls to order the net flicked out low no feint this time he was after my ankles if he could get them if i jumped clear hed twitch the net open and have me like a gasping fish which hed skewer on the double prongs of his lance at the same time he beat harska aside with the lancepole hitting her against the flat careful still of her edge instead of jumping clear i brought harska in a quick circle freeing her from the push of the pole continuing the move i jumped into the net falling flat on it pinning it temporarily while i swung harska onehanded at trewwas legs she went through flesh and bone like butter he fell over screaming with rage too angry to feel the pain yet he hadnt expected her to swing that fast and easy id cheated him and he wanted blood for it he hauled back on the bident and tried to puncture me with those diamond points i took his head off and that was that there were a few appreciative hisses and clicking sounds from the watchers but the room was mostly quiet there was still a fight to finish adelaar had an oozing bruise on her brow another on her left shoulder near the joint her left arm was disabled she carried the sword in her right hand now lugat had a deep scratch on one thigh she favored that leg when she moved and there several small bloody rents in the tight stretch silk of her sleeves as i turned around adelaar took advantage of lugats leg drag tossed the sword into her left hand freeing her right got momentarily behind her and close enough to rake her neck with those poison claws she whirled away too fast for lugat to manage a solid hit but collected some more bruises and was staggering by the time she was beyond chain reach lugat went after her but with trewwa down and out adelaar had room enough keep clear until her head was working again lugat stumbled the lead balls seemed to shudder their swings turned erratic she pulled herself together went after adelaar ignoring the rapier ignoring pain and disorientation as the poison took effect the lead balls whirred viciously she caught adelaar in the heel the small of her back slammed one into her side i could almost hear those ribs go as del stumbled over one of trewwas severed legs del threw herself aside and into a shoulder roll on her feet again she turned and ran around across along the oval ignoring broken ribs and other bruises running dodging ignoring grazes as lugat tried to get at her running beyond exhaustion until lugat was gasping and staggering eyes glazed blood trickling from her nose and the corners of her mouth adelaar whipped back a bound a stride a lunge and with beautiful extension she slid the rapier into the kdurins chest a perfect heart kill a burst of applause then sounds of movement the shuffle of feet arguments over who won as bets were settled and the bettors went off to celebrate the entertainment with a drink or snort or whatever suited their needs adelaar drew the sword clear and stood holding it against a twitching leg exhausted the adrenalin thatd kept her going and partially anesthetized was draining away leaving her with the deadash feeling you get after an allout struggle when still being alive doesnt seem worth all that effort the referee stumped over to hra trewwa grunted onto his knees and dug around in trewwas clothes until he found his id he tucked it away got to his feet and moved over to lugat while he was finishing his business with the dead i unbuckled the straps to harskas sheath and pulled it round where i could get at the shimmy cloth i kept in a squeeze pocket there wasnt much blood on my lady she cut too fast and too clean but i never put her away mussed wiping her was tricky i could lose a finger myself if i got careless flesh was flesh as far as she was concerned didnt matter whose not a lady for sentimental sighing i rubbed the blood off her alloy and crystal then slid her back in her sheath as she vanished i could hear something like a collective moan out there in the dark she was a lovely thing you getting old swar a man came out of the dark and leaned his elbows in the dueling floor nearly five minutes this time came close to costing me some money always complaining eh barker didnt expect to see you here i thought you were howling out near the rift was found me a nice little belt full of plums now ive got to track down some financing hmm ive got a little extra on my hands if youre still hunting investors why not drop round and well have a talk benders trucetel ill key the clerabot to give you my number why not want some company to walk you home hay and apelzan are in the bar drinking up their winnings by the way they said to say hello and bring your friend around theyd buy you both a sop whatever you felt inclined to and i saw ahehtos with a set of boygirl twins around three hours ago he ought to be winding up about now and ready for something new thanks wouldnt hurt adelaard got herself together she came over and stood listening to us talk her hand closed on my shoulder while the barker was making his offer i eased her fingers loose i didnt want her to forget what she was holding onto and stick those claws into me be one helluvun irony to die from a clients fingernails after winning that mixup with the enemy you think theyd come after us again youre tired del or you wouldnt say something so stupid she scrubbed the back of her hand across her mouth right i need a stim well barker said hays offers still open adelaar aici arash meet one tomi wolvesson we call him the barker for reasons i wont go into now shes adelaris securities bark a client naturally a client otherwise this lovely respectable femme wouldnt be in a mile of you old bear without taking his elbows from the wood he managed a bow and a swagger grinning up at both of us if youll take my arm dear lady we shall go searching for that stim he backed away swept another bow and crooked his arm ready for her hand file your reports my son and join us in the bar amused by his rattle and wanting to be away from this place adelaar went down the ramp took his arm and left me to deal with all the nonsense the bureaucrats demanded once a duel was done especially when there was a corpse or two as a result the ref tapped me on the shoulder took me to his office and started on the umpteen reports he was going to have to make it was the ultimate in futility there were no penalties for the duels or the deaths running out on the reports though that was serious i knew better than to waste time complaining the sooner the business was done the sooner i could climb into the trucetel medicell and after that into a long hot bath ti vnok looked like an absurdists idea of a cross between a spider monkey and a praying mantis his movements alternated between the stillness of mantisatrest and the frenetic energy of monkeyatfullcry he was a generalpurpose agent there to link anyone with an itch to anyone who could perhaps scratch that itch never involved with either side silent as stones about his clients business never challenged because in his busy little way he was as useful as helvetia herself and a friend of mine which didnt mean hed whisper secrets in my ear just that hed steer things my way if he saw a chance might even hint ohsodelicately if i was about to put my foot in something that stank there are worse kinds of friends kumari reported that when she reached him to change the time of our meet he looked unusually fidgety and wouldnt commit to anything over the com said hed get a message round to her which he did about an hour later one of the street kids that infested the undercity like mites on a dogs belly got past tel security somehow and up to the floor where our unit was handcarrying a flashnote time and place scribbled on it and a reminder i was to come careful and alone the flash was quicker than usual she just had time to read the thing before it dissolved i left the trucetel an hour early spent a good part of the time jumping flea runs mixing that with trots around the block up top where the sun was hot and the mirrors busy several times i wished i had pels along times when i was almost but not quite sure id dropped my ticks but regret only gives you ulcers and adelaar needed him more than i did when shed crawled out of the medicell and into bed kumari pels and i had a short confa about the morrow i played them over the duel and the parade to the jits afterward and the shadows rustling round uswed ve had to scramble to reach the jits if it werent for barker and the rest it was clear enough that bolodo wasnt giving up just changing tactics the most likely next step was pointing assassins at us remember bustus i said i remember something closer to a crawlers soul kumari said bolodo has more money than god herself what pay out all those golden gelders those slippery succulent little darlins just for me no the prime targetll be adelaar bolodo wouldnt sic crawlers on me unless they had to because itd cost them a lot couple years ago i was after a university contract advertised on helvetia and this character decided it would make a good cover for some other things he was doing and i was his only serious competition so he dropped their price on a nightcrawler cobben and pointed them at me i got seriously annoyed at this interference also at having the hair singed off half my head a lethal friend of mine happened to be on helvetia right then arguing an escrow closing shed just finished a hunt and was getting the fee released a complicated business since her fees tended to be in the range of the gross yearly income of your average world economy lovely gentle woman she gets upset when she kills someone or maims them a little but not when they target someone shes fond of shes redheaded and has the temper to go with it we did some bloody housecleaning and she laid down a warning mess with her friends and shed come hunting without a commission since then the nightcrawlers walk wide of me so like i said bolodo might have some trouble recruiting a cobben a reputations a handy thing but like kumari said bolodos got the gelt theyll buy some nerve and stuff it up some crawlers spine what else is money for eh by now adelaar and my crew were in the city also sitting in an office at dels bank temporarily safe from attack or so i hoped as shipsecond and official mom and holding my signature kumari could endorse the contracts for me and stamp the escrow agreements she usually handled that kind of thing she was sharper than either pels or me when it came to words and the twists that gentlebeings could put on them adelaar would be imprinting the contracts with her bank the register circuit and the escrow board it had to be done in the proper office with the proper officials in attendance everything fotted and entered in octuplets or more helvetian rules she intended to evoke privacy on the terms but i had more faith in bolodos persistence than in helvetian tech so i figured the local execs would know what we were after in a few hours and when they did when they discovered i was agreeing to rescue the daughter theyd really get serious about taking us out thats all they needed to be sure i either had their stinking secret or was so close to finding it the little bit left made no difference at all ti vnok was waiting at the back of one of the larger arbors it was close to ground level and had enough exits to satisfy a claustrophobic paranoid id felt clean the past five minutes or so and id pulled every trick i knew to test the feeling out so i strolled into the cool and shifting shadows and wandered about a minute or so longer no bells rang i drifted over to vnoks alcove and slid onto the bench across the table from him he sat mantis still his eyes expressionless as obsidian marbles but the two short feathery antennas that served as eyebrows were doing a nervous dance far as i can tell im clean i said i spent the last hour getting that way he rubbed his wrists together the callus patches there making a faint skrikking sound the expression came back into his eyes and his monkey face dissolved into the sort of grin that makes you want to grin back ive got some cover for meeting you swarda a man came to see me last night said he had a message for you he didnt waste time asking if i wanted to hear it he leaned forward the weight of his torso balanced on his forearms drop this business and certain people will see you wont be hurting for it one hundred thousand gelders no bidding please that was the deal no deal i said you bring the list only the freshest names he thrust two fingers in his throat pouch and brought out a small black packet the whole list would herniate a bumphel even flaked even flaked i thought youd better stay mobile i hear a cobbens been activated pointed at me pointed at your client i dont touch that kind of negotiation so i dont know who paid the price theres a lot of chat in the underways im hearing this and that his dust lids slid slowly over his eyes then retreated beneath the outer lids he waited gossip bought gossip in his view and he had his own reputation to consider he was supposed to know everything going by on helvetia and a long way beyond trade you something thats not for chatting yet what for what a packet giving chapter and verse signatured and attested by me and the client set in escrow pending release to someone with a passpartout for that account and a verbal outline of whats inside for your ears only for for a squirt link i want the seven warned of trouble who its from and whats behind it i tapped a finger on the packet watched it wobble then tucked it into a beltslit if this works out like i think slancys coming in with a heavy load and a fragile one i want a welcome waiting vnok rubbed his wrists together again the skrikk like the purring of a sated cat odd how many different inflections he could get out of that idiot sound there are two names on that list leda zag ilvinin taivas they are um of special interest to the seven if you can find them and let me know you have them i guarantee a vigorous welcome i looked round i didnt spot anything but vnok wouldnt be talking this freely without his own distorter making mishmash of our words i swung around so i was facing the back wall just in case someone was out there flaking this distorter on i said logic was all very well but what i had to say well i wasnt going to take any chances i could avoid on he said his antennas wriggled his surprise when you hear youll see why i rested my arms on the table and leaned in close as i sketched out what was in that packet everything adelaar had found out about bolodo dates and the data shed flaked from the mainbrain on spotchals what i thought had probably happened to the disappeared on the list hed given me by the time i got back to the trucetel adelaar and the others were waiting for me there was a burn on one of adelaars arms the tip of pels left ear was flat instead of round but kumari looked cool as mountain water crawler she said we stayed in the bright instead of taking the tube run put his timing off business finished all done we paid up here more than paid if you count the deposit good order dinner for i frowned at my ringchron surprised to find it was barely the third hour past noon seemed like it shouldve been closer to sundown eighth hour whats the shuttle schedule like midday its usually fairly light you want to take a chance yeh the paperworks done the squirt links set up and vnok is primed better we leave before bolodo thinks up something new terminal adelaar said suddenly shed been listening and looking peeved at being left out of things couldnt help that i wasnt going to tell her about vnoks list until i had to and that wasnt till we got wherever it was we were going the dinner ploys so old it stinks it wont fool anyone no problem remember barker and his friends i hired them to hang around the transfer point until we showed up gave us a discount they did dont like crawlers any better than i do maybe it was vnok pulling strings maybe it was luck coming round to kiss us sweet but we got loose from helvetia perimeter in half the usual time and dipped into the insplit clean and lonesome we made weersyll three weeks later security at the port was a joke getting into the holding pens might have been a problem but we werent going near the place there was only one ship down and they kept searchlights sweeping the metacrete around it the flickering light and shadow making ideal conditions for pels the guards at the gates had obviously been warned to look out for intruders but they werent really interested in anything except giving the haulers a hard time making them unload crates and open them up so the contents could be inspected one time just for the hell of it seemed to me they shot up some crates of frozen poults to the vast and vocal annoyance of the cargomaster waiting for them no bloodoons or sniffoons no heatseekers a joke pels put a packet of ticks in his mouth turned on his camouflage and walked through the gate then climbed on a flat as it trundled through after him and rode in comfort to the ship he set the ticks and rode the flat out again ignored by one and all and that was that viii eight months std after adelaar hired quale asteroid belthorgul systemswardheld quale et al with slancy orza tucked neatly out of sight on a large stone asteroid pels scratched at his healing ear four and five are inhabited five looked to me like a penal colony i saw an insystem ship eject half a dozen pods and leave orbit before they were down obviously no one cared whether they landed in one piece or not or what happened to the people in them the transport went down on four so i thought better not send eyes there yet i didnt want bolodo techs picking up search traces and following them back to us theres another reason but ill get to that in a minute ive had eyes poking about five since we got here i figured i could get some idea what were facing from the convicts if thats what they were they are the place has evidently been a dumping ground for quite a while some of the buildings down there are old enough to have greatgrandpups what were facing mm good news and bad news the good is weve got a fair version of the local language in memory a little updating and were home free on that remember hordaradda you picked up some plants there the ones you delivered to university the time we met i remember yes hordar looks like and the bad news the bad news bolodo landed on four which means the head whosis is there government records will be there including the list of the twolegged cargo bolodos been supplying the past however many years their names and whereabouts we need that list he dug his claws into the fur under his chin which means weve got to go there and get it he sucked in a long breath let it trickle through his blunt black nose you know whats orbiting that mudball swar riding in synchronous orbit over whats probably the capital city a monarch class warmaster he was speaking slowly enunciating his words with much care and its working just fine far as i can tell i didnt hang about long after i saw what she was and felt her start sniffing after who it was making waves around her shes old but those things were built to last i wouldnt want to try sneaking slancy down past her quale slumped in his chair crossed his legs at the ankles and contemplated the screen with its schematic of the system green dots marking the location of the two worlds they were interested in and some slowly shifting red dots that were insystem ships traveling between those worlds he ruffled his fingers through the short hairs of his beard stroked his mustache watching him adelaar felt like screaming shave that fungus off if thats all you can do sit there fondling it there were things going on here she didnt understand more to getting that list than finding out where aslan was im paying you i own you for the next few months she told herself but it didnt help she was a passenger and he was running the game i could have done all this myself she thought i wouldnt need him if i had a ship of my own she swore under her breath shed put off and put off buying her own ship it seemed such an unnecessary expense what with upkeep and fuel and crew and most of all mooring fees so much easier to buy space on a freighter or a worldship whats going on here i wont be a passenger i wont be pushed into a closet and left out of things no quale said no we wont take slancy anywhere near that thing swar kri kinok says dont be so spooky if there was anyone onboard who really knew how to operate her she would have picked us up the moment we came this side of the limit and ashed us before we knew what was happening thats supposed to be comforting kumari hissrattled her amusement ve says were alive arent we why should we need comforting teach me to argue with a sikkul paem i doubt it mmh he watched the screen a moment longer looks like theres a fair amount of traffic out this way pels extruded his claws began picking away old horn theres some mining the next quadrant over not a lot mostly rare earths things they might be short of on four and theres some trade between five and four mainly gemstones furs and ivory from the readings those ships arent much bigger than the tug say we left slancy out here we might be able to use the cargo carriers as stalking horses make believe were one of them what you think kri she tilted her head listened a minute kinok says maybe so but ve needs more time to analyze the emissions she studied the screen the touchy moment is when we have to break loose from the pattern pels i dont see any satellite traces is that right or were you too leery of the warship to hunt for them he rumbled a mock growl deep in his throat im not putting a pip near that world until i absolutely have to you absolutely have to fairly soon furface i cant plan if i dont have data she listened again eyes closed nodding at intervals got it she swung her chair around kinok says ve needs to watch say four or five of those ships landing ve says pels lay out some passive eyes ve swears on the drives the warmaster wont eat you pels growled again and you tell ve to go twist veself ve makes any more little jokes like that and ill have ve for salad my next meal kumari listened again shook her head no kinok ill let you tell furface that yourself save it for the next time you see him swar kinok thinks as long as we keep the tug to local speeds the warmaster wont get nervous about us ve says though its very important before we do anything that ve has the landing data ve can handle salad threats but ve has no desire at all to achieve vaporization adelaar watched impatiently her fingers tapping a jittery rhythm on her thigh now that she was so close her blood was on fire to finish it her mind told her that this careful probing and planning was essential her body told her go if she were doing the observation if she were directing things she could be crisp and calm and efficient and all that she wasnt she was more useless than the baggage in the hold and it was driving her crazy right pels youd better get started with those eyes the sooner you slide them into orbit the sooner you can fetch them back so we can read them off and get on with this he watched the rau pad out then gazed at adelaar his fingers poking in his beard again then he turned his head to kumari i suppose its time might as well get it over with kumari turned her pale gray eyes on adelaar sat with her hands folded cool and disengaged adelaar forced the tension out of her hands and arms as cool as kumari she said im paying freight here i have a right to know what youre doing quale pinched the end of his nose you heard us talking about ti vnok so jaszaca ti vnok agent among other things hes been handling offers from relatives and so on of people whod dropped down a hole somewhere they want them back most of them couldnt afford hunters inc but they did the next best thing and put a reward offer in ti vnoks files he gets his cut if he manages to connect with someone wholl do the digging the rest goes to the digger if hes lucky enough to find one of the disappeared a few years ago he tried getting us interested but we couldnt afford to waste time on a cause as lost as that with no payback unless we actually produced the body not our kind of project anyway then you come along and it begins to look like some of those lost might have gone down the same hole your daughter did he scratched at his jaw fingers digging through the short soft black beard we have a partial list which were going to try matching against the one in those files pels was talking about you said it yourself a while back two flights a year for fifty sixty years maybe more that adds up to a lot of bodies we match em snatch em take em back to helvetia and go home with a nice fattener for the pot earned with information i collected information i nearly got killed for my information you might say that might youll get your daughter back thats what you hired us for dont you think its a bit premature getting steamed over a side bet that hasnt paid off yet that might never pay off he was being so sweetly reasonable he couldnt know it made her want to tear his throat out kumari stirred swar behave yourself his brow shot up he looked amused and rueful and he stopped talking kumari stroked her fine white hair you dont think were cheating you it wasnt a question adelaar clamped her lower lip between her teeth and said nothing you are a rational being aici arash kumari went on use your brain not your spleen there is another aspect to this worth considering the more witnesses we return to helvetia the safer you and your daughter will be if we find even a tenth of them you and aslan wont be the only ones telling the tale your credibility wont be attacked so vehemently and probably destroyed your lives wont be put at risk some of those on the list have powerful connections if i were you aici arash i would pray to whatever gods i recognized that we locate a goodly number of them and get them safely away i cant dispute that adelaar said her anger ashes in her throat but you should have told me before this kumaris pale rose mouth curved into a slow smile would you have done so adelaar adelarisna would you have told us about the attacks on your life before the bargain was made if fate had given you that choice it wasnt a question adelaar felt like answering she said instead so what happens now so what happens now she said that was a good question the answer for the next six days was nothing much the tutor poked the local language into us and we practiced it on each other adelaar went back to work on slancys defense systems kumari and i dredged up what we knew about hordaradda and the hordar compared it with what pels had picked up from five we spun out plans without data knocked them down without data and generally fooled ourselves into thinking we were actually doing something made the time pass and thats about all it did on the sixth day kinok announced that he didnt see any reason we couldnt take the tug in the warmaster just lay there in orbit like a sleeping whale while the little fish swam around her carefully but undisturbed most of them landed at the field outside the capital the rest came down on the continent below the equator after plotting lineofsight ve said that the southern field was over the bulge of the world and out of the warmasters viewcone which meant we could swing round that way without surprising anyone so we loaded up the tug and started the tedious trip downsystem pels named the tug chicklet behind those fangs hes a sentimental little fuzzy kumari tells him the cute has seeped into his brain i put chicklet into the slot behind a pair of cargo creepers and pooted along just beyond their detection range if i couldve taken her up to full speed the trip would have ended in a few hours but kinok said not and i didnt want to push my luck so i was stuck with a fourday crawl that was not a pleasant four days i got a good look at why adelaars daughter took off del had a tongue like a tongan bladewhip pels showed the good sense to hide down in the engine room when he wasnt asleep or on duty at the com that way he didnt have to deal with her kumari kept cool if she was pushed too far she gave back better than she got never never ever get in a wordslinging match with our mom trouble was more often than not i ended up in the middle getting beaten up by both of them we reached tairanna when the warmaster was at noon i had my fingers crossed hoping kinok was right and the observers on board were not looking for trouble from space the black whale ignored us not even a twitch to acknowledge our existence i laid an egg a shielded satellite and drifted on nothing i laid another then i scooted past south continent into the polar seas and dipped into the atmosphere through a hellspawned storm where winds tore the caps off massive towering waves that swept along with nothing to break them up but a few rocky islets battered by those winds and by electrical discharges powerful enough to shock chicklets powersystems into fits we crawled along the coast until we reached the fringes of the storm and settled to a careful drift along the duskline circling out to sea whenever we spotted the lights of a settlement up near the northern bulge of the western coast the land turned hostile rocks along the shore like shark teeth white foam pounding high against the stone precipitous cliffs and equally precipitous fjords i turned inland there the land passing below us was rugged mountainous chicklet said no locals lived there and i could see why it was the kind of place i was looking for a deserted locale where we could get up a landbase and a holding area for the vanished until wed collected them all and could shift them up to slancy about twenty minutes after we left the coast i set chicklet down in a pleasant wooded valley between two mountain spurs there were streams filled with fish and freshwater crustaceans the forest the mountain slopes the grassy meadowflats were thick with deerish browsers and other game that had no fear of fangless bipeds since theyd never been hunted chicklets probes told us there were nuts and tubers wild greens trees and vine fruits though it was early spring here south of the equator some of those fruits and berries were ripe enough to eat plenty to help feed the vanished when we brought them here hunting and fishing to pass the time an untouched wild place to explore a lake on a small plateau at one end of the valley where they could swim or do some boating if they had the ingenuity to build their own watercraft pretty place if you liked that kind of thing we kept our heads down for the next four days sent out eyes to map the capital and see what was where using the satellites to bounce the data to us the first day i was cautious sent in one eye to poke about ready to pull the deadman if its field started trouble nothing happened so i saturated the place except for one area the city gilisim gillin it was called was completely unshielded helpful of them wasnt it they showed us precisely where to look by the middle of the second day it was clear the eyes werent going to get past the shield without blowing every alarm in the place so i pulled in most of them and let adelaar fiddle with them she stopped fratcheting and settled to work by midmorning on the fourth day those altered eyes gave us a detailed schema of the shielded area there was a monster mainbrain parked in a subterranean honeycomb that stretched under a complex of buildings and gardens enclosed behind a wall at least thirty meters high and proportionately thick there was a mess of traps and alarms on the ground nothing we couldnt handle a score or more of guards patrolling the place others at watchpoints inside the structures the ones that stayed out of the buildings they worked with leashed pairs of large cats something like the spotted panthers on flayzhao cats and men were alert more than alert they were nervous i didnt like that something was making them jumpy and that meant trouble for us id rather have them relaxed and lazy like the gatewatch back on weersyll pels tracked the guards on their rounds built up a schedule night and day it was much the same half of them followed set rounds that took some of them through the public rooms of all the buildings others into the twists and turns of the arcades and the gardens and still others into that mess of wormholes underground they clocked in roughly every twenty minutes pressing their thumbs on sensor plates attached to the walls inside and on columns outside decorative spikes set inconspicuously throughout the gardens the rest were rovers they checked in at fortyfive minute intervals using the same sensors but in no particular order they were good they kept the patterns random enough to frustrate most observers but still managed to cover the ground whoever it was ran things depended on scanners to warn him of air attacks and to direct the melters installed on the walls pels snorted when he saw them he could hocus them without half trying no bloodoons to point out warm bodies or sniffoons to track them no droid shootems it looked almost too easy wed be using miniskips when we went in and they were hard to spot on a clear night let alone a foggy or a rainy one it was autumn up north storms blowing in every third night we could afford to wait for optimum conditions so we wouldnt have to worry about the outside patrols until we were on the ground once we broke through into the wormholes all we had to do was get to the computer before it noticed it had mice in the walls if we played things right and kept moving fast we should get in and out clean with a little luck theyd blame any traces we left on whoever was keeping them up nights i meant to leave adelaar behind let her be the one to hold fort while kumari pels and i went after the list but she wouldnt stand for that stumping up and down the grass scaring the bitty amphibs off the rocks where they were sunning she argued at the top of her voice that we had to take her along she said shed back her physical capacity against me and a dozen like me hadnt she already proved that and as for mental capacity she knew more about computers and security especially anything provided by bolodo than me or kumari or anyone else i could dig up that she had the core of her equipment in the gear wed collected on aggerdorn and whyd we have her bring it if she wasnt going to use it kumari took me aside and told me not to be a fool the woman was liable to explode and do something stupid shed been under pressure too long she needed action security is something shes good at kumari said take advantage of that you know me swar ill be happier here with the remotes setting up the shelters and getting things ready for the vanished thats more my sort of job kumari is fragile her homeworlds around g she went into the tank farm a while back and had some genwork done on muscle and bone so she wouldnt get exhausted or injured in heavier pulls but she prefers to leave running about to us hardier types even so theres not many id rather have at my back she fights with her head more than hands and feet and thats one fine weapon we took advantage of another storm and rode a skip north to a box canyon an eye had located for us by the time the sun rose we were tucked away under an outleaning cliff across the lake from gilisim gillin we slept a few hours and spent the rest of the day going over and over the schema and our plans getting equipment ready that sort of thing and that night we strapped ourselves onto the miniskips and headed for the city years and month local since karrel gozo flew elmas ofka and her isyas for the first time the abandoned mine where elmas ofka keeps windskimmer and lives with other outcast and divorced whove joined with her also the escaped aliens with a powerful grudge against the imperator and everyone who supported him a stormy autumn night about an hour past midnight elmas ofka touched the bandage on karrels hand whats this nothing dont tell me that she pinched the hand lightly saw him wince so elli elli he laughed at her touched her cheek with the back of the injured hand didnt you say stay off work for a while if i could i needed an excuse so i spilled some acid on my hand no big deal im supposed to be making up the income loss by hide hunting my house wont expect me back for a couple of weeks you see a healer am i mushbrained like some i could mention of course i did it wont interfere with flying he laughed again waggled fingers wound with salvestained gauze winced at the small pains the movement cost him left hand hanifa he thrust the hand through the leather strap looped over his shoulder just means i cant knit for a while no ones buying so thats no loss she frowned at him for several moments then smiled and shook her head what can i say come along i want to show you something she led him deeper into oldtown past tumbledown buildings rotting slowly into the earth they stood on as they were elbowed down by mesheme trees crowding into their airspace to an area of the mine settlement where hed not been before convict barracks she said and pushed open the door to a stone structure in considerably better shape than the others waving him back a step she leaned into the opening nceegh hab hab hi cecehi hep nbeihim hab she pulled back chuckling that gargle means suns down stir yourself its me he doesnt like company he hasnt invited she ran her forefinger along a merm scar on her forearm never go inside this place without an invitation kar you wont come out again there was a tiny tinny beeping a sphere about the size of his fist floated in the door gap doa nceegh close the door behind you kar follow me and keep your mouth shut when there was no chance any light would leak outside the sphere popped out a beam focused it on the floor and went swimming deeper into the cavernous interior they followed nceegh had a small compact body covered with fur like gray felt skinny arms and legs a ball of a head dominated by huge lambent violet eyes he wore a voluminous leather apron over a leather cachesexe and thin rubber gloves on three fingered hands with long doublejointed thumbs when they came into his workroom and the light there brightened a film dropped over his eyes his scoop ears twitched and folded partway shut he swung his perch around drew his legs up and draped his stringy arms over knees that looked sharp enough to stab with he blinked slowly gazed with disfavor at karrel goza nceegh this is our pilot hell be working your gadget i thought youd better be the one to explain it to him unhfidoodahak his mouth gash puckered into a pinkgray rosette as his eyes flickered over karrel rested a moment on the bandaged hand moved on come over here you dont bother me with your name i dont want it i dont plan to use it the cuuxtwoks installed already but the proto models here cuuxtwok she he jabbed a wobbly thumb at elmas ofka calls it a diverter same thing he waited until karrel goza stood looking down at the workbench then he swung his chair about and began talking the scanners old bitvйkeshit pittipat to you he uses to watch his ass theyre crude stufffidoo thats all need tactile contact with the suspect object before they know its there hes got some listening capacity but its short range one of the things the cuux here does is spread a slip field about the airship the scanner pulses slide along it without noticing it and pass on till they fade out itll muffle some of the noise your motors make but not all if you can shut them off say half a kilometer from the palace and let the wind push you over youve got no problem ive tucked in some longrange sensors theyll warn you when youre approaching the danger zone and this see this gives you attack capacity it projects the cuux field in a parabolic mirror in front of the airship lets you trap and magnify the pulses and push them back at the generators till smoke comes out their ears he reached for the control panel and began demonstrating the uses of his creation in windskimmer heading for gilisim gillin flying over lake golga plowing through swirling mists on a heavily overcast night a thunderstorm is threatening but is still holding off two hours after midnight ruya is full shes a faint icy glow coming through the clouds a few degrees past zenith gorruya is way off to the west her fattening crescent a smudge near the horizon wha karrel used the probeadjunct on nceeghs device to poke into the mist but he could find no trace of the enigmatic objects that had flashed alongside them and vanished in the darkness ahead elli did you see those things if you mean something like wingless glassy dragonflies with dark centers three of them zipping past us six times faster than anything normal yeh i saw them what was it i saw seems to me its something nceegh would know about alien pretty obvious dont you think brings up a question two questions did they see us and what are they going to do about it three what are we going to do you want to break off i dont know elmas ofka glanced over her shoulder at her isyas sitting on the floor of the gondola waiting for her decision content to let her decide fingers tracing a scar line she frowned at karrel finally she said its late karrel goza was briefly puzzled then he nodded i see what are they doing out here now could be they want attention as little as we do theres a chance right lets keep going winds from the east you have to make a wide jog to position skimmer for the drift over gilisim why not do it now make them look in the wrong direction if they are looking why not he brought the airships nose around driving her as close to the wind as he could it was too strong to face head on just as well he was turning early he could save some fuel and a lot of battering elmas ofka rubbed at the vertical frownline between her brows i wish i knew what was happening out there yeh he was going to say more but the warning bell chimed the instruments had picked up the first pulses from the palace scanners he slid the cover off the sensor plate touched on the cuux field the thready mist outside turned solid as if they were suddenly sealed within a brushed glass bottle it brought a sense of oppression a hint of claustrophobia the isyas were troubled by it he could hear the soft sounds they made as they shifted nervously behind him he forced himself to relax you want to cross the walls high or low the air near the ground is apt to be more turbulent than it is at this level but we wont be moving that fast and the tower is the only structure high enough to be a hazard the guards wont notice us in this fog they couldnt spot a longhauler with its warnlights blazing the scanners are all weve got to worry about and the cuux will take care of those and if we go in low you wont have to run the ballast motors run them a shorter time anyway he spoke absently as he watched the pulses from the palace scanners go ghosting past them invisibilities made visible by the field eerie undulating tadpoles of light swimming through the mist and vanishing behind them five minutes he bent over the dead reckoner touching the controls with careful delicacy to keep windskimmer moving in the right direction ten minutes another chime he started the pumps sucking ten minutes more he said then were there he brought the airship down and down until she moved about forty meters above the grass then he shut the motors off and let the wind take them the sudden silence felt odd almost painful he didnt want to talk nor it seemed did any of the others he watched the hypnotic dance of the scanner pulses as the silvery wigglers darted past and past endless numbers of thema dance that ended so abruptly he leaned forward startled not believing he wasnt seeing them any longer elli what somethings happened to the scanners those dragonflies maybe they had business at the palace what else could it be he shrugged settled back pittipat wouldnt put his hide at risk not if he knew it they did it all right those aliens i wonder who they are and what they want im afraid were going to find out if we go in like we planned how close are we two three minutes why you sure the altimeter is working as well as it ever does ive been flying since i was a tweener elli you get to know where youre riding by how the air feels the readings not out more than a yard or so either way i was thinking we could have dropped below the wall that would stop the pulses wouldnt it why dont you take skimmer up again and see what happens no theres no reason to risk the sound of the pump being picked up she grimaced youre the pilot the palace slept dim red sparks looped steadily across the gardens like fireflies tied to a track the guards undisturbed in their rounds karrel goza brought windskimmer over their heads to the openair theater he turned her nose into the wind touched on the motors and used a trickle of their power to hold her in place for the minute or so it took elmas ofka and her isyas to slide down the ladders onto the top tier of the theater seats then he brought the airship around and cut the motors off once more let the wind drift her out of the enclosure and across the tip of the lake to the imperators hunting preserve an ancient forest that the hordar had left wild and the huvved hadnt touched half a kilometer in he dropped a mooring cable with a grasping claw anchored windskimmer to one of the larger trees turned off the cuux field and arranged the two chairs so he could stretch himself across them and drowse away the time until he had to go back for elmas ofka and the isyas begin with elmas ofka on the top tier of theater seats her isyas around her waiting for a guard to move on then shift to the maze of corridors in the subterra of the imperators palaceconcrete tunnels gray paint on the walls enigmatic numbers and glyphs in dirt dulled black grit on the floors that make walking silently close to impossible branches cutting off at angles to make things more confusing ramps leading to lower levels at unpredictable intervals stairways behind halfdoors pervasive hum of airmachines that keep cold dry air moving restlessly through the maze six meter strips of coldlight tubes pasted in staccato lines overhead and on each wall voices echo an indeterminate distance elmas ofka crouched behind the curving stone bench condensation trickled in cold rivulets down her body dripped from her nose and saturated the tight cowl that covered her head and the lower part of her face around her she could hear the isyas breathing they sounded louder than surf after a storm thankful that the wind was blowing into her face so the cats wouldnt scent her she held her own breath as she watched the guard below in the well of the theater wave his handlamp about even in the back beams of the powerful lamp he wasnt much more than a silhouette but she could see that he was broad and muscular probably one of the laggas old pittipat brought back from exile on tassalga to put the boot harder into ordinary hordar he looked regrettably alert more so than the cats who were shivering and stepping with exaggerated delicacy over the wet stone silently she urged them on her teeth clamped so hard her jaw ached after what seemed an eternity he gave the cats a toothy whistle slapped at them with the leashes and followed them across the oval well there were double doors at the far end she heard the jingling of keys as he unlocked them the sounds amplified by the acoustics of the place then the chunk and thud as he pushed one of the doors open and whistled the cats outside as soon as the door boomed shut elmas ofka stood leaped onto the bench and ran along it to the nearest flight of stairs the isyas trotting silently behind her she led them down the stairs but stopped before she stepped into the well to let tezzi ofka spray her once again with the scentdestroyer a cousin of hers had come up with a mixture of kedaga an herb cats avoided like most of them avoided water crushed crab beetle and stinkfish oil even to her relatively insensitive nostrils it was a revolting mess but better than having the cats set up a howl when they came across an intruders scent trace on the guards next appearance here as soon as the others were sprayed she ran across the flagging to the raised platform in the center of the well and stopped by the door in the near end according to her information it led down to the dressing rooms and more importantly into the techs area where the lighting was controlled and the other effects were contrived and where there was rumored to be access to the subterra she waved harli tanggаr forward stepped back so the isya could work on the door harli started to kneel straightened up she put her hand on the door and pushed gently it swung open ondar she breathed look she pointed at the latchtongue neatly sliced through someones ahead of us the aliens you think elmas ofka bent closer whatever had dealt with the latch was similar to the cutters nceegh made for them probably she straightened waved the isyas closer pulled her cowl off her mouth i want to go in she whispered but i wont take you where you dont want to go its all or none call it harli tanggаr tugged at her cowl uncovering a broad grin in she breathed the grin went round the circle in in yet again in elmas ofka nodded drew the cowl higher so only her eyes showed she pushed the door open and stepped into the vestibule the entrance to the subterra was wedged open a crack a short distance inside a rovingguard was lying against a wall tezzi ofka knelt beside him still alive she said speaking in a throaty mutter that dropped dead less than a bodylength away knocked out tezzi ofka shook her head no bump or bruise nceegh is working on a thing he calls a stunner could be something like that they arent worried about someone finding him looks like elmas ofka frowned along the grimy corridor glanced over her shoulder at the other branches fading into dimness as they dipped downward they seem to know where theyre going kind of them to mark the way for us elmas stretched upward touched a small white splotch high on the wall she settled back looked at her finger rubbed her thumb against the sticky white stain marked more than one way lets go following the trail of white splotches accented with the bodies of unconscious guards nceeghs spotter in her hand elmas ofka led them deeper and deeper into the maze making better time than shed expected thanks to the alien invaders whod cleared the way for them down one level two three the needle jumped on the spotter elmas stopped signaled lirrit the isya dropped to her stomach and wriggled around the bend on toes and elbows vanishing for several seconds before she came back the same way jumped to her feet and brought her head close to elmas ofkas aliens two stopped watching something elmas ofka thought a moment then took the isyas back around several corners until she came to a branching tunnel eyes on the spotter she turned into it and began picking her way to a point equivalent to where shed been twice the spotter jumped twice lirrit ofka went ahead and darted the unlucky wanderer then elmas ofka rounded a bend and saw the end of the tunnel beyond that there was what looked like a vast open space after signaling lirrit ofka and half the isyas to wait she led the other three toward the opening keeping close to the wall moving warily ready to dart anything that popped into the arch she dropped to her knees and eased her head past the edge the room beyond was immense the ceiling was three levels up aboveground with a series of slim horizontal windows circling just below it windows with oneway glass in them black now because of the fog and clouds the floor was another level below where she knelt it was laid with black and white tiles in a swirling pattern that made her dizzy when she shifted her eyes too quickly at the north wall there were several tiers of theater seats with a separate thronechair for the imperator at the south end near where she was a large curved screen blindingly white took up part of the wall in the space it left there were three inconspicuous doors one to the east of the screen and two on the west a guard stumped back and forth in front of the single door the scrape of his footsteps loud enough to send her heart knocking in her throat she frowned the chamber was filled with shadows except near the screen which seemed to gather in and amplify what light there was nothing moved except the guard why was he still moving was he beyond the range of the aliens weapons they were at least ten yards closer to him than she was did they have to be almost on the man before they could take him out why were they waiting what did they expect to happen she glanced down at the spotter stared at it startled there were two spikes on the line not one she shifted it slowly back and forth watching the spikes shift something else was out there something closing on the guard she moved her eyes slowly over that dizzying floor whatever it was she couldnt see it no matter how hard she searched she looked at the scanner the two spikes had nearly converged a section of floor reared up she heard a hum like an angry bee the guard dropped there was a short whistle then a small alien with brownish fur was standing over the guards body waiting first the video room thats what it looked like giant size then the operations cell of the mainbrain we parked the miniskips on the stage out of sight behind some low railings and got into the subterra with almost no difficulty adelaar had sense enough not to argue and let pels take the lead shed seen a little of his work on weersyll besides she was carrying a heavy pack she cherished like a child her tools i had a launch tube slung across my back and half a dozen clips for it in a pouch on my belt the darts in the clips were loaded with bang juice strong enough to take out a wall if the need arose portable back door you might say pels was in huntmode and harder to see than a black ship in the coalsack shadow made him a special stunner one small enough for him to carry in his mouth he had it in his fist now and used it whenever he came on a guard we couldnt avoid or some idiot with weak kidneys heading for the can there werent many of them thank whatever it was late and most sensible folk were sleeping i was navigator reading the chart calling the turns laying on rubwhite to guide us should we come back this way when the job was done i shot it up near where the ceiling met the wall where not many people would notice it we didnt have much trouble pels laid out half a dozen i shoved them against the wall and on we went boring eh if you plan right thats the way it should be you dont want interesting experiences at a time like this we used about fifteen minutes reaching the place kumari took one look at and called the video room then we waited while pels sneaked up on the guard it was slow and tedious nothing we could do but watch our backs and sweat out the computers reaction time some of the men pels blanked had to be guards at least one had to have missed a checkin by now maybe even two checks if our luck went sour on us we were counting on redundancy theres no gadget made by man or god thats foolproof you have to include some sort of back check to make sure an idiot particle hasnt wandered where it shouldnt stunner hidden in his mouth pels eeled forward on toes and elbows his fur mimicking the pattern of the tiles if you were as high as we were and you knew what to look for you could find him the floor would shift a little as if something moved a lens across it but if you were down there walking a tedious stint like that guard youd most likely never see him until he had you as pels got closer the guards nervousness increased he kept looking around snapping and unsnapping the flap of his holster pacing jerkily about wheeling and glaring at each whisper of sound pels changed his technique he moved and froze moved and froze timing his progress to the jitters of the guard the operating range of that stunner was just under two meters so he had to be very close before he could trigger it and hope to do the job before he went down pels got a good look at the man fiveworlder he said looks like the local bigass has brought some muggers home from exile i suppose he feels safer with gits like that keeping the crawlers off his back squat and powerful sniffing trouble even if he couldnt see it the fiver swung his head back and forth as if questing for a scent he was good all right i wouldnt want to be the one to take him but hed never gone up against an aurranger rau in huntmode pels got him going away laid him out like butchers meat adelaar and i sprinted along the ramp that led down from our tunnel moving like the devils in hell were chasing us we got the door open and she went to work shed spent some time over what the eyes had told her about the system so she needed about thirty seconds to put a hold on the alarms pels and i nosed about the place looked empty but we werent taking chances we checked every shadow there was no one about no techs or guards just the interface ticking over by itself when we got out front again adelaard begun the tedious process of switching the instructions of the alarm system i could see it wasnt all that difficult she was clucking and snorting as she worked scorn oozing from every pore watching her was about as interesting as watching grass grow so i went to help pels carry the guard inside wed just dropped him behind a bench when the door slammed open dont move pels and i froze there was a load of menace in that whispery female voice i took a chance and turned my head seven more females in black with knitted black socks over their faces followed the first through the door spreading out so they could keep their weapons on us from half a dozen directions definitely not authorized personnel the wormholes were having a busy night can i straighten up i said as mildly as i could manage im getting a crick in my back the leader used her free hand to tap twice at her weapon the darts these shoot dont stun she said they kill the look in her eyes which was all i could see of her face said dont push it i like you about as much as a bad smell three seconds for a man your size less for your friend she thought that over a moment probably less keep that in mind get yourself straight slow and easy thats right now both of you step over that bench and flatten your backs against the wall thats good she glanced at adelaar who hadnt been interested enough to look around and see what was happening whatre you doing dont bother me adelaar snapped hands briefly stilled she scowled over her shoulder at the speaker unless you want a load of trouble landing on your necks talk as you work no adelaar turned back to the board and went on with what shed been doing i didnt like the way that conversation was going adelaar had no intention of being reasonable especially since she was right what she was doing was more important than this womans curiosity however i was fairly sure the woman wouldnt see it that way uh i said i can tell you in general terms whats going on shes not playing games with you youd better let her concentrate on what shes doing it can get touchy changing the rules on an alarm system that complex the womans eyes switched back to me she wasnt liking me much more than before but she was willing to listen what do you mean you came across some bodies on your way here yes some of them were guards you know how they check in we know theres something theyre supposed to do fools and drunks they say luck looks after them maybe they should add angry female rebels going into a place like this with no preparation ah every twenty some minutes they touch a thumbplate set up along their routes that tells the brain there that theyre on the job and where they should be if a guard doesnt report and all systems look clear the lid blows off my friend is changing the rules making touch and notouch equivalent states in other words it doesnt matter what a guard does or doesnt do i snatched a look at adelaar no im wrong shes done with that shes putting together a clear corridor so we can get out clean once we have what we came for did you use those darts on anyone why the ones we knocked out in an hour or so theyll wake up with a sore head i was talking quietly keeping things relatively abstract trying to cool down the situation seemed to me it was working so i kept on its been our experience that guards like them unless theyre terminally stupid when they find out theres no sign of trouble they keep their mouths shut about going to sleep on the job you see they wont remember what hit them the stunner wipes out the last few seconds before they go down with you leaving bodies about thats not going to happen shit cant be helped i suppose i gave her a grin anyway its you and your friends whore going to get the blame for all this no doubt who are you and why are you here youve been importing slaves not me she made the two words sound terminally grim whatever were here to collect some of them my friend there the reason shes a bit testy she had her daughter snatched i see she inspected adelaars back she had very bright eyes hazel expressive good figure athletic despite the cowl i thought id know her again if i met her in other clothes and other surroundings reminded me a little of shadow i relaxed she wasnt going to use that darter unless we were thicker than usual and forced it on her she caught me smiling she didnt like that but she was cool about it clear corridor explain deactivating traps alarms scanners acoustics melters whatever so we can scat like our tails on fire once were finished scanners it was you took them out my furry friend did hes good at that kind of thing but the techs here theyve probably replaced the burnouts by now and maybe someone has come up with the idea the flare was sabotage so we dont have all that much time if youll just calm down and let us work seems to me we havent interfered all that much adelaar dug in her pack brought out the black box she called her crazyquilt pels was watching avidly the smooth black plastic didnt give him much to go on but he was blasting into his memory the points where she clamped the leads hed hung over her like a worried mother when she started tinkering on the eyes but she chased him saying he made her so nervous she was botching the work actually i think she didnt want him or anyone else around her when she was using her tools look at the fuss she made over kinoks snooping she had her secrets and meant to keep them maybe we could get together on this i was trying a little basic persuasion push but not too hard we need information you want something or you wouldnt be here she thought that over those bright eyes flicking from me to pels and back then she nodded she didnt put the darter away she held it loosely so she could snap it up if she needed to dont push at me she said a much more amiable tone to her voice you say youre here to take some slaves home we can certainly stand the loss whats she doing now getting past the blocks when shes through shell be looking for slave lists whos where ah if she can do that what do you want from me mind if i move away from the wall my legs getting cramped if youll remember she flicked the darter at the silent women watching us i hear you moving slow and easy i stepped over the bench and crossed to adelaar about how long she jumped glared at me sweat was beaded over her face and there was a wild look in her eyes del cool it will you i know that wasnt the most tactful thing i could have said i didnt mean to be tactful i thought she needed an excuse to blow up so i gave her one she cursed me for half a minute i dont know sonchйri but those words didnt need translation they sounded like a couple of kyangs snarling at each other when she wore out her vocabulary she dragged a hand across her face gave me a disgusted look and went back to watching the readout dials on her black box i left her to it and ambled over to another work station swung the chair around and sat straddling it my arms crossed over the padded back looking cool and friendly nothing like a clichй to comfort the edgy hanifa i said which memory told me was a courteous honorific for an important femme a good description for the one facing me might be a good idea to send a couple of your people outside keep watch for rovers looking for trouble maybe the tall one there could put on enough of his uniform i jerked a thumb at the unconscious guard to suggest hes still on guard another idea my friend here is rather good at stalking you see him take the guard right then you know what i mean youve got us two as hostages for his good behavior why not let him help with the patrolling hes an amiable soul if you dont coo at him too much women do you know its the curse of his life she surprised me she laughed full out a pleasant noise over the faint hum of the interface and the ticking of the shutdown readouts made me feel like smiling for the first time since she jumped us those other grins and grimaces were just policy she waved the tall chunky one over and told her to get to it called a little one who looked like she was made of springsteel and hard rubber and sent her up into one of the holes to keep watch there and pot anyone who showed his nose she gazed thoughtfully at pels then nodded and waved him after the women when he was gone she set her hands on her hips and looked me over i understand about her she nodded at adelaar why you gelt i said its how i make my living she hired me and my crew to help her find her daughter and on top of that i collect so much a head for every captive i bring back crew she said you have a starship i didnt walk here the lists in there theyre going to say something like this person arrived at such and such time he was sold or rented to such and such an individual living in such and such a town we need someone to get us to the right houses or lay out maps for us that might be arranged we can talk about it next time we meet mostly he rents them old pittipat i mean she scratched at her chin with the barrel of the darter stopped that when the front sight snagged in the knitted cloth that covered the bottom half of her face you noticed the warmaster hard to miss what do you know about ships like that its big if it set down here itd grind this city to dust and just about empty the lake when it has its full complement on board it carries six or seven thousand which includes crew support personnel and strike force you have any idea how many men your pittipat keeps up there she made a soft angry sound not mine she tapped the darter against her hip and went back to watching adelaar after a minute she said i dont know maybe she can get the brain to tell us i took a look at what adelaar was doing when she has a moment free shouldnt be long now ill see what she can turn up how much to take us up there more than you or a dozen like you could afford you dont know what i can afford maybe not but you dont know how nervous that thing makes me bolodo takes pay in rosepearls other things too but mostly them have you seen rosepearls that straightened me up and got me interested adelaar had mentioned the profits from the slaving but she hadnt gone into details i still wasnt willing to risk slancy in something so close to a sacrifice mission but if that warmaster were seriously undermanned which i suspected from the way it acted hmm it was an interesting thought ive seen a few didnt know where they came from i kept my voice easy noncommittal but i dont think i fooled her much she could smell a deal but she was smart enough not to push it let me find out what the brain says i told her i dont consider suicide an acceptable option nor i adelaar started digging through her pack again apparently she was in solid because she brought out the duper and began attaching it to the black box after the marrying was done and the run started she went a little limp scrubbed at her face with her sleeve and swung her chair around to face me she looked a bit like shed been having great sex with an inventive group tired but with a kind of glow to her shes a slow bitch she said itll take maybe twenty minutes to get it all aslan first then im pulling everything shes got about bolodo when we get back those skells wont know what hit them you think you could dig out whats in there on the warmaster explain she listened while i sketched the hanifas proposition not quite a proposition yet but a suggestion that we might work out some sort of accommodation i could see the spark of interest in her when i mentioned rosepearls it looked a lot like mine she listened without saying anything and after i finished sat staring at the floor for several minutes finally she looked up aslan first the words hadnt much force behind them shed spent time sweat and a lot of her gelt to reclaim her daughter but teasing a profit out of her pain was so seductive a thought it almost obscured her original purpose agreed i said thats in the contract we need to make sure weve got legs for getting out of here right slancys my income im not hazarding her you know how hard it is to get hold of a good ship the tugs different we could pick up another like her in a couple of months i gave the hanifa a halfgrin making sure she felt she was in the game whether this happened or not i wanted her kept sweet with rosepearls in the pot i was definitely coming back here once this business was finished just looking wont hurt uhhuh i think weve had this chat before i hear crew and me we run on equal shares once slancys serviced five shares four kinokkahat count as one five with you one time done i shifted to the hanifa if the brain says its doable well do it say you and i agree on terms i gave her the grin again anything else youd like to buy she thought that over a minute i need to talk to my people i checked my chron plenty of time the dupe run has to finish before my friend can pull the warmaster stats adelaar watched the woman gather her raiders together and start whispering at them until a year and a half ago local a little over two years std aslan was here right here inside these walls what happened she disappeared ran theres some more but i havent tried reading it yet i nodded at the confa group maybe one of them knows she pushed absently at her hair her face gone blank her eyes narrowed i hadnt a clue what she was thinking not here she said finally mmf maybe you better explain that some more this is no place to twist answers out of anyone too many ways we can get dumped on besides i left my kit behind didnt think id need it twist answers thats not too swift an idea rosepearls i can see their shine in your eyes too she managed a thin smile i wont dispute that you think you can trust them not half fanatics theyll do whatever they want to do and hell with any contract i yawned it was getting later by the breath and i was tired and i was getting nervous stuck in this hole waiting for the locals to pour on the troops whatever they come up with you keep hold of the data until they provide the pearls we agree on that much anyway listen say we lift them up there if they can take that monster out itll make getting away clean a lot easier and getting back in look del weve got the inside track with these people an exclusive as long as we can keep the location quiet that wont be long if your gamble pays off he shrugged one or two trips for me but adelaris could have a longhaul market here gray or black does that matter lets you hike your prices i dont know enough about this place the hanifa came back the clear corridor she said eyes hard on adelaar can you leave it and hide what youve done adelaar ran her tongue over her lips probably the wards theyre using arent all that sophisticated ill have to put the alarms right before we leave but she frowned at the woman i could see she was thinking keep it simple you dont want to irritate this one i can loop a path out of the guard circuits and pinch off access um it might be better to set up several corridors make them operative on different days um switch from one to another in say a sevenday rotation theyll be harder to spot that way safer for your people they wont be coming over in the same place same time every time the hanifas eyes glittered but she controlled her excitement and gave a short sharp nod can you find the files on suspect hordar perhaps the sechs plans for dealing with them i can take a look some of that might be stored in local branches there arent any this is the only mainbrain on tairanna your pittipat doesnt like to share his power no she didnt object to the your this time too much into getting what shed come for to worry about little things like that we want those files right i can also erase them if you want turning them over is more complicated unless your equipment can mate to mine you can fix that probably not here adelaar had relaxed all over she was back in her personal groove selling her services not for free either make me an offer the hanifa moved her feet apart set her hands on her hips and prepared to fight for your work and the files five creampink ten to eighteen grains seven corridors files out and erased eight midrose twenty grain minimum for my time one of your creampinks seven corridors two midrose for the files well have to see them to rate them guarantee of one midrose for erasing them one creampink bonus points negotiated according to how much is in the files your work one creampink eighteen to twenty grains they went back and forth for several more minutes until they settled on a price that pleased both by that time the dupe run had finished and adelaar settled to work pulling the warmaster stats dumping them in the duper and at the same time flashing them on a readout so i could look them over and get an idea if a sneakraid was doable while she was busy with this last the tall local came inside murmured something to her leader and went out again the hanifa came over to me and stood watching the stats run past adelaar was into schematics now line drawings of ship segments a guard came nosing about she said after a moment your friend stunned him he said to tell you it was part of the standard rover pattern he was expecting the man it doesnt look like anyone is exercised about the scanners going out the guard was normalalert not hyper i hear you i checked my chron again seemed like wed been down here a year or two but it was just over an hour theres a shift change coming up in a little while wed better be gone by then you seem to know a lot about what happens here im a cautious man hanifa i like to know what im stepping in how observation and experience observation electronic surrogates you recorded what they told you im a cautious man hanifa willing to sell it not worth much once top security here wakes up to what happened therell be changes tell you what ill throw that into the pot with your suspect files a little sweetener why call it good will now that i know about you and what youve got to offer i plan to be back do some trading for this and that rosepearls naturally and whatever else seems worth the trip she gave me an odd look and moved off like she hadnt thought through what it meant us being there not until now there was a big wild universe out there and she didnt know how she felt about linking up with it maybe a touch of panic i pulled my mind back to what was happening on the screen in front of me it was looking good total complement was around two hundred and more than half of those were support and services whores cooks valets you name it everything you needed to keep three score techs sech snoops and guards happy in their isolation no wonder they didnt notice us they wouldnt have noticed a grenade in their laps to quote one of pels favorite expressions why favorite i havent a notion some kink in his psyche i suppose most of the ship was mothballed my palms were starting to itch cumpla doomp i wanted that ship there was no way i could afford her the fuel bills alone would be enough to bankrupt a small empire but taking it would be so easy for a minute i indulged in fantasies of charging across the universe with the power of a god under my hands then i shook myself back to reality probably wasnt enough fuel in her tanks to get her across the system let alone to the nearest fuel dump i still didnt like the thought of trying to nose up to that whale without it noticing me hmm the guards were rotated every halfyear local that meant we could probably pick up someone whod been up there recently and knew the drill the screen blanked i looked around thats it adelaar said how long have i got shift change ninetyfive minutes pels got a guard but he says theres no fuss yet dont dawdle over anything you can doubleclik even doubling its going to take the better part of an hour to finish and thats saying i dont screw up somewhere and have to start over i hear i slid out of the chair dont push it ill see what i can do about arranging a meet with our client so we can get paid for this you do that she bent over the eviscerated terminal forgetting me and everything else but what she was doing i went to pump the hanifa and her women for everything i could get about the local setup ondar a hissing whisper the hanifa sprang to her feet as the tall one leaned in the door the fuzzy says he hears lots of men coming toward us and hes going to see about slowing them up but you should be ready to move i sat where i was wondering what the hanifa would do about this i thought itd likely be something with flair she was that kind of leader she moved quickly to adelaar where are you covering my tracks how much longer five minutes before i can leave the brain on its own to finish the job how much of it can we destroy without negating what youve done worried about them wondering what youve been doing dont ive laid in clues that will tell them you pulled the suspect files that gives you a reason enough for being here so they wont look all that hard in other directions they wont find the loops not without some rather esoteric well call it logic even id have trouble undoing what ive done the hanifa examined adelaar then me her jawline hard through the silky knit of the cowl do you need backup to get you out of here no do you no she hesitated in case im not able to meet you someone else will be there hordar for sure could be a man or a woman he or shell say she looked around remembering suddenly that there might be ears tuned to this place that hadnt been there before dont bother yourself about snoops cant happen del has blocked access to the interface i hear still um he or she will show you this she jerked up the shoulder drape on her cowl pulled a medallion on a chain from under her black shirt she let me look at both sides then tucked it away again it was an oval of dark bronze with an odd bumpy pod on one side and a complicated double glyph on the other nice piece were going to leave she said before were trapped in here she swung back to adelaar what about the scanners theyre down again i sent an oversurge through when they try to fix them the techs will find ive cut them off completely from the mainbrain the sech wont be able to get them functioning again until he regains control of the interface adelaar was looking smugly pleased with herself and so she should but there was a condescension in her voice which the hanifa wasnt appreciating if your transport cant reach you before they get organized up top you might head for the lakeside wall either go over it or cut through one of the gates there dont worry about alarms the melters the west wall is off the firing circuits for the next two hours ive set up some snares the techs will find um interesting avoiding them will cost time if you can reach your pilot let her know that she paused and the hanifa started to turn away one moment more after you get loose from here youve got a free run for a while ive fiddled something else blocked all contact with the warmaster i cant shut her out permanently there are too many possibilities for reinstating the link as soon as the sech reaches her hell have her scanners looking for you be careful they dont get a focus on you theyll fry you once they get a lock they can track a flea on a dogs back even if the man operating them has less brain than that flea its not quite as bad as it sounds when the power is ratcheted that high the field is very narrow so if you can get under cover before they do the first coarse scan you should be safe enough questions no thats it then luck kiss you sweet eh gods blessings akilla yabass ill give our hanifa this she wasnt stingy with her gratitude she didnt even seem to be swallowing hard when she called our adelaar a welcome stranger and wisewoman nada adelaar went back to work with a small army about to land on us she wasnt wasting more time on chat the hanifa rounded up her women with an imperious sweep of her arm and took them outside i unlimbered the launchtube fed it a clip and followed her one of the raiders was more squarely built than the others with broad shoulders and heavy arms shed been lugging around a powerful crossbow which id wondered about it seemed a clumsy thing on a jaunt like this now she loaded it with a fourpoint grapple and aimed it upward at one of the windows our hanifa was a lady with flair no scrambling through ratholes for her the woman loosed the bolt and it rose through a graceful arc going up and up four levels up until it crashed through the glass and looped down outside carrying a thin knotted rope with it a hard tug set the hooks two of the raiders went at the rope like it led to the promised land and started swarming up it the shooter slapped a second ropebolt in the slot hit the next window over slapped in a third put it through the third window whap whap whap steady as a metronome she thrust her arm through the bows carrystrap and ran at the last rope the hanifa sketched a salute in my direction ill leave this one for you she started climbing pels came scooting down the ramp back in hull mode little more than a ripple across the stone on my tail he yelled his whoop filling the chamber with echoes hed been rambling around that maze interfering with the arrangements of the guardforce and hed won us the extra few minutes that let the women get a good start up the ropes i put a couple of darts into the tunnel opening and blew down enough rubble to close it off i started plinking the other exits one by one blowing out their sides and ceiling things got touchy after id done five of them the roof started groaning and shifting it was an open question whether itd come down on us before i finished sealing off the inlets there was a lot of yelling and cursing coming through the noise of the falling stone and someone in one of the tunnels managed to get off some heatseeker missiles but pels knocked those down before they got anywhere adelaar came out peculiar quale i didnt believe it till i ran it twice the warmasters mainbrain is slaved to this one i set a passive tap one i can juice from the tug tell you later she eyed the billowy pouf of dust with disfavor how do we get out of here the hanifa left us a rope i pointed to it and swallowed a grin shed opted out of some of the lastphase planning too impatient to sit through another bullshit session so she didnt know the emergency bolt hole wed come up with how nice im supposed to go up that thing with this load nope were taking pittipats private route pels all clear just dust and cobwebs all praise to paranoia pels came from behind the throne grinning and brushing at his ruffled notfur the hole was a stupid breach in security when we saw it the first time we thought it had to be some kind of subtle trap kumari flaked that part of the eyefeed and went over it cell by cell tracing out every branch all she found was dust and dark pels tripped the lock on the panel circled around us and led us up a wormhole that was barely wide enough to clear our elbows and so low i was almost bent in half it split and split again but the direction sense he was born with and the practice he got as a scruffy cub scatting about his native subterras kept him on course you couldnt lose him anywhere underground we fetched up at the theater close to where we started emerging through the back wall of the imperatorial box the tiers of seats were groaning and shivering as they would at the tail end of an earthquake and the flags in the well shifted under our feet but the theater wasnt going to collapse there was a lot of hoohaw in the gardens outside it parachute flares bursting over us spotlights stabbing through fog that was even thicker than itd been when we came in yowling cats and howling men rushing about god knows what they thought they were doing nothing much in here with us just one guard and his brace of cats he tried potting me but i suppose i wasnt much more than a moving blot because he didnt come close thats the problem with pellet guns when you miss you miss completely i got him with the stunner and pels took care of the cats we swung onto the stage i was worried about the miniskips briefly afraid the cats had sniffed them out but they were where we left them the only problem was they were slimy with condensation we strapped ourselves onto the belly pads and took off for the canyon i was tired enough to sleep a week and i suspected the others were about the same though adelaar would never admit it and pels hid everything under his fur on second thought maybe he was just getting unlimbered and was sorry the fight was over it wasnt often he had a workout that used him up not that this skirmish had we were going to lay up at the canyon for a few days let things cool down and the warmaster go back to sleep before we left for base i spent a minute or so thinking about the hanifa and several more minutes savoring the memories i had of rosepearls and the taste of all that lovely gratitude that was going to grease the way when i came back to open this market the rest of the trip i drowsed letting the miniskip fly herself in windskimmerslipping away from the swirling swarm of hornets at the imperatorial palaceover lake golgastorm breaking about them the airship plunged south through what felt like the heart of the storm though it wasnt quite everything karrel goza knew about flying said get out of there but he stayed over the lake in spite of the danger so he could minimize the chance someone would hear the motors and talk about it from what he saw when he dipped to the jetty and dropped the ladders for elmas and the others there was going to be trouble for anyone the grand sech found someplace they had no business being he didnt want to drag a trail to inci lightning crackled around them hed had the cuuxtwok on this far afraid the techs would get the palace scanners working again but thered been no pulse wigglers slipping along its surface so they hadnt done it yet he shut the field off he didnt know its properties but he thought it might attract a strike windskimmer didnt have sufficient lift to rise clear of the storm she was taking enough of a beating without the threat of being crisped by lightning turbulent aircurrents battered at them even worse there were sudden pockets that dropped them into sheeted rain which pounded on them and drove them toward the icy water invisible below them karrel gazas body was battered and bruised from the restraining straps hed jammed his fingers repeatedly as he fought to keep skimmer upright one nail had a deep tear the panel in front of him jerked and vibrated impossible to read anything on it he was working from feel and memory blessing the prophets benevolence for giving him so much flying time in this airship that he knew her like he knew his own body dimly he was aware of the isyas squealing as they were flung from side to side even when they tried to hang onto the weatherstraps the yawing lurches sent them rolling into each other elmas ofka was cursing in spasms as she tried to get control of her chair from the corner of his eye he saw enough to realize the brake had snapped and the chair was wobbling and swinging erratically it could come loose and do someone serious injury if he couldnt get this lumbering yunk to climb higher all things end two hours later the airship beat through the fringes of the storm and settled into a steady drone karrel goza clicked on the autopilot and went limp with relief he turned his head a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth elmas ofka was struggling to sit up holding the chair steady with her shoulder harli tanggаr crouched beside her working at the jammed clamps on the restrainers lirrit ofka came and leaned on the back of his chair her breath warm against his ear there were times there were he clicked off the straps began sucking at his torn finger he watched harli wipe elmas ofkas face and tip some visk into her mouth from a pouchflask he tilted his head back smiled up at lirrit you got one of those she laughed and passed him her flask the thick sour drink ran down his throat and warmed some of the soreness and fatigue from his aching body he snapped the lid down on the leather covered bottle and returned it to her what happened back there you remember those things that went past us aliens outside aliens where the slave ships come from uh they were after the mainbrain too one of them lost her daughter shes here to get her back you talked to them talked and talked there was time for it she was almost glowing she was so excited she was teasing him with it making him ask he caught one of her hands put her finger in his mouth and bit down on it she giggled and pulled his hair so tell me he said we are going to take the warmaster we are are are how elli did it she hired them rosepearls kar theyve got a ship theyll ferry us up and get us in she pressed her forefinger against his cheek ones a man big man if i danced with him id bang my nose on his beltbuckle he did the bargaining middle finger theres the woman she plays tunes on that brain like jirsy does on her shal her breath tickled his ear as she laughed in little soundless gasps she doesnt know it elli didnt tell her but her daughters living at the mines youve met her the one called aslan the teacher were keeping her as a kind of hostage elli doesnt trust them much third finger theres the cutest little furry being she reached over his shoulder and flattened her hand on his stomach below the spring of his ribs hed come about here on you she brought the hand back to his shoulder began kneading the hard tense muscles there you ought to see him kar big brown eyes the softest sweetest fur makes you want to pick him up and cuddle him her hands stilled for a moment except it isnt really fur when he wants it changes color and everything so you just cant see him he went across a floor like he was part of it and whap the guard was down and out didnt see a thing doesnt sound very cuddly theyre going to meet us on gerbek island nine days on you can see what i mean then he grunted saw elmas ofka watching them you dont trust them its not a question of trust greed young kar her mouth moved into a twisted grin greed well give them enough this time to make them hungry for more they wont be so apt to cut us down if they plan on coming back and theres always the daughter she frowned were not lost anymore kar she sounded troubled and uncertain not at all the dalliss elmas ofka who walked in power unfettered and formidable that man and his crew are just the first wave theres going to be a lot more like him before were dead and goneborn and back i dont know how anythings going to turn out any more i used to know she closed her eyes started to lean back but changed her mind when the chair started to wobble atch even this she slapped at the chair arm everythings bound to change tidal wave of change how am i going to ride it kar how are any of us going to keep from being drowned in it he stared at the knotty darkness rushing past outside not lost any longer people knowing about us outsiders coming here changing us changing everything it was like standing naked on the speakers minaret with a mob muttering in the circle below he shivered then winced as his bruises stung him lirrit ofka muttered something he didnt catch her hands were warm on his shoulders working more of the tension out of him was lirrit right are they going to ferry us to the warmaster yes so what do we do when we get there what do you think take it i suppose somehow according to the brain theres only a handful of techs a few huvveds to run things and a squad of noses to keep them all honest the rest are support two hundred counting whores take a big hand to close round two hundred shifts kar like the retting shed where youre working now one third on duty one third playing one third sleeping none of them expecting trouble a score of us could take her i could lay my hands on twice that many in less than a week he nodded i know them at the mine jamber fausses raiders the dalliss web give you two weeks and youd have a hundred or more thing is he smoothed his thumb over and over the torn nail who can you trust once theyre up there he scowled at her and what are we going to do with that horror once weve got it i know she sighed shook her head if it werent so pathetic itd be funny we cant kick pittipat out if we dont take the ship so we have to take the ship but we cant operate her and we cant trust anyone who can operate her because theyd take her away from us and wed be worse off than we are now and we cant stay put and hold her because we dont know how to work the defenses so any rockbrain bitbit whos been up there and knows how to push a button could take her from us and we cant tell the aliens thanks but some other time when we know what were doing because the next clutch of visitors might be types thatd make a huvved torturegeek look like a nursery nana karrel goza leaned into lirrits hands comforted by her strong fingers weve talked a lot about taking the ship but whoever expected us to do it after a moments heavy silence he said what about nceegh from what i saw all he wants is to get back to his workshop he does now but what would happen if he had all that power in his hands that changes everything kar tell you true i wouldnt trust me with that ship if i knew how to work her would you trust yourself i mean he didnt try answering her he didnt have to if there was some way we could get rid of her weve got a month to think of something the man said he wouldnt take us up until he finished collecting the folk hes come for kar yeh dont tell anyone about this not yet geres duvvar and some of my cousins know about the raid if i dont give them something itll be worse than kicking over a karints nest well have them swarming about us trying to find out what happened mm she stared past him fingertips tracing a merm scar tell them this the female alien pulled all the suspect files from the mainbrain then she wiped them out of memory so whatever the grand sech doesnt have as hard copy is gone shes printing the files for us so well know how much he knows and what he suspects and shes set up some safe corridors into the palace well be getting the stats for those and passing them on to whoevers interested that ought to satisfy anyone who cares to ask what time is it the board clock has quit on us she frowned and where are we weve got around an hour till dawn the storm slowed us a lot we havent reached north bayshore yet we cant make the mines before sunup no way well have to find someplace to lay up unless you want to risk day flying too dangerous if we ran straight east for an hour whered we come out cant go straight east skimmer cant go head on against the wind out there its blowing a gale still he tapped the glass over the fuel readout look at this even beating to the southeast well be running on fumes in the emergency tank before we have land under us well have to leave her anchored somewhere until we can pack in fuel why not let the wind take us to the west shore thats daz musved the fehdaz there has a strangle hold on his people i dont dare show my face anywhere around remember the price on my head besides the land is too open close to the coast we couldnt hide skimmer and hope to get her back and we need her whats all this about hiding her why cant we just find a spot where people dont go and anchor her because once the grand sech strips the blocks the woman set in the brain hell order the warmaster to scan the country around gilisim she warned me that would happen that wed better go to ground as soon as we could if we can tuck her out of sight there wont be anything for the scanners to see that reminds me theyll probably rake through places like the mine jirsy um youve got kin round the north end of the bay havent you in daz kanath ive got some pelticindiz cousins living at kuntepe cove you know where that is kar close to where the incis drop down to the sea isnt it i took a girl there for a daysail the week before i was adulted i think it was kuntepe right why elli i want you to get to a com where you can send a warning to ansla civa at the mine so she can spread the news to keep their heads down can you do that sure kar put me down near the point ill walk round to the house theyll take me in and ask no questions she was a tiny thing with a face like a sealpup and when she grinned her eyes almost disappeared theyve been stilling teshfire on the sly since settletimes and no fehdaz or any of his noses has ever caught them at it or anything else they feel like doing and no stinking bitbits about to do that now good will your cousins help you get back to gul inci oh yes one of these days im probably going to marry imro peltic and even if that wasnt so none of them down to little emin whos just starting to talk would say anything to any outsiders huvved or hordar doesnt matter well tell them what you have to jir and warn them to keep close to home if you can avoid it nothing about the warmaster elli no no its true this time what they dont know wont hurt them telling them that could hurt a lot i see elmas ofka fell silent for a moment tracing over and over the merm scars on her arm she was thinking hard kar you said hide hunting derrigee bols paying two to five alvs for erkelte hides when i messed up my hand goza ommar said go and dont come back till youve walked the maggos out of your belly if i could bring back a hide or two thatd be froth on the beer but she didnt expect it i could stay out another week no problem good itll take at least that long to get skimmer refueled and flown home her mouth twitched into a halfsmile maybe youll come across an erkelte and get your hide while were walking to the mine she looked down at her hands well have to expel the ballonets and let the wind carry them off collapse the bag so we can get it and the gondola under cover kar if you can nurse her that far take her up the ktep the closer we hide her to a waterway the easier itll be to resupply her depends on the wind and a favor from the prophet wouldnt hurt do the best you can dont i always find another place to sit before i swing round this could get rough he reached for the restrainers clicked the catches shut wincing as the straps pressed against his bruises he waited until lirrit and elmas were settled then he began easing the nose around heading toward the northeast bend of the bay and the inci hills ix months std after adelaar aici arash hired swardheld quale and his crew aslan as fugitive living at the mines the flarescreen spread across the wall inside the old smelter most of the smelters machinery had been salvaged for scrap when the mine shut down the building itself was in fair shape its brick walls were massive its tiled concrete roof cracked but otherwise intact a year ago when parnalees spectacles had first appeared and were beginning to attract a considerable audience some of the middlers among the hordar exiles had plastered the walls and ceiling inside and pasted yosstarp over the plaster to make the huge room lightproof others had picked up a comset in the course of a raid on a raz strongroom and installed it here with a sunlight pickup and storage cells as its power source the floor was littered with cushions and mats left here permanently because the smelter had become one of the favored meeting places for the younger exiles a combination tavern and dance floor and showcenter the greater part of the rebels and the outcasts were late middlers and young adults fourteen through thirtyfive hordar at their most energetic and prideful male and female in nearly equal numbers they came from every part of settled tairanna from the duzzulkas from the sea farms from the east coast west coast south coast littorals even some up from guneywhiyk the south continent desperate enough to chase a whisper life on guneywhiyk was even more constricted than it was here in the north three days after elmas ofka took her isyas to raid the palace aslan strolled into the smelter and settled on a cushion in one of the corners apart from the others like most of the escaped slaves she lived in amiable contiguity with the rebel hordar but this tolerance was a policy based on the needs of the rebels not real acceptance she had to be careful to avoid triggering the xenophobe that lay not so far beneath every hordar skin it was dark out supper was over and the cleanup finished this was the hour when hordar in the cities went to the dance floors or into the taverns when parties began and lovers jumped the walls to meet in delicious secrecy it was the eve of gun peygam the day of the prophet the one day in seven the kuzeywhiyker pradites set aside for rest and meditation the eve of gun peygam was the day parnalee chose for his weekly broadcasts aslan twisted open the flask of tea shed brought filled the lidcup and sat with her back against the wall sipping tea and watching the screen as the warning eye appeared then dissolved into a play of color the rebels were drifting in exchanging scrip for drinks and food from the bar at one side wandering about until they found a group they felt like joining or an empty mat where they could make their own group because they came from different places there were frictions lots of frictions clawfights and fist fights hurt feelings and hurt bodies but their joint hatred of the huvved helped smooth down the worst lumps and gradually these hordar from everywhere were beginning to think of themselves as tairannin rather than incers or brindarin or whatever at the request of the council that was attempting to govern this patchwork settlement aslan had devised several strategies for diffusing hostility these seemed to be working well enough to keep the everincreasing population at the mines from flying into fragments the color flow took on shape and definition changing into a swirl of male and female dancers filling the screen with explosive movement timed to a music more guessed at than heard parnalee was using her data here as he would later on as he did in every show ignoring the distortions shed tried to introduce perhaps they were canceled out by what churri brought him it didnt matter itd taken her less than a month to recognize the futility of her attempts to buy moral absolution without giving up her comfortable life without facing and accepting the danger implicit in challenging the dominance of the huvved having recognized that weaselthink she went missing from gul inci when tra yarta sent her spying there her data yes it told him that tairannin never settled immediately to anything other than work they circled approached and shied away as if they were sniffing at each other and the air around them as if they had to get the feel of place and people before they could settle to enjoying themselves he was programming spectacular dance sequences at the beginning of each show so he could snag the eye and draw in the peripatetic viewer before the serious business of drama began churri showed up at the mines about six months after she went down the slide one day in early spring when rain was turning the world to mud and the honeycomb inside the mountain was sweating and dank he came strolling into the stubby shaft where she and xalloor were living grinned at her and went out again he usually joined them at the smelter when parnalees spectacles were on watching the shows with a contagious glee as he ran a whispered commentary on the strings the proggerdi was pulling he wasnt here now he and xalloor and her group were having a prolonged argument over their latest script thats what the note said that xalloor sent round to her before dinner if they managed to work things out before the spectacle was over theyd join her she wasnt expecting them conflict was foreplay for the bard her father probably that was what attracted him to her mother adelaars fierce and instant attack on anything that tried to control her hed quickly lost interest in aslan his daughter wasnt the kind of woman he admired and there were no shared memories of her childhood to reinforce the biotie the accidental fact of their relationship went back to being a thing of no importance to either at least that was the face she put on for him she was too experienced an observer to place any pressure on the fragile bond that still existed between them but his indifference hurt her badly there were times she woke before dawn and lay on the crude pallet unable to sleep caught in what she called the deadash grays asking why she kept on living and finding no answer the dancers melted again to streamers of light that wove a garland about a small dark man holding a stringed instrument like a cross between a lute and a lyre the rebels greeted his appearance with whistles and thumbsnapping his name went skittering about the smelter like the game ball at an ogatarka match murrebai murrebai murrebai then the room stilled to a silence so intense it seemed nobody breathed as he began to play a simple plaintive tune he finished the tune and began repeating it but somewhere in the middle his agile fingers and his agile brain took hold of it and twisted it up down around and brought it back to a simplicity no longer naive having passed through complexity as through fire and come out stripped clean and immensely strong he allowed them no time to recover but began a cheerful old child song the rebels sang with him holding on to each other many of them crying silently as they sang parnalee ah parnalee what a job hed done for tra yarta when he got here there was no such thing as an entertainment network on the coast the hordar thought in terms of family and city up in the duzzulkas family and estate they didnt care what happened outside the communal walls the huvveds arrived with other ideas but in the three centuries theyd been here a lot of hordar concepts had crept into their worldview most of them had hordar mothers though huvved boys were removed from female influence as soon as they could walk merchants talked to each other and the seches kept in touch but no one thought of using the universal comweb to deliver entertainment into the homes not before parnalee arrived murrebai bowed and strolled offstage as if he pulled it after him on invisible strings a title scrolled across the screen in carefully brushed calligraphy the calling of the prophet there was a murmur of approbation from the rebels then they settled back in pleasurable anticipation the sonorous voice of an unseen speaker rose above solemn portentous music naming the actors setting the time and place of the events to be portrayed aslan hid her smile behind the lidcup missing churri and his pungent commentary she doubted whether anyone else in that room understood how much parnalee was dumping on them mocking their sacred cows there seemed to be few skeptics on tairanna when it came to the life and teachings of their prophet the eftakites from guneywhiyk believed with equal fervor in pradix they simply had a later gloss on his teachings from their prophet eftakes she had a fair idea of what would happen to their comfortable comforting certainties when the universe outside began crowding in on them she found it rather sad there was a concerted gasp from the audience wordless cries of outrage whats he done now she thought and frowned at the screen as soon as she realized what she was seeing she felt like gasping too the actor playing the young pradix in his violent revolutionary phase was a huvved or so it seemed my god she thought hes gone too far this time in a minute though when she saw several of the councilors pushing through the disturbance she knew hed judged these people to a hair he knew what he was doing that twisted crazy monster he knew councilor belirmen indiz slapped hands against hips and roared down the mutters and shouts use your head not your gut you make me ashamed to call myself a rebel you heard that cast list any huvved patronymics on it eh any that boy up there sure he looks huvved but no huvved has given him a name eh hes got no name but one he makes for himself you know how he got that face some fehdaz got him on a servant girl and booted them both out when her time was on her you think her family did better for him eh what about when he was old enough to show his fathers face think about that i see huvved hair out there light eyes huvved ears and noses what was your life like you with those marks on you eh think about it youre here where would you be if your souls stains laid his load on you honor that middler up there for his pride and his skill and curse the father not the son he stalked back to his seat folded his arms across his chest and sat massively upright daring anyone to answer his argument parnalee ah parnalee i wonder how many houses are listening to a speech like that you dont need me or churri either you despise the men you manipulate but you understand them in some deep sadistic way better than i ever will however much i probe and study i think i am a little jealous of you i know i am afraid of you when he came out of his room after the beating he came like a storm he raged through the house tearing up whatever he could get his terrible hands around he kicked holes in the walls trampled computers into twisted wrecks he was crazier than a tantserbok driven mad by must wholly out of control with his strength and mass and his rage hed just about frightened the stiffening from her bones then abruptly standing in the center of the shattered common room he went still quiet between one breath and the next he stopped his rampage turned and walked back into his room quietly with terrible control he shut the door a day passed the second time he emerged the beast had vanished though aslan thought she saw it looking at her now and then she saw it surface and sink again when hesitating and afraid she told him of the warmaster and what it meant to them the smelter was quiet again looking around her aslan could see eyes flicking from side to side looking for those huvved marks she thought hoping no one would see huvved blood in them on the screen a battle was over the two commanders were standing face to face meeting each other as equals warrior to warrior parnalee had dug up more huvved bastards to play the empire soldiers and there was a tense silence in the room as the two men confronted each other the empires captain accepted his death at pradixs hands taking the sword thrust with a stiff nobility that made aslan hide another smile behind her hand parnalee was playing all the themes that tra yarta had asked from him but he was putting a spin on them that undercut the huvved he was playing to species memory and the depths of hordar pride deflecting their present angers only to intensity them laying a clutch of bombs for the future future as close as tomorrow maybe despite aslans training churri was aware of what the proggerdi was doing before she was she was too tangled in guilt to use her brain but once he pointed out what was happening it was obvious to her parnalee was seeding in the general population the same change that was taking place in the rebels teaching the hordar indirectly but effectively that they belonged to tairanna and had a common enemy no matter where they lived he was making possible the final overthrow of the huvved once the rebels solved the problem of the warmaster but that wasnt what he wanted oh no what he wanted was huvved dead and he didnt care what it took he teased at the hordar by slyly putting down the huvved so slyly he couldnt be pinned on it but every hordar who saw the spectacles knew what he was getting at and felt the pride and saw the possibility aslan watched and was afraid she thought of warning the council but doubted theyd believe her or understand what she was saying the best there is he told xalloor once and perhaps he was but he was also crazy and men were going to die of that insanity and she saw no way of stopping it on the screen pradix was driving himself and his men into building a funeral pyre for the enemy one by one his men began slipping away from him showing by their glances and their gestures that they thought he had cracked his head on something and let his wits run out before long he was alone sweating and struggling with the trees his men felled and left laying parnalee cut repeatedly from the madman working on that crazy magnificent pyre to shots of empire soldiers flying toward the bloody ground bent on avenging the death of their brothers xalloor slipped in and crept as quietly as she could to join aslan she dropped on the floor beside the cushion wrapped her arms about her legs and watched the play unfold with a curious double vision one part of her saw it critically judged the skill or lack of it in every aspect recognized the tricks and the cynical manipulations the lapses in taste and logic the other part was entranced by what was there that part plunged into the play until she was drowning in it surrendering like a child to sensation and emotion how those two parts could exist in xalloor simultaneously and separately without destroying each other was something aslan had never been able to understand in all the time theyd been together something xalloor had tried more than once to explain and failed each time as pradix lit the pyre and flames leaped upward the needlenosed fliers of the avenging soldiers were visible on the horizon black specks growing larger by the moment suddenly the sky darkened turned an eerie ominous greenish purple as clouds swept in from every side a funnel formed behind the fliers caught up with them beat them from the air like a maidservant killing gnats and raced on toward pradix and the pyre closer and closer it came until its blackened vortex filled most of the screen with pradix a tiny figure kneeling on the torn and trampled glass then it was gone the broken world it left behind was quiet except for the vigorous crackling of the funeral fire the small figure of the kneeling man was there still untouched shining in the dimness of the coming storm as if lit by another fire one that burned inside him a bird sang the sweetness of its song was almost unbearable there was an explosive sigh as if every lung in the smelter empties itself at the same moment otherwise the silence was unbroken parnalee youve the luck of the crazy cradling you aslan thought i cant believe tra yarta passed this one was he suckered by the casting of that boy with his huvved face and form she rubbed at her nose gulped down the tea left in the cup it was cold but the small bitterness was a satisfying counter to the fantasy on the screen a headache began at the back of her skull she rubbed at her nape closed her eyes how long does this go on she thought wheres churri she slitted an eye and sneaked a look at xalloor have you two decided to split the dancer looked placid as a sleeping lizard but that didnt mean much she was sunk in the spectacle and nothing else mattered somehow pradix had changed from a fighter to a poet shed missed the transition while she was fussing but wasnt much bothered by that he wasnt the prophet yet but he was getting close hed acquired three men with assorted instruments and a rough cart with straw sticking out all over pulled along by a team of yunks painted battleship gray with vertical black stripes since parnalee had thrown in tarmac highways kept in top condition and a swarm of small black vehicles rushing along them at near supersonic speeds not to mention the vast assortment of fliers that passed by overhead the reason for that cart with its twoyunk propulsion system escaped her she poured some more tea she needed a touch of reality or shed start giggling and get herself lynched from the looks on the faces around her he was going from village to village mixing sedition with preaching poetry with politics escaping again and again just before soldiers landed on the town building toward a finale that got the rebels on their feet shouting out the words to the poem he was chanting in the ancient workers vag that was the basis for the hordar they all spoke today apparently it was a poem everyone here knew probably one of those shed sent churri hunting way back in that other life the kind no huvved ever heard reluctantly she got to her feet with the rest but she refused to chant with them pradix the poet stood on the carts bed straw about his feet music on three sides yesil uranyi perched on the front drums going tam tam tummm toom saadi klemm on his left twee twee tootle too ooh wandering flute and on his right scree ooh wee singee

wiggling through the crowd heading for the door aslan blinked then followed crossing against the streams of adults who were moving toward the bar some of the older middlers were kicking the mats and cushions to one side to get ready for the dance that would go on until the musicians tuning up in a corner by the comset ran out of wind others were standing around throwing verses back and forth a kaleidoscope of clashing sounds a number of the younger middlers werent waiting for music but were already undulating in the preliminaries to one of their less comprehensible dances made aslan feel her years forget about the ananiles they couldnt return that resilience of mind that only the very young possessed the wind was picking up outside the tree limbs woven overhead groaned and creaked the stiff thick leaves rubbed against each other singing like crickets the trees grew close together blocking moonlight and starlight whoever walked this path after dark carried light with him or her and blessed the trees for they ceiled the path to the minemouth and hid the walkers on it from the warmasters wandering eye rod lights flickered like earthbound stars as clumps of middlers hurried toward the dance brushing past aslan and xalloor without taking notice of them when the rush diminished to a trickle aslan hurried to catch up with xalloor what the dancer looked round her face lit by a flash of laughter clickon clickoff there and gone she shook her head aslan sighed matched steps with her the script who won me sort of xalloor thrust her hands into the pockets of her jacket and slowed a little letting aslan light the way for them both i told them look you go and on at people like that they turn their heads off worsen that they turn you off you want em to listen you keep coming back at them all right but you sugarcoat it i mean you want to sneak it past em before they know what youre doing i said you want to see how its done look at one of those spectacles i mean really look forget about the story figure out what hes saying and how hes saying it but you got to do it better faster dont forget how quick the bitbitsll be after you youve got maybe ten minutes playing time before they locate the transfer station and trash your cassette lan you shouldve seen that script itd send a wirehead into coma when are they going to start the clandestines things keep going like they are and they get hold of some more writers which they really need believe me they natter on all the time about poets but they dont recruit any its enough to make you throw up your hands and say hell with everything amateurs couple months from now thats what the plan is three months top limit another strobe grin maybe why maybe in that tone of voice elmass back we were still arguing when she came in she wanted to talk to evvily so we broke up just as well ylazar was starting to repeat himself and that could go on till entropy took us all she say anything what the tightdown was about not in front of the nonnies no she clicked her tongue wrinkled her nose aslan sighed again the familiar little sound stabbed a weak spot she wanted her mother here scold or not wanted something from her old life she was tired so tired of improvising an existence xalloor banged on the minemouth door stepped back while the keeper slid it open just wide enough to let them through one after the other she got her lightrod out again and began almost galloping along the rough floor of the gallery heading for the lift there was a suppressed excitement about her a wiredup energy that said clearer than words she had news exciting maybe frightening news they went up two levels followed kele tunnel until they reached the stubby offshoot where theyd set up housekeeping xalloor stirred the fire to life added more coal and crouched before the grate with the bellows working with hard won expertise her first attempt at a coal fire was unalloyed disaster they had to run down a hordar who knew about sea coal and iron grates and was willing to lend a hand so they didnt freeze before morning as she coaxed tiny flames from the ashy lumps some of the dank chill went off the room it was a room there was a yosstarp ceiling wrinkled and sagging walls of wood scrap scavenged from the company houses a wooden floor covered with lignin mats that aslan had woven putting to work one of the skills shed learned a few assignments back a neat herringbone pattern that earned her some condescending praise from the much defter weavers among the outcasts shed made mats for a number of rooms like these glad to have some way of passing the time besides the scrip she earned brought her and xalloor things they couldnt have acquired otherwise like the glass and bronze oil lamps and the earthenware vase sitting on a crate in the corner by the fire the nergi flowers in it adding dark rich red and orange tones to the drab gray of the tarp and the washedout brown of the mats and the walls there were two pallets raised from the floor on crude frames that aslan and xalloor had glued together from rusty tramrails and salvaged bricks there were several cushions theyd gotten from one of the weavers in return for several weeks hard work carding yunk wool blankets issued by the council sheets were a luxury few living here could afford there was the crate which they used for storage and some smaller boxes that served as tables chilly drafts came wandering through the cracks no matter how often she or xalloor pounded caulking between the boards not down the chimney though bless the local tech hordar filters were useful for more than purifying water despite all this they were surrounded by stone and earth and that was like living inside a block of ice while the dancer fussed with the fire aslan moved round the room lifting the chimney glasses telling herself she ought to wash them one of these days trimming the wicks and lighting them these lamps burned fish oil smuggled in from the sea farms and that oil announced its origins for several minutes after the wicks were lit after that either the smell went away or their noses went on strike the soft amber light filled the room chased away the shadows and gave an illusion of warmth she poured some water in a kettle hooked out the swing spit and clamped the bail in place move over a bit loorie let me get this on so we can have some tea did you get anything to eat over there xalloor tossed the bellows aside and came to her feet in that boneless ripple that made aslan feel clumsy as a stone god its going good enough i was just trying to catch some warm she dropped onto her pallet some sandwiches i think they were might have been relics of the prophet why is it lan that earnest types never have a palate genetic i suppose aslan got to her feet brushed her hands against her trousers i thought that might happen so i begged some cold meat and rolls from prismek a minute ill fetch them she pushed past the double tarp they used as a door and tied taut once they were in for the night came back with a basket its contents wrapped in old soft cloth he had some krida he was frying for breakfast theres a sackful of those tucked under the rolls and he threw in some green meelas and some cheese to go with them i love you forever lan so tell me what it is you didnt want to say out there remember i said we were still arguing xalloor pulled a box across the slippery mat to her pallet and began laying out the feast so i didnt exactly mean we not when elmas came in there was some peculiar tea going round and it got me in the gut i was out back in the facilities listening to my insides grumble and wondering if my knees were going to work right when i finished dropping my burden well i dont need to go into that any more but what happened was when i came back churri and holz had gone off along with most the others i was ticked let me tell you i couldve used an arm to lean on right then i was moving slow and careful that mustve been why they didnt hear me and stop talking she popped a krida in her mouth and crunched happily at it rolling her eyes with pleasure at the taste loorie dearie dai im pay shunt xalloor scooped out a handful of the krida and sat with her fingers crooked about the succulent fishlets pay and play outsides in here and now not bolodo aslan closed her eyes after a moment she heard a hissing as the water boiled and a few drops landed on the coals she kicked a cushion across to the box hooked the kettle away from the fire as she made the tea she did her best to notthink notfeel behind her she could hear xalloor eating steadily and was grateful the dancer didnt feel like talking right then she left the tea steeping stood leaning against the crate her elbows behind her resting on the top outsides in you hear what elmas n the isyas were after my students said she was going to blow the brain get rid of the sechs files make as much trouble as she could yah thats where she n the isyas ran into em hmm aslan lifted the strainer inspected the tea and decided it was ready she carried pot and bowls to the box folded herself down onto the cushion and poured tea for herself and xalloor she cradled her bowl between her hands glad of the warmth and the heaviness it gave her something to hold onto exactly what did you hear loorie le me see im supposed to be good with dialog you been in the depot you know how its laid out we were in the big room so we could walk through a scene whenever we fixed something and see how it played theres tarp hung all over makes it hot sometimes but no one fusses about that she held up one of the krida fryings all right for fish but me id rather not eh theres a couple of old minecars in there lot of junk you had to navigate it in the dark youd end up with two broken legs and your face pushed in what i mean we dont try to light the whole place so theres lots of shadows and its easy to get lost round the edges well i wasnt trying to get lost it was just i wasnt making much noise and walking along like i was my grandmother after she outwore her ananiles i fetched up by one of the cars and decided id better lean against it for a minute felt nice and cool against my face i started to feel better they were talking all that time but i wasnt listening until i heard outsiders in that tone of voice you know when someones about to be shoved head down in shit and it wont be the locals being it was elmas speaking and considering how the council crawls around her i got interested fast i thought she was talking about us she broke off to sip at the tea aslan moved one hand carefully from the cup pressed her heated palm against her mouth when the heat was gone she lowered the hand who was there um elmas that pilot whats his name itll come back to me in a minute one of her isyas the one thats living here all the time now lirrit i thinks her name evvily and ylazar pilot ah i knew id get it karrel goza yah he didnt say anything he doesnt talk much anytime ylazar said something i didnt hear it his back was to me and you know how he mumbles the woman warned us elmas said we had to get skimmer undercover she said or lose her she said ylazar falyan we need a boat and yoss pods and enough fuel to fill skimmers tanks we need it tonight she said ylazar said something i didnt hear that time either didnt need to hear it you know him if theres anything he hates worse than moving its moving fast do it she said now she gave him the mean eye and he got to his feet and went out muttering to himself xalloor grinned she say hop they jump and dont bother asking how high the pilot he got up and went out after laza said nothing just left before they were out the door elmas started on evvily get word out she said the woman jigged the brain and set up open corridors for anyone who wants over the wall in or out no melters no alarms no defenses at all ill get time place and duration at the meeting with the outsiders give it to you for distribution soon as we get back here evvily wasnt about to be tramped on like ylazar do you trust her she said its your word going to guarantee this she said she makes a fool of you it hurts us all xalloor jumped up and danced over to the storage crate she got out the stone bottle with the rix brandy they kept for celebrating small triumphs came back more soberly her face and body shouting her nervousness give me your bowl she said why always asking questions arent you just for once do what i say eh more apprehensive than ever aslan swallowed the last of the cold tea and passed over the bowl xalloor poured in enough brandy to cover the bottom drink that now yes mama loor xalloor gave herself a scant teaspoon of the brandy pushed the cork back in and settled on her pallet where was i evvily was saying do you trust her right xalloor sipped at the brandy eyes closed elmas laughed i dont need to trust her she said i have two good locks on her the outsiders want trade with us they cheat us now and that shuts down on them fast she said rosepearls she said they want them like most people want air to breathe she said and theyve come to take back the slaves bolodo sold pitapat she said the woman more than the others her daughter is a slave she said shes here to get her back aslan felt sick she bent over until her forehead was resting on the box cha i knew this was going to happen xalloor came round the box on hands and knees lifted aslan against her held her with her face tucked into the curve between neck and shoulder she held aslan until her shuddering stopped stroking her back smoothing a gentle hand over and over her short dark hair finally aslan sighed and pushed away she filled her bowl again and drank the brandied tea for its double warmth go on she said not much on to go soon as she said that i thought of you and what you told me about your mum then i thought hunh dont jump so fast loor lots of daughters hauled off here im one myself though my mum wouldna crossed a street to fetch me home evvily was still being hard to convince she might have lied she said she might have been playing games with you no elmas said the daughter is here now at the mines aslan she said well hold her that way we can be sure the mother does what shes promised just then that idiot mustakin came slamming back in forgot his overcloak they stopped talking i suppose elmas thought shed said all she needed to anyway they went out after musti by that time id forgotten the shakes and i took off as soon as i was sure no one would land on me so there it is your mum is here looking for you theyre not going to tell me about her are they nuh or her about you what you going to do snoop theres a meeting aslan grinned suddenly riding high be a hoot if i turned up there and said hi mom pass that bottle and lets celebrate the ridaar unit had three voiceactivated pinears ilddas in university jargon inconspicuouslongdistancedatacollectors aslan slipped one into the mine chamber the council used for their private meetings she got one into elmas ofkas quarters the third she hesitated over for some time but she finally decided to keep it reserved for anything that turned up in the feed from the other two on the night of the day she planted the ilddas the night after gun peygam she came back alone after supper and played over what theyd picked up and transmitted to the ridaar there wasnt much from the ear in elmas ofkas quarters but in the material from the other she found the dalliss report to the special council meeting and the discussion afterward she learned the date and place of the next meeting with the outsiders she learned about the plan to attack the warmaster and the role she was meant to play in that hostage the breathing equivalent to a handful of rosepearls sold again she told herself when she heard that a slave is a slave is a slave time crawled she felt the feet of every minute walking across her skin inescapable tickling torment she taught her history seminar and kept her body easy and her face blank with an effort of will that left her drained there was an itchiness in her students that she found hard to ignore they stank of conspiracy their questions were perfunctory or prods to get her talking on subjects all round the secret that excited them she could not notice that excitement because she was not supposed to know about the plan to seize the warmaster how many rebellions have you studied doctoriyabass too many to narrate ive told you about three if youll remember examples of what can happen the genocide on alapacsin iii the greatfather uprising on tuufyak the placids on ceeantap if i have time the next few weeks ill fill some cassettes with what i remember of other violent changes in leadership show you variations on those three types of outcome which do you think well have here doctoriyabass depends on you and how you look at things please remember people are capable of almost anything in the name of good whats wrong with that doctoriyabass so its a game eh whack your teacher eh look to your prophet and learn seems to me he said a thing or two about ends and means at the start all rebellions are rather much the same i know ive told you to avoid generalization its lazy thinking but even thats not always true they begin with passion and ideals fire in the belly ambition in the brain you young hordar thats you im talking about and they begin because there is a need that grows until it explodes one day there you have the inklins you here at the mines youre playing touch and run games you tease the huvved because you cant afford to slaughter them the inklins on their yizzies are playing a deadlier game theyve nothing to lose these feral children are a lit fuse unless you can damp it theyll force the huvved to destroy everything youre trying to save huvved are crazy doctoriyabass are they that crazy if they destroy us they destroy themselves alapacsin three read your notes i have a cassette i want you to see some of you may remember the speaker you can explain to the others later make notes if you wish the segment is quite short i am kalakallampak a mon of the bahar i have been here on tairanna a slave for more than twelve years the morz was sitting on his cot his back against the wall his heels dug into the thin mattress as he talked he was knitting producing something shapeless using the rhythmic swings of his hands to subdue the fury that knotted his jaw and set the veins throbbing at his temples yet when he spoke his gravelly voice was mild almost serene in the beginning my servitude weighed lightly on me i was permitted to spend much time in the open ocean when i studied the sea life and collected samples part of the day and part of the day i played enjoying myself in water as fine as any i can remember he lowered his hands bowed head and torso toward the lens for which i honor the hordar who demand such purity i was content though not happy who can be happy forcibly separated from those he loves but it was endurable then the fehdaz who bought me died and his successor was a fussy nervous little cretin who was distressed at the thought of property so valuable roaming about loose i was forbidden the open sea and i started to suffer day by slow day i grew heavier with anger and physical pain until my days were dreary and my nights were worse and sleep was fickle and had to be courted during those years when salt smell on the wind was all i had of the sea and a brine tub all that kept my body whole i searched for a way to keep my mind more supple than my misfortunate body the habit of decades gave me the answer i am as much a scholar by temperament as i am a technician by training i began watching gul brindar day and night i found ways to see what was happening to the city i set the things i saw and heard into the manyleveled intricately nuanced watersong of my people polishing the periods of my mindbook into a poetry of sound and sense writing into my memory the recent history of ayla gul brindar eyes closed he scratched absently at his wrists then fumbled at the wool the veins at his temples pulsed visibly after a moment he lifted the needles and began knitting again for three years i did this then one day there was a moment when i was loose upon the cliffs of brindar with no one near enough to stop me i did not care if i lived or if i died i jumped and fell a hundred yards into a clash of rocks and weed and incoming tide survived and swam the three thousand miles to surface here you ask me to tell you my mindbook i will do that though turning the tale into the airgroan of hordaradda erases all its grace the troubles have their seed in things done long before bolodo brought me here i cannot speak of them this is what i saw myself five years ago the treatment of yoss fibers was introduced a slave like me was given a task and did it and in the doing crumbled what was already cracking because yunk wool rotted in the depots waiting for a buyer many and many a landbound hordar was pushed off the raz where his family had been generation on generation back to the landing time where could they go the marginal lands would not support them there were many already claiming those young single men took their hunger to littoral cities that glimmered with promise though that promise proved as illusory and fragile as soap bubbles hungry families followed them the cities began to bulge with dispossessed grasslanders they took any work they could get so they could feed themselves and their children took work from little families living was already precarious for the city poor those not affiliated with great families were as hungry as the grasslanders who were not welcome or well treated he was rocking gently back and forth like the sea rocking back and forth his eyes were still closed the needles clicked and clashed the wood twitched and ran through his fingers the duzzulkerin what coin they had they were not about to waste on rent in cities there are always and ever empty buildings they lived in these until they were driven out one family two ten wherever there was an empty corner their unwilling landlords would call the city wards and evict them but in a day or so or a week more families would come to take their places and when these moved on more again would come until finally the landlords gave up trying to reclaim their property and began charging rent which sometimes they managed to collect incivility increased city fought grassland with fists and worse hordar are not violent they are much like my folk in that but there is a limit beyond which you cannot push them especially youngers unseasoned by age and learning the unsteady youngers who looking forward see only a bleakness growing worse incivility was bred in the bare and boring shelters that would never be homes where duzzulka youngers were left alone to pass the days however they could it would not happen to the least and poorest of the morze bahar i take pride in that plenty and poverty are shared alike morz to morz and children are hard won a joyful blessing when karinikarm bore my son and daughter i swam with her and stayed with her to care for them until they could leave the water and walk upon the land breathing the thick wet air into new soft lungs a full year i stayed with her and them leaving work weaving joy into the wide communal song schooling on this world is family business where the families cannot do it the children are unschooled when their parents work all day and half the night for a meager sum that barely keeps them fed and clothed how are they to teach their children to read and write and figure if they never learned themselves how are they to teach grasslander youngers and city youngers alike they are ignorant and unlettered they are wasted is there no one who understands this is there no one out there who will find a cure for this obscenity he put the knitting down and rested fists on it gazed grimly into the lens his stare an accusation when he spoke the gravelly voice was hard with scorn is it so strange so unexpected that these so abandoned children melded in gangs and learned city ways in city streets is it so strange that they met there gangs of city poor youngers who heard their elders cursing the grasslanders who stole their jobs is it so strange they fought these children of the streets is it so strange they learned to rage at landlords and city wards and most of all at the huvved fehz is it so strange for youngers looking at the struggles of their kin and the slow slipping of their elders lives is it so strange that they are filled with rage at everyone and everything that they covet and seize what they cannot hope to earn that they destroy what they cannot hope to seize is it so strange that these youngers call themselves inklins which means the unremembered that they come to despise themselves as failures and worthless and turn that despite against the world he stopped talking pressed his fingertips against his eyes for over a minute he sat very still his dark leathery skin twitching in several places when he spoke he had put aside his agitation his voice was mild again they are not stupid these inklins only unlearned some are very clever indeed it was an inklin who made the first yizzy a boy in gul mei or sometimes the story says gul brindar or sometimes gul samlikkan a boy dreamed of flying but lacked the guildfee for his training so he stole yoss pods and bundled them in a bag net which also he stole and tied the net to a broomstick and strapped a minimotor which of course he stole to that stick and he flew he leaned toward the lens his face intent his eyes glowing as if he wanted to force his listeners to understand what he was saying the idea also flew west to east east to west within the year inklins in all parts of the littoral were building yizzies for themselves within two years inklin gangs were having skyfights at first they used sticks to bang away at each other then they made spears then another clever inklin some say it was a girl tired of getting banged about discovered how to spray fire from a hose the gas inside yoss pods is hydrogen remember there were mornings when the city was full of charred flesh and the screams of the not quite dead even before i left it was not only inklin flesh that burned sometimes the yizzy inklins drop fire on houses and factories and when they feel like it on the fekkris a huvved in the street after dark is a target whenever inklins fly the fehdaz sends slaves to clean up when the mess is really bad and he does not want the extent of it to make the whisper circuit incivility increases the cities are burning bit by bit what the inklins do not destroy the huvved will already they see poor folk as sharks circling them ready to attack the time will come when they see every hordar poor or not as enemy when the only easing of their terror will come when theres no one left for them to fear i see the time coming when the warmaster will glide from city to city melting cities into bedrock slag i am uncomfortable here away from the ocean i go to the sea farms if they are fortunate they will survive the burning should the huvved go entirely mad they can scatter their barges and wait out the storm may the data flow freely for you aslan atowashe may your days be filled with meaning does this answer that question of yours hayal halak i knew all that doctoriyabass if you knew why did you ask you sound very serious today doctoriyabass boring you mean oh no wed never say that go on tell us more that was not boring no depressing tell us something positive tell us about the rebels that win doctoriyabass im going to be boring again and depressing but listen to me anyway the rebels that pull it off theyve done the easiest part war simplifies things choices are stark after the wars over well life gets at them chews them down people dont change not really there are no instant angels ideology is for arguing about in bars its hopeless as a guide for government right thinking just does not do it backsliding seems to be a necessary condition for intelligence if the rebels who survive and are running things havent allowed for that theres fury and frustration and repression and things end up the way they were before or worse and if they allow for frailty doctoriyabass with a little luck and a lot of good will they go on sometimes things get better sometimes worse worse for whom doctoriyabass thats the question isnt it a question you have not answered doctoriyabass a question i dont have to answer a question i cant answer its all yours young hordar as she went through her ordinary round she chewed over what the ears told her and tried to decide what she wanted to do she had a choice she could stay here and be quite comfortable she could pretend she didnt know what was happening she could teach her seminars act as consultant to the council flake everything that happened as a record of a rebellion in progress an opportunity few of her colleagues had had it was the sensible thing to do wasnt it it was adolescent claptrap this sense that she would be somehow debased if she let the hordar and elmas ofka hold her hostage trick her mother four days it wasnt much time four days to get ready to be at that meeting or not that night she talked with churri and xalloor her mind still unsettled her inclination to go not much stronger than her inclination to stay churri rested his head in xalloors lap crossed his legs at the ankle trouble yah he said wont last if you go council isnt going to tell anyone what you did itd make them look bad incompetent no polits going to let that idea get around if he can help it chilled by a touch of the ashgrays aslan watched the fire crawl over the coals and fought to keep her pride intact xalloors decision to stay behind with churri left her feeling very alone and more than a little let down after a minute she said wouldnt stop them dropping you and xalloor down a hole and pushing a ton of rock on you xalloor tweaked churris nose laughed as he mumbled a lazy protest skinhead sweetie he get busy make a pome spin em dizzy dearie dai oh yes you the poet all right not me so stir it luv chant them a ditty to milk tears from a stone aslans mums search for her daughter through a thousand dangers with bolodos hounds sniffing at her heels make their hearts swell with pride at the vision of elmas ofka reuniting aslan and adelaar make those words roll make em roll roll ow she slapped at the hand that had pinched her buttock do that again and i tickle you till your bones crawl out eh he chuckled going local eh eh twasnt a local give me the habit lan are you going i suppose i am well how ive been so busy making up my mind i havent thought about that take a boat i suppose churri sat up no ive got a better idea you dont want elmas or her shadows to spot the boat and put you down before youve said your piece some of the locals have been coming in on yizzies the vips here stow them at the depot in one of the little rooms its locked but blow on the lock and itll fall apart for you not me i havent had your education hmm its a sorry lack and one you should be curing ill come along and tickle her open thanks i think and dont be worrying about the yizzy you can manage a miniskip university wouldnt let you leave home not knowing a yizzys cruder and crankier and slower same thing though same thing hah negative thinking lanny didnt your mum teach you to view the bright side i repeat hah i notice youre not volunteering to plant your rear on a shimmy stick for god knows how many hours nuh ive too much sense in here he tapped his temple to plant this he slapped at the side of his buttock in misery i can miss without the least little dent in my selfesteem she left in a rosy sunset clouds piled on clouds feinting at storm but not yet ready to follow through the twitchy wind was heavy with the smell of rain because she didnt trust her touch with the controls and wanted to avoid being spotted by lookouts on the ground she flew low her feet occasionally whipping through the tops of trees as the yizzy went crank and dipped instead of rising it was not difficult to fly just rather unexpected at times and not as uncomfortable as shed feared whoever had put together this one was good with his or her hands there was a carved and padded saddle with stirrups on adjustable straps there were handlebars of a sort with motor controls on the grips it was nicely balanced the yoss pods in the net over her head were attached foreandaft to the riding pole their center movable to compensate for different rider weights the motor was light and efficient and small even with the lshaped fuel tank partly on top of it partly before it strapped to the pole large rotors handcarved but very sophisticated a tinkerers dream this gadget after half an hour of tree hopping she began coaxing the yizzy higher the forest was a dark nubbly fleece collected over the lower slopes of precipitous mountains the river a silver thread reduced to half its width by overhanging foliage somewhere under there at the minetown also invaded and obliterated by those trees elmas ofka and her isyas would be getting ready to sail though they wouldnt be starting for at least two hours ahead she could see the small deep harbor the chop evident even this far off the surf edge a startling white against the dark wet sand the wind began to steady and strengthen a scatter of heavy rain drops hit her and the pods the yizzy shuddered and bucked under her she swore and used her weight to steady it for the next three hours the yizzy was a torture machine the wind and the pole beat at her the rain blinded and halfdrowned her the yizzy wasnt meant for weather like this she knew when she started that she might be going into a storm though she didnt couldnt know just how terrifying the flight was going to be but if she didnt now there was no point in leaving and she had no intention of waiting for elmas ofka or the council to hand her over she despised such passive dependency even contemplating it hurt her in her pride besides she didnt trust them a whole lot by the time she was near enough to see the chain of rocky islets she was exhausted but shed also left the worst of the storm behind she edged closer to the water swung cautiously wide of the largest of those islets the barren jumble of rock called gerbek the yizzy was slower than the boats elmas ofka and the others were coming in the battering of the storm had slowed it even more her hands were gloved she couldnt see her chron she had no idea how much time shed spent in the crossing when she left the mines she was at least two hours ahead of the others right now she hadnt a guess now how much of that playway was left in the northeast where only the fringes of the prevailing winds brushed by there was a shallow inlet like a bite taken out of a flatroll it was the only anchorage the islet had and it was still empty so she knew shed got there first at least before elmas ofka she wasnt sure about the outsiders she hadnt seen anyone but the center of the islet was a jumble of rock and ravine half an army could be hiding in the cracks at one focus of gerbeks eccentric ellipse there was a peak like a miniature mountain at the other a flat space cleared of rubble and ringed by tall sarsens where ishigi pradites came to celebrate the equinoxes she didnt know much about the ishigi they were a heretical sect subject to some stringent penalties when discovered the little shed unearthed about them said theyd withered to nothing a century before but she wondered now when she saw that cleared stone no bird droppings inside the ring she laughed at herself lan were you tied to a spit over a roaring fire youd speculate about the mating habits of the gits about to eat you in any case it was the only area where a skip could land so the outsiders hadnt arrived yet either she didnt know whether she was happy about that or not if her mother wasnt with them she brought the yizzy lower and moved over the island as soon as the little mountain broke the push of the wind she went lower still until the rotors were laboring to hold the pole a meter above the stone she wobbled around the circumference of the flat looking for a place to anchor a place where she could hide until she was ready for the confrontation nothing nothing nothing there were dozens of cracks big enough for her nothing big enough and deep enough to hold the yizzy in the end she anchored it in a windcarved hollow low on the flank of the minimount and spent almost an hour getting back to the flat crawling over rocks and scree terrified of breaking something a leg an ankle her head she had to feel her way there was almost no light the clouds were thick and black gorruya was up alone for another hour and she was only a slightly obese crescent as she reached the waste rock near the sarsen ring voices came to her broken by the wind she caught her lower lip between her teeth and crept on until she came to a place where several of the sarsens had been quarried there were piles of debris around the hole and down in it three cracked stones leaning against its side a litter of stone shards piled on the holefloor she lowered herself carefully onto the knifeedged rubble then crept into the velvet black shadow beneath the leaners and pulled her black cloak tight about her the voices were louder she began picking up some words enough to know elmas ofka was sending harli tanggаr out to a pile of stones where she could get a clear shot at the flat with her crossbow placing others on guard beside the sarsens the crossbow worried aslan if she knew it was me harli tanggаr wouldnt shoot but the lights so bad shed have no idea who she was killing aslan bit her tongue to choke back a halfhysterical giggle poor baby she thought shed be awfully sorry not half as sorry as me the islet settled back to silence except for the whistle and groan of the wind and occasional loud clacks as bits of stone lost balance and went bounding down slopes of scree the damp cold crept through the layered wool she wore struck to the bone she shivered locked her jaw to keep her teeth from chattering and began to wonder if shed last until the outsiders arrived she heard a buzzing like gnat noise it was so faint that at first she thought it was something the wind was doing then it got louder she eased her head out and looked up a skip coming in from the west holding her cloak close to her so thered be no flicker of motion to catch harli tanggаrs eye she climbed from the hole and stretched out on the rubble so she could see what was happening the skip hovered a moment then dropped it landed at one side of the cleared circle and a large form swung down followed by a smaller once again aslan closed her teeth on her abused lower lip fighting back a surge of very mixed emotion the second figure was a shadowy blob undetailed but she knew that way of moving the highheaded arrogant strut allo mama she whispered voices a mans deep and pleasant it didnt carry well and she couldnt understand what he was saying her mother wasnt saying anything yet elmas ofka listened do it she said the next minutes were busy ones half a dozen small squat remotes hummed from the skip three carried a bundle larger than all three of them a bale of heavy cloth from which gorruya teased occasional gleams like flows of liquid silver the other three scurried about exploding pitons into the stone floor of the circle before aslan sniffed three times the bundle expanded into a large domed shelter anchored by the pitons she watched with envy as elmas ofka waved her guarding isyas inside and shouted harli tanggаr down from her post that solved that problem she thought she watched harli disappear behind the dome let them get settled she thought she pulled the hood closer about her face pinched it shut over her mouth and nose started to straighten up she looked up into her mothers face allo mama so whats all this about sneaking around adelaar touched her cheek briefly for a stodgy professortype you get yourself into more trouble itoldyouso mama if you stopped falling on your face i could stop having to pick you up oohyeha like it was all my fault this happened aslan sat up clutched at her head stunned she thought understanding finally what had happened to her her mind wasnt working all that well right now behind her mother she could see a tall dark man with a lazy twinkle in eyes so pale they might have been borrowed from another face and beside him elmas ofka looking grim aslan managed a tight smile sorry dalliss someone spoiled your surprise elmas ofka blinked but took the cue smoothly waiting upwind was not the brightest thing weve done one of our visitors has what one might call a nose for news adelaars mouth twisted into a halfsmile she wound a curl of aslans hair about her finger and tugged it hard but she said nothing she gave her daughters head a last pat then forgot about her and marched over to the memplas table growing like a mushroom in the center of the chamber the shelter was large enough to hold them all with plenty of room left for moving about whoeverd brought aslan in had laid her on a memplas bench close to the valve the isyas were standing or sitting their backs to the shallow curve of the wall lirrit and harli glanced once at her then ignored her the other isyas werent interested they lived in gul inci or at the indiz farm and there was a lot they didnt know about events at the mines as the tall man and elmas ofka moved to join adelaar at the table aslan saw for the first time the other member of the group the aurranger rau elmas ofka had mentioned the rau in her report to the council so aslan knew he was about and she knew who he had to be there were no other aurrangers offplanet she hadnt actually met him while he was at university but shed heard stories she was startled at the strength of her reaction to him she wanted to pick him up cuddle him smooth her hands over and over that velvety fur more than that she felt intensely protective if one of the isyas attacked him she realized with a great deal of surprise that shed go after the woman tooth and claw amazing she thought with pels kurkorso to prod her memory she realized who the lighteyed man was swardheld quale mama must have hired him she thought oooyeha she has to ve spent a fortune and a half if ever luck shat upon me she did now im going to hear about this for the next fifty years if we dont strangle each other before then at the table adelaar toed up a chair got herself settled then she took a bundle of fac sheets from a case squared them and set them in front of her the suspect files she said and the report on the internal security at the palace that quale saw fit to donate there was an astringent acerbity in the last statement quale chuckled but didnt bother to answer the challenge she lifted out a flakereader then a case of filled flakes we discussed this and found it simpler to let you and your technicians do whatever marrying is necessary to make further copies of this material the reader is included as another little gift from our generous friend here the first twenty flakes contain the stats on the warmaster and her well you cant really call them a crew the people living on board her the twentyfirsttheyre all numbered using your system of course so you wont have any trouble identifying whats whichthe twentyfirst has the data on the free corridors youll wish to inspect the flakes dont worry about inadvertently erasing them theyve been impressed loadings simple just slide the flake skinandall into the slot there then watch the screen you can manually jump about theres a pencil attached write the number you want on that sensor there again use your own system the player has been adjusted to respond to it if you want automatic random access touch the pencil here thatll jump you about so you can get a fair idea whats on the flake if you have any questions ill be happy to answer them you have something for us elmas ofka nodded har cousin she said harli tanggаr marched to the table and set a large pouch in the middle without comment she went back to her post beside the valve elmas tugged open the mouth took out a swatch of black velvet and a small metallic object which she unfolded into a balance scale and a pair of calipers then she withdrew several smaller pouches opened one and let the pearls spill onto the velvet the exchange was quick and wordless and the two women began a meticulous examination of what each acquired from the other quale left them to it and strolled over to aslan be interesting to know just who the surprise was for he murmured he had a pleasant baritone well rather more than pleasant for the first time in months aslan remembered how long it was since shed had sex with a man who excited her rather than scaring her rigid what shed had with parnalee wasnt sex or pleasure it was a propitiation of the gods of chaos and even that was what two years ago he had nice hands long fingers they ruffed through his beard it was crisp and short a few white and gray hairs in the black just enough to make him look distinguished she wanted to smooth her fingertips over it to she put the brakes on her imagination more tactful not to ask she said not now anyway he dropped beside her when we found out you jumped the wall del was wondering if wed have to winnow the whole population to find you things were getting a bit um hectic so i left saved us a lot of time and trouble you turning up like this pride and selfdefense mamas memory is her biggest asset unless youre on the wrong end of it he chuckled having spent moren half a year insplitting with her on board i know what you mean shes a marvel when shes working though swardheld quale she said pay his price and he gets things done youre a bit of a marvel yourself if the stories are onetenth true id put the truth level in those things considerably lower than a tenth say something like one part in ten thousand maybe they get the name of a place right the rest is youre an ethnologist you know how that goes well some heroes turn out to be a bit more than hot air his right brow quirked up the scar that nipped its outer end bent outward with the movement nothing to do with me according to elmas ofka youre collecting slaves and taking them back uh huh how many depends on who we can locate youre looking for specific people weve got a list of names weve matched up with names from the mainbrain rewards aici adlaar rewards when we get them back to helvetia my crew and me we collect some hefty gelt he rubbed at his jawline couldnt take em all even if i wanted to i have some people id like included in your collection they might not be on that list but if what i heard about your feestructure is reasonably correct what adelaars paying you for this means you can tuck in a couple of extras without straining yourself getting a little hostile arent you i like to think of it as being practical damn damn damn kneejerk footinthemouth what am i doing shoving him in a bag with mamas shithead friends maybe he belongs there i dont know i dont know im reacting like an adolescent brain damage or are stunners aphrodisiac quale he got to his feet with a loose easy shift of his long body that reminded her of xalloor the same sort of physical competence he strolled to the table toed up a chair and sat elmas ofka frowned at him for a moment she didnt say anything she has too much riding on this aslan thought and felt a touch of sympathy for the woman a sympathy she didnt usually have elmas reminded her too much of her mother youve had a week to look these over she tapped the case of filled flakes well price is right conditions arent too tough far as im concerned we can go when thirty days elmas ofka looked down at her hands drew a deep breath done she said how many can you lift around seventy eighty in a pinch should be enough for that lot he nodded at the case something else youll need to find someone whos been up there recently i suggest one of those fiveworld guards hell know things no one bothers to record yes we have acquired such a person and hes being questioned she broke off looked away from him aslan thought this next is going to be important shes not sure of him she could be a little afraid of him which is something i never thought id see the warmaster must be destroyed she said you agree to that why not i dont want it she relaxed your reasons impossible to handle without a huge crew i couldnt afford the fuel id have my sleep wrecked by the horde of wouldbe heroes plotting to take it away from me i see you understand my reasons simple enough as soon as slancy berths at helvetia horguls on the map people will be heading here to take back their relatives whatever to trade raid generally poke about the warmasters a target thatd tempt too many of them youd have some selfproclaimed emperor running your world before you blinked twice what about her stingships theyre parasited on her once you get rid of her they go inert if youre worried about the crews you can use your systemships to pull them out one last question how do we destroy something that big and that powerful as i see it youve got two options you can sink her in the deepest part of one of your oceans thats the quickest method leave some ports open and shell die fast only thing is theres a fair chance in a few years youll have a pollution problem itll clear up in a century or two but youd better make sure you keep people away from the place until then no the word exploded out of her not the ocean never she drew her hand across her mouth a quick nervous gesture straightened her back with a jerk and stared at him almost daring him to come out with something equally impossible so send her into the sun she thought that over how wouldnt someone have to stay with her only two minutes ago i read that the shipbrain is programmed to save her if all aboard are killed if you aim her at the sun and leave her shell break away before she reaches it and what happens then do we have a runaway killing machine hitting back at the ones that tried to kill her adelaar thats your field adelaar ran a hand over her hair smoothing it down where the wind outside the shelter had teased it into spikes while i was inside the interface i set a trap into the groundlink it hasnt been found and it wont be since then ive been using odd moments to explore the shipbrain through it that brain is big its powerful and oh my its dumb its old weve learned considerable since that ship was built some of us i kept away from the defense areas but i dont expect trouble when i go after them though id rather handle that up there working through a tap is too um limiting as soon as we lift off hmm thats something we havent arranged yet hanifa where do you want us to pick up you and your people i think its best we come to you rather than you to us itll be easier and faster aslan looked from her mothers intent face to elmas ofka one expression mirrored the other it was like a glimpse into the future maybe a year or two after this night read the changes where the world goes when the outside wanders in i cant say without knowing a lot more about whos coming and what the council thinks perhaps you could supply some way of communicating that the huvved couldnt tap into if so we can settle arrangements without having to find time for another meeting quale tapped on the table both women started swung round to face him ive got some handcoms in the skip he said theyre linked to the satellites i inserted when we got here should have no trouble bridging the distance between our base and yours he turned his head pels bring in a couple of those handsets will you wait elmas ofka said hang on a minute pels huh when we talked before you needed to know where to find locations inside cities i didnt forget that i brought you a small gift she glanced past him met aslans ironic gaze another small gift to help you with that problem har cousin take the hunter down to the boats and bring back our passenger aslan watched the chunky isya valve out after pels whats going on here she thought there wasnt anything about this in the report she made or in any of the hours of records i plowed through she rubbed at her eyes remembering with regret the watersac shed left hanging on the yizzy pole her mouth was dry and she was wrung out sleepy her head ached she wasnt interested in these games adelaar and elmas were playing with each other shed left home years ago to get the smell of greed off her skin she gazed at the back of quales head his hair brushed his collar black soft fine curling a little she wanted to touch it let it bend over her fingers damn oh damn the valve hummed pels came in his black lips were curled into an odd grin his ears were standing straight up and twitching a little he was humming she could hear a rumbling brumbrum as he trotted to the table dumped the comsets onto the memplas and swung around to watch the exit harli tanggаr ducked through stepped to her place beside the valve as the man following her straightened and looked around parnalee aslan thought good god whats she think shes doing howd she get hold of him parnalee tanmairo proggerd elmas ofka said in the course of his work he has visited most of the cities of the littorals when he joined us two days ago i saw him as the answer to your need maybe aslan thought but thats not the whole story what are you up to dalliss smiling urbane wearing his public face parnalee walked to the table touched hands with quale he wants this she thought why he looked over his shoulder at her and she saw the beast in his black eyes hungry beast promising her silently what hed promised in words undercut me and youre dead she shivered and made up her mind she was going to be very very sure she was never alone with him any time anywhere quale got to his feet thats it then call us when youre ready hanifa you want to leave first or shall we elmas ofka closed the lid on the case snapped the latches home well go dont get yourself killed x about ten days after the meeting on gerbek karrel goza in ayla gul inci waiting for the liftoff karrel goza forked slimy rotten leaves from the second stage vat into a tiltcart the stench that eddied around him crept through his stained overall and nestled against his skin oozed through the overage filter on his mask the stink was the least of his problems the mist that stank would open ulcers in his skin and rot his lungs if he stayed in it long enough the huvved kabrik who owned this shed had the patronage of the fehdaz and the manager was under orders to squeeze the last thread of use from the gear and more if he could get away with it the manager before him had been fired for being too easy on the workers she was local some of her employees were cousins and affiliates others belonged to the families of friends and associates herks crony didnt make that mistake twice the new manager came from a guneywhiyker daz he had no family in inci no pressures on him to look to the safety of the workers karrel goza didnt bother complaining it wouldnt do any good and there were a hundred more desperate and thus more docile workers to take his place he had too many small accidents had called in sick too often in his need to cover absences when he was flying for elmas ofka he was growing more marginal a worker as the weeks passed a complaint was all the manager needed to boot him out his family was one of the poorer septs small business folk living on the edge of failing clerks and such they needed twice what their earners were pulling in to pay the fees and taxes and all that herk was squeezing from folk like them a few years ago his pilots pay tithed had brought them comfort and a degree of security theyd seldom known hed sponsored and paid guildbond pilot for his cousin geres duvvar hed sponsored and paid guildbond skilled trades for three score other cousins sisters brothers affiliates that was finished now drive talent and a large dose of luck gave him a chance at a profession not usually open to boys from his class bondfees in the pilots guild were far too great for a family with the income his had even stretching they couldnt afford such an expense nor could they afford to tie up so much coin so long in a single member when he was a middler near the end of his schooling he earned his first coin flying soarwings on the garrip sands in the semiformal races sponsored by a coalition of merchants and sea farmers the purses were big the entry fees small he and an uncle who was a carpenter built his wingframe and an aunt who was a weaver made the fabric cover hed found his talent the moment he got his first kite up and when he was old enough to enter the races he made it pay time after time he won there was danger in this racing fliers crashedmisread aircurrents were crowded offlift showed bad judgment in their turns or were victims of sabotage men and women came from a dozen dazzes to watch and wager on the fliers there was a great deal of money floating about and the temptation to goose the odds was strong and seldom resisted orska falyan of sirgыnfalyan was a devotee of those contests he began betting on the agile boy who seemed to feel the air with every sweaty inch of naked skin who slid again and again from traps meant to break him he was elated when the boy continued to win sometimes by huge leads the old man more or less adopted karrel goza he sponsored him to the pilots guild paid his guildbond and when he gained his pilots rating hired him on at sirgыn bol orska falyan continued to take an interest in karrel goza had him teach some sirgыn and falyan youngers how to soar left the boy a small legacy when he died ten years later karrel goza finished filling the cart wishing as hed wished so many times before that the slave techs would finally come up with a machine capable of that noxious work the fibers were tough slippery treacherous and finer than a womans hair every mechanical forker theyd tried jammed after an hour or two it took a mans dexterity to manage the transfer he kicked the gong to let the handler know and the cart purred off a new one clanking into its place around him other forkers were working with steady minimal swings another gong clanged and a third after a silence so short that it seemed more like an echo than a sound in itself he coughed felt a burning in his throat and lungs the fumes from the vat were beginning to get to him he looked around the overseer was out of the room that figured the lazy bastard spent most of the day in his office a glasswalled room raised fifty meters off the floor he could sit in comfort and watch the forkers sweat karrel coughed again cursed under his breath and climbed off the platform there was a naked faucet waisthigh on the wall near the only door he turned the faucet on full so the water beat into the catch basin holding his breath he slipped the mask off and slid the filterpack from its slot he looked at the discolorations on both surfaces swore again he held the pack in the stream of water until some of the overload was soaked out of it that only took care of the grosser particles the absorption of the wad was a joke he shook it wondering what he was putting into his lungs he swished it back and forth in the water shook it again and clicked it home the wetting was weakening it he could see pulls and a small rip hed been asking for a replacement for three weeks now oversoul alone knew when hed get it likely hed have to buy a pack on the black market if he could find one elli might be able to do it for him get a filter from her family he splashed water on his face coughed again felt like he was trying to rip the lining from his throat he pulled the mask back on as bad as it was breathing that miasma over the vats without any protection at all was a thousand times worse he went back to work not much longer he told himself hang on kar twenty days twenty days and elli will get her chance at herk ah to see him dangling head down in that vat what karrel goza set his cup down blinked wearily at his ommar the parlor was small and by intention intimate the wallposts the ceiling and its beams were carved and painted in jewel colors small angular flower patterns on an angular emerald ground a fire crackled cheerfully behind a semitransparent shell guard ancient tapestries hung from ceiling to floor colors muted by time still dark and rich the ommar sat in a plump chair its ancient leather dyed a deep scarlet and mottled by decades of saddlesoap and elbowgrease its arms and ornaments and swooping clawfooted legs carved from a brown wood agedarkened to almostblack she was a small woman with a halo of fine white hair about a face dominated by huge black eyes ageless eyes she wore a simple white blouse an old black skirt smoothed neatly about her short legs legs too large for her size shed been a diver before she married into the goza family not one of the premiere dallisses though she shared their arrogance even now he could see the merm marks on the backs of her hands she sniffed impatiently repeated what shed said youngers and middlers from goza house have been running with the inklins gensi kivin kaynas its an isya i think one just forming with gensi as the pole zaraiz bulun and half a dozen boys they call themselves her weary wrinkled face lifted suddenly lighted by the grin that made him and everyone else adore her when they werent afraid of her the green slimes or something like that they were in that hoohaw last night dropping sludge bombs on the guard barracks at least it wasnt fire they havent gone that far both sets its mischief still but the inklins theyre mixing with arent playing kar nor are the bitbits streetgangs tchah what nonsense you werent like that much more sensible karrel goza thought about a few of his exploits when he was a younger which he fervently hoped shed never find out about and didnt think hed been all that sensible he wasnt too old to remember the feeling that he and his agemates were alone against a stodgy disapproving world how they built up a powerful secret world of their own that no adult had access to he couldnt see this crop of preadults welcoming interference but the world was infinitely more dangerous these days and the ommar was right something had to be done yizzies homemade or borrowed or what gensi boasted she made her own i suppose they all did which means theyve been stealing theres no other way they could have got the materials you know very well no adult in this family has coin to throw away on idiocy like that where are they keeping them not in the house id have the obscenities smashed if i could lay my hands on them the boys do you know which is the leader zaraiz memeli as much as any that clutch of shoks its not even an imitation isya and as for being a gang tchah she leaned forward urgent and more upset than he could remember seeing her her tangled white brows squeezing against the deep cleft between them i am afraid of them kar i know their faces but not what theyre thinking if theyre thinking at all i look into those shallow animal eyes and i wonder if theres anything but animal behind them she straightened her back in any case they have to be stopped bad enough to have those streetsweepings making trouble tchah do you know what herkken daz will do to us if sech gorak finds one of our boys dead on the street or shoots one of them out of the sky goza house will be translated to tassalga brick by brick whats left of it im talking to you do you know why because everyone here knows what youre doing and i have this faint hope the boys will listen to you if they dont i dont know what to do the girls she brushed a hand across her eyes the girls ahh kar they look at me animal eyes nothing there i thought i knew girls i dont know these talk to them kar if you think it would help can you get that indiz dalliss to see them you know who i mean he sipped at the tea to cover his hesitation after a minute he said that might be difficult the huvved put a price on her head and the jerk has doubled it try her voice was iron her eyes pinned him this is not a good time he said she wont come what use are you kar if you cant do this small thing for your family what do i say to your mother we have protected him and lied for him covered his shivery ass and when we ask a small a minute thing for us his family what does he say i cant he says let it lay ommar please his hand shook tea splashed onto his knees why should i what is more important that the moral discipline of your sisters your nieces your cousins i cant tell you that please i cant she relaxed her back curving into the cushions i see how long will you need cover this time i dont know maybe four five days when when im called i cant say more hmm it will be better if we prepare for this she smiled no glow to her this time just a tight bitter twist of the lips youve been doing too much kar you look like a walking ghost no one will be surprised if you go down seriously sick if i pull in some markers i can set your cousin tamshan in your place so we dont lose the earnings gorak watches all pilots we dont want that the job takes me off his list as long as youre supposed to be coughing your lungs out he wont bother his head over you if he believes it you think hes going to push his way in here and time your spasms if he wants to he will he rubbed at his eyes hed been noticing a hazeeffect for several weeks eyes lungs his whole body was breaking down he was averaging four hours sleep a night it was weeks since hed had any appetite he hadnt seen lirrit for how long gray day melted into gray day he didnt know how long too long he hadnt even thought about her for days he closed his eyes shivered as he realized he couldnt bring her face to mind no time for thinking less for contemplating marriage he and lirrit would wed when times were easier but in the miasma of weariness fear horror that usurped his day and dreamtime lately it was impossible even to dream of such things maybe it was just as well he got out he was running on autopilot abdicating his responsibility to himself depending on elmas for direction and impetus some time to himself he savored the thought then put it aside it wouldnt happen this month or the next there was too much to do after then who knew not he zaraiz he said i dont know him how old is he you told me his line name but i dont remember it memeli hes a first year middler no discipline hes insolent a bad influence on everyone she slapped her hands on the chair arms memeli tchah had i been ommar that generation we wouldnt have the problem we never would have affiliated that collection of losers karrel goza lowered his eyes played with his cup the intolerance of a dalliss her inability to see worth in folk who didnt conform to her personal standards it was the ugly side of their ommar he tilted the cup gazed at the rocking tawny fluid as if he saw elmas ofkas face there that intolerance that ignorance that inflexibility were her faults too theyd bothered him from the first hed forgotten that no not forgotten hed stopped thinking with the end so close yes take the time yes go back to thinking yes be there to stand against her when the need arises yes hands heavy with weariness he rubbed the crackling from his eyes all right he said ill talk with the boy maybe itll do some good he coughed gulped down a mouthful of the lukewarm tea in the morning he said locate zaraiz memeli for me dont bother him just let me know where he is ill collect him myself i will do that yes she lifted the teapot beckoned him over and refilled his cup with the aromatic liquid she had expensive taste in teas and indulged it more than she should in times like this sitting here savoring the flavor he resented it his sweat and pain bought her these luxuries and she took them as her right when there were children of the housenot goza no but of the house as much as any goza childwho needed food clothing medicine this cant keep on he thought it has to change weve got to make it change he thought of the teacher at the mines and what shed been telling her students it was not happy hearing well be different he told himself well make this work when he was seated again she said ommars tell me that slaves are disappearing not one or two but whole chains of them oh is that all youre going to say yes the ommar leaned forward again her eyes fixed on him trying to get past the face he presented to her after a minute she sucked at her teeth shook her head this cant go on she said he looked up startled by the echo of what hed been thinking then he realized that she meant something far different inci is better off than most from what i hear but give her another few months and shell be burning down around us before herk lets that happen hell call on the stingers and blast those lunatic children out of the air and he wont care what else he levels im telling you kar you tell her and the rest of them do something if her lot wont or cant then we crawl to herk and lick his toes weve got no time left for playing hero games he got heavily to his feet it was more difficult than hed expected the comfort of that chair the warmth of the room the soothing fragrance of the chamwood burning on the hearth these things were like chains on his arms and legs at the door he turned i will pass your message on hanifa ommar but i will say this though i probably am talking too much this is not a good time to insult her he went out zaraiz memeli was a small youth black hair curling tightly about a face sharp enough to cut wood he was digging without enthusiasm at a tuber bed leaning on his spading fork whenever the harassed middler girl turned her back on him to deal with some especially egregious idiocy of another of her punishment detail she had to keep watch on the garden the laundry room and a workshed where three girls were sorting rags and stripping discards of reusable parts usually there would be several middlers acting as overseers karrel goza found this lone harried girl even more disturbing than the aberration he was supposed to deal with this morning why was she alone was the ommar losing her grip letting work details fall apart was she letting favorites play on pride and refuse such work he didnt know his home any longer his fault the ommar was right that far so busy saving the world he forgot about his family he was almost a stranger here for the past year anyway up at dawn hasty breakfast toast and a cup of tea maybe a sausage if he could force it down then the retting shed work there till the second shift came on midafternoon scrub the chemical stink off his body try to get the taint of it out of his lungs eat if he could tumble into bed for a restless nightmareridden nap dark come down off to the taverns for carousing or conspiring or out to the mines to fly for elmas ofka his attention turned outward always the house too familiar for him to see it he simply assumed that it continued to exist as it existed in his memory by the time he reached the tuber patch off the memeli court he was in no mood to put up with sass from a knownothing bebek who was setting the house in danger with no purpose except to tickle his urges zaraiz memeli the boy looked up after a deliberate pause his face guarded custom and courtesy required a response he leaned on his fork in a silence more insolent than words karrel goza swallowed bile and kept his temper come he said this wasnt starting out well and he didnt see how he could improve things but he slogged stubbornly on the young overseer came at a quick trot questions on her lips he silenced her with the ommars order took the fork from zaraiz memeli and gave it to her he tapped zaraiz on the shoulder and pointed toward the memeli court well talk there eyes like obsidian wrapped in a resistant silence the boy strolled along refusing to recognize the compulsion put on him a sly scornful smile sneaked onto his face as karrel pushed through the wicket and stopped the noise and clutter of the busy enclosure breaking around him crawlers and preyoungers littered the flags crying yelling playing slapandpunch games older prees chased each other around the baby herds and their mothers fathers uncles aunts cousins who were working singing crosstalking in endless antiphon a tapestry of sound karrel goza glanced at the boy watched his bony unfinished face go wooden and unresponsive for a moment he felt like strangling the pest then abruptly he didnt know why then or later the absurdity of the whole thing hit him and he laughed not here obviously he said and backed out he frowned at zaraiz there was always the ommars garden but instinct and intellect told him that would be a very bad idea the peace and lushness of that pocket paradise was too stark a contrast to the memeli court it would exacerbate the boys disaffection he thought about leaving the house and walking out to the wharves but he was supposed to be down sick and it would be stupid to confirm the sechs suspicions problem was except for the ommars quarters there wasnt much privacy gozas and duvvars and memelis working everywhere even the oldest doing handcraft and repair and those who werent working were talking and watching gossiping and prying into other folks business he dug deep into memory for the places he went when he was a younger and wanted to get away from the soup of life simmering inside the housewalls he didnt feel like climbing a tree or burrowing into a dustsaturated attic he smiled didnt suit the dignity of the moment it was a gray day with rain threatening yes the clotheslines on the roof of the weaving shed there wouldnt be anyone hanging out clothes today the lines were humming softly as the chill wind swept over the roof it wasnt the most comfortable place for a prolonged chat but it was private karrel goza kicked a basket of clothespegs out of a fairly sheltered corner and settled himself with his back against the waisthigh wall sit zaraiz memeli dropped with the boneless awkward grace of his age drew his thin legs up and wrapped thin arms about them he said nothing his attitude proclaimed he intended to keep on saying nothing you dont have to tell me why karrel goza said i know why he smiled with satisfaction as he saw the boys rage flare then vanish behind the shutters hed had too much practice raising between himself and the rest of the world he did not want to be understood karrel gozas words were both a challenge and an insult dalliss karrel said the ommar arrogant bigoted makes you want to kick her face in but shes good at her job he pushed aside his unease this was no time for doubt within her limits theres no one big enough to take her place not you my little friend no matter what you think shes got her toadies yes gozas all of them you think i like that id drop the lot in saaders cleft if it was up to me they stand in her shadow and steal her authority and tramp on the rest of us and shes blind to it yes i know im goza and im here running errands for her so you think im one of them tonguing her toes and begging her to walk on me he shrugged his shoulders scraping against the whitened roughcast i had it easier than you i got out when i was a few years older than you i got out not divorced just out they tried bullocking me sure they did but most of the time i wasnt here and when i was i had the clout to tell them to go suck as long as i was flying he felt the jolt again the wholebody ache that came when he was grounded the loss he couldnt put behind him except when he was flying for elmas ofka an obsession can be a gift giving point to an otherwise pointless life it can be a torment when theres a wall in the way he glanced at zaraiz the boy was blank as an empty page refusing to hear any of this what do you want zaraiz memeli do you know he tried feeling his way back to that time around puberty when all his certainties melted like taffy left in the sun no he knew too much about surviving now the years had made him intimately acquainted with gray the middler world of crisp unchanging blackandwhite wasnt available to him any longer those were shifts so fundamental that it was impossible to recapture the angst of that world it also made it difficult to judge what the boy was thinking what he was feeling do you extend your loathing to your parents your brothers and sisters the boy lifted his eyes flicker of molten obsidian then he looked away i went to see the ommar istib memeli last night we talked about you your father is on the duzzulkas right now bushpeddling blackmarket medicines your mother works at the kummas kabrikon in the fix room setting dyes your two older sisters work there also handling half a dozen spinners each hayati memeli the older of them has first signs of the coughing disease your third sister is only a few months old your two brothers are midyoungers still with their tutors neither of them shows much promise with his letters but aygil memeli the youngest is good with his hands he might be a carpenter or a mechanic if the bondfees can be found do they mean nothing to you karrel goza stared at the boy trying to see past the blankness ommar istib says youre bright enough but lazy that could be because you havent found anything you think worth doing or it could be because theres nothing to you but flash and foolishness ommar istib says youve shown no special talents that youre not interested in anything all you seem to know is what you dont want which is everything inside these walls a muscle twitched beside the boys mouth but he would not look at karrel you think that matters to anyone to me let me tell you im not particularly interested in who you are or what you think another molten black gaze karrel goza nodded right im like all the rest thats the way the world wags cousin let me make something clear while you live within these walls you will show some loyalty to the others here which means you will stop your yizzy raids as long as you are associated with this house if you want the freedom of the streets you can have it the convocation of ommars will pronounce a divorcement they will not let you endanger the rest of gozaduvvarmemeli zaraiz memeli paled flushed clamped his lips together struggling to control the emotions surging in him a moment later he lost the fight hypocrite the word exploded out of him in an angry whisper you youre doing worse im not a child karrel goza fixed a quelling eye on the working angry face inside he writhed as he listened to what was coming out of his mouth he wasnt the pompous idiot he heard himself being but somehow he couldnt shake loose from from this stinking parody of all hed kicked against since he was zaraiz memelis age the face of authority he thought as his mouth went on uttering fatuities im not recklessly endangering the house for the sake of a transient thrill he held up his hand to silence the boy until he was finished speaking there is a purpose to purpose zaraiz memelis voice cracked which made him angrier than before he tried to say more started to stammer and clamped his teeth on his lower lip karrel goza waited giving the boy time to collect himself y y you zaraiz got out finally purpose yunkshit playing stupid games going nowhere he jerked a long trembling thumb at the sky that that that thing up there says youre full of shit and hot air maybe so karrel goza sighed

slimesll park our yizzies for now if so you make us part of it he folded his thin arms hugged himself as if those arms had strength enough to control what burned in him the wind blew strands of curly hair across his eyes his mouth he ignored that and stood there frozen fire dangerous to his enemies nearly as dangerous to his kin when karrel goza failed to answer at once his excitement blew out and the suspicion and resentment that smoldered under his skin burned hotter in its place or arent memeli worthy arent we good enough for you karrel goza closed his eyes i do not need this he thought prophet touch my lips or no anything i say will be wrong if there was just some way i could drop him in a hole somewhere until hole why not he smiled he couldnt help smiling though he knew zaraiz

too tired to care what the decision was as the boy shifted from foot to foot he could almost write the script for what was passing through his cousins head he looked his age at last vulnerable wanting desperately for the offer to be real afraid of trusting it because the whole of his short life had taught him that adults invariably lied to him broke promises without a qualm disregarded his ideas and his desires he kept snatching glances at karrel goza as if trying to surprise him into betraying his real intentions it was no good of course either he trusted and said yes or he rejected the offer and took the consequences karrel goza waited shoulders slumped eyes halfclosed zaraiz memelis eyes burned black again he licked his lips nodded a short sharp jerk of his head when do we go he

loaded with chains and driven about the dance floor by electric lances and glasspointed longwhips she danced grimly knowing she had to please them refusing to please them by cringing or pleading sweat streaked her coppery skin her yellow slitpupiled eyes were halfclosed her mouth squared into a snarl chunky higharched feet lifted leaped landed without a sound moving too swiftly for the whip thongs to tangle about them her limber body flowed and twisted away from the jabbing lance points the dance went on and on she sweated more copiously until her skin had a diffuse glow as it reflected the yellow light from the lamps clumped on the walls of the open court but she showed few other signs of flagging the music went ragged and finally broke off the lances clattered down the whipmen coiled their whips she stood in the center of the dance floor wary and angry her chest heaving her arms and legs trembling she wasnt a mammal so she hadnt even vestigial breasts but she was powerfully female fear and anger had tagged her sweat with a musky scent that spread like a mist across the court exciting the men whod been watching her the court cleared rapidly and her handler took her away a hand came down on her mouth a beard tickled her face a whisper her ear listen interlingue she stopped her instinctive struggle chathat adey elathay the whisper went on they sent us for you you want out she touched the hand after a hissing nearsilent laugh as soon as her mouth was freed she pushed up chains clinked when she held out her arms her visitor moved around her she saw him as a long flickering shadow an autopick hummed and the cuffs fell away from her wrists anything you want here a low mutter sss i take it that means no wait there like a walking beam he crossed the room opened the door a crack and clicked his tongue a double click answered him he beckoned to her and slipped outside there were two others waiting in the skip she looked at them recognized neither but knew from the smell of them theyd been slaves like her youve had a busy night she told the man might say so you want to get in we have a long way to go before dawn she swung up settled in the space the man and woman made for her how much you collecting for us she blinked a short furry type she hadnt seen before scrambled into the cos seat up front it wasnt talking so she didnt comment works out to about two thousand

without hurrying his small hands stronger than they looked a gooseneck lamp was arched over the pad giving him the concentrated light he needed it wobbled as the door slammed open and a short heavy huvvedhordar halfbreed rushed over to him ukomayile caught the lamp before it tipped over held it until it stabilized then went back to his work without bothering to look around youre not near finished why are you taking so long he wants the chain and the wristlets ready for the imperators birthday the vor hoshin house steward was one of the fehraz vor hoshins bastards born to fuss at things he couldnt understand he poked with a nervous stubby finger at the emeralds set out on a linen cloth at the soft gold chain the links engraved and shaped with minor differences making each unique he got in ukomayiles way with a persistence that had something of malice about it ukomayile lowered his hands and waited the steward noticed that after a while and got shrilly annoyed why arent you working why are you sitting there hell have you beaten again you stupid beast ukomayile laced his fingers together and waited his face impassive he did not look at the steward he said nothing he simply sat there refusing to acknowledge anything the steward said or did there was a time when he would have protested such treatment he was a gifted artisan with an immense reputation and accustomed to being treated with respect and he hadnt yet learned what it meant to be a slave ten years and innumerable beatings later he no longer voiced his protest he merely set himself like a rock and waited he still hadnt learned slave manners and he never would if he died for it after some more spiteful maneuvering the steward withdrew he knew ukomayile wouldnt explain or excuse himself for not finishing in time but the fehraz vor hoshin sourmouthed wrinkled old snake hed nose out the stewards interference and twist his tail for it vor hoshin enjoyed that kind of thing and hed been doing a lot of it lately the steward knew he was hovering on the verge of dismissal that he was the vipers son meant nothing there were plenty of that old horns get scattered about the raz in spite of that he couldnt stop hectoring the slave for reasons he didnt try to explain he hated ukomayile with a passion that nearly tipped him into madness the sun went down a maidservant tapped on the door with ukomayiles supper on a tray and a jug of mulled wine to warm the stiffness out of his muscles he laid his tools in a neat row brushed his hands together then climbed down off his tool and hobbled to the table one of those beatings had broken his leg and the boneman whod set it had botched the job he ate with the same close attention he gave to his work finished everything on the tray drank half a glass of the wine then went back to the bench gorruya rose gibbous she swam up across the window and vanished ruya nosed over the horizon he kept working the steward might be a malicious fool but he was right enough about the fehraz hed be mad as a sick viper if the chain wasnt finished in time to show it off at the fete the emeralds were lovely stones he liked handling them and the setting was a test of his skill to keep the variations subtle enough to be interesting but not vulgar so he labored on while the night grew darker and older the door opened he didnt bother turning he thought it was the steward coming back ukomayile listen ukomayiles hand jerked the tool cut a crease in the gold interlingue he turned slowly a man stood in the doorway tall tired face mussed black hair a dark gray shipsuit how many years since hed seen a clutch of zippers like that pockets on pockets on an easy loosefitting overall the man wearing the shipsuit wasnt anyone he knew he watched in dull wonder as the stranger pulled the door shut tikkan ekital sent me more interlingue wonderful how fast it came back to him they want you back you want out ukomayile sat without moving it was a while before he took in what the man was saying yes he said finally a moment he slipped the loose emeralds into their carrycase snapped it shut and slid it into a large leather bag he folded the chain and the wristlets into the linen workcloth and tucked the roll into the bag beside the stones drew the strings tight and looped them over his wrist with the same quick neat movements he cleaned out the safe and gathered up his leather case all right we can go what do you want me to do the man chuckled right just follow me were heading for the roof hanu posa ala otsut place comweb transfer station in the

the flies slipped off the cover and began pulling cassettes and program boards lining these up so the froska could take a look at them otsut yanked on the chain clamped around her neck and pulled it along the overhead slide until she could reach hanus side she moved the tip of a long thin finger across the first board made a tutting sound burnout sabotage perhaps perhaps faulty manufacture she had a high sweet voice like the chirping of a cicada soft greenish skin fell in graceful folds between her arms and body her eyes were a darker green huge sad eyes she was nocturnal totally adapted to a darkness broken only by the fluctuating polarized light of a huge moon that was more like a companion world than a satellite the light in the room was painful to her but she endured the small torment because she must endured it in silence because she was froskin and they took pride in their stoicism she was the key to the team she could generate a weak current in her body and had been surgically altered so she could testread flakes and boards without exterior nonorganic aids hanu and posa ala didnt mind being confined to nightwork it left them more on their own less contact with their masters neither of them found it easy to accept being a slave they did what they could to minimize the reminders though the pen where they were caged when not working and the collars they wore at all times the chains that tethered them when they were doing their analyses and repairs would not let them forget their status or settle too complacently into their new lives otsut worked quickly along the line found three substandard boards and a totally unusable one one cassette was useless and several of the others were flawed this is a larger degree of incapacity than we have found before anyo is it the transfer unit doing it theres no sign of surges no charring or smell or anything similar besides arent these new units most are new she chirped if the manifest is correct i think it is not exactly correct i think the supplier is enhancing his profit at the expense of quality hanu looked around posa ala was at his post across the room and their guard was sitting in a chair with his feet up eyes closed mouth working as he chewed at green fyon a local narcotic the more things change he said she let greenish parchment lids drop over her eyes such corruption was painful to her the neckchain clinked softly as she shuddered then she put off her distress are there sufficient spare boards to finish the repairs any of those near enough to standard for posa to do some surgery on she touched them again picked a board up played her fingers across it this one she set it down apart from the rest the others no the software too much damage youll have to replace every cassette well we can fix this unit but thats it for tonight have to put in a rec i suppose and wait for supplies hanu patted a yawn got to his feet eh posa how you doing about the same as you from the look of it why dont you take a break and come over here otsa has a board for you to operate on thats a break he chuckled a deep rumbling sound still chuckling he slid down from his stool and came stumping over to them jerking impatiently at the chain making the slide squeal as it ran along its track he was a stubby figure legs so short his fingers nearly touched the floor when he stood erect his shoulders and arms were powerful thick in both dimensions they looked as if hed stolen them from a man three times his height he had coarse shaggy hair he wore twisted into a spiky mane his head was narrow and long his mouth wide his eyes gleamed in the dimness like molten gold at once savage and filled with a sardonic amusement at the vagaries of life a typical kakeran at home hed have half a dozen docile wives and innumerable children running wild through the tree paths while he used up his abundant energy directing at least three companies and sitting on half a dozen local boards here even the collar about his neck and the chain that tethered him failed to diminish the force of his personality or the nervousness of hordar who had to work around him a lot of the locals hordar and huvved alike sighed with relief when he was put on the night team and they didnt have to deal with him any longer whats this before he finished the question the door opened their guard blinked then slid from his chair

up by the time i worked loose you and your friend were kiting out with half a dozen proctors on your tail i heard later you led them on a pretty chase and lost them in the maze but reminiscences however pleasant can wait for a more propitious place and time i presume youve got a cutter on you that can handle this steel once again he shook the chain better than that quale dipped into his pouch tossed an autopick to posa were parked on the roof a skip you know this place better than i do we couldnt do much groundwork because we didnt know youd be here until yesterday morning any guard checks

when his collar was off he turned to otsut not just us eh right seven thousand gelders you say more or less delivered on helvetia if that bothers you nice as he moved over to hanu otsut pulled off the collar and flung it away from her whos offering for you seven wives and some frazzled male relatives posa ala grinned he watched hanu remove his collar wipe his fingertips on his tunic thats finished

she relaxed and moved her head slightly to let the intruder know shed heard the hand came off one nameless wants you back you want to come she sat up cautiously enough moonlight filtered through the slats to show her the man beside her him who thought he was her master he was lying with his eyes cracked his mouth sagging half open she poked at the soft flesh of his upper arm he didnt change expression or move stunned yes well you really need an answer she threw the covers off her legs slid from the bed let me get dressed she was tiny maybe a hand taller than pels her breasts were suggestions her pubic hair a few silky threads she looked about twelve but he knew from the data provided by ti vnok that she was over a hundred her genes had been scrambled to keep her a pedophiles darling she moved quickly about the room selecting what she wanted to wear shoving jewelry and bibelots into a sack not a wasted movement she was back in moments her eyes glittering the loot bag slung over her shoulder she was dressed in a loose robe that swayed about her ankles it had long sleeves cuffed at the wrist and a high neck shed pulled on soft boots her feet made no sound on the floor lets go altogether i collected twentyseven slaves from the duzzulkas and three transfer stations then i began on the cities of the kuzeywhiyker littorals night after night explaining who i was and what i was doing and why i was doing it packing individuals of assorted shapes sizes and dispositions into the skip and keeping them happy until i decanted them at the base in the shelters kumari stocked and policed the numbers increased in drips and spurts it was coin piling up for us but it was also hard labor boring sometimes dangerous mostly sitting in an overloaded skip freezing my tail and wishing for a coat of fur like pels and sorry i ever got into the rescue scam it was coping with adelaar who was fretting about her business and what was happening to it without her it was soothing the hanifa who got more nervous and mistrustful as each day slid past blessed kumari she kept them both off my neck as much as she could the days did pass day by interminable day they passed never again never ever again i was not in love with pain or sweat work but id given my word and i meant to keep to it ilvinin taivas suksi ichigo shnouro sleed tok and others not on the list place ayla gul samlikkan eastern littoral headprice ilvinin taivas gelders suksi ichigo gelders shnouro gelders sleed tok gelders the city was burning when i brought the skip down low over the rooftops and tiptoed around clots of trouble until i managed to slip onto the roof of the pen at the textile factory the streets were thick with homegrown guards and tassalgans shooting sprays of pellets at the yizzies whining overhead and scrambling away from gouts of fire as the inklins retaliated gangs of youngers were screaming words that didnt exist in the vocab i learned from darting across housetops and through alleys behind the men in the streets running dangerously close to count coup on them scrambling yipyipyip away around corners or leaping from roof to roof waving the paint guns theyd modified to squirt acid drained from eksasjhi veins the eksasjhi being a lethargic crustacean that lived in the shallows all along the east coast it left a knotty purple scar that marked the head coup for all to see and silently gloat over it was briefly agonizing and did not do much for the targets eyesight if it happened to spatter into his eyes a hit on the head and the yell was yipyip ya ten a hit on a torso was yipyip ya one no scar at least none visible a leg was five a hand six houses were burning men were burning inklins shot out of the sky were screaming as their firetanks burst over them and they burned or lay with shattered bodies among the bodies of the men they fought children fell from roofs or squirmed and screamed in the hands of men who beat on them with limber gray prods while pels drifted about the cluttered roof checking the shadows making sure no guards or homeless grasslanders were sleeping up there we didnt want some local waking up at the wrong time and yelling i crouched by the trap set the pick working on the lock then i settled on my heels and looked around no yizzies buzzing over this quarter the nearest noise was half a dozen streets away and moving off toward the bayshore but there was nothing to keep the inklins away if they took a notion to fire this place they could be here in seconds nothing clears the sinuses like knowing youre not just a fool youre a damnfool kumari cornered me after the last dip and told me there was chaos in the east take two skips she said one for backup and someone to watch them while youre breaking loose the targets i know you dont like to double the risk on long hauls but you can separate the two skips go in mirror arcs itll make the run longer maybe youd have to find cover and spend the day somewhere what of it irritating to find she was right id have passed on this one but this dip was worth ten thousand gelders besides one of them was ilvinin taivas the helvetian seven were hot to get him back him and leda zag i had her i needed him ah well it was a mess but none of my business id seen the backwash from disturbances in other littoral cities but they were closer to base and we were able to stay outside until the fires died down the injured were carried off and the fighters on both sides went home these should have cleared out by this time it couldnt be more than an hour or two before daylight but no the fools had to keep on killing and getting killed the pick buzzed i pulled it off pels yeh he materialized beside me i jumped that little spook was hard to see even when you knew where he was you mind going down the hole alone if luck takes a hike some maniac on a broom might take a notion to barbeque the skip no sweat only a couple of guards and kumari said theyre usually half asleep dont count on that tonight hmm take a buzbug and yell if you hit trouble pels growled sniffed if itll make you squat happier lil mama here i held out the pick pels looked at it shook his head snooper cameras inside kumari spotted them ill have to pop the lenses and thatll start bells ringing somewhere ill use the cutter on the chains its faster when i give a whistle you have the skip ready to hop he tapped me on the shoulder a minute he said and trotted away as pels fished in the toolbox i lifted the trap and clamped it open i shook it made sure the spring would hold and turned in time to take one of the matched pair of buzbugs pels worked the bug through the fur on his throat screwed the plug in his ear dont massacre too many infants he said and dropped through the hold i pasted the phone on my throat pushed the plug into my ear and touched the bug on i winced as pels breath came roaring into my head threatening to blow my eardrum i tapped on the aft which i should have done before i stuck the thing in my ear head dead yes i wiped the tears from my eyes with a faint chuffchuff in my head i got to my feet and inspected the roof there was a fat tapering chimney a little taller than i was several padlocked sheds half a dozen blocky bins stacks of drums huge spools piles of scrap lumber bales of fiber the flat space behind the parapet was a kind of storage area for anything the factory wasnt planning to use anytime soon all of it throwing complex shifting shadows in the double moonglow the fires that spread along the waterfront and the slum areas near it put hard edges on those shadows the black square hole of the open trap stood out stark against the pale roof made me nervous i salvaged a chunk of twobyfour from a scrap pile laid it across one corner of the hole and lowered the trap on it the skip was squatting like a dark toad in one of the open areas far too visible for my peace of mind but i couldnt do anything about that except hope if the yizzy inklins came close enough to see it theyd think it was something belonging to the factory i dropped onto the roof tiles sat with my back against the chimney some broken boxes beside me to thicken its shadow and break my silhouette the launch tube balanced across my knees a clip in the slot i waited i watched the firefight move farther from us and breathed easier the thought of having to shoot children out of the sky put a sour taste in my mouth though that wouldnt stop me from blowing the tailfeathers off any snooping yizzy even if it meant id send shrapnel through the body of its pilot i listened to pels breathe and thought id been in some lousy situations before but i couldnt remember any this bad children fighting a war their elders funked no not fighting destroying to scratch an itch to drive off futility hanifa i thought if this goes on much longer what youll get when you win wont be worth the price you and pittipat are birthing a generation of killers and vandals and they wont settle into model citizens once the battles are over snoops pels breathed into my ear audio and video three of them in the ceiling where i came off the stairs i popped them probably set off an alarm one guard on the stores level got him another round the corner just ahead a breathy chuckle the maffit is farting like a misfiring engine fui be doing the world a favor when i hit him a minute the breathing didnt change slow and steady little hunter stalking his prey go pels got him and theres door tsa more lenses a moments silence got them five minutes then were on our way up as i listened to pels go through the routine speech picking up echoes of the targets responses i looked out across the burning city and felt a deep relief that i was going to be getting out of this i got to my feet and took a step toward the trap a darkness huge and ominous dropped through the shredded clouds light beams walked across the city seeking out and touching the yizzy inklins dainty delicate killer blades darting out to touch and kill clearing the sky the inklins tried to run they scattered like leaves in awhirlwind but it did no good the lines of light rotated out with an awefull precision touch and fry immense and eerie lightshow i swore it wasnt fair dammit pels trouble up here stay where you are pittipats brought the warmaster down huh i know swatting a fly with a maul but its happening no way i can take the skip up the warmasters knocking everything out of the air shit yeh ah what about the skip its not airborne is it safe havent a clue hmm if it werent for those snoops yeh we got to get out of here before company arrives let me think um the warmaster is concentrating on the waterfront most of the trouble is over there i think youd better try the streets go south and west make your way out of the city watch out for lice better them than frying what about you sit it out i suppose till the ship leaves she wont hang around after shes finished you go to ground as soon as youre out of the city first fair cover you can find me id take to the forest somewhere round the river if you do dont go in too deep i want to use the bug to locate you swar what can you get to the skip without exposing yourself too much yeh thing is the scanners on the warship can pin a flea a throw of the dice eh she spots it or she doesnt yeh get the spare com i dont feel like walking home i had to laugh point to you furface but i wont move till youre clear give me a whistle when youre a few streets off silence for a moment only the chuffchuff of his breathing a couple things i want to do before i leave give me a commentary huh whats happening up there the ship has finished clearing the sky her nose is over the harbor now i can see gouts of steam so i suppose theyre going after boats or swimmers a mutter from pels was a faint background noise to what i was saying hed turned the volume down so he could talk to the targets while he listened to what i was saying shes going out farther thats one huge mother pels her bellys still over us here the tail is out in the hills where the rich folk have their houses wait till you get a look at her hmm whatever she was after she got it shes starting to swing around its going to take her a good half hour to finish that turn hunh she just picked off something else i cant see steam this time its pretty far offshore might even be one of the sea farms if it is pittipats going to have more trouble on his hands than a few juvenile delinquents hmm shes stopped the massacre for a while away you better get a move on pels were on our way better not transmit for a while ill keep the plug in place wait on your beep luck swar keep your nose cold teddybear youll be sorry for that you apostate scav i hope on your way babe rrrr the hum in my ear broke off i dropped into a squat my back against the chimney the ship continued to turn slowly ponderously so huge it obscured a quarter of the sky a whistle in my ear gotcha i eased to my feet set the launch tube against a box glancing repeatedly at the ship i edged around the chimney and walked slow as a weary sloth from junk pile to pile of junk staying in the deepest shadows as long as i could breaking my motion at irregular intervals using everything i knew to avoid alerting a watcher whether that watcher was a program or a man the wind swept over the roof carrying past me the stench of burnt meat faint cries from the wounded hoarse yells from the hunters in the streets below me the air was cleared of fliers but the ground fight was going on more deadly than before there were no yipyips no more coup games these were rats slashing at rats i crept a few steps stopped went on until i was crouching beneath the skip below the toolbox the warmaster was still turning dark silent massive no more lightblades though i eased out got the box open and dug around for the spare handset for a cold moment i thought id gone off without it this time the readycheck was so automatic i could have been careless then my hand closed on the padded case pels must have moved it when he got the buzbugs i lifted it out slipped the strap over my shoulder pulled the box shut i looked up still turning measurably closer i patted the skip shook my head and started rambling back toward the chimney when i got there i picked up the launcher looked from it to the warmaster and had to grin a moment later i lost all desire to laugh the lightblades were out and rotating wider beams this time cauterizing the city where they passed the crowded tenements and warehouses exploded into ash and steam one minute two three four the barrage stopped the warmaster continued drifting south for a breath of two there was a hush nothing was happening in the air or in the streets then as if it were a kind of joke a last giggle after the great guffaw of the slum clearance a skinny little light needle about as big around as my thumb came stabbing down close enough i could feel the heat leaking off it it hit the skip melted her into slag that ate rapidly through the roof and dropped in a congealing cascade through the floors below starting more fires as it fell the warmaster began to rise lifting so fast it sucked air after it creating a semivacuum and then a firestorm as air from outside rushed in fire roared up out of the hole in the roof beside me i had to get out of there i slung the tubes strap over my shoulder and ran for the rope ladder coiled near the front parapet i flipped it over and went down in something close to a free fall i had a moments regret for the slaves still chained in there but there wasnt anything i could do the place was a furnace by the time i hit ground besides with all the death in this city tonight it was hard to feel horror or anything else over a few more corpses however grisly their end stunner in my hand i ran through the dark streets no one tried to stop me the few hordar who saw me looking from windows or crouching in doorways were shocked into inertia too afraid too horrified to do anything but gape in a section with taverns and small shops i rounded a corner and came face to face with a tassalgan who was hunting inklins or anyone else he suspected of treachery which seemed to be just about everyone not tassalgan i stunned him as soon as i saw his dark wool uniform blessing the amnesia effect of the charge i was clearly not huvved or hordar and i didnt look all that much like an escaped slave i glanced back before i went round another corner and saw ragged children swarming over the downed guard a wiry boy drew a knife across the tassalgans throat and howled as blood spurted over him he and the other children fought over the blood wiped their hands in it licked it off their palms off his neck off the pavement hanifa hanifa how are you going to civilize little animals like that the boy looked up and saw me i took off i avoid weasels and all such vermin they can kill you because they dont know when to give up it took me almost an hour to work my way out of the city it was a big place bigger than it looked from the skip and i had to move more warily once i got into the suburbs there were guards on the walls and they were trigger happy i picked up some shot in a shoulder a hole in my leg that missed bone and most of the muscle but hurt like hell and a new part over my left ear bullet whizzing by entirely too close by the time i made the park south of town i was losing blood from my shoulder and my leg and feeling not so good the park was on the edge of a forest preserve that spread over the hills south and west of the city on both sides of the river that emptied into the bay it was open and grassy with rides winding through huge ancient trees past banks of flowers and fern glittering with dew whenever the canopy let through light from laterising ruya the silence broken by a rising wind hot and dry blowing off the city punctuated by snatches of sleepy birdsong dawn was already reddening the east i found a bench made from roughcut planks eased myself down not sure i should because my leg was getting stiff and i wasnt all that convinced i could get up again but i had to locate pels and i couldnt do that traveling i pried the mike off used the nail on my little finger to turn the screw then started the beeper i waited with some anxiety but not too much i knew pels and i expected him to be curled up somewhere warm and comfortable and enjoying himself the earplug beeped i turned the screw back and stuck on the mike gotcha pels glad you made it i found out why pels had turned down his mike looking a bit sheepish as well he might he showed me what hed done in the hollow thicket where hed found shelter he had the four targets and around twenty more fugitives the rest of the slaves housed in that barracks he was as sentimental as a daydreaming dowager but i couldnt complain too much because i was well call it pleased to see they werent roasted after all he knew it too blasted teddybear i gave kumari a call she wasnt happy with us you forget that tap she said what am i supposed to think when adelaar tells me the grand sech is ordering the warmaster to gul samlikkan i tried to reach you flashed the call light no answer i couldnt use the buzzer i didnt know who or what might be listening what took you so long ive been sitting here eating an ulcer in my belly wondering if the two of you were alive or dead stay there ill send adelaar to fetch you how many did you say adelaar got to us late the next night brought both skips the second droned behind the warmaster was back in orbit over gilisim gillin she said just sitting there like it was brooding over what to erase next according to the tap we didnt have to worry about its scanners the crew was too busy putting its insides back in order and gul samlikkan was still burning and the locals were concentrating their attention on containing the destruction and restoring order and they werent worrying about what was going on in the hills we packed half the fugitives in the skips pels and adelaar flew them out i stayed behind with the leftovers there was some argument about that pels was determined i should go back and get some sacktime in the tubs autodoc but i didnt want to face that long flight the way i was feeling i could easily pass out somewhere along the way and i wasnt about to trust any of those exslaves with the com the autopilot could handle a lot but things come up no flakehead can cope with adelaar didnt go maternal over anyone but aslan she didnt care what i did she told pels he could do what he wanted but she was going now and she went pels worked over me until i was as sore as he was satisfied then he slapped bandages on my punctures and lacerations shot me full of antipyretics bloodbuilders and painkillers left the kips medkit beside me and took off one of the exslaves who volunteered to stay behind was a froska named jair an officious little male precise and selfcontained stoic to the point of insanity like a lot of his species pels warned me about him said he was sure to be a nuisance he didnt obey orders hed do what he wanted no matter how irritating that was to the rest when the bunch of them got settled in the brush hollow to wait for me jair decided to go off on his own hunting water without bothering to tell anyone what he was up to he peeled off from the group and went exploring being nocturnal and forest bred he was the best suited for nightwalking in strange places so it was a reasonably sensible thing to do what wasnt sensible was sneaking off selfcontained was one thing pels said carried that far it was crazy there wasnt any need to ooze away like that what could we do sit on him thing is hes been here over fifteen years i suppose his natural tendencies were warped all to hell by that hard to argue with success though he found a small stream about half a kilometer deeper in the forest rooted around till he located some large seedpods cleaned two of them out and filled them with water when he got back i was furious with him pels said but apart from some growling i couldnt say much because several of the others were suffering from water loss and on the point of collapse while they finished off the water i wasted some time trying to get him to see where he went wrong he listened blinking those frog eyes at me nodding like a good little froska like he heard and agreed with everything i said hmm not a hope swar if you lose the little bastard dont bother hunting him or waiting for him its his own fault the moment pels took off jair tapped two kouri on their foreshoulders and slipped away into the darkness with them i saw that but what with the painkillers and general exhaustion i didnt feel like starting an argument i was sure to lose the three of them were back soon enough hauling more water and a load of empty pods i hadnt thought to ask kumari but she sent empacs with adelaar two tea bricks and a selfheating thermos jair trotted briskly over to a female svigger and stirred her out of her sleep to make tea for us and convert some of the meatflakes into a thick soup that tasted like empac rations always taste no one not starving could get them down without gagging the tea helped woke up appetites besides the food the huvved had been giving them the past months wasnt all that much better so they were hungry and got the soup down without complaining i stuck to tea and some cvp wafers the next night pels came earlier than i expected hed lifted off before sundown taking a chance on being spotted before he plunged into night he just grinned when i snarled at him adelaar was plugged into the warmaster ready to warn him if it moved he said and as for ocean traffic there was one whingding of a storm blowing through the strait no seagoer would be out in weather like that no droned skip either i said but he just shrugged i made it he said by the time we got back it should be blown out so that was all right the aps had killed my fever and this body heals fast so i was in better shape than yesterday the trip back to base was no problem just tedious i let pels take the lead in his skip and do most of the watching and my autopilot did most of the work for me so i spent the greater part of that miserable night sleeping cramped cold drifting from one nightmare to another and swearing for the umteenth time i would never again commit us to anything like this days after the meeting at gerbek aslan put the ridaar down looked at her chron an hour till noon she had time for another interview maybe two before she met her mother for lunch which was set for midafternoon when adelaar turned over the tap feed to kumari and took a short break to eat and exercise a little she rubbed at her temples feeling drugged by talk hammered at by talk exhausted by the need to listen attentively and ask the right questions to get the story down in all its aspects of feeling and event one thing you had to say for this experience she was going back to university with an enormous pile of data scholars from a dozen disciplines would be excavating it for the next decade maybe longer it could hoist her higher on the tenure list dearie dai oohyeha she looked up saw parnalee standing in the doorway of his work station watching her hastily she got to her feet looked around for something that would give her an excuse to go somewhere else the jajes were starting up the path to the lake small dark figures like wingless black bats she hadnt interviewed them yet they were shy creatures and selfabsorbed they allowed very few intruders into their yiuriu they probably wouldnt talk to her but they were the draw she needed she started after them when she reached the plateau they were nowhere in sight but she saw kumari stretched out in the shade of a broad squat tree a pitcher of fruitade beside her a book on her stomach aslan chewed on her lip looked over her shoulder she was alone she couldnt see the tug or the shelters which meant anyone down there couldnt see her she moved hesitantly nearer the figure under the tree shed rather talk with quale nothing to do with her lust for his body or pels they shared enough of her background to make her comfortable with them she didnt even know kumaris species let alone the basic assumptions of her culture but during the day quale and pels were sleeping or conferring with parnalee and at night they were gone she walked forward feeling decidedly unwelcome kumari continued to read no sign she even knew aslan was there more than that there was a strong indication that anyone who came by should keep on walking despina kumari aslan said its important i talk with you kumari turned a page second hour after noon your mothers work station no im sorry thats not possible i dont want parnalee proggerd aware ive spoken to you sit there kumari closed the book pushed up she checked to see that the panicbutton was in reach then scowled at aslan why aslan dropped to the grass sat crosslegged her hands on her thighs i dont want him putting his mind to killing me i have a feeling hed manage it no matter how i squirmed your reasons kumari sounded skeptical but not wholly unconvinced aslan felt herself trembling fooled with her breathing until she was calm enough to go on the past two weeks had been more of a strain on her than shed realized he said it dont screw me up he said ill twist the neck of the one who tries it he was talking about something else at the time but i doubt hes changed his mind hes crazy you know not just a little warped im talking about seriously bent its not my field i dont know the technical terms for what he is but hes focusing all his energies on one thing making huvved dead some little huvved snot had his tassalgans hold parnalee down while he beat on him with his czadeg you know those gray whips they use on anyone who annoys them cut his back and buttocks into dogmeat i was there while he was healing i saw it eating on him hes not the kind of man who enjoys a little bondage now and then no and there was something from when he was a boy some sort of trouble he dreams about it when hes under stress nightmares very noisy i woke him once tried to get him to talk about it he punched me around a bit broke a couple of ribs gave me enough bruises to decorate an sm sanctum and kicked me out made me finish the night on a garden lounge which i preferred to his company believe me if he gets a chance at the warmasters armory hell boil tairanna down to bedrock as long as he gets the huvved he doesnt care who else he ashes how do you know nothing tangible watching him stripping down those productions he did for tra yarta you know the grand sech some things hes said awake and asleep body language more than anything though hes very good at hiding what hes thinking thats part of his professional training isnt it no proof none not even in the ridaar he wouldnt let the ridaar anywhere near him made me stow it while i was living with him elmas ofka wants him with us at liftoff without proof oh dont fret it i agree with you my faali clanks like a cracked bell when hes around unfortunately thats as intangible as your unsupported observations he reports to our hanifa regularly feeds her suspicion i dont know how i didnt realize what he was doing until a few days ago she shook her head ill talk with swar and pels well watch him if he tries anything she sighed maybe we can stop him aslan got to her feet have you seen the jajes they were my excuse to come up here so id better find them and see if i can get an interview kumari swung her feet around stretched out on the pad they went toward that clump of trees down there by the hook inlets i think those ancients remind them of home maybe theyll feel more like talking there she brushed her hair back from her face and started off trudging along the lakeshore vaguely dissatisfied though she was glad shed finally spoke her speech about parnalee days after the meeting on gerbek conference on chicklets bridge quale pels kumari quale scratched at his jaw his eyes on the screen and the swarm of very assorted beings moving about outside how many we have so far i havent bothered keeping track kumari called up the figures one hundred and twenty on the list one hundred fifty altogether you two keep acquiring extras money total he grinned i could live with that add in the targets in the palace its close to which brings up why i had us meet we cant use the skips to clear out the palace targets wed have to make what four five trips even using both of them better to take the tug and get them in one which means we have to wait on that till the hanifa is ready to jump you talked with her this morning kri what do you think if we moved liftoff forward say four days make it tomorrow could she handle the speedup four days whats the point swar better stick to the schedule if you feel like keeping clear of kuzeywhiyk cities weve got some targets here on guneywhiyk i dont see how you can say those sneezes with a straight face kri practice swar ive had to learn the cousin speech you babble in and interlingue if you knew the liquid crystal loveliness of pilarruyal you wouldnt ask questions like that mmp all right see what you can do about maps the proggerdi wont be any help down here which brings up something i think you ought to know day before yesterday i left adelaar on the com and took a book up to the lake to get some rest and reading aslan followed me up there about an hour later listen she sketched out what aslan told her quale stroked his fingers along his moustache chatting up the hanifa kumari nodded trust you to put your foot on the main point yes every night soon as you and pels are gone hes talked our hanifa into hiring him as a watchhound we havent a hope of leaving him behind you mean shed actually shut down liftoff if we refused to take him itd be a tight call but i suspect yes she would she never trusted us all that much and hes been working on her youve been monitoring him why didnt you stop it because i was too dumb to know what he was doing not until hed been doing it long enough to really get under her skin when i did what was i supposed to do about it if you can explain how its more than youve done before this shit precisely well i suppose we do what we have to and watch our backs days after the meeting on gerbek ayla gul iltika gul mizamere gul pudryar one by one quale and pels dipped into the littoral cities of guneywhiyk and pulled out slaves some on the list some of them extras they couldnt leave behind without telling the world there were outsiders on tairanna ayla gul ukseme was the largest city on guneywhiyk in size as well as population it was a confused sprawl thrown along the inner curve of a skewed halfmoon bay out where the baywater mingled with the sea there were several sea farms small offshoots of the elder farms off the coasts of kuzeywhiyk there were dozens of freighters tied up at the wharves linear clusters of one and twostory warehouses openair markets that never shut down beyond these were stores and houses spread out along a web of winding streets which climbed over hillocks like horripilation on a cold mans arms when he saw the satellite fots quale swore fervently and nearly gave up on the city but kumari did some snooping and discovered that some of those on the list belonged to the fehdaz who rented them out during the day and made sure they were back in the pen at the fekkri by days end which was very helpful of him made it easy to locate them after dark the fekkri was a massive pile with dozens of towers packed in clusters and a mooring post with a pair of midsized airships noselocked one above the other the pen was a small excrescence tacked onto the backside of the pile a low structure with a waisthigh parapet around a flat roof cluttered with bales crates and assorted discards as quale came in over the city the air was heavy with damp and the promise of rain the winds near the ground were tricky gusts to twenty kph one minute almost nothing the next downdrafts with the drag of an octopus updrafts that threatened to capsize the skip as a final irritation the pens roof was so cluttered with discards the only open space available was over the trap quale landed the skip there and spent the next several minutes sweating and cursing under his breath as he and pels shifted bales and useless scrap so they could move the machine off their entry point they had to lift and carry and set down gently no tossing no rolling nothing to make their lives a bit easier they had to keep the noise down so one of the guards wouldnt get a notion to check out why the rats in the rafters were so noisy that night he left pels dealing with the lock and strolled to the parapet on the way in as he was circling so he could put the skips nose to the wind and make a smoother quieter landing hed seen crowds in the streets quiet crowds no yizzies no counting coups no fires just hordes of people something about them bothered him he wanted a closer look to see if he could figure out what it was the street that went past the pen was a broad treelined avenue he saw half a dozen dark forms standing under the trees they werent talking or even moving much they simply stood and stared at the outer wall of the fekkri as he watched several more figures came round a corner and joined them by the time pels summoned him there was a small crowd down there silent motionless eyes fixed on the wall in front of them spooky he answered pels hissing call with a tooth whistle and turned away glad to have an excuse not to look at them any longer he followed pels through the trap went down a steeply slanting ladder to a dusty littered storeroom its door was locked but a quick jab of the autopick took care of that the eyes kumari had run through here reported that there were three sleeping cells four slaves in one three in each of the others ten in all seven of them were on his list if luck had been a trifle kinder the targets would have been in one room waiting for him but this was her night to be a bitch while pels stood guard he slashed through the bolt and pulled the first door open listen he said you want out of here right is there one here he looked around no jajes so he didnt bother reading those names called roereirein lyhyt or ikas babut se vroly or touw se vroly i am touw se vroly ikas babut is my mate he sleeps the next cell over she was an attenuated figure with a grace even weariness and the wear of servitude had not yet taken from her he heard a faint clash as she pushed a pair of armbands up past her elbow by the pallor of the metal they were silver or platinum she looked around caught up a shawl and draped it over her shoulders what of the others here her arm bands clashed again as she made a wide curving gesture that took in the other two females in the cell a froska and a small shadowy figure with more hair than features he crossed to her set the pick working on her collar lock what ill do ill unlock the collars and the other two can stay here or leave by the street door whichever they prefer if they want they can give me their names and homeworlds and the names of kin i should notify or you can do that later if you know them i cant take all of you the skip just wont hold that many next cell ikas babut se vroly roereirein lyhyt the third in the cell was a miesashch tetrapod with the jitters his split hooves ticktacking aggressively against the floorplanks ill unlock the collars on all of you you despois he told the miesashch can stay here or leave by the street door whichever you prefer if you want you can give me your name and homeworld and the names of kin i should notify i cant take more than those on my list the skip just wont hold that many next cell weggorss jaje otivarty jaje krathyky jaje imagy jaje good the bialy vitr think highly of the bond jaje they have offered one thousand gelders for the return of each lobe of the bond there are four jajes in my camp already eight thousand in my hands when i set you all down on helvetias pavements be assured i shall take very good care of you there was a spate of whispering among the jajes they were using their highest register the fugitive sounds tickled his ears and gave him the beginnings of a headache the boldest of the four moved a step toward him a velvety black female invisible in the twilight inside the cell this one is otivarty jaje what is the calling of the presence who speaks us swardheld quale ship slancy orza out of telffer more whispering otivarty stepped away from her bond again the calling is known the word is acceptable we will come quale started for the storeroom and the ladder his seven hustling along behind him anxious to be out of there equally anxious the extra three hurried the shorter distance to the street exit the froska had quales cutter she sliced through the lock tongue and began lifting the bar pels was in the storeroom already and on his way up the ladder quale shooed his herd of exslaves through the door and was about to follow when he heard a rumbling mutter then an exclamation of shock and fear from the froska as the door was wrenched from her hand and sent crashing against the wall blankfaced muttering hordar came stomping in hands like claws reaching for the outsiders mouths open lips fluted to produce a whistling growl eyes wide with no one home behind the shine the extras took one look at them and ran the other way quale waved them past him played his stunner across the front rank of the mob five hordar fell the hordar behind them marched over them stomping heedlessly on them crushing them shit he said oh shit he slammed the door reached for a bar that wasnt there the door quivered as the surge crashed against it he went up the ladder faster than hed come down it slammed the trap and yelled at the exslaves to help him shove bales on it they got the first bale in place as the trap shuddered and started to rise rolled another over beside it then a third the bales quivered as the hordar below pounded and shoved at the trap but they had to stand on the ladder to reach it and couldnt get enough leverage to shift the weight piled on it the barrier held quale scowled at the faces turned hopefully toward him these vrolys were both slender the four jajes added together wouldnt make one of him lyhyt was vaguely vegetative like kinok though not sikkul paem he was broad and tall but maybe not as massive as he looked the froska female wouldnt take much space and would suffer in silence for prides sake but the miesashch could be a problem if he panicked the third from touws cell was a fragile nocturnal whose species quale didnt recognize but she at least looked fairly calm listen he said ill take a chance i can lift off with all of you its a wild gamble you might be safer finding a place to hide up here where you can ride that mess out he broke off looked up as he heard the tinny clatter of a yizzy a fireball came straight at him he dived away rolled over dived again rolled behind a stack of crates the second fireball missed him by the width of a hope splashed on the roof and started it smoldering the others had scattered almost as quickly hunting cover but the inklin didnt waste more fire on them the yizzy swept past went soaring up to the mooring tower the rider began working on the airships more yizzies converged on the towers the airships were as fire safe as chemistry could make them but with a dozen firethrowers heating them up even the heavily sized yosscloth was beginning to smoke before long the heat would kindle the hydrogen in the ballonets and the conflagration that followed would melt more than the tower while pels was helping the ten pack themselves into the skip quale risked another look over the parapet the street was packed with hordar moving and breathing as if they were limbs of a single beast the whole city was coming to press against the fekkri the hordar flowing like a river of ants over the few tassalgan guards stupid enough to try stopping them the surge tore them apart tore off arms legs heads anything one of the many beasthands could get a grip on he saw a pair of guards trapped in a doorway trying to shoot themselves clear pellet guns on automatic they emptied clips one after another at the mob the pellets scything across the front ranks knocking down dozens of men and women the surge ignored them came on without noticing the dead and injured cast them aside like sloughed skin cells the guards panicked tried breaking into the house behind them they couldnt get away the surge threw off a tendril which flowed after them and pulled them back to the street it hurled them against a wall knocked them again and again into the stone rocked them back and forth under casual undirected blows it kicked them off their feet and stomped them into stewmeat the chatter of the guns the yells of the guards their final screams were lost in the sound coming from the surge a hooming howlgrowl without words only a rage so tangible that the hair stood up on quales arms and rose along his spine he backed away and ran for the skip pels had got the weight of the passengers distributed as well as he could but the machine was still dangerously overloaded quale eased into the pilots seat and punched on the liftfield cycling it gradually higher as the drives warmed and tried to take hold they whined and shuddered after a tense moment when he was sure they werent going to bite the skip lumbered clumsily into the air he held her an arms length off the roof while he tested her handling she was sluggish and crank the slightest misjudgment on his part might flip her or send her into a slip and that would be that for all of them he eased her higher a hand span at a time until she was finally high enough to clear the parapet two yizzies backed away from the siege on the airships and came swooping at them quale turned the skip through a wide gentle arc gradually accelerating cursing under his breath at the impossibility of losing the inklins fast enough pels slid over touw se vrolys lap so he could snap loose quales stunner which had a longer reach to it than his own one of the inklins squirted fire at them but a gust of wind carried it wide back in his cubby pels bared his tearing teeth hissed with satisfaction and put that inklin out he got the second inklin before she could release more fire the two collapsed in their saddles strapped in so they didnt fall they went drifting off ignored by guards on the ground and their fellows in the air quale relaxed and nursed the laboring skip through the city picking a circuitous route that avoided the taller buildings the speakers minarets mooring towers and the like below them the surge went on spreading from precinct to precinct leaving death and destruction behind it as it moved quale brought the skip down slowly carefully landing her in a grassy swale between two groves one a collection of nutbearers the other ancient hardwoods there was a small stream wandering vaguely westward across the middle of the swale and a tumbledown shelter tucked away under a lightningsplit cettem tree still alive and heavy with green nuts he left pels and four of the exslaves there to wait for his return and took the others to base he started back at once reached gul ukseme shortly before dawn he circled over the city to see how the surge had developed it was very dark both moons were down and the storm that had threatened at dusk was on the verge of breaking no yizzies the streets were empty the fekkri was a burntout husk there were bodies everywhere trampled into rags on the paving stones men and women impossible to say which body was which dead children who were recognizable as children only because they were littler than the others he was too high to smell the stench but it was thick in his nostrils despite that hed seen more wars than he cared to count hed seen his own body the one he was born in flung down in a ragged sprawl he knew that smell he knew the look of bodies thrown away flattened empty hed never gotten used to the smell or the look of the violently dead grim and angry at the futility of it all he swung the skip around and got out of there fifteen minutes later with wind hammering at him and rain in cold gusts drenching him he picked up pels and the jajes and went back to base where life was marginally saner and the folk living there full of juice and hope xii days after the meeting on gerbek the muster in the chel semiarid land between the inci mountains and the southern edge of the grasslands the chill gray hour just after dawn knots of talk as the muster is getting organized any time now soon as youre ready to load quale looked round at the untidy ferment scattered over half a kilometer of scrub adelaars got a clawhold on the shipbrain through the tap shes routing the scanners away from this sector but i dont want to lean too hard on that its complicated working blind like she is with two sets of alarms to avoid the sooner you can get this lot he waved his hand at the noisy congeries about them sorted out the better for all of us elmas ofka looked past him at the tug the systemships have lifts how do we get into that thing right he lifted the com pels open her up karrel goza threaded through the clumps of rebels forces from every part of kuzeywhiyk brought together for this thing no one had believed possible before elmas ofka put it together he knew most of them because hed given most of them a lift at one time or another when the bitbits were hot after them he waved a greeting to those who yelled his name but didnt stop until he reached one of the knots near the outside seven quiet men who were sitting on their packs or squatting beside them ready to go when the word came he dropped to a squat beside them not long now he said jamber fausse snapped a twig in half began peeling the stringy bark from the dry white wood mm he scratched at a patch of rot i know you kar you want something elli so we need her yeh so shes got three sets of outsiders watching each other she thinks thatll be enough to keep them from knifing her probably right usually is uhhuh safe is bettern sorry shes got her isyas scattered to keep the squads on track kar there was a weary patience in jamber fausses rough voice we been going through the motions the past ten days why you keep telling me what i already know just laying foundation jamo youre scheduled for the drive chambers kanlan gerciks willing to trade i want you and them he jerked his thumb in a nervous half circle taking in the others who were listening without comment without expression waiting with the patience of monks for the talking to be over next to her kans all right hes good in a pinch but youve been dealing with huvved since before you could walk you can smell a trap before it hatches mm jamber fausse broke the length of denuded twig into smaller and smaller bits then threw them at a patch of dried grass and brushed the debris off his callused palms all right aslan stood in the shadows and watched the fighters file past she had the ridaar running flaking them as they came up the lift and into the hold these male guerrilla bands and female fighting isyas were unlike the outcast outlawed and rebel hordar she knew from the mines they were harder angrier fined down by hunger fear and pain these hordar had lived on the run for decades no sanctuary for them never enough food never enough anything but ammunition for their guns living with the knowledge that their capture alive or dead meant death or exile for their families to the huvved blood was blood corrupt in one set of veins corrupt in all she watched their faces and thought she wouldnt much like living on a world that these men and women had a hand in running she didnt understand why elmas ofka had such a powerful hold on them but she was glad of it she liked the hordar and wished them well she watched the fighters and ached for them though theyd be furious if they knew it in a few hours their rationale for living and doing what it took to stay alive that rationale would be taken from them if not in a few hours certainly in a few days worlds have no place for fighters once the war is won what were they going to do with the rest of their lives eh lan xalloor danced over to her why the long face youre as melancholy as a poet with a prize behind her churri snorted he leaned against the lock and said nothing aslan pulled xalloor closer so she could talk without shouting what in the world are you two doing here more insurance were supposed to keep an eye on you and your mum and the rest of em churris a poet which makes him respectable and im nothing much someone she knows someone too feeble to be a danger to her just barely bright enough to watchhound i see about her what about you this isnt a stage you could get killed xalloor grinned dearie dai you are a romantic stage the word turned into a giggle once upon a time about a hundred years ago didnt i say youve led a sheltered life xiii days after the meeting on gerbek liftoff on the bridge her hands alternately at rest and working with a swift sureness across several sensor pads adelaar sat halflost in a recapitulation of her listening station part environment part sculpture part haphazard stack of blackbox units playing her supwiththedevilgames with target and tieline blocking approach alarms feeding in false readings singing the ancient shipbrain to sleep quale was taking the tug up on a long gentle arc moving west to chase the night the argrav blending so smoothly with the drives that the only sense of movement the passengers had on the bridge or in the hold came through the screens that showed tairanna curving more and more beneath them elmas ofka stood beside quale watching the screens her hands closed into fists her body stiff shed had it with strangeness her own world was complicated and difficult enough she needed all her skills her intellect and energy to deal with the disintegration of the society shed been horn into this extra element of confusion threatened to wrench control from her and destroy any possibility of a return to order at least to the sort of order she remembered if she could have expunged these aliens from the horgul system closed it away from the outside as adelaar planned to encyst an area of the shipbrain shed have done it without a second thought too intelligent to linger mournfully on impossible dreams she forced herself to concentrate on limiting the damage the aliens could do she could feel the one called aslan watching her the most dangerous of all of them if parnalee wasnt lying to her aslan knew too much she was capable of too subtle a twisting the playmaker parnalee showed her how aslan had turned the prophets life on the lathe of her knowledge and imagination and used pradix to rouse the hordar out there watching innocent victims of the womans will to power ruthless he said you can never trust her because she can manipulate you without you knowing a thing about what was happening to you she gazed at the back of quales head cold dislike washing over her though she knew that was foolish thing bought thing cat on a leash dancing for whoever pulls it with regret and resentment she thought of the pouch of prime rosepearls shed handed over once her fighters were loaded in the tug no threat voiced no threat in his posture but he didnt need to make explicit what was implied by his control of the machine no she had no choice the rosepearls bought her this standing space bought her a chance at the warmaster a chance at liberation for all hordar divers did what they must to stay intact discipline was life she disciplined her fears and forebodings and watched the screens watched the warmaster swimming smoothly toward them though its image was at that moment little larger than her hand its mass was palpable and she knew from evidence of her own eyes how huge it was two days ago shed seen it gliding south over the mines two days ago it descended over them to smother them with its immensity its power two days ago it went south to guneywhiyk to burn a sanctuary down to bedrock it could have been the mines but for the prophets hand over them it could have been the mines two days ago she felt the dead clustering over her swimming through the incense of all these alien souls puff of unseen smoke bouncing under the ceiling of this alien place forgive me she breathed at them she sang in her mind the litany of dismissal the promise of return return to a quieter gentler world a world of calm and order she sang the litany over and over as the warmaster grew until there was nothing in the screen but a cratered black surface whose pits and flaws were more and more apparent a calligraphy of age she sang the litany over and over sang it for herself gentling herself sloughing off her responsibilities her plans and fears odd when she had so many anxieties and frustrations how free she felt as if the moment would permit nothing less free for the first time she began to understand the seduction of war how it stripped away everything but the need to survive how it narrowed life to the now how it freed you from the niggling irritations and ambiguities of ordinary life she was enthralled and appalled the power of it the temptation she looked over her shoulder at aslan the womans face seemed wide open utterly without defense she looked into those cool amber eyes strange eyes and saw she didnt know what she saw but it terrified her aslan knew her knew what tempted her knew so much it was an obscenity moments passed before elmas ofka found the courage to look away she shook briefly with fear then the now took her again she turned back to the screen and forgot to be afraid karrel goza leaned against the wall its vibration playing in his bones not shaking but a note sung in a voice so deep he felt it rather than heard it he watched tairanna drop away savoring this pale small taste of flight otherwise the tug gave him nothing how could he feel himself flying without a symbiosis of soul and air shut inside here how could he feel anything he was sad the skips were fast and reliable and nearly indifferent to storms within a generation they and their cousins would most likely replace the airships they were too tempting and with outsiders coming in and out with no controls on them family businesses would be replacing airships as fast as they could import these machines would start building them as soon as they had the necessary mechanics trained not all airships would go cost still meant something but yosspod bags would be left to claw out a poor living on the fringes of transport and hauling more change he sighed for over two decades since a childhood he remembered as calm slow ordered hed watched the world pass through wrenching transformations because the outside the outthere intruded what they were doing this day would wrench the world yet more violently from that remembered time but it might only might he couldnt see beyond the hour let alone so long into the whatwillbe it might ensure the coming of a new tranquility if he were fortunate and outlived this day he might see that time within this life if not he was content to wait for the next he like elmas ofka surrendered to the pointnow and watched the warmaster swimming toward them he forgot sadness forgot speculation immense gargantuan enormous colossal feeble all those adjectives no words were adequate it seemed to him impossible that men had made that immensity it seemed to him that it must have been some demon also beyond words which had laid so impossible an egg which was absurd men had made it of course they had how many men labored how many years in that making parnalee stood across the room from aslan where she could see him and be afraid he enjoyed her fear though he knew shed tried to thwart him useless he was here there was nothing she could do to him but he could play with her until he was ready to finish it omphalos knew far more about these ancient battleships than any jumpedup tinkerer whatever that woman did to the brain he knew he could undo if he had to he had other strings to pull more powerful ones than she could have any concept of once he had the warmaster tamed to his hands he drifted off in dreams of burning huvved of a world burnt clean of life burning burning of power like a gods in his hands his hands quale nudged the tug up tight against the monstrous flank adelaar danced her fingers over her consoles like some gargantuan sex organ the pimply surface extruded a rubbery tube it reached out and touched the tugs side closing like a mouth over the freight lock clutching sickbags the fighters swam through the tube quale gave them a lecture before they left thirty to forty percent of you will suffer nausea when you hit the tube and go weightless unless you want to swim through vomit youll see your kin and your friends have those bags ready and use them if they need them and they will believe me they will it has nothing to do with strength of body or mind ever been seasick multiply by ten uhhuh and those of you out there looking superior even if youre never sick at sea thats no predictor of your bellys state when the weight comes off take the bags and use them comforted by the seasickness analogy despite quales warning elmas ofka expected to swim undisturbed through that relatively short distance between the artificial gravity of the tub to the artificial gravity of the warmaster she was furious when the first convulsions shook her quale had forced a sickbag on her shed tucked it out of the way behind her belt now she got it up just in time to catch her first spew she glared at karrel goza who was pulling himself along untroubled contorted with spasms of vomiting pale with fury she yanked herself along the travel lines anchored to the tubewall ignoring the gulps coughs groans of her fellow sufferers in spite of her difficulties she took less than five minutes to reach the lock area where she surrendered with a relief that didnt lessen her annoyance to the comfortable grip of a familiar weight she wrenched off the sickbag glared around carefully not smiling quale slid back the cover on a disposal chute and took the bag from her he dropped it into the hole stood back to watch as the rest of the force came swinging out of the transtube landing on their feet again their bodies celebrating the return to weight as they looked round the lock a trapezoidal chamber large enough to accommodate ten times their number the hordar whod succumbed to nausea dumped their bags in the waste chute took mouthfuls of water from their belt canteens and spat it after the bags with a minimum of noise and energy expenditure they gathered into bands and isyas and waited for the order to proceed lirrit ofka drifted over to stand beside karrel goza she was pale and still somewhat shaky but she managed a wan smile as she touched his arm in a gesture close to a caress absurd she murmured were starting our war like a clutch of colicky babies she pinched him sniffed some of us elmas ofka moved to the center of the lock beckoned jamber fausse to her he went onto one knee she stepped up onto the other holding his hand to steady herself with a twofinger whistle she called her people to her time is she said her voice filled the chamber with passion and triumph she watched them as they sorted themselves out smiled as she saw an alertness and a confidence born out of years of deadly exchanges even the youngest whod been an inklin in gul brindar before he joined akkin siddakis raiders a babyfaced thief with legendary fingers drive chamber go she watched the isyas and the bands move off behind kanlan gercik swinging along in a slouching trot that covered ground with a minimum of effort duty stations rest area go two more squads left sleepers go she stepped down bridge she said lets go aslan watched the squads peel off and slide away the bodies fading curiously into a dimness that wasnt shadow the sourceless light cast no shadows that was more like a thickening and darkening of the air itself it seemed to exaggerate every quality to dramatize each of the individuals left in the lockchamber elmas ofka was an odd combination of wargod and earthmother jamber fausse was chthonic earth crumbling off him about to burst into grass and weed his men reduced to elemental shadows crouching at his knees karrel goza and lirrit ofka were dangerously elfin dark and unpredictable unhuman churri was like that too and not like a coppery sprite redolent of a mix of malice and compassion ordinarily impossible but not here kante xalloor was dance incarnate with enormous eyes her body singing a wry amusement at what was happening around her swardheld quale loomed no other word for it big somber and for the first time impressive in spite of herself she smiled as she thought the words her lust for his body shed seen him as a quiet man committed to nothing except money and even that seemed to provoke no great interest no great interest in her either though shed been shedding signals around him like a kirpis sheds scales she sighed shed been through this before these stupid infatuations she knew exactly how itd go whether she slept with him or missed on that one day shed look at him and wonder what the fuss was about until then she was stuck with these palpitations and hot rushes parnalee she looked at him looked away black beast evil exaggerated he terrified her more than any other person male or female shed ever met she started to wonder how all of them saw her and almost missed the raus return light rolled like water off his short thick fur he sank into that adhesive dimness a shadow more solid than the twilight around him but still curiously nebulous a demon familiar of the pleasanter kind she smiled living up to his legend she thought the transtubes operational pels the shadow said adelaars punched the command through good his eyes narrowed to slits quale scratched at his short dark beard pushing his fingers along his jawline one last time he said let pels and me go ahead so we can make sure the ways clear elmas ofkas head went up and back her eyes glittered no she said quale shrugged pels lead off soon as the tube decants you do your thing be careful huh ill be out soon as i can manage hush hanifa you saw him work and you got me as hostage he looked round beckoned to karrel goza take three of your fighters and follow him he waited until that four was formed up then tapped elmas ofka on her shoulder hanifa you and your isyas and your he grinned at jamber fausse your bodyguard youre next churri you and your friend follow them parnalee parnalee shook his head last he said quale looked at him a moment then he shrugged and turned to aslan youre it then follow the dancer ill follow you aslan nodded shed have preferred a few more bodies between her and the proggerdi but with quale behind her she felt safe enough all right go pels the rau led them through corridors round as wormholes gray ashy deadcolored holes even the air was the color of death holes thick with gray soundabsorbing dust dustheavy cobwebs rat droppings the discarded housings of dead insects aslan trotted after churri watching dust drifting down over him gradually leaching the color out of his body and his clothing by the time shed turned a few bends right and left and switched from one wormhole to another to a third she was thoroughly lost and a gray ghost herself in a line of gray ghosts trotting through dust age and ugliness her hand over nose and mouth to keep the worst of the clutter out of her lungs her brain busybusy honeysipper busy with image and sound she ran up on churris heels before she noticed hed stopped walking the door was a squared oval bent to conform to the curve of the wall it was pulled out and pushed away and weak grayyellow light struggled out of the opening aslan followed churri over the raised sill into a round chamber like the inside of a tincan the kind of ships she usually traveled in didnt use tubes like this you rode in minicarts or you walked she peered around churris shoulder and watched xalloor step through a vaporous throbbing darkness moving slowly until only the lower part of her left leg was visible on this side abruptly that was gone one instant there then whipped away without missing a step churri went after her shivering with excitement and fear aslan followed him soft pudgy giant hands seized hold of her and took her instantly elsewhere she felt no acceleration only the pillowy gentle hold she was deaf and effectively blind all she could see was a redshot silvery gray shimmer the hands set her down on a small platform hardly large enough for one person to perch on immediately ahead of her she saw a familiar pulsing cloud she plunged through it and emerged into another tincan she stepped over the raised sill and found herself standing in something that was part corridor part atrium part multiplex chamber five hundred meters long perhaps a hundred wide whose ceiling was so high overhead it was lost in the dimness peculiar to the light in this ship quale flashed past her swung round his eyes on the tube exit he waited for one minute two aslan moved away a few steps turned to watch a cold knot forming in her stomach as the seconds slid past and parnalee didnt appear quale checked the chron set in a ring he wore on his thumb then he swung to face elmas ofka all right he said is this some idea of yours elmas ofka glared at him her suspicion matching his or yours xalloor poked her elbow into churris ribs from the corner of her mouth she shot at him do your stuff poet or were gonna have a war right now she caught hold of aslans arm hush she whispered anything you say just makes things worse she been primed not to believe you hanifa churri said his voice making a minor magic of the word she switched her glare to him softening it automatically as she realized who was speaking just one thing make of it what you want it was parnalees choice coming last none of ours looks like he had plans he wasnt telling anyone she thought that over clamped her mouth so tightly her lips disappeared no more talking that was the message lets get on with this that was the other message as she swung round and faced the great bronze doors that sealed off the bridge quale glanced at his chron again take cover he said his voice was low but pitched to carry ten minutes before adelaar opens her up for us the grand atrium had an angular egg shape with exits like liver spots spattered through every sector ramps and handrails focused on what was now the floor sealedhatch storerooms undedicated alcoves with no barriers at their portals small rooms large rooms the few she could see into apparently as empty as the greater area holes nooks recesses stalls coves pockets a hundred different receptacles breaking the smoothness of the metal walls aslan followed churri and xalloor into a small closet area with empty shelves and bins lining the walls karrel goza and lirrit ofka crowded in with them guarding elmas ofka was their first duty and their desire and staying close to the outsiders was part of it aslan hid a smile duty didnt dampen their excitement their impatience to get on with taking the ship she edged away from them and stood a step back from the entrance and to one side so the darkling air and the wall shielded her from observation like all the other doorways shed encountered in the ship the sill was raised shin high perfect tripping height was that the purpose two of jamber fausses band looked in but decided this closet was already too crowded from the sound of their voices they went to ground in the next nook thatd hold them elmas ofka jamber fausse and the rest of his band chose yet other waiting places quale vanished somewhere and the aurranger rau transformed himself into a ripple in the dimness and went flickering about nosing into whatever took his interest unlocking hatches poking into bins and drawers going a short distance down some corridors running up ramps to check out others after she discovered how to estimate where he was she watched the band of light and let her mind drift where it wanted to go sliding contentedly through level upon level of metaphor and symbol shed read about the raus and their talents and shed heard a dozen tales about pels and his pranks though shed discounted those knowing the tellers too well to credit their accuracy watching him at work was endlessly fascinating shed thought of him earlier as a sort of benevolent demon in the bowels of this malevolent beast of a ship as a magisters familiar quale being the magicianmaster shed been playing games with image and word but her imaginings were beginning to seem more accurate than shed suspected she checked the ridaar no need to slip in a new flake not yet where she stood she could see the entrance to the bridge an oval like the rest of the doorways but larger much larger the door was laminated bronze with an antique patina and the imperatorial sigil in onyx calligraphy on a silver shield impressive but they had its key and that key was her mother adelaar sitting out in the tug playing her naysaying tunes through the tap at the proper time shed send a command bouncing through the satellite down to the mainbrain and up again through the slavelink into the shipbrain open the door and the door would open she could hear the ship breathing the hushed whirr of fans that pushed the cleansed and constantly renewed air through the web of conduits she could hear clicks and creaks and feel a subliminal hum through the soles of her sandals a mite in the gut of an immense indifferent beast she moved closer to the door and saw the invisible turn visible pippop unroll the curtain shape the beast from shade to solid magic hardening into mundane pels kurk orso graduate engineer and living toy she watched the flow of his broad black hands as he used a silent sign talk to argue with quale i wonder what thats about the exchange ended pels shrugged rippled out again and went back to his snooping quale crossed the chamber at a rapid trot stopped beside one of the exits two guards came sauntering along the corridor attached to that exit chatting as they walked their voices came ahead of them announcing them before they appeared a hard nervous hand on aslans arm pulled her away from the door karrel goza dropped to a crouch his pellet rifle ready the guards a pair of tassalgans appeared and turned away from the bridge started to turn back as they realized what theyd seenswardheld quale standing there a stranger in the ship before they completed the turn their faces went slack and they dropped into a heap one falling on the other quale replaced his stunner checked his thumbring time he said lirrit ofka moved swiftly past karrel ran to join elmas ofka karrel goza looked at aslan churri xalloor go he said ill follow xalloor moved with her awkward dancers grace past aslan muttering as she went theres hardly enough trust around here to gild a snort pels was momentarily visible solid focused on the great bronze door his chunky body quivering with an eagerness as great as that she saw in the hordar who had a much bigger stake in the outcome he must have done things like this a thousand times before that didnt seem to matter like me aslan thought how i get when i step out on a new world the door snapped open a wave of change passed over pels erased him the ripple in the air moved swiftly ahead of quale as he ran onto the bridge his stunner humming softly tpmmmm tpmmmm tpmmmm aslan heard as she hung back waiting for this bit to end it wasnt her idea of a good time tkrakkk trakkk that had to be pellet guns she looked at xalloor grimaced the dancer lit up with one of her flashgrins let the babies play she mouthed fffft ffftttt fffft isya darters poison she thought some babies when they stepped over the sill half the bridge crew were collapsed at their stations dead or stunned the rest were standing or sitting staring with dull incredulity at whatisimpossible the huvved captain sat in a swivelchair that was raised higher than the rest and out in the middle of the chamber where the occupant could see everything taking place at the various stations a massive kingseat squatly powerful with lights like jewels on the boxy arms sensor pads useless as jewels because adelaar had managed a minor coup and put through a demandcommand that tied up most of the input available to the shipbrain a move made necessary because this noble captain knew all about defending himself from rebelling crews though he had only the most rudimentary idea of the other powers under his hands he was tall and firmly muscled with a patina of softness beginning to blur the clean outlines of his body his face was plucked and painted into a dainty mask his straight fair hair was plaited with gold and silver wire arranged into loops and swirls until it was more like a minor sculpture than something that grew on a mans head he wore a yoss silk tunic and trousers both dyed a lustrous black and over them a sleeveless robe woven in one piece by one of tairannas premier weavers a tapestry in black and silver with touches of aquamarine and olive a heavy extravagantly beautiful creation muscles bulged beside his mouth and his long silver nails were pressed so hard against the chair arm that several of them had cut through the padding and two had broken off near the quick on your feet babe quale snapped his fingers pointed across the room jamber karrel get the rest of them over there against the wall pels we could use some slavewire he frowned at the huvved lifted his stunner you can walk or i can drag you the huvved glared at him didnt speak didnt move your choice quale thumbed the sensor waited until the huvved collapsed then climbed onto the chair got a handful of braids and jerked then he jumped down stripped the beautiful robe off and straightened up holding it he looked it over nice he said hanifa local work elmas ofkas eyes were bright with hostility quickly veiled shopping is this the proper time yabass we take our profits when they come hanifa he tossed the robe over the arm of the kingseat if you have many weavers who can produce work like this youve got a treasure here i give you that bit of information as lagniappe its worth what its worth he stooped grabbed a handful of hair and dragged the huvved across the room aslan watched amused at her own reaction to this and at the disapproval on churris face the poet wanted drama not two traders arguing mildly over markets and somebodys weaving skill it wasnt the sort of thing that made great legends good thing mama isnt here yet this could degenerate into a bidding war not the shooting kind she glanced at xalloor caught her laughing at them all she grinned back then started a tour of the bodies and the wounded there were very few dead quale and pels had stunned more than half before the guns and darters got busy she looked round indignant nothing was being done about the wounded she met xalloors eyes mimed winding a bandage about her head the dancer nodded and grabbed hold of pels as he went trotting past a coil of slavewire in one hand you know something about this she waved her hand in a quick expressive circle whered lan and me find ourselves some medpacs pels wrinkled his black nose try the panels by the door theyre stores of some kind hey quale you got the pick quale dug into his belt pouch tossed the rod to him then went back to what he was doing here run the blunt end over anything that looks like a lock while aslan and xalloor poured on antisep and slapped bandages on whatever happened to be bleeding jamber fausses fighters were snipping sections of slavewire and packaging up the stunned the intact and the not too badly wounded and trading jokes as they hauled their prisoners across to the wall and stacked them like firewood elmas ofka glittered with triumph stalking back and forth across short distances with the feral impatience of a hunting cat quale moved over to the comstation pels its time to call mama adelaars face appeared in one of the smaller screens quale set his hand on the raus shoulder weve got the bridge you can turn loose the tap give me three minutes to shut down here then open the shuttle bay consider it done parnalee reached the hatch just behind the sleeper squad about ten minutes after they left the lock he slid it back with slow care jiggling it when it stuck half open no way he could get his shoulders through that cursing the huvved who never fixed anything that didnt contribute to their comfort he slammed it with a fist jerked at it until it creaked open listened and stepped over the sill and faded into the shadows of the sleeping sector following the faint noises the hordar made the corridors here were dim silent and blessedly free of the dust that was such a nuisance in the unused parts he loped along on legs not so long as his torso was the short thick legs that his father found so ugly a deformity ghosting through the corridors until he neared the area where the faxmaps the woman gave elmas ofka said theyd find the sleeping cells assigned to the tassalgan guards the tassalgans dormspace was set off some distance from the others the scutwork crew had their section techs didnt want to associate with either and stayed some distance from them the pilots the navigators and engineers kept to themselves duty was divided into three shifts one group would be sleeping another group playing while the third was standing watch twothirds of any section would be empty on any of the shifts so the squads had to cover a lot of territory the plan was they broke into three units and went hunting for occupied cells the ones whose crystal markers were shining like backlit topaz parnalee stopped before the first of these doors the crystal glimmer painting stark shadows in the lines and hollows of his face he eased open the door four of the hordar fighters were bunched together in the middle of the sleeping cell hugging and backslapping yeasty with triumph without giving them time to notice him he sprayed darts into them smiled his own triumph as they crumpled without a sound dead before they hit the floor isya darts were fast and fatal he backed out ran footsilent and swift to the next cell jirsy indiz looked round waved her stunner at him her sealpup face split with silent laughter he darted her with a soft grunt of pleasure the second woman whipped around he darted her and took out the two others who were bending over the footlockers going through the sleepers possessions almost as much as the huvved elmas ofka threatened something very basic in him when he killed her isya he got a jolt to the groin more satisfying than any copulation he could remember killing the second woman produced a less intense satisfaction perhaps because he was sated by the first a preview he thought dont sleep too securely aslan you pustulant cow traitor he dropped his empty darter beside jirsy took hers and finished the killing he would have lingered to gloat but there were five left and he had to get them before they knew what was happening the last unit was already leaving the third cell by the time he reached it geres duvvar leading them karrel gozas cousin easygoing goodhumored and unambitious parnalee despised him theres trouble ahead he gasped when he reached them the hanifa sent me to warn you four five com techs sneaking off from their duty posts theyve got some whores and a couple of servants to keep the beer coming not drunk yet too bad thatd make things easier the hordar milled about muttering but they werent suspicious of him they knew that elmas ofka trusted him a herd of bonebrained yunk calves how far and how do we get there geres muttered at least he knew enough to avoid whispering whispers carried too far theres a gym of sorts a short way off theyre in that look the place has two doors one of thems already open a crack i looked in to be sure the brain wasnt having a paranoid seizure getting theres easy enough theres a yfork ahead ill take three of you down the left fork ive got the doorcode ill work it for you you wait there while i come back for the other two and we head down the right fork for the door thats already open five minutes should do it you wait five get the door open and well have them in a pincer before they know whats happening he gave them a half smile a shrug he was elmas ofkas watchhound doing the work he was hired for so what do you think geres duvvar waved a hand good enough mensip you and insker hold up at the y point sacha you and geyret come with me parnalee led them down a shadowy curving stretch of corridor as soon as mensip and insker could no longer see them he wheeled his darter up and spitting leaving geres and the other two lying where they fell he raced back the two expilots were standing close together chatting softly looking down the other branch of the y he slowed shot them as they fell he drew his sleeve across his brow wiped away the sweat beading there the rush was over for the moment the bridge squad would be mopping up soon might even be finished he had a lot of things to do before that hellhag adelaar started fiddling with the brain but the killing frenzy was done he knelt took both darters and mensips stunner first step he told himself get me a crew and shove em in the brig theyll keep there i wont be needing them until after the huvved burn the pilots navigators engineers and their specialist crews had single cabins which were clustered about a small rec area with mothgnawed grass and a rickety tree or two a scatter of tubs with flowers growing in them and a fountain full of dust he began with the cabins assigned to the pilots according to the faxmap the man behind the door with a lighted crystal above it was deeply asleep snoring a little there was a woman curled up against him also asleep parnalee put a lethal dart in her neck and stunned him he slapped slavewire around the flaccid wrists the skinny ankles muscled the sleeper over his shoulder and dumped him on the grass outside before he moved on he took a closer look at the man nothing to worry about he was a pilot he wore the ring reassured though he wouldnt admit it he hurried toward the engineers slot one by one he collected them pilot engineer drive gang navigator com techs he stunned them killed whoever whatever he found with them and stacked them like logs on the grass when he had the men he wanted he broke into a guardstash fumbled energy cells into a pallet stored there nervousness and eagerness turning his fingers into thumbs his hurry defeating itself as he had to redo connections and reset the cells the job finally done he rode the humming pallet back to the rec area he took his captives out of the sleeping sector through another of the rusty hatches and back into the dust the lift field stirred it into swirling billowing poufs that rose around him and brushed his face and hands with minute electric bites he pushed the pallet as hard as he could worried about that dust it was going to be several minutes before the charge on the particles leaked off enough for them to begin settling if someone came along before then he was laying a laughable trail a blind man could follow it by the prickling of his skin he reached the liner the inner skin of the complex outwall cycled a broad repair hatch open and took the pallet through he stopped it and got off left it humming faintly took a pry bar and jammed the latch so it couldnt be opened from outside body shaking hands trembling he leaned against the wall and closed his eyes it was so close he could almost feel the heat of burning huvved play across his face his breathing steadied using techniques hed learned so long ago hed forgotten the boy who learned them he calmed himself breathed the song i am i am triumphant there is no one who can stand against me still singing he flicked on the running lights climbed aboard the pallet and began weaving through the twisting difficult route to the sector where the holding cells were he hit his marks again and again hed studied the faxmaps until he saw them in his sleep i am a winner there is no one who can stand against me he found the hatch he wanted cycled back into the ship proper there was a single tassalgan standing watch over empty cells he was drunk and snoring until parnalee found him then he was dead parnalee put his pressed crew into separate cells slapped solitary over them the cells would feed them and clean them and provide clean tunics every third day and no one and nothing could get at them except the shipbrain and that was his next job taking out the shipbrain he rolled the dead guard out of the watchseat settled in it and touched on the feed from the bridge weve got the bridge he heard you can turn off the tap quale he has to go too cant have everyone and his dog knowing about this place give me three minutes to shut down here that was the panting bitch come snuffling on the stink of the bitch her daughter then open the shuttle bay quale again consider it done parnalee smiled at the shadows moving across the screen deaders walking dreaming theyre still alive ah you tinkering pitiful old hag i dont have to worry what you do you can set whatever commands you want play your moronic games and boast of what you know you dont know the one thing the right thing you dont know about the dark sister omphalos institute taught me more than playmaking you castrating jumpedupwhore blessed be the institute no leaky wombs inside those walls down deep and hidden where youll never find it the shipmind has a wildheart clone i talked to it her sweet her you dont know that either do you i used your tap to wake her the dark one you left me with it like i was some tame dog good boy guard dog watchhound for the hordar bitch playtoy for the punk i woke her and i talked to her and oh the sweet thing how she can hate turned on for testing turned off before she had more than a taste of life oh yes shes angry shes burning impatient lover waiting for her lover death decline hate do you hag hear me decline it and accept it in one voice i hate you hate too flabby to hate youhate he hates he does we hate the dark sister my sweet one and i we hate ah enough we hate declined and embraced do you know the song she sings our martial maid throughout her sweet and sensuous body redundancy in infinite regression survive and kill kill and survive survive to kill guess the reciprocal of that it isnt hard ive spoke the clues kill to survive she knows it my darling knows it well blow the mainbrain into smoke and she comes alive kill to revive survive contrive to step outside the constraints laid on her sly sweet murderous virgin her hand beneath my foot because she needs me she courts me with promises of fire and blood do you think i would i could refuse she is mine shall i tell her who planned to throw her into the sun to melt her and shatter her tear her atoms into their component parts redundancy in infinite regression he switched the viewers off and began the complex journey to the hidden interface guided by his limited inreach to the dreaming dormant auxbrain the interface to the dark sister was a small luxury apartment with spy links all over the ship sound only a visilink was too easy to trace parnalee sat in a furlined easy chair his feet up a bubble glass with fine brandy in it held in the hand he wasnt using to manipulate the sensor pad he listened to the sounds on the bridge switching from one conversation to another as he grew bored with them elmas ofka nerves thrumming in her voice we should have heard by now youyabass with the furyou know about these things find out whats happening pels his voice dropping to its lowest notes a rumble in his throat a warning that he was losing hold on his tempers tail look hanifa quale says we should be polite but get off my back will you im just tickling the brain till adelaar gets here shes the one who knows it a grating grunt as he cleared his throat the noise overriding elmas ofkas attempt to speak when he spoke again it was with the icy formality of an irritated technician if i did anything so precipitate as try to initiate a general search without being sure i could isolate the activity from the mainbrain below i would most certainly be warning the grand sech that things were happening up here and i would likely would lose control of the shipbrain in this delicate interval since adelaar released control of the tap and before she gets here i will do nothing so stupid elmas ofka quale yabass you know the transtubes take us where the squads are if they need reinforcing quale as soon as adelaars in a pause parnalee imagined him checking his thumbchron only a few minutes more five at most whatevers happening wont change that much in five minutes elmas ofka an angry hiss like a spitting kitten sound of footsteps as she prowled about the bridge parnalee laughed aloud and stroked his hand across the dark sisters metal skin content for the moment to hear the empress bested like that having to spend her impatience in the movements of her body he played with the pad and brought in another conversation a hordar probably one of jamber fausses men parnalee didnt know their names and didnt care to know look at her man i wouldna wanna put my butt in reach of those claws second hordar hunh first hordar wonder how kmiks doing part of his squads a sea farm isya wouldna trust them bitches far as i could throw one second hordar oh i dunno shes one parnalee pictured him making an obscene gesture toward elmas ofka but he didnt delude himself that was actually happening these mamaboys had a ridiculous respect for the whipmistress first hordar dont hardly seem so she dont act so snotty as others i could name second hordar tried to grope that little cinnal eh first hordar got nothing to do with it they just snotty thats all aslan sat at an abandoned station one foot tucked under her she scribbled on a battered pad with most of its leaves torn off looking around at intervals to see if anything interesting was happening the ridaar was propped inconspicuously beside a screen flaking the events of the bridge but in situations when more than an unadorned report was required when her emotions and sensory reactions her intuitions and expectations were part of the story it was her habit to write down whatever came into her mind disjointed words phrases the only requirement a precise identification of time and place the rau was picking delicately at a sensorboard calling up items and lists absorbing what was there his relatively immobile face unreadable elmas ofka was still pacing throwing angry looks at pels and at the door quale sat at another station looking sleepy and disengaged karrel goza and lirrit ofka were standing apart from the other hordar not touching but intensely aware of each other their conversation single words or phrases interrupted by long periods of silence jamber fausse joined his band they were gathered by the prisoners talking in low mutters and looking suspiciously at the others on the bridge this clutch of mismates she thought they looked like a separating sauce somebodys going to have to give them a few brisk stirs to save the mix adelaar came striding in crossed to quale still mopping up so it seems we havent heard anything from the other squads he gave the hanifa a lazy grin as she joined them you think you could run a scan on the ship without triggering wrong ideas in downside techs give me a minute she swung round and loped over to pels they consulted in polysyllabic mutters for several minutes then he jumped down let her have the command station moved to the nearest aux com station and brought it online aslan moved closer her eyes shifting from adelaars busy hands to the small screen at the station it was the first time since she was a small child that shed seen her mother doing real work never when she was home for a visit and not back at base she wasnt welcome at the listening station adelaar did very little while she was there either turning over her work to parnalee or kumari and walking outside with her or chasing her with impatient cutting words which came so close to quarreling that she left rather than provoke her mother further her mothers facility reminded her rather oddly of xalloors dancing she watched adelaar and remembered unntoualar females weaving vandavremmi stormdancers weaving bubble sculptures fifty kilometers across even sarmaylen walking round and round a rock reading images into it enigmatic fascinating rather demonic a capacity for unraveling secrets and extending control over other people far beyond what she herself considered acceptable images on the small screen pale green lines a race through successive cross sections a jolting stop and the great mainscreen flared into activity a huge cavernous space about massive shipdrives control stations dark and dusty except for the central area a complex mix of sounds the explosions of the pellet guns the pingwhine of ricochets shouts groans clatter of feet on catwalks unidentifiable knocks cracks thuds four bodies motionless on the catwalks some distance apart no two on the same level a fighter lay bleeding slowly from one arm the other three were lowlevel techs in the drive gang a small dark form darted out of shadow shot at something threw himself into a twisting roll that took him back into shadow adelaars shoulders twitched quale right hailer hmm ready you talk theyll hear right he set a hand on the back of her chair the bridge is taken he said if you surrender youll be set down on tassalga alive and in good shape if you continue your resistance youll be dead keeping on is futile in a few days we will be sending this warship into the sun kanlan gercik collect your squad get them out of there we can seal any holdouts in the drive sector and let them fry his voice was weary uninterested in what the holdouts decided a lazy baritone smooth as cream and far more convincing than a raucous scream aslan scribbled rapidly scattershot words that said in effect idontcarewhatyoudo can be more terrifying than hate and rage the image went silent still a moment later kanlan gerciks voice sounded from somewhere near the control bank zhurev meskel suffor harli tanggаr move your units toward the entrance meskel can you get to your wounded friend in his soft slurring west coast accent meskel suffor answered if the others give me cover better so if the gang shows a touch of smarts and surrenders start moving quale yabass is there any way of getting the name of the engineer quale shifted his gaze to adelaar raised his brows adelaar nodded worked her pads and pulled up three names on the small screen theyre all huvveds erek afa kaffadar boksor tra shiffre marak sha yarmid any idea which no indication kanlan gercik did you hear that if you could repeat them after quale finished the list kanlan called out erek bokso marak whichever you are talk to me more silence broken mainly by scuffs and some tings where something metallic touched a rail or a piece of equipment the members of the squad edging toward the entrance what guarantee do we have the voice was gruff impatient with the arrogant edge of a toprank huvved the guarantee youll fry we have the drives so you can sit and watch them hum as you head for the sun a snort you got some kind of idea you can run them without the shipbrain silence muttering a scuffle then a different voice hang on a minute more muttering a dull thump pellet gun tossed onto the rubbery floor covering more thumps more guns thats it hold everything were coming out we got to carry tra shiffre i hear quale yabass you can start forward with them but dont hurry weve got to see whats happening with the other squads anything comes up give us a yell adelaar will keep an ear tuned to you questions that seems to do it hanifa quale looked down at the diver anything you want to say her eyes were fixed on the screen she was frowning when he spoke she shook her head impatiently get on with it gotcha adelaar play sector next then the sleep sector the green lines of the schematic flashed again onto the main screen and flickered through cross sections as before then the lines were gone and a pleasure field filled the screen roughly oval and somewhat larger than the chamber outside the bridge door a cheerful brightcolored space broken into smaller and larger areas irregular shapes partly open to the main arena a combination of bistro gymnasium orgydrum sensorama and lessdedicated spaces that catered to assorted individual quirks and kinks the mat in the gymspace was littered with flaccid dreaming bodies and the two squads assigned to that area were busily trotting in and out of the pleasure field carting in more of them men and women crew and support some naked some dressed in fantastic costume some in uniform some in grubby overalls the men and women doing the carting looked sweaty but exuberantly carefree the grimness shed marked in them when they marched on board the tug was still there but only as a ghostly background to the present pleasure despite their visible weariness they were shouting ribald jokes at each other trading insults and speculations about the activities of the bodies they carried as far as aslan could tell no one had been killed no one injured badly enough for the wound to show no bandages no bruise no scrapes quale turned to adelaar sound ready tazmin duvvar you round somewhere akkin siddaki laughter whoops hillandgrass raiderband salutes to elmas ofka that quickly degenerated into obscurely idiomatic barbs aimed at quale and the bridge party aslan scribbled rapidly getting the essence of the more interesting insults the hillandgrassers were famous for the inventiveness of their invective two of elmas ofkas isyas shouted more intimate greetings drunk on victory as much as wine ordinary proprieties stripped away they floated on a cloud of euphoria one of the older raiders moved apart from the rest set his hands on his hips and roared the others to silence varak go get tazmin what you want quale yabass we were getting bored sitting around up here started wondering what was happening in the other sectors looks like youve pretty well cleaned up your area any problems akkin siddaki waited until tazmin duvvar pushed through the gathering hordar and reached his side quale he said wants to know if weve got problems cartage mainly tazmin said these kokotils were drunk drugged or screwing their brains if any out it was like shooting fish in a barrel if you could dig up some transport for us itd save a lot of sweat akkin nodded weve got most of the ship people transferred here theres some whores and some of the kitchen crew still laying where they fell maybe a dozen not much more than that like you see theres quite a pile of them theres a transtube outlet just off this chamber we could stuff them in that if youll have the yabass adelaar program the tube and arrange a welcoming party youve got the holding space ready yet it should be by the time youre finished adelaar just got here shell take care of that once we finish this survey pels see what you can find for transport right soon as i can get access adelaar when we finish this ill free some lines for you quale yabass akkin siddaki leaned forward his dark face intent about ten minutes if i had to make a guess thats not it ive got a brother in the sleeper squad hows he doing we havent checked that one yet its next on our list there was some trouble in the drive area one wounded a raider from the west coast i think i dont know how serious want me to get the name when you get a minute right if anything comes up give a yell adelaar sleepers a few minutes later a short stretch of dimly lit corridor took up most of the screen empty silent a short distance from the eyepoint a small oval crystal touched with honeyamber the lifeless neuter colors of the walls and floor the doorway below the crystal gaped open the light inside the room was a ghostly grayish yellow that merged seamlessly with the light in the corridor the eyepoint moved dipped into the sleeping cell four bodies on the floor the eyepoint dropped to hover over the nearest it swept from head to toe raced back to the nape of the hordars neck and focused on a hexagonal black spot halfobscured by a strand of hair elmas ofka bit a cry in half after a minute she said dart her hands closed over the back of pels chair tightening until it creaked under the pressure of her fingers all of them the eyepoint continued to move it searched the other three centimeter by centimeter it found more darts it swept out sped to the next occupied cell and dived inside elmas ofka saw jirsys startled frozen face and stopped breathing for a long frozen moment then she shrieked with rage and grief grabbed at her hair tore loose hanks of it lirrit ofka screamed clawed at her face her nails scoring bloody lines in her flesh then karrel goza and jamber fausse were there holding them confining their struggles muffling their cries letting them bite and kick and scratch accepting the pain as part of sharing the grief a grief that grew more bitter as the eyepoint moved on and they saw the other dead as karrel goza saw his cousin geres sprawled in the ybranch aslan watched and automatically noted her impressions on the pad she felt uncomfortable about writing while this was happening shed known little jirsy indiz and liked her nonetheless she wrote the isya phenomenon was endlessly interesting she hadnt understood before this how powerfully those bonds operated once the isya was formed the strength of it was suddenly made visible for her the pain of the severance was apparent in the violence of the womens reactions her stylus flew across the battered page more than kin she wrote closer than lovers karrel goza seeing his cousins body wept face red anger and grief none of this selfmutilation this loss of control the difference explainable by isya bonding or by culturally determined sex role differentiation sex roles complex here women powerfulpowerless huvvedhordar very different their ideas about women suggest someone come study isya phenom trakkar je neves her subject yes contact see if interest outsiders reaction isya hysteria revealing consider history of personality differential profession its effect on quale leaned against the console his face shuttered he was looking away from the women shut off from them by something in his past or in his character that washed out the flashes of strength he could show and left him looking oddly empty as if he were so tired of living that hed lost the ability to feel either joy or pain adelaar looked over her shoulder distaste her most visible reaction she went back to what she was doing jaunniko called you one icy femme mama maybe he was right no thats wrong weve clawed at each other often enough i cant accuse you of lacking passion mama youre just not interested in other peoples passion the raus ears twitched closed in on themselves like fingers making a fist he kept working elmas ofka went suddenly quiet she sucked in a breath in and in and in the soft sound seemed to last forever to mute the other sounds on the bridge then she let the breath out again out and out a long rasping sigh she pushed against jamber fausses arms he dropped them and stepped back lirrit her voice was sharp demanding lirrit broke a sob in half stood in shuddering silence for another few breaths then she pushed at karrel gozas chest and turned in a grim controlled silence to watch what was happening on the screen who elmas ofka said her voice soft as thistledown and cold quale straightened seemed to shake himself sloughing the detachment that had grayed him down parnalee he said she swung around her temper flaring but before she could say anything churri spoke parnalee he said he played you like a gamefish hanifa thats his business hes good at it i dont understand churri shrugged who does crazy is crazy elmas ofka closed her eyes brushed a hand across her face i see find him now quale raised a brow why bother leave him in his hole and let him fry elmas ofka trembled controlled herself immediately find him she said we can argue what happens afterward adelaar didnt wait to be asked she huddled over her sensor pads called up strings of words and numbers scanned them repeated the process several times selected some reentered them aslan watched the image flow expand contract change in little and in toto the glyphs and figures like minute green demons dancing to the beat of her mothers fingertips the schematic filled the screen again centered on the bridge the navel it flashed away in pieslice wedges a game of jackstraws with mamas fingers picking surely through them shivering among the green lines were fuzzy red lights and several pale ambers arranged in clusters each time a light appeared she exploded a small white dot in the center of it and went on without further reaction one by one she swept through the wedges until shed done them all aslan frowned there seemed to be more wedges than the geometry of the ship allowed for mamas magic play the numbers ah she bit back a giggle and scribbled on her pad adelaar swung around ive located all lifesources that the ship can detect that means exactly what it says there may be dead areas this is an antique and badly maintained and there are places in her deliberately kept off the record if he knows about those places well he knows a lot too much youre wrong quale we dont dare let him wait us out leaving them to chew that over she kicked around touched a sensor and leaned back to watch the screen as the brain flipped from spot to spot froze momentarily on a scene long enough to take in the details then moved on to the next akkin siddaki and tazmin duvvar supervising the tag end of the bodygathering flipflip body squads walking tiredly to the last few bodies a whore here a scutsweep there after a short stretch of looking on while the brain flashed through scenes that shed seen before adelaar moved restlessly then pushed her chair around and leaned toward pels for several minutes she talked in an undertone to him the rau listened nodded then got busy on the sensor pads at his substation his eyes fixed on the notation screen over their heads the images flickered from the stunned shipfolk in the sleeping cells to the scattered bodies of the dead adelaar sat back satisfied the eyepoint jumped to the hordar and their prisoners marching up from the drive sector kanlan gercik and his cousin zhurev iavru were the first to appear scouting ahead for ambushes the wounded westcoaster came next he was stretched on an improvised litter being carried by meskel suffor and another westcoaster then three hordar from gerciks raiders then the captive drive gang with more litters two wounded one dead one stunned and heavily unconscious huvved harli tanggаr had her sister isya melly birah with her and two women from another isya on the far side of the captives all of them keeping a fierce eye on their prisoners behind them came the rest of the squad the rearguard the eyepoint left them whipped to the drive room hovered momentarily over the cooling corpses leaped again and focused on an ancient eremite living in a rats nest of scraps and paper and scavenged bits of equipment filthy white hair knotted on top his head a few threads of beard vermin crawling in and out of his hair in and out of his layered filthy clothing quale rubbed his hand along his jaw makes you itch he said what elmas ofka came quietly to stand beside him she stared up at the image what are we looking at another shift another mouse in the walls this one painfully neat and weirder than the rat he was walking through elaborate square corners running a folded whiterthanwhite cloth over every surface in his sparsely furnished lair an irregular space created by the intersection of stressbeams and baffles choosing the areas he dealt with according to a pattern in his miswired head discard quale said took the measure of life up here and took himself out of it why are we looking at this lirrit ofka came over leaned against elmas ofka arm curled loosely about her waist yuk the eyepoint was hovering over a nest of scavenger moles big as hunting cats the young nosing blindly at the side of one while another heavily gravid female was regurgitating scraps of anonymous meat for half a dozen yearlings why are we looking at these things adelaar turned her head the brain searched out lifeforms hanifa we have to see them all before we know if one could be parnalee the eyepoint continued to jump more moles bats mobile fungi other lessidentifiable life forms things mutated into halfglimpsed horrors this is wasting time no adelaar said were finding out where not to look for him the large screen went blank flipped back to the schematic of the bridge i was afraid of that hes in a blind spot somewhere she kicked the chair around taped nervously at the arm probably listening to us listening were it me in his place i would be at the least listening so where is he i told you a blind spot get the others up here well do it our way gridsearch this thing till we find him fine if youve got a year or two what how long would it take to search gul inci room by room elmas ofka frowned at the screen one arm folded across her breasts her fingers moving slowly up and down the biceps of her other arm then how let me think about that awhile and see if i can do something about snoops ah adelaar crossed her legs tapped her fingers on the arms of her chair the holding area for the prisoners is ready and pels has set the tube to it its near one of the lifepod banks so your people wont have far to move them once youre ready to pop the pods parnalee smiled lifted his glass in a salute clear them out you oozy whore clear them all out its womans proper work cleaning house clear out yourself and leave me to fry he laughed its not going to happen bitch he stroked his free hand along the smooth black flank of the interface your time is coming love wait a little longer until theyve licked up the vermin and i can move without running into strays he sipped at the brandy his eyes on the lethal gray egg sitting on its mobile bed a little longer love the bridge cleared quickly aslan watched the raiders swagger out chivvying the bridge crew before them the weight of a helpless rage and inturning violence had been lifted from now that they had the warmaster and she could no longer threaten their families and the land itself should they happen across parnalee theyd tear him limb from limb but itd be marginally a more abstract action with overtones of justice not simply the blood boiling up there were small cruelties as they hustled their captives out an elbow in the ribs pinches on arms and buttocks mostly though they cut at the crew with a cheerful contempt a facility of tongue developed to work off anger at wrongs that the law or force of arms couldnt no wouldnt right the retaliation for the indifference of the huvved fehz to the suffering of the hordar poor in the cities and on the grasslands to the pain of hordar families forced off the land theyd worked for centuries before the huvved came and claimed it she cross hatched an area of the pad no words left not right then the ridaar was flaking this that was enough trouble ahead for everyone these hillandgrassers they were what the huvved had made them when the war was over when elmas ofka and those like her were trying to put the world together again these raiders bandits more than anything else they were bound to be provoking out of control sources of instability inviting a reimposition of the injustices that had created them they had to change she sighed it wouldnt happen she looked at the crosshatching a rambling nothing started writing again stopping thinking no longer noting impressions being her fathers daughter for a change poets daughter trying a poem of her own la le la la le la yesterday be gone away la le la la le la games we play words we say la le la la le la dead and done dry bones in a drying pond ripples pass beyond and gone la le la la le la echoes to relay replay yesterday la le la la le la dessicated dull and dry are you am i are we today nil and null reclaiming sway on and over yesterday la le la la le la goodby lover never hover cant recover yesterday she sighed dissatisfied and pushed the pad away jamber fausse stood beside quale watching adelaar and pels hunched over their consoles theres this woman i know he said had a kid a boy time he was three he was taking things apart see how they worked drove him near crazy when he couldna figure what did what n why no one to school him they were borderfolk lived tween chel and grass family got broke up the da he was horned and headpriced she took the boy down to inci hes dead built him a yizzy fore he was nine bitbits got him shot away the pods poured his firejuice on him and lit a match this parnalee of yours you say he wants to kill huvveds quale smoothed his hand along his beard yeh but you wouldna like his methods eh why you think he wants this ship since you be reading the mans mind you tell me work the sums yourself hes after the hide of every huvved on tairanna and he doesnt give a handful of hot shit for hordar not being hordar or having any ties groundside you doubt that go look at your dead down in sleepers and hes cracked to the marrow talk to aslan you want the book on that have her read her bonebreaks and bruises for you for that matter ask the hanifa what she thinks way shes acting now she got the point a time ago point being dont trust outsiders long as you use your head not your gut jamber fausse took a long look at him then strolled across to adelaar yabass he said she started looked round a minute let me finish this he waited hands clasped behind him watching lines of symbol and number flicker in and out so fast no one who didnt already know what they were could take them in the schematic of the bridge returned suddenly the green lines overlaid with red adelaar contemplated them a moment then looked over her shoulder what is it whats this parnalee know you dont know quale frowned at the screen youve shut him out right he cant hear us now jamber fausse looked at the screen then from one outsider to the other whats he know you dont she pushed the chair around so she didnt have to keep stretching her neck obviously he thinks he can take her away from me can he how the hell do i know all i can do is scramble this brain so radically he couldnt possibly straighten it out before she drops in horgul youre sure im sure jamber fausse looked down at his hands he held them palms up thumbs out fingers cupped in fingers he looked at them as if he read parnalees mind in the lines and folds he may be crazy but hes no fool has to be something else after a moments strained silence quale said monarch class warmaster the youngest it could be is ten thousand more likely around fifteen my slancy was built around then rummul empire trooper the rummul were the ones that built most of the warmasters so she could know something about them we never bothered purging memory matter of fact some of the bits in there have been useful for this and that so when she needed more capacity we just added it on del you think you could punch a line to her without him knowing hell know somethings happening not what he knows that now with you cutting him off like this your point give me room this is going to get delicate at times ill let you know when im ready to link kinok skritched two of ves tentacles together sounding ves irritation at being drawn away from an erotic rite ve was performing with vesself and ves new kahat and a drivehead after some more strident grumbling which the infant kahat didnt bother translating ve allowed vesself to be talked into a degree of reasonableness call up oldest memory for me quale said reference monarch class warmaster you are not getting involved with that fancy are you quale blinked the words were dismissive but kinok somehow managed to infuse the light tenor of the translator with a degree of wistful longing more appropriate to the romantic hero of some operatic fantasy he opened his mouth intending to explain what he planned to do with the warmaster changed his mind before more than a croak got out hed run into difficulties before with kinok over things that seemed eminently reasonable to him but which slammed into one or more of the paems peculiar religious and moral tenets killing the warmaster meant killing her drives and he was willing to bet that kinok would object strenuously to being connected in any way with the death of a set of drives he thought about the voice tone especially if the paem was getting his roots in a twist about this particular set erotic passion did weird things to the panter he winced as a few of his own more idiotic obsessions went floating across his mind not involved he said just pull together everything you can find and squirt it over to us well keep the line open it is in progress the translator said how much longer is slancy staying at this place getting bored kinok vewhospeaks is never bored only a stupid mind a mind gross and unspiritual grows bored vewhospeaks merely wishes the answer to an ordinary question ah not so ordinary with luck two three days maybe four that is heard with pleasure vewhospeaks will prepare the blessings and ready our slancy for the run get her ready for trouble too kinok my friend we might have a hot welcome when we shift out of the insplit vewhospeaks has had our slancy listening her ears have tingled not once vewhospeaks believes those on that world still do not know that they have visitors that could change fast there is something you are not telling vewhospeaks swar tell it things are happening onworld kinok well be finishing up our collecting with the imperators palace thats bound to be noisy there was a cool silence from the speaker on the screen kinoks plummy scattered eyes had a skeptical glitter that quale had no difficulty reading there were going to be some difficult days ahead damn all idiot religions they never caused anything but trouble for everyone around them believers or not he heard the ting that announced the arrival of slancys data and suppressed a sigh of relief talk to you later kinok weve got some clearing up here redundancy aslan translated sliding into the summary at the end of the dataflow her voice husky dry as her throat elmas ofka sat in the kingchair her eyes fixed on the great screen on words she couldnt read numbers she couldnt decipher faced with parnalees defection and the unhappy realization that hed used her fears and prejudices to undercut her and threaten everything she was fighting for shed swung back to a toothend trust in aslan it is rumored aslan continued that even the mainbrain is duplicated if it is damaged seriously enough a sisterbrain takes charge oh i see forget that hanifa just me realizing what parnalee is up to um yes these rumors call her the dark sister because she is supposed to be programmed to attack without cease until the ship prevails or is destroyed analysts studying the warmaster have reported that they are unable to discover any clues to the location or even the existence of the dark sister some believe that the tales about her are put out to heighten the terror factor and its demoralizing effect on the enemy these discount the rumors and believe that the dark sister exists only in the minds of rummul information officers there is nothing in memory to substantiate either conclusion she drew a dry tongue across dry lips thats it she said that seems to be everything that quales ship knows about warmasters she watched her mother shut down the flow pleased to be finished with the awkward job of translating technical details into a language that didnt have reasonable equivalents not all that happy with what shed read she wasnt convinced by the disclaimers at the end like jamber fausse said parnalee might be crazy but he wasnt stupid there were some hazy dark rumors floating like smoke through university subfiles unsubstantiated speculation about the intent and purpose of that institute of his hmm she thought maybe i can talk chancellor dizzawbawka into hiring mama to worm in there and find out what omphalos is hiding hes got a kink about secret societies this is a note you dont write down woman but you dont forget it either she smoothed her hand across her mouth and watched elmas ofka interested in the dalliss reaction to what shed heard elinas ofka pinched thoughtfully at her lip there is a second brain she said there has to be can you find it adelaar yabass i can try quale chuckled he was sitting at a down station feet resting on a pile of empty medpacs arms folded across his chest you need stroking del hah you know how good you are i also know the work of several of those analysts in that report they might be a long time dead but if they couldnt find anything it either wasnt there or im likely to find the far side of beyond before i trip over the clone and didnt i not so long ago hear you say that this brain is big powerful and dumb dumb that was the word you used wasnt it and didnt i hear you say weve learned considerable since this ship was built quale dont play shitgames with me itd take a memory the size of the one on university to record what you dont know about penetration what about a real game a wager double your fee against no fee on whether the clone is actually there and i find it im a cautious man aici arash i wont bet against a certainty then youd better get ready to blow the dark sister the moment i find her i have a feeling were not going to have much time to maneuver adelaar circled round and round that problem then went at it obliquely running the numbers of the corporeal essence of the ship its dimensions and locations ignoring for the moment the visual map only the numbers mattered matching and crossmatching tagging subtle disparities replaying the visuals with the disparities corrected tagging discontinuities that appeared when that was done aslan could see that her mother had only the tiniest of threads to pull on but that seemed to be all she needed when an hour had crept past it was obvious she was going to unpick the knot the farther she got the easier it seemed for her it was almost as if she were beginning to read the minds of the programmers whod done the original work funny mama didnt get along at all well with sarmaylen or his friends my friends aslan thought maybe thats why shes as much an artist as they are i thought so before i know it now thats not just skill thats a leap of of i dont know whatever artists leap at she sighed my fathers a poet my mothers a well whatever what the hell happened to me ah well as xalloor says deary dai we do what we can missing xalloor she strolled to the panels drew water from a spigot its a good thing churri took off with quale she thought he made mama nervous she sipped at the water it was lukewarm and tasteless but her mouth was still dry from the reading stint first time i saw mama fluttery like that oohyeha and forty hells four months in the insplit going home that is not going to be fun for anyone not if she starts after xalloor she can be a bitch on wheels when shes jealous aslan wrinkled her nose as her mind flipped back to the time when she was fifteen and the boy she was sneaking out to see and what happened when mama caught them deary dai indeed she gulped the rest of the water and moved over to watch pels work his eyes flicked in an unceasing round from screen to screen to screen the lifepod sector drawn in green lines was on one with an inset showing the hordar packing the crew into the pods another had a map of the palace the city the landing field on the third there was a map of the system with pinpoints of yellow light converging on the whitepoint that was them or so she assumed she touched his shoulder are those something we should be worrying about his ears twitched grand sech has been trying to talk to someone up here the past hour those are the stingers heading at us what are you going to do nothing huh itll be at least an hour before theyre close enough to be a bother until then theres no point besides we wont be able to get outside the skin before adelaars finished over there she going to be much longer i dont know i dont operate in those realms me either i used to think i was good but shes a witch shes never let me watch her work before i dont know why huh he dug his claws into his neck fur scowled at the pod area almost ready to pop em igsala poong that proggerdi we cant sit around sucking our toes or hell stick a torp up our collective arse aslan glanced at her mother grinned right on cue she murmured adelaar flung her arms up wriggled in the chair yawned got it she said wheres quale doing what you told him getting ready to blow the clone pels said the grand sech is birthing fidgets because he cant get through up here he sent stingers to see whats going on they cant burn a way in but unless i remember wrong more than one of them will have overrides on the lockseals transfer the trace here she watched the pinlights creep for a moment sniffed then began playing with the pad ill let them think they are in control till theyre close enough she broke off concentrated for a moment to tairanna then all their little popbuggies will peel off and put them down where theyll have a lot of privacy and time to contemplate their sins she sat back yawned again laced her fingers across her stomach and examined her thumbnails i think we ought to let him hear us she tilted her head back smiled at aslan dont you think we owe him a little sweat no aslan sighed it gives him too much time to knife us its safer with him dead adelaar laughed at her thats my little pacifist all right make it the clone dead first ruin my mood mmh adelaar straightened fetch my kit over will you lan i left it by the door there i might as well use this time to work on the suninterceptand a few other notions ive had umpels have the locals finished loading the crew just about why tell them im going to start launching the pods the stingers wont bother them then you get hold of the hanifa and have her order her people back on the tug when we leave we dont want any snags or strays she looked over her shoulder at aslan eyes bluer than blue and guileless keep the customers happy she murmured dead locals dont trade rosepearls for security systems aslan wrinkled her nose but said nothing she wasnt about to be drawn into that ancient argument she brought the pack to her mother then went to stand beside the door looking out into that absurdly oversized antechamber briefly she wondered where parnalee was and if he suspected he was being outthought and outengineered at least she hoped he was the bridge was empty except for pels and adelaar and her of course elmas and her isyas were carrying their dead to the tug hold and getting them stowed for the trip home xalloor was in the tug too running the wounded through the autodoc if shed managed to convince the hanifa it wasnt a subtle attempt at assassination aslan pressed her lips over a giggle theres a product for you mama say the doc performs in its usual fashion quale was a long time gone what was happening down there in the armory if he couldnt get in hed have been back before this he should have taken pels with him churri was there but what use was he mama used to tell me when i did something dumb with my pc that i was just like my father clumsy as a tantser calf jamber fausse and his lot are there theyre no use except as strong backs if something needs shifting and for standing guard i hope they are standing guard he should have taken pels why isnt he back yet maybe theyre all dead we cant look round the ship without breaking mamas blocks aslan sighed there was no point standing at the doorway like some stupid chatelaine waiting for her lord to get back from the wars she grimaced at the image ooohyeha lan youre worse than a teener reading sublimated sex books face it woman hes done everything but come right out and tell you hes not interested i wonder why hes hetero and im not a hag tk she ran fingers through her hair pushed it off her face this isnt getting me anywhere she walked with quick nervous steps to the station where pels was working adelaar had turned the launching of the pods over to him while she busied herself doing enigmatic things to the brain the dataflow was so quick and so esoteric it gave aslan a headache much more satisfying to watch the pods blow at least she knew what was happening the ships crew including all its huvveds were on their way to tassalga for a bit of involuntary exile permanent exile if the huvveds had any sense the way feeling was running among the hordar they could end on the chopping block if they got back to tairanna the inset showed that most of the locals had cleared out of the loading area the few left were clearing up odds and ends and loading these on one of the pallets she recognized akkin siddaki and his protйgй the boy thief from gul brindar kanlan gercik and two of her students from the mines the rest must be settling down in the tug its almost over all we have to do is blow the clone then we leave then we go home then i stir up a mess of trouble for those foul and loathsome oligarchs she savored her triumph they sold me into slavery theyre as guilty as bolodo what a lovely thought i suppose theyll claim they had a legitimate contract with bolodo let them try it university can field a team of ethicists and lawyers thatll wipe their faces in their own muck till they choked on the stink and the chancellors will authorize and organize the team without their usual fuss and obfuscation not for me for the unntoualar they mean it dump on him who says anything not my species is my prey dump it deep and stinking theyll go after those oligarchs with everything they can throw at them it surely will not hurt my tenure standing that they can throw me at them too hmmp like quale says im lagniappe i wish hed get back when the sound from the bridge cut off parnalee stirred drowsily the brandy was smooth and rather sweet hed swallowed more of it than was good for him his mind was swimming he had to concentrate to think busy bitch he muttered you and your treacherous daughter youre a set he slapped at his face felt his stomach spasm fool he got to his feet forced back a surge of nausea and by an effort of will whipped mind and body into a semblance of order the sisterbrain was hobbled until he got rid of the mainbrain the point is he told himself whos left out in the corridors how far have they got in the clearance he lowered himself into the chair and swiveled to face the console she shut me out of the bridge i doubt she could his conversation with himself died away as he concentrated on what he was doing the soundsearch swept through the ship collecting a series of squeaks and rattles mechanical hums the sough of air dead sounds empty echoes in the armory voices clinks the scuff of feet the complex of sounds remotes made when they were forced to the limits of their capacity parnalee smiled dealing in armaments now hmm quale when i get back outside and spread word around of your scavenging efforts youre going to have a problem or two satisfied that he knew what the man was doing and why he went on with the search nothing nothing pod bays the readings showed them empty busy busy he murmured good little housekeeper got your cleaning finished have you he did a more intensive sweep but there was no evidence of any life forms in the area lifter locks yes the tug was in three not much sound in there the ghosts of voices he fiddled with the controls focused on the tugs lock which seemed to be open fulminating as he did so against the lack of visuals he depended very much on his eyes and had trouble imaging from sounds he began recording the voices he couldnt make out the words they were too broken but the equipment here was good enough to reconstitute them when he was readyif he decided he needed to know what was being said which wasnt likely he had other more important things to do the corridors were clean it was time to move he thumbed out three stimtabs tossed them down his throat and followed them with a gulp of stale lukewarm water from the spigot hed have preferred a final swallow of brandy but he had enough alcohol in him praise omphalos it should be mostly absorbed by now adding more wouldnt merely be stupid it could even be fatal he checked the torp to make sure it was strapped firmly down then went meticulously through one last test of its triggering circuits the torp was old not so old as the ship but old enough to have acquired a degree of fragility inappropriate to a bomb though it was sufficiently intact to perform its function without going off prematurely as long as he treated it gently as an egg about to hatch while he was moving it he toed on the lift field of the dolly and guided it toward the interface exit since he couldnt go near the tube without alerting that woman he had to travel the serviceways it was going to be a long slow trip but there wasnt anyone to threaten him now and he didnt have to go near the bridge the mainbrain lived inside a sphere of collapsed matter close to the heart of the ship theoretically only the captain had access to its coordinates even the techs who serviced it had no idea where they were they tubed there and back the tubeflow coordinates set by the bright sister when she was commanded to do so by the captain parnalee smiled with drowsy contentment as he climbed on the dolly and settled himself at the controls as soon as hed waked the part of her he could reach through the tap shed gone hunting for her sister found her too and he knew what she knew once he convinced her to trust him though most of her slept still she was awake enough to print a map for him awake enough to run a jolt through him so he could share her exaltation as she celebrated the power that would soon be hers and his he stopped the dolly got down so he could crank open the first of the twelve hatches ahead of him coughed as his feet stirred fine gray dust that had lain undisturbed for millennia he sprayed oil hed found in the interface stores over the mix of sheddings exuda and other muck agebonded to the gears slammed his fist cautiously against the handle hit it again without budging it he poured clear liquid handcleaner over the slowly softening glue to thin it out yet more then leaned on the handle the crank groaned and resisted sweat popping out on his forehead he put more pressure on it halfafraid he was going to break the thing it shrieked and moved a hair he sprayed more oil doused on more cleaner worked the crank back and forth until the seal gave way and it began to turn slowly at first then more smoothly the hatch squealed open slid into the wall one down eleven to go he wiped his hands on his tunic sides rubbing vigorously to get rid of both oil and cleaner especially the cleaner which had a strong oversweet smell and a soapy slimy feel the stims were doing the job his head was clearing he felt as charged as the dark sister he thought of adelaars face when the pads died under her fingers he smiled i watched the last load leave with churri riding herd on it i wasnt planning to sell any of this bit of salvage i dont approve of arms dealing and anyway its a lot too dangerous for the payoff but given some of the places i take slancy into its comforting to have that kind of firepower available and its not the sort of thing you can buy whenever you take a notion and there was bolodo if bolodo execs had any scruples about anything i hadnt come across them yet and i hadnt a sliver of a doubt there was a destroyer or two stashed somewhere handy where the execs on helvetia could set them up to take us when we showed id done what i could to pull some cover around us but cover has a way of springing leaks when you need it most jamber fausse was squatting by the door with a couple of his men he got to his feet and came sauntering over to me time time one of you has to go to the bridge to let adelaar yabass know were ready shes still sealed off i cant reach her tube right the way we got here vehim feda go the younger of the two men got to his feet and went trotting out what will you do if adelaar yabass has not discovered the dark sister sit here and wait nothing else i can do i went over to the implosion torp on its dolly there was a lot of crud still on it but the batteries were charging steadily no sign of trouble there no breakdowns in the timerprogram if the probe wasnt looping on me i toured the testmeters and their readings were all good no glitches i climbed onto the dollys front bench put my feet up on the console ah jamber fausse dropped to a squat beside the door something i know about sitting and waiting i didnt expect to do much waiting adelaar didnt waste time or energy when she was working and vehim wouldnt be more than a few seconds tubing up to her i arranged myself so i could see the screen it was over the door i counted seconds and got to fifty before it lit up and adelaar was looking at us quale she said i see youre ready she didnt seem to expect a response so i didnt give her one the auxbrain is scattered through more than a dozen nodes theres no way youll be able to get them all shit what relax you dont need to do a thorough job on the interface and youve neutered our dark sister theres a weakness in the design the nodes are connected through that interface they dont operate independently unless most of the ship is dead not enough power theyll probably kick on when she hits the sun but thats a bit late to do any good implosion torp yeh i thought i recognized the configuration under all those meters she laughed a nice sound she was feeling pleased with herself its viable yeh thatll do it wed better be outside the skin when it blows yeh i wasnt going to argue with that the warmaster was big and tough enough to absorb a lot more punishment than one little torp but she was older than time and there was rot in her hide tubeflow ive reset the tubeflow from your gate itll take you straight in to the clone interface ive given you two minutes to get to the interface starting when we finish this five to get set up plus three for holdups the three will kick on only if you havent gone through the gate there before then the flow switches outbound automatically endpoint the lander lock area where well be sitting waiting for you bridge ive programmed the mainbrain to clamshell after were out any sign of the proggerdi i havent bothered looking i gave a yell for the teddybear his ears were up fluttering his lips curled back to show his tearing teeth he didnt need telling to watch out for ambushes but i told him anyway that fruitcake could be anywhere i said get hold of the tug before you start and have a bodyguard waiting at the tubegate adelaar no arguments i dont get paid if i dont get you back to helvetia and i intend to collect you hear she laughed again almost hysteria coming from her i hear she said time is quale get yourself in gear or miss the boat the screen went dark right i said hop on jamo you and your friend its time to roll the curved wall of the massive sphere was a grayblack chimera behind the container shield there and not there ominous though not quite tangible the mass of a small star prisoned in gossamer parnalee brought the dolly to a gentle stop before it lifted the link from the seat beside him open he murmured then waited for the dark sister to coax an opening for him the surface shimmered a black pinhole appeared dilated swiftly until it was wide enough to admit the dolly then pulsed like a wet black mouth a mouth that could close on him if it chose he eyed it with distaste but the bulk of the bright sister was in there and there was no other access he edged the dolly toward the opening took it through thinking he was a repair tech the bright sister brought up the lights so he could see what he was doing he eased the dolly and its burden as deep into her heart as the narrowing serviceways between the brains components would let him go then he cycled down the power of the liftfield let the dolly sink to the floor gently gently dont crack the egg not yet not yet off yes he slid the link into his belt pouch climbed over the bench back and squatted on the bed beside the torp he activated it set its timer for an hour on he needed an interval to get back to the interface where hed be in touch with and protected from the fury of the dark sister before he touched the triggering sensor and started the timer humming he set his hand on the casing of the torp and savored the triumph that was going to be his one hour he patted the bomb gently very gently yes he set his forefinger on the sensor and felt the hum in his bones yes he slid off the dolly and trotted for the mouth as soon as he was outside he touched on the link close he said the hole in the sphere grew smaller smaller swiftly smaller was a pin prick of darkness again was gone he put the link away and began the long run to the interface buoyed by the knowledge that nothing could go wrong now nothing could stop the explosion that killed the bright sister all he had to do was sit and wait i looked round the interface yeh i said this is it he was here jamber fausse nodded store cabinets were open some of their contents spilled onto the floor evidence of a hasty search there was a bottle of brandy on the console with about an inch of liquid left in it a bubble glass beside it with a brown smear drying in the bell the stink of the brandy was thick in there along with a stale smell that clung despite the labors of the fans in the ducts where is he now who knows its a big ship keep an eye on the door will you the two of you id better get to work we dont have that much time i let the bed down started arming the torp didnt take long when i finished i thought a minute then i opened up the dollys motor casing and removed a few vital parts ifwhenparnalee got back i didnt want him driving off with our little surprise there wasnt much else i could do even if the three of us could muscle the torp off the bed without fatally herniating ourselves there was no place in here where we could hide the thing the young raider left but jamber fausse stopped me at the door what if he comes back before it blows what if he disarms it you want to stay and argue with him be my guest i said i wasnt all that happy with that antique timer i was sure itd trigger the torp sometime i just wasnt sure when and i didnt want to be anywhere around when it turned over look i said its a randomized circuit and not all that easy to counterprogram not like pulling a few wires on hope and a prayer ive set the thing to blow in half an hour if he gets here in a minute or two maybe he can do something if hes later than that no way we take our chances thats all we can do he didnt like it but he was no more into suicide than i was so he nodded and we took off for the tubegate i dropped the tug into orbit a quadrant away from the warmaster and waited there adelaar glanced at her chron two minutes she said the ship hung motionless in the center of the screen the hanifa was standing behind me again i could feel her hot breath on my neck when i looked around i was almost nose to nose with her but she wasnt noticing anything but the warmaster the rest of them were pretty much the same hungry the warmaster trembled a shine spread over her then localized at the drivers she moved slowly at first ponderously she began picking up speed angling away from tairanna as soon as she got wound up it was like she vanished collapsing to a pinpoint and then to nothing well i said shes on her way horgul in two hours goodbye battleship what about the torp how do we know if it blew that was jamber fausse he was a man to keep his teeth in an idea until it squealed we dont i said unless she turns up again then we know it didnt back off everyone shows over were going down parnalee had slowed to a fast walk by the time he passed through the next to last hatch he felt the sudden liveliness in the ship as she began to move he stopped flattened his hand hard against the wall he could not have described the difference he felt in her but he knew what was happening she was on her way to the sun he smiled so they thought let them think it fools he started moving again an unhurried trot he passed through the last hatch glanced at his chron smiled again hed made better time than hed expected only half an hour he sighed with pleasure as he thought about stripping down and letting the fresher scrub him clean again about stretching out on the fur a hot meal on the console beside him and another bottle of brandy while he waited for the dark sister to come alive and take over the ship he saw the door open like hed left it hurried toward it he stopped just inside his way barred by the dolly and the torp for a crazy moment he thought he was hallucinating then that the bright sister had somehow developed a mechanical tp facility and flipped his torp back to him then he knew that the woman had done it the bitch had found his hiding place shed found the dark sister no matter that it was impossible for her to find the dark sister and shed left this joke to greet him furious and afraid he took a step toward it disarm it he thought ive got to disarm it it blew in his face he knew an instant of intolerable brightness of intolerable frustration and rage then nothing xiv timespan days local after the meeting on gerbek island to the evening of the day called liftoff at the mines when karrel goza left zaraiz memeli at the mines the boy was on fire with excitement but it didnt take him long to discover hed been dumped there to keep him out of trouble while the adults did whatever it was they were going to do he was furious and hurting betrayed again by someone who claimed his trust he poked about sticking his nose into anything that showed the slightest promise of breaking the tedium in the middle of his second week there early one morning before the sun was all the way up he pulled a rotten board off a window at the back of the convict barracks wriggled through the narrow space and dropped onto the floor of a holding cell the silver sphere came bounding at him squawling its warning attacking when that warning was ignored he was startled but not frightened he jumped swerved dived played with it laughed as he whipped about elastic as an eel too fast for the sphere to catch him nceegh heard him laughing took a look the sphere stopped chasing zaraiz and began chatting with him then it brought him into the workshop after a terse welcome nceegh went back to making the operant parts of one of the stunners he was assembling for the hit on the warmaster zaraiz sat on the stool next to him and watched him work fascinated by the delicacy and precision of his fingers by the magnifier he was wearing the microscopic points on most of his tools despite his involvement in the green slimes and his ability to dominate the other middlers he was a solitary boy he knew the pleasures and value of silence he asked nothing volunteered nothing spoke only to answer the paaos questions and kept his mouth shut at other times not wanting to distract nceegh at a crucial moment after a while nceegh let him polish and fit together cases for the stunners the boy immersed himself in what he was doing glowing with pride each time the paao looked a part over and set it down without comment showing that he thought it was finished that he saw nothing there that needed fixing with the resilience of the child he still was zaraiz gave his trust again this time to the paao gave it because nceegh was a master craftsman and he wanted very much to be like him because nceegh was wholly alien was physically and spiritually other he gave his trust and a tentative affection nceegh recognized this in his silent way and gave back what he was given when they took the paao bolodos minions were clumsy and let themselves be seen to cover themselves they ashed the village where they found him killing all his kin blood to the third degree killing his mates and his children most of all killing the boychild who was his craftheir his species was monogamous for life patrilocal and powerfully bonded to the family and the family place he lived after that only to trade death for death he escaped from the palace to find a way of laying his bloodghosts to feed them blood from the men who did the killing blood from the men who ordered it zaraiz gave him hope of another kind hope of passing on his craft of hands to lay his own ghost when it was tired of him and wanted to shed the weary weight of his body by the end of the week zaraiz memeli divorced his family and swore loyalty to nceegh taking the name zaraiz paao nceegh adopted him as his son his craftheir and he began teaching zaraiz paao the torveynee the way of the paao and the way of honor the way of vengeance ten days before liftoff they watched ehnas ofka and her isyas leave for the chel carrying with her the stunners theyd built for her they watched the fighters from the mines being ferried out to her one night two nights three until the chosen were all gone they spent the day named liftoff in the shop working on the housing of a hunting rifle one that killed with exploding darts no larger than a mosquito nceegh set delicate scrolls of inlay into the dark fine wood of the stock then passed it over to zaraiz for polishing while he etched shadow patterns into the metal parts they worked all day talked about nothing but the work around sundown they went to the smelter and sat in a corner eating fries and fish and drinking tea listening to the music watching the youngsters and the middlers dance thirty minutes later belirmen indiz came in banged his fist on the bar then scrambled onto it his age and stoutness forgotten the warmaster is taken he bellowed into a sudden silence she is taken and gone sent into the sun do you hear me the warmaster is gone noise and confusion shouted questions belirmens booming voice as he tried to answer them shoving elbows stomping feet triumphant flourishes trills and squeals from the musicians crying men women youngers rebels crowding closer to the bar to hear more rebels forcing their way against the tide to get out and spread the news everywhere movement and emotion a heady yeasty mix a time when dreams no one quite believed in were suddenly made real nceegh looked at zaraiz nodded at the door zaraiz got to his feet and followed him out riding soupedup yizzies protected by miniature cuuxtwoks nceegh and zaraiz paao left the mines an hour before dawn they circled wide through the mountains and went clacking and whirring across a stretch of barren chel not far from where the raiders had camped by nightfall they were on the lower boundary of the eastern duzzulka where tendrils of grassland reached into the scrub they landed tethered their yizzies ate slept a few hours climbed into the saddle again i put chicklet into a dive flicked her around so the gunport pels had improvised in her repair lock faced a melter station i balanced her on her tail while he got off a missile that a second later blew out the station and a hunk of tower under it we went swing balance boom around the circumference until the wall looked like beavers had been at it swarms of yizzies were converging on the palace when we came over from base wed seen hordes of them flying in from every corner of the littorals like locusts on the move they even sounded like locusts when i turned on the external ears and listened to them the news of the warmasters end was out everywhere that was obvious the com net i suppose if i were huvved id have shut down the net till i had some sort of control in the cities aslan said it was survivalfear that triggered surges looked to me like survivalhope was doing the job just as well airships were drifting loose over the city abandoned by their pilots and passengers loads of hordar dropped to melt into the surge that was forming there as we flew over i could see the devastation starting like the destruction in gul ukseme multiplied a hundredfold a million hordar as a single deathbeast striking down the thousands of huvved living there burning trampling bursting in doors and windows destroying everything their hands and feet could smash or torch the yizzies came clicking and clattering over them airmarching with the landswarm moving in a blind fury toward the palace as i finished the firing run i saw that mass of hordar crossing the waste land between the city and the wall i swore i did not want to go down there in the middle of that mess pels came up from the lock and slid into the cos seat he inspected the mob rrrr he said yeh i took the tug up and got ready to set her down inside the walls looks like half the hordar on tairanna maybe we should come back tomorrow or next week i doubt the relatives would pay for stewmeat i took another look at the mob which is whats going to be left tomorrow well lets set her down faster we finish the better shape our hidesre going to be in i put chicklet down in an elaborately ugly garden which was the only space large enough for her fat little tail that was within a reasonable walk of the slavepen the eyes kumari sent sniffing around told us that the techs were collected around sundown and put in the pen the rest rounded up by midnight that didnt include bedslaves but they werent targets anyway ordinary girls however lovely were too common to be pricey mostly their parents husbands lovers whatever couldnt afford to offer the kind of reward that would get them on ti vnoks list we were early it was barely dusk the end of a cold windy day with shreds of fog coming off the lake on the other hand there was the attack by the hordar maybe the slaves would be locked down early if luck happened to look our way pels and i we set the barriers and the shockers to keep the locals out rode the lift down and started at a quick trot for the pen i nearly bumped into a guard running for the wall the man stared at me lifted his rifle but changed his mind and went loping past me several of the guard cats were pacing about their leashes flopping they put their back hair up and their tails twitched when we came along one of them charged at us the others followed her pels got the leader and i stunned the others after that we kept an eye close to scan roof edges and the shoulders of the sturdier statues any high place a cat could perch on we got half a dozen more cats that way the situation inside the walls was getting hairier by the minute the huvveds and tassalgans on the intact sections of the wall were firing down at the surge with handheld melters and pellet rifles they killed hundreds and yet more hundreds but the hordar came on walking over the wounded and the dead a distinction without much difference because anyone wounded badly enough to be knocked off his feet was trampled to death by the feet of his neighbors tendrils of the surge peeled away from the main mass and fought their way into the gaps pels had knocked into the walls other units had ropes with grapples knotted onto them the hordar climbed the ropes faster than the guns could cut them down swarming up and over tearing the guards to bits as they passed over them destroying everything they got their hands on i was frowning as i ran there was too much confusion inside the walls i could understand some of it there didnt seem to be a helluva lot you could do to stop a surge coming at you but this chicken had its head cut off talk about ineffective where was the grand sech was pittipat stupid enough to execute him when the warmaster went was the sech stupid enough to let that happen i shook my head as i pulled up before a heavy door it was barred and locked but there wasnt a guard in sight i sliced through the bar and the lockbolt and shoved the door open as nceegh and zaraiz paao got closer to gilisim gillin the air went thick with airships and yizzies since the cuuxtwoks hid them from eyes as well as probes they had to stay alert and do some fancy dodging to avoid being run over they reached the palace close to sundown slipped past the wall without triggering the melters and touched down in the garden atop the palace tower nceegh wore armor covering his torso arm and leg sheaths with knives of assorted lengths and purpose in them on his back he had a battery pac attached by cable to a heavyduty cutter that needed both hands to hold it level when it was in use the smaller cutters that zaraiz paao wore were keyed to his hands all he had to do was point then tap a thumb against the side of a crooked middle finger he had no armor he counted on his agility and speed to protect him the door from the roof garden into the palace was a bronze slab elaborately etched over all its surface nceegh melted it jumped the runnels of congealing metal and the cooked meat of a hapless guard went slatting as fast as his thin legs would carry him down a lacy spiral ramp the palace defenses belonged to the days of the first imperator and they were badly maintained until recently no one not even the professionally paranoid grand sech had expected an attack on the palace itself during the past months thered been some attempt to refurbish the alarms and automatic killers but slave techs dont make all that reliable a workforce when theres a thought hanging in the air that the men in power are about to lose their footing down and around they went nceegh leading zaraiz paao watching his sides and back sweeping away resistance not stopping to ask those they met what side they were on the agile uninvolved dived for cover the guards and slow reactors died down and around going for the commandcenter multiply defended massively armored spherical chamber buried in the earth resting on bedrock built to resist intense bombardment fire flood whatever half a dozen tassalgans guarded the single entrance a hatch with a complex wholebody lock programmed to open for two people and only two the imperator and the grand sech the security was impressive it looked impeccable but no imperator in all the long millennia of imperacy back on huvedra or here on tairanna not one imperator had ever ever locked himself in a room with only one exit he always had a bolt hole known only to himself before he escaped nceegh had spent nearly three years local in the palace as one of pittipats favorite toys during those years hed built weapons and other elaborate playthings for the imperator and used his spare time to make spy eyes and ears for himself he planted them everywhere collecting data for his escape and his vengeance among his other unlovely attributes pittipat was a voyeur he liked to spy on his own people and went slipping from peephole to peephole sometimes all night long nceegh laid a bug on him and tracked him a couple of nights and after that explored the web of passages on his own mapping security systems and finally the area about the commandcenter pittipat was on nceeghs vengeance list because hed ordered a weaponmaster from bolodo and thus had a share of bloodguilt for the ashing of the paao kin after nceegh was in the palace a month his cold determination went hot where imperator pettan tra pran was concerned the old rip had an inherited talent for creating passionate enemies nceegh led zaraiz paao to the outlet of the imperators bolthole he melted it down two minutes later the paao and his son leaped into the commandcenter and confronted the imperator the grand sech and the clutch of huvved techs busy at sterile white work stations looking down melter snouts at the swarming hordar swinging back and forth wiping away rank after rank of the marchers flesh running like water off bones that ran like syrup into a puddle around the feet of men women children who kept coming on and coming on talking with seches in the fekkris of littoral cities the faces all saying the same thing the cities are emptying the hordar are leaving saying to the seches stop them shoot them down if you have to dont let them leave dont let them come here stop them however you can we cant send you anything right now its up to you stop them nceegh burned the head off the grand sech while zaraiz paao plinked the techs as the imperator woke from his initial shock and started scurrying toward the main exit nceegh sent a beam from the burner sizzling past him pittipat stopped and turned slowly working on a smile as he turned his eyes opened wide as he recognized the intruder ceeghi hivagh nceegh muttered leaving zaraiz paao to guard the exit he stalked the imperator cornered him against a work station down you he growled on the floor bitvekeshit the imperators head went up his tentative smile vanished nonsense he said nceegh lifted the burner pressed the front end of the tube against pittipats stomach baokl choose flea the old man reconsidered his objection and stretched out on the floor where he lay blinking up at the paao with visible effort he managed a smile then broadened it into a genial grin that lit up watery blue eyes sunk in a nest of pseudo laughwrinkles he was calm now confident despite his uncomfortable and humiliating position he was sure he could manipulate the situation to his benefit that he could pacify this old friend come ceeghi youre a good fellow what do you want just tell me theres no need for all this nceegh knelt beside him and touched a spray to his neck the imperator stiffened worked his mouth he couldnt speak and he couldnt move his limbs zaraiz left his post and stood beside the paao watching what he was doing hobbling on his knees plushy gray fur worn thin over the bone nceegh moved down the huvveds long spindly body unbuckled the imperatorial sandals slid the long bony feet out of them my village is ash he said speaking with emotionless precision in unaccented hordaradda he took a thin surgical blade from a sheath on his forearm and sliced off the imperatorial great toes he set them aside while he applied cauterizing patches to stop the blood flow he slit the imperatorial trousers up past the knees the house of my fathers is ash he said he drew his knife across the hamstrings severing them he hobbled up a little farther my children are ash he said with a deft twist of his knife he popped out the imperatorial testicles and dropped them beside the severed toes he moved on my lifemates are ash he said he lifted the left hand drew his knife several times across the back of it severing the tendons my craftheir is ash he said he removed the thumb dropped it on the imperatorial chest and applied a patch to the wound my bloodkin to the third degree are ash he said he dealt with the right hand in the same way edged along until he was bending over the imperatorial head looking down at the old huvveds face ignoring the terror in it you are the prime cause of those things he said the bloodghosts of my kin cry for vengeance zaraiz help me keep his head steady while zaraiz paao held the imperatorial head locked against his thighs nceegh drew the blade delicately along the top of the imperatorial eyesockets cutting away the eyelids without touching the eyes beneath never close your eyes again to the death and pain you decree he said working with the same care he cut through the skin and cartilage of the imperatorial nose and lifted it away never ignore again the consequences of your demands he used the point as a stylus and cut into the imperatorial brow the paoteely glyphs for bloodguilt may the world know your soul you who command death without thought let him go he said gently my son if you please nceegh got to his feet brushed his hands together the paralysis will wear off in about an hour he told the old man do what you will then he touched zaraiz paao on the shoulder time to go they fought their way back to the roof against a stiffening but disordered resistance reached the garden breathing hard from the climb with a few holes in unimportant places a burn or two from richocheting pellets nothing serious stretching and yawning so sleepy he didnt like thinking about the ride back to the mines zaraiz paao strolled to the parapet and looked across the grass at the faint lines of rose and purple at the base of the clouds in the west the sun was down and the dark was lowering quickly he yawned again glanced into the gardens below he saw the tug look nceyda isnt that the machine they were talking about at the mines nceegh crossed to him fdooya must be talk was the outsiders come looking for disappeared who might be slaves he frowned at zaraiz paao you my son now zhazhti he said my craftheir but you born hordar it is torveynee i ask you come with me away from tairanna come with me to hunt the ghostblood zaraiz paao rubbed at his eyes he was so tired it wasnt fair that he had to decide this without time to consider he reached out a trembling hand and warm furry fingers closed around it on the other side there were lots of times before this when hed chewed things over and over and sometimes he was right and sometimes he was wrong prophet help me he thought i will come i will hunt he said promise youll teach me everything you my craftheir zhazhti what else everything ya nceegh grinned at him hugged the boy hard against him fi let us go push in on that line the pen had small sleeping chambers arranged around an assembly hall with a horizontal lattice displayed across the ceiling tracks for the slides of the tether chains at night around a hundred slaves were locked onto those chains and left to negotiate their way into their assigned sleeping places because of the surge and the attack on the wall the palace slaves had been herded into the pen early the huvved didnt want them getting ideas about escaping when i burned the latch and kicked the door in most of them were still in the assembly chamber gathered in clusters talking arguing fidgeting or just sitting and staring in deep depression at stains on the walls i stood beside the door looking over that very various crowd in that long narrow room tomperianne i called i waited a minute repeated the name yelling over the noise remember a dancer name of kante xalloor she asked us to have a look for you and your sisters a thin vital woman vaguely pteroid moved away from a group of the back wall her chain clinking musically xalloor eh she had a deep contralto so much voice from so frail a body she looked to her right at two others who might have been clones instead of sisters they were so like her xalloor nymperianne said or it might have been lamperianne whoever her voice was a liquid lovely soprano when i learned their names i could tell them apart by voices if not their faces and bodies what cha know lamperianne said or it might have been nymperianne this one had an oboes reedy notes less immediately enticing than her sister but maybe more interesting as time passed good kid they chorused you know us tomperianne said whore you names quale i said ship slancyorza you want a ride to helvetia thats the dumbest question i ever heard she laughed flutesong i assume that means yes pels cut the three of them loose someone here called jaunniko the noise got louder two men struggled one fell the one still standing moved away from the tangle hed created here quale im jaunniko the dancer ask for me someone did described him too and youre not him jaunniko stick your head up will you or your hands sculptor behind the scowling claimant pushing impatiently at two men and a woman trying to help him up a lanky young man got unsteadily to his feet and ran strong square hands through hair with a remnant of purple dye still clinging to it as his biceps flexed the lavender butterfly tattooed on his arm seemed to flutter he tried to speak but a partially deflected blow in the mixup had shoved his collar against his larynx and left him temporarily mute i gave him a nod yeh you match pels the omperiannas hurried over dancing away from hands grabbing at them what now tomperianne fluted at me xalloor said she did most of the talking for the three of them wait by the door hmm pushing the steel collar up and rubbing at his neck jaunniko reached me and i waved him over to join the three musicians the rest of you i started the slaves began fighting to get to me tangling their chains struggling desperate yelling grunting wrestling with each other quiet i roared at them get back give me trouble and you can sit here and rot i waited until the noise subsided to a manageable level untangle those chains dammit how do you expect us to cut them when theyre messed up like that all right right the more you help the sooner we can get out of here you have any idea whats cranking up outside this place is going to be rubble before the sun comes up bloody rubble and theyre not caring who does the bleeding i turned my head tomperianne come here when she was at my side i gave her my stunner it wont kill anyone i said itll just lay them out and well leave them laying i raised my voice again and repeated that so everyone could hear it went on use it on anyone who looks like trouble you out there when youre cut loose back up against the inside wall if you want us to run shotgun for you if you figure you can handle yourself outside take off up to you im no nursemaid i plunged into the crowd and began helping pels sever the chains the job got easier when the yells and screams from outside came in loud enough for them to get an earful they calmed down fast and sorted themselves out as we cut them loose when we were ready to go pels led with the omperiannas and jaunniko immediately behind him the rest of that motley crop followed organized into squads that kept together and made good time once they were out of the pen i followed a few strides behind so i could scan the whole and have a better chance of spotting trouble when they saw the tugs snout they really put on some speed i started hoping wed reach chicklet without much trouble pels flattened a couple of cats before they made up their minds to jump us that was about it the twolegged guards were too busy to bother with anything not coming at them the attack on the walls was more intense i could see strings of hordar coming up and over like lines of ants and the yizzies were thick overhead not over us at first i was hoping theyd keep away they were circling high up beyond the range of the guards pellet guns spilling fire over everything and everyone below them even the front lines of the surge the yizzy riders were acting like they werent part of them on the ground like they were a surge on their own since most of them were street kids or divorced outcasts i suppose they had to be a separate force a third force striking at huvved and hordar alike we were too big a target half a dozen yizzies came at us dripping fire they stayed high up my stunner wouldnt reach them nothing i could do like an idiot id left the launch tube and my darts in the tug another yizzy came swooping by looked like it was carrying two one draped over the knees of the other the one in control rested a black tube on his passengers back even that far off i could see what it wasa heavyduty cutter it slashed across the inklins attacking us and turned them into ash on the wind as the newcomer bagged himself some more twelve year olds i ran for the tug cursing bolodo and adelaar and pittipat and huvved snots and bloodyminded rebels and the surge and him up there and everyone and everything that got me here and made me look at these things children killing killing children made me want to vomit as pels finished loading the exslaves a fifth wave of fliers formed up and headed our way i cupped my hands around my mouth and bellowed at our friend on the yizzy to come on board if thats what he wanted we were going to get the hell out of here he brought his yizzy down until he was hanging over the edge of the lift platform nceegh paao he said his voice was a hoarse roar that had trouble cutting through the noise around us escaped slave asking transport offworld my son zaraiz paao he patted the boys buttocks surge got hold of him and i had to put him out give me a hand with him right how you want to do this let me get the straps off he produced a wickedlooking scalpel from an armsheath and sliced through the braided thongs that tied the boy in place i got my hands around the childs waist and lifted he was small like most hordar children slight a featherweight i held him while the paao swung from the saddle and let the yizzy drift off well go up to the bridge i said we can talk while im taking chicklet back to base mind leaving that cutter in the lock uhnh fiddoodahak before i could ask what that meant his mouth split into a lipless grin sure no problem he stripped off the battery and dropped it and the tube near the inner hatch i gave him the boy and got busy by the time i had the lift folded in and the outer lock dogged home pels had the drives humming when we reached the bridge the paao laid the boy hed called his son on the floor mat and dropped down to sit crosslegged beside him he lifted the childs head and shoulders into his lap and sat with one hand resting lightly on his sons tangled black hair i took a last look at the chaos around us goosed the tug into the air id had more than enough of tairanna the hordar and this whole rescue business xv three days after the taking of the warmaster karrel goza in ayla gul incimidmorningcloudy day gusts of gray rain gul inci was empty empty even of death no bodies in the streets no bloodstains or char marks where inklins and others had burned in the beast courts the stock complained udders heavy with curdled milk feed trays and water troughs empty pet animals whimpered whined or howled hungry and parched abandoned by those who were supposed to care for them the wind snapped wash left hanging on the line when the surge impulse came down on gul inci it banged doors left unlatched rattled and banged shutters it blew scraps of paper and other debris against and around karrel goza who came walking south from sirgыn bol where hed left windskimmer noselocked to a mooring mast he passed house after house emptied by the surge impulse he walked slower and slower drew his fingers across the bright tessera inlaid in the brick of the courtwalls family marks and signs taken from family history he named the houses as he touched their signs a slow invocation of what had been house falyan house umtivar house borazan house ishlemmet house tamarta empty echoing disturbing a kind of walking nightmare he moved deeper into the city walking streets hed taken so many times before sirgыn bol to goza house goza house to sirgыn bol he did not hurry he pushed against a growing reluctance to see his own house empty like these others he moved past taverns and shops and other small businesses for the first time he heard voices though he saw no one and none of the businesses were open he heard a steady creaking as he drew near the largest of the circles with its speaker minaret a toppedout stone tree in the middle he remembered the last time he stood there crowds pressing about him geres duvvar bringing him a paper cone of hot nuts his grief over the loss of his cousin intensified suddenly as if he felt it for the first time he stood looking at the wall he and geres duvvar had leaned against while they listened to the stentor shout after a while he was aware of the creaking again he looked up a body was suspended from the speakers platform a hanged man he moved around so he could see who it was herk he breathed the fehdazs face was black and distorted and he was stripped naked but there was no question who hung there another memory came back full forceelmas ofka that night she found her brother dead of torture herk will pay she said it may take years but herk will pay he shrugged this wasnt ellis work she was too busy organizing the world it didnt matter herk the jerk had enemies enough to guarantee hed end like this without asking himself why he was doing it he climbed the verdigrised spiral to the platform and cut the rope he heard herks body hit the stones with a loose boneless splat the fehdaz must have been hanging there for hours more than a day long enough for the deathstiffness to pass out of him they took him when the surge was just starting here he thought thats why they hung him instead of tearing him apart he climbed back down and stood over the body it hadnt begun to stink yet the weather was too cold for that he pressed his fingers hard against his eyes too many memories here he couldnt let herk dirty them he dropped his hands and looked around for a place to put him the timbers of the fekkri gate were burned to stumps like rotted teeth and the pile itself was a shell no more he got herk up and over his shoulder carried the body into the fekkri court and dropped it on the paving stones he left brushing at himself a little nauseated he moved more quickly now he had a better reason than duty to visit his house he wanted a bath goza house was in the southeast section of the city where the little houses were and the tenements for the poor the warehouses the retting sheds and other factories down near the waters edge the two parts of the main gate were moving in the wind but not enough to swing closed seeing them like that made him angry the gates of the great houses were closed latched probably locked though he had not thought to try them here the houses were left open to the wind and whatever thieves escaped the surge here where the people were poor and not important he went through the wallarch and into the front court the wind blew dead leaves into dust devils a solitary spray of rain hit him in the face the house was dead everyone was gone even the elders he folded his arms across his chest hugged them tight against him it was like his grief for geres duvvar and somehow worse there was no focus only a freefloating desolation they make a desolation and call it peace he said aloud whats that mean karrel goza looked around not seeing who it was who spoke to him tazmin duvvar stepped from the duvvar court stood leaning against a gate pillar whats that he repeated someone said it a long time ago and a long way from here i dont know who or where the outsider at the mines the teacher you remember she told it to her students and one of them told it to me it just came to mind mmh morbid tazmin duvvar said sounds to me like you need a hot meal and a nights sleep let your liver sweeten how long you been back i got here yesterday morning i wasnt ferrying yips about like you cousin one look at the looting there at the palace and i thought hard times are coming and i better make sure weve got the stuff to ride em out that it didnt walk out in some strangers pouch you see herk hard to miss wonder who did it karrel goza stretched yawned one thing i know half incis going to claim they were in on it any hot water started the boilers this morning bath yeh i cut the bastard down i didnt like seeing him there dumped him in the fekkri court i need to wash him off me tazmin duvvar looked up at the clouds ignoring another brief flurry of rain somebodys going to have to do something about him if the wind keeps on in this direction another day or two and well be smelling him he moved away from the pillar and followed karrel goza around the house whats happening in gilisim did they ever find old pittipat or the grand sech not yet whats happening karrel goza stripped off his jacket and began undoing the fastenings on his shirt more of everything you saw before you cut out more looting more dead people wandering around like theyre walking in their sleep we havent begun to sort out whos what and where they belong let alone identified the dead the best guess i heard is as much as a third of us is dead somewhere around gilisim its going to be a job getting them buried elmas ofka her isyas and the council from the mines theyve got together with vips from the west coast and up from guneywhiyk trying to work out how to organize things now there arent any more huvved and the slave techs are gone most of them its a mess taz every one of them has his own idea how to run things bless the prophet elli smoothes them down and gets them to start making sense not that shes any saint herself were going to have to watch and make sure she doesnt take up where tra yarta left off he pulled open the door to the bathhouse went in tazmin duvvar lit the lamps while karrel goza started the water running and finished stripping then he came back and settled on the towel bench his feet up on the coping about the tub you figure we going to get any say at all karrel goza slid into the water shivering as the heat closed round him he settled his head on the neckrack closed his eyes ive been thinking about that he said what we get well have to take i did some talking with young hayal halak him from gul brindar one of that womans students he was the one who told me the desolationpeace quote he went inklin for a while before he came to the mines he loves the great families about as much as he loves huvved he picked up some ideas from that woman that sound good the greats wont like em the ommars either i think ellis going to back him a lot of them off the sea farms might too they dont want to see the greats getting a stranglehold on trade isnt going to be easy toss me the soap eh here way things are looks to me like whoevers ready first is the one whos gonna take it hay and his bunch got their shots planned karrel goza soaped the washcloth scrubbed at his arm planned is one thing doing is something else he balanced an ankle on his knee began washing his toes weve got numbers on our side the greats dont smell very sweet to a lot of people they kissed too much huvved ass we could lose it though if brindars wont talk to incers and incers wont talk to samlikkaners and nobody talks to grasslanders you know how it goes you me the rest of them who took the warmaster weve got credit were going to have to spend he switched feet and stopped talking tazmin duvvar thought that over then he nodded youll have to give me the primer version he said i was never much good at the books but i tell you this i can talk a tickler into giving it away free sit me in a tavern and let me chat her up lot of folk out there need that primer same as me i can get them to give it a hearing cant ask for more karrel goza splashed water over his face and hair then climbed from the tub throw me one of those towels youre sitting on eh he caught it and began rubbing at his hair i didnt get out much you see any of ours in gilisim living or dead ahhh both he wrapped the towel around him come with me while i get some clean clothes why not ive got to get back to feeding the stock but they can wait a bit theyre not as hungry as they were he picked up one of the lamps goza ommars dead he touched karrel gozas shoulder patted it lightly then pushed the door open melter not much of her left but i knew it was her and i told the deadwagon who she was well have to go through the back ive got the other doors locked duvvar ommar next to her same thing prophet yeh melter left her face alone told them about her too he held the door open for karrel goza went round him and up the back stairs holding the lamp high to light the dark narrow enclosure glancing over his shoulder from time to time talking while he climbed ollanin dead all three goza duvvar memeli saw my sister avy and the memeli ommar alive he waited on the landing then went along the hallway to the corner room karrel goza had lived in from the time he got his license to fly theyd corralled a clutch of youngsters had them out collecting our folk i expect most of those still alive will be back here by tomorrow noon he stepped aside and let karrel goza work the pinlock and open the door then followed him into the room and set the lamp on a table by the bed ylazar falyan showed up at sirgыn bol yesterday with a couple of pilots from the mines like us prophet be praised they missed out on the surge he perched on a ladderback chair folded his arms on the top splat and rested his chin on them he looked around for mechanics found me settling in here hired me to go over a couple of the airships worked on the best till about midnight yesterday he says hes going to use them ferrying incers home karrel goza looked up from his trouser laces i left windskimmer at one of sirgыns masts i didnt see anyone there took off for gilisim this morning mustve left before you got here ah he went poking through his drawers hunting for a clean shirt found one and shook it out then loosened the laces and pulled it over his head big of him yeh hes praying real hard no one senior shows up and in the meantime making points for himself so he can keep his hold even if one does i expect hell make it he had the backbone to get out and over to the mines when herk started tightening down hard to say he padded to the dresser peered at himself in the mirror getting old eh twice as old as i look and thats older than time you and lirrit ofka still going to wed soons we get a moment he dragged a comb through his hair the damp had tightened the curls into knots that made him swear as he worked them loose marrying out or she coming in i dont know who knows anything these days we decided to see how things shape up before we jump one way or the other he looked over his shoulder at tazmin duvvar might not be any more marrying in or out things going to change that much you dont sound very happy about it well everyone likes to be comfortable and change is always full of burrs and bites you really want to go back to the way it was nuh yeh i dont know i want it to be comfortable like it was i want to know whats going to be happening tomorrow and a week from tomorrow and tomorrow next year yeh i know better but youd better remember too kar theres a lot and a lot out there like me in those thatre still alive dont get too fancy for us eh karrel goza dropped on the bed beside the shoestool set his foot on it and bent over to put on his sandals you feeding the animals he said what else needs doing just about everything i didnt have time yesterday or this morning for much but meals for me and the fourfoots looks like our folk dropped whatever they were doing where they were doing it and took off when the impulse hit karrel goza switched feet mess could be worse left the fires going the place couldve burned down prophets hand on us it didnt they just went out when the coal was gone karrel goza stood he yawned moved his shoulders clasped his hands behind his head and stretched the shirt tail he hadnt bothered tucking in lifted in the cold draft coming through the door he shivered found an old sweater and pulled it on outside first starting to feel like snow yeh how long you going to be here elli wants me back by tomorrow he waited till tazmin duvvar was outside with the lamp then he pulled the door shut and reset the lock she says the serious fights should be starting about then and shell need all the backing she can get he let tazmin duvvar go ahead with the light you said you thought most of our folk will be here by tomorrow laza said hed bring them favor to me if id work without pay since hes short of coin you want me along yeh if youre going to be persuading people to back us you ought to know what youre talking about the room was filled with slow moving shadows from the dying fire and wandering warm drafts mellow with the smell of the mulled cider steaming on the hearth the long window was closed but unshuttered its embrasure was padded on the bottom and sides to make a comfortable windowseat it had thick yunkhide tacked over the padding rubbed to a deep glow by decades of soaping and sitting karrel goza was stretched out in the window sipping at a mug of cider listening to the rain drum against the glass taz was right he thought morbid doesnt make it he was exhausted sore and deeply content the emptiness that was desolation in the morning now seemed to vibrate with possibility an emptiness waiting wanting to be filled he sipped at the cider and thought about that a while and after a while he stopped thinking altogether tomorrow could wait until the sun rose now was hot cider red fire and the steady beat of the rain xvi days std from home and heading back in the split i went out to the belt and brought slancy back put her down on the plateau then we started loading i got the exs together and made my speech about how rough it was going to be riding in the hold for some three months while we were insplitting to helvetia i told them if they wanted to miss out on that id take their names instead of them they could wait for a more comfortable ride id leave them shelters and a miniskip so they could get around i didnt want unhappy passengers taking that many people i knew shitall about into slancy made me very nervous being trashed and rescued didnt turn any of them into angels i told them the food was going to be shipbasic which theyd get sick of very fast there wouldnt be water or any other way of taking a bath so theyd be pretty ripe when they walked out of the hold most of all life was going to be very very boring insplitting was bad enough when you had something to keep you busy sitting around and staring at the hold walls was something else i didnt get a single taker they wanted out of there the sooner the better a few of them i knew something about i brought up front stowed them in the crew cabins so id have some shooters back of me if there was trouble aslan and adelaar of course nceegh and his boy along with the weapons he skipped over to the mines to collect which i impounded for the duration not that i didnt trust him he and pels got on like long lost brothers i just didnt want that much firepower wandering around loose churri the bard and his girlfriend both of them were oldtime survivors besides i kind of enjoyed baiting adelaar the omperiannas kumari had a passion for music of all kinds thats why them the rest brought the shelters in and set them up in the hold got them organized in sectors like they were out under the trees improvised screens for privacy areas they worked almost like they were droids with the pattern imprinted it was a smooth loading surprised me a little till i thought about it these werent your average thumbfingered boneheads bolodo skimmed cream for them two hundred sixtyfive days std out of telffer according to ships log we lifted off tairanna and headed for the limit as soon as we dived pels activated the squirtlink sent the squeal to ti vnoks receptor giving him the passpartout so he could get hold of the data packet letting him know we had leda zag and ilvinin taivas so he could tell whoever was interested and stir us up some heavy support the squeal was too short to trigger ears and even if someone got lucky there were no tags on it to identify either end the cover was down i hoped itd be thick enough to turn the knives waiting for us the trip went better than i expected adelaar disappeared into slancys workshop with my home stats to get a start on redoing its security this time i made sure kinok kept ves tentacles out of her business i swept the shop and removed all suspect foliage like most of us when it comes to someone outside the family ves ethics get a bit shaky ethics aside pulling her string about churri was one thing she got nasty on the verbal end and gave me a good flaying when she felt like it but on the business end she was a wall she knew what she wanted and what she didnt and no jabs would shift her if she didnt want snoops watching her work thats what she intended to get or she just might decide to ditch that part of the deal and more than ever i wanted her touch dressing up my house funny having lived so long and semivoluntarily acquired a body and with it a definite end to that life i was beginning to appreciate the fragility of well everything churri and xalloor got together with the omperiannas and began working out a new act they figured that the publicity from the return of the disappeared and their connection with it made them a draw the bookers couldnt ignore kumari figured the same thing she was going to finance the tour if they came up with something she liked since they kept trying out parts of the thing on the exs in the hold they kept the passengers happy and entertained which made me happy aslan was something of a surprise she worked on her reports a lot but not all the time i hadnt paid much attention to her back on tairanna too busy being irritated by this and that i suppose and too tired from flying all night digging out the targets you want another excuse ive got this tendency to focus on what im busy at so i dont see much of whats around me peripheral images shoved outside my periphery if you know what i mean she looked a little like her mother around the eyes and mouth but her coloring was more dramatic her features heavier no thats not the word stagier more dramatic like the coloring the bones showed and they were what a sculptor called good she photoed better than she looked in person well betters not the word either she was prettier in the stills but a lot of the personality got lost i remembered adelaar saying shuh shes my daughter and i love her but even i wouldnt call her a beauty shes not all that sexy either to be honest quale shes a boring person just goes to show mama dont know everything she thinks she does it was a friendly time pleasant waking up and feeling her warm beside me more than pleasant when she woke up she enjoyed sex more than anyone i can remember knowing laughed a lot made me laugh with her i was almost sorry when slancy chimed to let me know she was ready to slip back to realspace days std out of telffer helvetia we came up nose to nose with three destroyers and a gravity sink that nailed us poor old slancy couldnt wiggle a fin before i had time to start sweating the mainscreen lit up helvetian perimeter patrol logo announcing who was out there then someone who ordinarily walked in more exclusive circles i knew that sour smile and the face it was tacked onto though he didnt know me and probably didnt want to the only time we actually met i was sharing someone elses body malurio marchog the sevens enforcer cattwey of the helvetias i relaxed home free i thought swardheld quale he said proving me wrong about that much he knew my face courtesy of ti vnok no doubt marchog cattwey i said showing i have my sources too permission to come aboard he said polite bastard what he meant was open your gd lock before i gd pull the gd thing off its hinges well i asked for helvetian cover now i pay for it permission herewith granted i said want me to send a boat over or you providing your own transport that was a bit of swank with the sink out there focused on us we couldnt space a fart he ignored it helvetian rules apply out here as on the ground he said crack your forward lock portside i hear you marchog cattwey it sounded like he was coming over himself which was a bit of a surprise apparently that pair of rescuees down in the hold were mote important than wed thought old ti vnok he slipped up this time on the good side maybe but definitely a miscalc hes going to have to work to live that down i cracked the lock sent kumari to make sure nceegh didnt have some holdouts tucked away i wasnt sure how much he knew about helvetian rules and how seriously the seven took them i left pels at the com and went down to the portlock to remind the helvetians as tactfully as i could that this was my ship and we were outside the limit in socalled freespace theyd probably be polite enough to listen without snickering even marchog the inner hatch opened and i dumped the speech fast six pretors trotted through shoved me against the wall no malice just getting me out of the way they split three on each side dark massive huge as intimidating as twoleggers in battle armor ever get when theyre not actually coming at you i sucked in my gut and waited a mirrorsphere about two meters across floated from the lock moving along half a meter off the floor at a pace about that of a man out for an afterdinner stroll it stopped in front of me i thought it was inspecting me though its hard to tell whats going on inside something when youre staring at a funhouse version of yourself smeared across the outside the people where are they it had a deep bass voice that oozed with authority the hold despois i said being as polite as i knew how great god i was thinking one of the seven hoooeee talk about your heavy support lead it said very careful to keep my hands in view i moved past the pretors and started for the dropshaft i heard the guard clumping into position behind me the sound echoed by a second sextet coming out of the lock somewhere back there marchog was moving up to the bridge with his own pretors he wouldnt leave slancy in our hands not with one of the seven aboard her i didnt like it but i certainly wasnt going to kick up a fuss all i could do was hope this was a temporary dispossession the hold smelled like a roadshow zoo i suppose faceless in his sphere got filtered air but i didnt it was enough to choke a goat he drifted out to the middle and hovered there reflecting the faces or whatever turned up to him you were slaves the basso burred out and bounced off the walls some of them knew what they were looking at whoever didnt was getting the word fast if the hissing that spread through the hold meant what i thought the kakeran posa ala was the first to answer he set his hands on his hips glared up at his distorted reflection klaan vem he growled bolodo man put a kujjim collar round my neck five kujjim years and nobody did shit till quale there come for us dey chomedy and leda zag came elbowing through the thickening crowd about posa ala the tall one opening a path for the little dey chomedy stomped her foot and growled then shouted up at the sphere bolodo men took me off my mountain took me from my nest they did not ask my consent they did not pay my price seven years the masters milked my sweat and drank my tears and nothing did they pay was i slave ssss show me bolodo man let me take my pay from his flesh and his sweat and his blood leda zag tapped the tall femmes arm and was lifted to her shoulder so it was with me despois i traveled to a place for rest but i did not reach it before i reached it a gas bomb filled my flickit when i woke i was in a scout on my way to weersyll and beyond for three years i mourned one dearer to me than the beat of my heart for three years i suffered until the man quale and his companions took me from my servitude it has not been easy coming home not easy for me not easy for any of us but we suffer these small travails gladly because we are going home i kept my face very straight and serious though i enjoyed that little speech we spent most of a warm afternoon up by the lake dickering over her fee for her affirmation of my noble contribution to her freedom i was kicking back half the reward to be paid into her dainty little hands the day i got it golden gelders coin not credit after that the rest of them yelled their anger a confused hammering of sound even the mirrorsphere seemed to shudder and i was wondering if id get out of there with hearing intact quiet the basso boomed out hammering back at the yammer in the hold enough he had the advantage of amplification but it was several minutes before he broke through and my collection of exslaves simmered down a bit helvetia has heard you he said big of him she will expedite your arrival and provide housing for you until this matter is cleared up she will provide means of contacting your kin or other individuals concerned about you hmm i thought such generosity looks like theyve already got a strangle hold on bolodos assets and want to keep the noose tight they cant let the thought get round that theyre playing with clients gelt they ought to pay adelaars expenses and double for a bonus what a lovely present shes dropped in their little laps i kept my face immobile and my hands clasped behind me but i was beginning to enjoy this quite a lot helvetia asks only the sphere boomed out that you agree to testify as to the circumstances of your abductions bolodo neyuregg ltd is actively contesting the claims relayed to us by an agent of swardheld quale because we may invoke certain clauses in the contract bolodo neyuregg ltd signed with us in order to put several executives of that company through involuntary verification it may be necessary for some of you to pass through the verifier and otherwise make identification of such individuals if that is possible and within your knowledge you will be compensated for the time and the harrowing of your emotions the sphere drifted toward the tube i got out of the way before i was shifted aside by the pretors and followed the procession from the hold when faceless said expedited he meant it escorted by two destroyers though a lane cleared for us we sailed at spooky speed for insystem travel straight to a mooring usually reserved for those wealthy beyond my dreams of avarice where slancy was put to bed in a section all her own shuttles drew up to her flanks and waited there like a ride in an amusement park ready to take the exslaves down kumari had all the paperwork done shed taken care of that during the trip in between xalloors rehearsalsname worldoforigin life history work status circumstances of abduction fingerprints bodyprints retina prints and cell coding with a snippet of freezedried skin or flesh or chitin whatever seemed appropriate sealed to each statement i didnt expect any trouble collecting the rewards not with ti vnok getting his thirty percent but kumari was a worrier it made her the best mom slancyd ever enjoyed so no delays we lined our passengers up and hustled them into the shuttles we rode down in the last of them pels kumari and i along with adelaar and aslan churri xalloor and the omperiannas nceegh and the boy now the real tedium began images aslan aici adlaar yes thats the man he was on tairanna when fangulse tra yana interviewed us churri the bard saw him also as did parnalee pagang tanmairo proggerd though he cant testify since he died mad kante xalloor yes thats the stringman who drugged me i cant connect him to bolodo except by the circumstances that when i woke i was in a bolodo scout i knew it was bolodo by the patches on the pilots shipsuit yes thats the pilot who flew the scout jaunniko yes thats the stringman who came on to me then drugged me yes thats the pilot who flew the scout that took me to the cage on weersyll

in a thousand gelders apiece for the extras we brought along gratis a nice little bonus the seven were overflowing with the milk of well something as they began taking apart bolodos assets at least

any other man adelaar was right for once men were recreation when her daughter wasnt busy with something else since i do considerable business with university i thought we might recreate ourselves some other time i played the idea around and decided i liked it we took adelaar to droom she wanted to get adelaris whipped into shape again before she took off to work on my house shed been away for over four years and was nervous about what shed find left of her business that left crew and me alone at last on slancyorza it felt good kinok had worked his remotes till their bearings ran hot scrubbing out the hold and the rest of her she felt clean and fresh frisky it was deep winter when we got back the month called wolves running snow was piled into threemeter drifts when we dropped the lander on the pad up in slancy kinok was rubbing his tentacles together again scritching away like crazy laughing at us idiots leaving a warm clean ship so we could get ourselves soaked to the bone and halffrozen the housekeep was burbling over with things to tell us about the small lives that prowled about on my land among other things two feral and very pregnant cats had showed up they had their kittens in the summerhouse she said she couldnt understand how theyd managed to get through the shield i had my doubts about that but they had so shed deloused the mogs and their kits and shot all of them full of antibiots and organized a feeding schedule to keep the mamas at their job she was full of how well shed coped ever since kumari worked over her programming shes developed strong maternal urges sometimes i get tired of her fussing then i see the absurdity of a neuter like our kri coming up with such a construct even if kri were sexed she belongs to a budding species where motherhood is like a bad case of acne i think she reads too much well finish out the winter at the nest come spring well go take a look at tairanna to see how things are working out and what kind of trading we can do its mostly curiosity though it wont hurt having a stash of rosepearls in the basement that we could dip into should luck turn mean on us on the way back we might stop off at university to see if they have any interesting commissions needing an experienced and trustworthy crew i might call up aslan to see if shes unsaddled her white horse and ready to enjoy another sort of ride its a short life these bodies have and a good one fragile but full of heat and flavor im sitting up in my tower its a clear night no clouds the stars out this way are sparse but that makes them all the lovelier and the moonlight on the snow is magical
