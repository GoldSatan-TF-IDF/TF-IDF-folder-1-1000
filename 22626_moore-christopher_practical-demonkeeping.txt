practical demonkeeping by christopher moore for the demonkeepers karlene kathy and heather part one saturday night like one that on that lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and no more turns his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread samuel taylor coleridge the rime of the ancient mariner the breeze the breeze blew into san junipero in the shotgun seat of billy winstons pinto wagon the pinto lurched dangerously from shoulder to centerline the result of billy trying to roll a joint onehanded while balancing a coors tallboy and bopping to the bob marley song that crackled through the stereo we be jammin now mon billy said toasting the breeze with a slosh of the coors the breeze shook his head balefully keep the can down watch the road let me roll the doobie he said sorry breeze billy said im just stoked that were on the road billys admiration for the breeze was boundless the breeze was truly cool a party renaissance man he spent his days at the beach and his nights in a cloud of sinsemilla the breeze could smoke all night polish off a bottle of tequila maintain well enough to drive the forty miles back to pine cove without arousing the suspicion of a single cop and be on the beach by nine the next morning acting as if the term hangover were too abstract to be considered on billy winstons private list of personal heroes the breeze ranked second only to david bowie the breeze twisted the joint lit it and handed it to billy for the first hit what are we celebrating billy croaked trying to hold in the smoke the breeze held up a finger to mark the question while he dug the dionysian book of days an occasion for every party from the pocket of his hawaiian shirt he flipped through the pages until he found the correct date nambian independence day he announced bitchin billy said party down for nambian independence it says the breeze continued that the nambians celebrate their independence by roasting and eating a whole giraffe and drinking a mixture of fermented guava juice and the extract of certain tree frogs that are thought to have magical powers at the height of the celebration all the boys who have come of age are circumcised with a sharp stone maybe we can circumcise a few techies tonight if it gets boring billy said techies was the term the breeze used to refer to the male students of san junipero technical college for the most part they were ultraconservative crewcut youths who were perfectly satisfied with their role as bulk stock to be turned into tools for industrial america by the rigid curricular lathe of san junipero tech to the breeze the techies way of thinking was so foreign that he couldnt even muster a healthy loathing for them they were simply nonentities on the other hand the coeds of sj tech occupied a special place in the breezes heart in fact finding a few moments of blissful escape between the legs of a nubile coed was the only reason he was subjecting himself to a fortymile sojourn in the company of billy winston billy winston was tall painfully thin ugly smelled bad and had a particular talent for saying the wrong thing in almost any situation on top of it all the breeze suspected that billy was gay the idea had been reinforced one night when he dropped in on billy at his job as night desk clerk at the roomsrus motel and found him leafing through a playgirl magazine in breezes business one got used to running across the skeletons in peoples closets if billys skeleton wore womens underwear it didnt really matter homosexuality on billy winston was like acne on a leper the up side of billy winston was that he had a car that ran and would take the breeze anywhere he wanted to go the breezes van was currently being held by some big sur growers as collateral against the forty pounds of sinsemilla buds he had stashed in a suitcase at his trailer the way i see it said billy we hit the mad bull first do a pitcher of margaritas at joses dance a little at the nuked whale and if we dont find any nookie we head back home for a nightcap at the slug lets hit the whale first and see whats shakin the breeze said the nuked whale was san juniperos premier college dance club if the breeze was going to find a coed to cuddle it would be at the whale he had no intention of making the drive with billy back to pine cove for a nightcap at the head of the slug closing up the slug was tantamount to having a losing night and the breeze was through with being a loser tomorrow when he sold the forty pounds of grass he would pocket twenty grand after twenty years blowing up and down the coast living on nickledime deals to make rent the breeze was at last stepping into the winners circle and there was no room for a loser like billy winston billy parked the pinto in a yellow zone a block away from the nuked whale from the sidewalk they could hear the throbbing rhythms of the latest technopop dance music the unlikely pair covered the block in a few seconds billy striding ahead while the breeze brought up the rear with a laidback shuffle as billy slipped under the neon whale tail and into the club the doorman a freshfaced slab of muscle and crew cut caught him by the arm lets see some id billy flashed an expired drivers license as breeze caught up to him and began digging into the pocket of his dayglo green surf shorts for his wallet the doorman raised a hand in dismissal thats okay buddy with that hairline you dont need any the breeze ran his hand over his forehead selfconsciously last month he had turned forty a dubious achievement for a man who had once vowed never to trust anyone over thirty billy reached around him and slapped two dollar bills into the doormans hand here he said buy yourself a night with an inflateadate what the doorman vaulted off his stool and puffed himself up for combat but billy had already scampered away into the crowded club the breeze stepped in front of the doorman and raised his hands in surrender cut him some slack man hes got problems hes going to have some problems the doorman bristled no really the breeze continued wishing that billy had spared him the loyal gesture and therefore the responsibility of pacifying this collegiate cave man hes on medication psychological problems the doorman was unsure if this guy is dangerous get him out of here not dangerous just a little squirrelly hes bipolar oedipal the breeze said with uncharacteristic pomposity oh the doorman said as if it had all become clear well keep him in line or youre both out no problem the breeze turned and joined billy at the bar amid a crunch of beerdrinking students billy handed him a heineken billy said what did you say to that asshole to calm him down i told him you wanted to fuck your mom and kill your dad cool thanks breeze no charge the breeze tipped his beer in salute things were not going well for him somehow he had been snared into this malebonding bullshit with billy winston when all he wanted to do was ditch him and get laid the breeze turned and leaned back scanning the club for a likely candidate he had set his sights on a homely but tightassed little blond in leather pants when billy broke his concentration you got any blow man billy had shouted to be heard over the music but his timing was off the song had ended everyone at the bar turned toward the breeze and waited as if the next few words he spoke would reveal the true meaning of life the winning numbers in the state lottery and the unlisted phone number of god the breeze grabbed billy by the front of the shirt and hustled him to the back of the club where a group of techies were pounding a pinball machine oblivious to anything but buzzers and bells billy looked like a frightened child who had been dragged from a movie theater for shouting out the ending first the breeze hissed waving a trembling finger under billys nose to enumerate his point first i do not use or sell cocaine this was half true he did not sell since he had done six months in soledad for dealing and would go up for five years if he was busted again he used it only when it was offered or when he needed bait when trolling for women tonight he was holding a gram second if i did use i wouldnt want it announced to everybody in san junipero im sorry breeze billy tried to look small and weak third the breeze shook three stubby fingers in billys face we have an agreement if one of us scores the other one gets cut loose well i think i found someone so cut loose billy started to shuffle toward the door head down his lower lip hanging like the bloated victim of a lynch mob after a few steps he turned if you need a ride if things dont work out ill be at the mad bull the breeze as he watched the injured billy skulk away felt a twinge of remorse forget it he thought billy had it coming after the deal tomorrow he wouldnt need billy or any of the quarterounceaweek buyers of his ilk the breeze was eager for the time when he could afford to be without friends he strutted across the dance floor toward the blond in the leather pants having wafted through most of his forty years as a single man the breeze had come to recognize the importance of the pickup line at best it should be original charming concise but lyrical a catalyst to invoke curiosity and lust knowing this he approached his quarry with the calm of a wellarmed man yo babe he said ive got a gram of prime peruvian marching powder you want to go for a walk pardon me the girl said somewhere between astonishment and disgust the breeze noticed that she had a wideeyed fawnlike look bambi with too much mascara he gave her his best surferboy smile i was wondering if youd like to powder your nose youre old enough to be my father she said the breeze was staggered by the rejection as the girl escaped onto the crowded dance floor he fell back to the bar to consider strategy go on to the next one everybody gets tubed now and then you just have to climb back on the board and wait for the next wave he scanned the dance floor looking for a chance at the wild ride nothing but sorority girls with absolutely perfect hair no chance his fantasy of jumping one and using her until her perfect hair was tangled into a hopeless knot at the back of her head had been relegated long ago to the realm of fairy tales and free money the energy in san junipero was all wrong it didnt matter hed be a rich man tomorrow best to catch a ride back to pine cove with luck he could get to the head of the slug saloon before last call and pick up one of the standby bitches who still valued good company and didnt require a hundred bucks worth of blow to get upside down with you as he stepped into the street a chill wind bit at his bare legs and swept through his thin shirt thumbing the forty miles back to pine cove was going to suck big time maybe billy was still at the mad bull no the breeze told himself there are worse things than freezing your ass off he shrugged off the cold and fell into a steady stride toward the highway his new fluorescent yellow deck shoes squeaking with every step they rubbed his little toe when he walked after five blocks he felt the blister break and go raw he cursed himself for becoming another slave to fashion half a mile outside of san junipero the streetlights ended darkness added to the breezes list of mounting aggravations without trees and buildings to break its momentum the cold pacific wind increased and whipped his clothes around him like torn battle flags blood from his damaged toe was beginning to spot the canvas of his deck shoe a mile out of town the breeze abandoned the dancing smiling and tipping of a ghosthat that was supposed to charm drivers into stopping to give a ride to a poor lost surfer now he trudged head down in the dark his back to traffic a single frozen thumb thrust into the air beaconing then changing into a middle finger of defiance as each car passed without slowing fuck you you heartless assholes his throat was sore from screaming he tried to think of the money sweet liberating cash crispy and green but again and again he was brought back to the cold the pain in his feet and the increasingly dismal chance of getting a ride home it was late and the traffic was thinning to a car every five minutes or so hopelessness circled in his mind like a vulture he considered doing the cocaine but the idea of entering a toofast jangle on a lonely dark road and crashing into a paranoid teethchattering shiver seemed somewhat insane think about the money the money it was all billy winstons fault and the guys in big sur they didnt have to take his van it wasnt like he had ever ripped anyone off on a big deal before it wasnt like he was a bad guy hadnt he let robert move into his trailer rent free when his old lady threw him out didnt he help robert put a new head gasket in his truck hadnt he always played square let people try the product before buying didnt he advance his regulars a quarterounce until payday in a business that was supposed to be fast and loose wasnt he a pillar of virtue right as rain straight as an arrow a car pulled up twenty yards behind him and hit the brights he didnt turn years of experience told him that anyone using that approach was only offering a ride to one place the ironbar hotel the breeze walked on as if he didnt notice the car he shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his surf shorts as if fighting the cold found the cocaine and slipped it into his mouth paper and all instantly his tongue went numb he raised his hands in surrender and turned expecting to see the flashing reds and blues of a county sheriff cruiser but it wasnt a cop it was just two guys in an old chevy playing games he could make out their figures past the headlights the breeze swallowed the paper the cocaine had been wrapped in taken by a burning anger fueled by blow and bloodlust he stormed toward the chevy cmon out you fucking clowns someone crawled out of the passenger side it looked like a child no thicker a dwarf the breeze blew on bring a tire iron you little shit youll need it wrong said the dwarf the voice was low and gravely the breeze pulled up and squinted into the headlights it wasnt a dwarf it was a big dude a giant huge getting bigger as it moved toward him too fast the breeze turned and started to run he got three steps before the jaws clamped over his head and shoulders crunching through his bones as if they were peppermint sticks when the chevy pulled back onto the highway the only thing left of the breeze was a single fluorescentyellow deck shoe it would be a fleeting mystery to passersby for two days until a hungry crow carried it away no one would notice that there was still a foot inside part two sunday all mystical experience is coincidence and vice versa of course tom stoppard jumpers pine cove the village of pine cove lay in a coastal pine forest just south of the great big sur wilderness area on a small natural harbor the village was established in the s by a dairy farmer from ohio who found verdant hills around the cove provided perfect fodder for his cows the settlement such as it was two families and a hundred cows went nameless until the s when the whalers came to town and christened it harpooners cove with a cove to shelter their small whaling boats and the hills from which they could sight the migrating gray whales far out to sea the whalers prospered and the village grew for thirty years a greasy haze of death blew overhead from the fivehundredgallon rendering pots where thousands of whales were boiled down to oil when the whale population dwindled and electricity and kerosene became an alternative to whale oil the whalers abandoned harpooners cove leaving behind mountains of whale bone and the rusting hulks of their rendering kettles to this day many of the towns driveways are lined with the bleached arches of whale ribs and even now when the great gray whales pass they rise out of the water a bit and cast a suspicious eye toward the little cove as if expecting the slaughter to begin again after the whalers left the village survived on cattle ranching and the mining of mercury which had been discovered in the nearby hills the mercury ran out about the same time the coastal highway was completed through big sur and harpooners cove became a tourist town passersthrough who wanted a little piece of californias burgeoning tourist industry but didnt want to deal with the stress of life in san francisco or los angeles stopped and built motels souvenir shops restaurants and real estate offices the hills around pine cove were subdivided pine forests and pastures became oceanview lots sold for a song to tourists from californias central valley who wanted to retire on the coast again the village grew populated by retirees and young couples who eschewed the hustle of the city to raise their children in a quiet coastal town harpooners cove became a village of the newly wed and the nearly dead in the s the young environmentally conscious residents decided that the name harpooners cove hearkened back to a time of shame for the village and that the name pine cove was more appropriate to the quaint bucolic image the town had come to depend on and so with the stroke of a pen and the posting of a sign welcome to pine cove gateway to big sur history was whitewashed the business district was confined to an eightblock section of cypress street which ran parallel to the coast highway most of the buildings on cypress sported facades of english tudor halftimbering which made pine cove an anomaly among the coastal communities of california with their predominantly spanishmoorish architecture a few of the original structures still stood and these with their raw timbers and feel of the old west were a thorn in the side of the chamber of commerce who played on the villages english look to promote tourism in a halfassed attempt at thematic consistency several pseudoauthentic ole english restaurants opened along cypress street to lure tourists with the promise of tasteless english cuisine there had even been an attempt by one entrepreneur to establish an authentic english pizza place but the enterprise was abandoned with the realization that boiled pizza lost most of its character pine coves locals avoided patronage of these restaurants with the duplicity of a hindu cattle rancher willing to reap the profits without sampling the product locals dined at the few outoftheway cafes that were content with carving a niche out of the hometown market with good food and service rather than gouging an eye out of the swollen skull of the tourist market with overpriced pretentious charm the shops along cypress street were functional only in that they moved money from the pockets of the tourists into the local economy from the standpoint of the villagers there was nothing of practical use for sale in any of the stores for the tourist immersed in the oblivion of vacation spending cypress street provided a bonanza of curious gifts to prove to the folks back home that they had been somewhere somewhere where they had obviously forgotten that soon they would return home to a mortgage dental bills and an american express bill that would descend at the end of the month like a financial angel of death and they bought they bought effigies of whales and sea otters carved in wood cast in plastic brass or pewter stamped on key chains printed on postcards posters book covers and condoms they bought all sorts of useless junk imprinted with pine cove gateway to big sur from bookmarks to bath soap over the years it became a challenge to the pine cove shopowners to come up with an item so tacky that it would not sell gus brine owner of the local general store suggested once at a chamber of commerce meeting that the merchants without compromising their high standards might put cow manure into jars imprint the label with pine cove gateway to big sur and market it as authentic gray whale feces as often happens with matters of money the irony of brines suggestion was lost a motion was carried a plan was laid and if it had not been for a lack of volunteers to do the actual packaging the shelves of cypress street would have displayed numbered limitededition jars of genuine whale waste the residents of pine cove went about their work of fleecing the tourists with a slow methodical resolve that involved more waiting than activity life in general was slow in pine cove even the wind that came in off the pacific each evening crept slowly through the trees allowing the villagers ample time to bring in wood and stoke their fires against the damp cold in the morning down on cypress street the open signs flipped with a languid disregard for the times posted on the doors some shops opened early some late and some not at all especially if it was a nice day for a walk on the beach it was as if the villagers having found their little bit of peace were waiting for something to happen and it did around midnight on the night that the breeze disappeared every dog in pine cove began barking during the following fifteen minutes shoes were thrown threats were made and the sheriff was called and called again wives were beaten pistols were loaded pillows were pounded and mrs feldsteins thirtytwo cats simultaneously coughed up hairballs on her porch blood pressure went up aspirin was opened and milo tobin the towns evil developer looked out the front window to see his young neighbor rosa cruz in the nude chasing twin pomeranians around her front yard the strain was too much for his chainsmokers heart and he flopped on the floor like a fish and died on another hill van williams the tree surgeon had reached the limit of his patience with his neighbors a family of bornagain dog breeders whose six labrador retrievers barked all night long with or without supernatural provocation with his professionalmodel chain saw he dropped a hundredfoot monterey pine tree on their new dodge evangeline van a few minutes later a family of raccoons who normally roamed the streets of pine cove breaking into garbage cans were taken temporarily with a strange sapience and ignored their normal activities to steal the stereo out of the ruined van and install it in their den that lay in the trunk of a hollow tree an hour after the cacophony began it stopped the dogs had delivered their message and as it goes in cases where dogs warn of coming earthquakes tornadoes or volcanic eruptions the message was completely misconstrued what was left the next morning was a very sleepy grumpy village brimming with lawsuits and insurance claims but without a single clue that something was coming at six that morning a cadre of old men gathered outside the general store to discuss the events of the night before never once letting their ignorance of what had happened interfere with a good bull session a new fourwheeldrive pickup pulled into the small parking lot and augustus brine crawled out jangling his huge key ring as if it were a talisman of power sent down by the janitor god he was a big man sixty years old white haired and bearded with shoulders like a mountain gorilla people alternately compared him to santa claus and the norse god odin morning boys brine grumbled to the old men who gathered behind him as he unlocked the door and let them into the dark interior of brines bait tackle and fine wines as he switched on the lights and started brewing the first two pots of his special secret darkroast coffee brine was assaulted by a salvo of questions gus did you hear the dogs last night we heard a tree went down on your hill you hear anything about it can you brew some decaf doctor says ive got to cut the caffeine bill thinks it was a bitch in heat started the barking but it was all over town did you get any sleep i couldnt get back to sleep brine raised a big paw to signal that he was going to speak and the old men fell silent it was like that every morning brine arrived in the middle of a discussion and was immediately elected to the role of expert and mediator gentlemen the coffees on in regard to the events of last night i must claim ignorance you mean it didnt wake you up jim whatley asked from under the brim of a brooklyn dodgers baseball cap i retired early last night with two lovely teenage bottles of cabernet jim anything that happened after that did so without my knowledge or consent jim was miffed with brines detachment well every goddamn dog in town started barking last night like the end of the world was coming dogs bark brine stated he left off the big deal it was understood from his tone not every dog in town not all at once george thinks its supernatural or something brine raised a white eyebrow toward george peters who stood by the coffee machine sporting a dazzling denture grin and what george leads you to the conclusion that the cause of this disturbance was supernatural woke up with a hardon for the first time in twenty years it got me right up i thought id rolled over on the flashlight i keep by the bed for midnight emergencies how were the batteries georgie someone interjected i tried to wake up the wife whacked her on the leg with it just to get her attention i told her the bear was charging and i have one bullet left and brine filled the pause she told me to put some ice on it to make the swelling go down well brine said stroking his beard that certainly sounds like a supernatural experience to me he turned to the rest of the group and announced his judgment gents i agree with george as with lazarus rising from the dead this unexplained erection is hard evidence of the supernatural at work now if youll excuse me i have cash customers to attend to the last remark was not meant as a dig toward the old men whom brine allowed to drink coffee all day free of charge augustus brine had long ago won their loyalty and it would have been absurd for any one of them to think of going anywhere else to purchase wine or cheese or bait or gasoline even though brines prices were a good thirty percent higher than the thriftymart down the street could the pimplefaced clerks at the thriftymart give advice on which bait was best for rock cod a recipe for an elegant dill sauce for that same fish recommend a fine wine to complement the meal and at the same time ask after the wellbeing of every family member for three generations by name they could not and therein lay the secret of augustus brines ability to run a successful business based entirely on the patronage of locals in an economy catering to tourists brine made his way to the counter where an attractive woman in a waitress apron awaited impatiently worrying a fivedollar bill five dollars worth of unleaded gus she thrust the bill at brine rough night jenny does it show jenny made a show of fixing her shoulderlength auburn hair and smoothing her apron a safe assumption only brine said with a smile that revealed teeth permanently stained by years of coffee and pipe smoke the boys tell me there was a citywide disturbance last night oh the dogs i thought it was just my neighborhood i didnt get to sleep until four in the morning then the phone rang and woke me up i heard about you and robert splitting up brine said did someone send out a newsletter or something weve only been separated a few days irritation put an unattractive rasp in her voice its a small town brine said softly i wasnt trying to be nosy im sorry gus its just the lack of sleep im so tired i was hallucinating on the way down here i thought i heard wayne newton singing what a friend we have in jesus maybe you did the music was coming from a pine tree im telling you ive been a basket case all week brine reached across the counter and patted her hand the only constant in this life is change but that doesnt mean its easy give yourself a break just then vance mcnally the local ambulance driver burst through the door the radio on his belt made a sizzling sound as if hed just stepped out of a deep fryer guess who vapor locked last night he said obviously hoping that no one would know everyone turned and waited for his announcement vance basked in their attention for a moment to confirm his selfimportance milo tobin he said finally the evil developer george asked thats him sometime around midnight we just bagged him vance said to the group then to brine can i get a pack of marlboros the old men searched each others faces for the right reaction to vances news each was waiting for another to say what they were all thinking which was it couldnt have happened to a nicer guy or even good riddance but as they were all aware that vances next rude announcement could be about them they tried to think of something nice to say you dont park in the handicapped space lest the forces of irony give you a reason to and you dont speak ill of the dead unless you want to get bagged next jenny saved them he sure kept that chrysler of his clean didnt he sure did the thing sparkled he kept it like new he did vance smiled at the discomfort he had caused see you boys later he turned to leave and bumped straight into the little man standing behind him excuse me fella vance said no one had seen him come in or had heard the bell over the door he was an arab dark with a long hooked nose and old his skin hung around his piercing grayblue eyes in folds he wore a wrinkled gray flannel suit that was at least two sizes too big a red stocking cap rode high on the back of his bald head his rumpled appearance combined with this diminutive size made him look like a ventriloquists dummy that had spent a long time in a small suitcase the little man brandished a craggy hand under vances nose and let loose with a string of angry arabic that swirled through the air like blue on a damascus blade vance backed out the door jumped into his ambulance and motored away everyone stood stunned by the ferocity of the little mans anger had they really seen blue swirls were the arabs teeth really filed to points were for that moment his eyes glowing whitehot it would never be discussed augustus brine was the first to recover can i help you with something sir the unnatural light in the arabs eyes dimmed and in a humble obsequious manner he said excuse me please but could i trouble you for a small quantity of salt travis travis ohearn was driving a fifteenyearold chevy impala he had bought in la with money the demon had taken from a pimp the demon was standing on the passenger seat with his head out the window panting into the rushing coastal wind with the slobbering exuberance of an irish setter from time to time he pulled his head inside the car looked at travis and sang your mother sucks cocks in heell your mother sucks cocks in heell in a teasing childlike way then he would spin his head around several times for effect they had spent the night in a cheap motel north of san junipero and the demon had tuned the television to a cable channel that played an uncut version of the exorcist it was the demons favorite movie at least travis thought it was better than the last time when the demon had seen the wizard of oz and had spent an entire day pretending to be a flying monkey or screaming and that goes for your little dog too sit still catch travis said im trying to drive the demon had been wired since he had eaten the hitchhiker the night before the guy must have been on cocaine or speed why did drugs affect the demon when poisons did not phase him it was a mystery the demon tapped travis on the shoulder with a long reptilian claw i want to ride on the hood he said his voice was like rusty nails rattling in a can enjoy travis said waving across the dashboard the demon climbed out the window and across the front where he perched like a hood ornament from hell his forked tongue flying in the wind like a stormswept pennon spattering the windshield with saliva travis turned on the wipers and was grateful to find that the chevy was equipped with an interval delay feature it had taken him a full day in los angeles to find a pimp who looked as if he were carrying enough cash to get them a car and another day for the demon to catch the guy in a place isolated enough to eat him travis insisted that the demon eat in private when he was eating he became visible to other people he also tripled in size travis had a recurring nightmare about being asked to explain the eating habits of his traveling companion in the dream travis is walking down the street when a policeman taps him on the shoulder excuse me sir the policeman says travis does a slowmo sam peckenpah turn yes he says the policeman says i dont mean to bother you but that large scaly fellow over there munching on the mayor do you know him the policeman points toward the demon who is biting off the head of a man in a pinstriped polyester suit why yes i do travis says thats catch hes a demon he has to eat someone every couple of days or he gets cranky ive known him for seventy years ill vouch for his lack of character the policeman who has heard it all before says theres a city ordinance against eating an elected official without a permit may i see your permit please im sorry travis says i dont have a permit but ill be glad to get one if youll tell me where to go the cop sighs and begins writing on a ticket pad you can only get a permit from the mayor and your friend seems to be finishing him off now we dont like strangers eating our mayor around here im afraid ill have to cite you travis protests but if i get another ticket theyll cancel my insurance he always wondered about this part of the dream hed never carried insurance the cop ignores him and continues to write out the ticket even in a dream he is only doing his job travis thought it terribly unfair that catch even invaded his dreams sleep at least should provide some escape from the demon who had been with him for seventy years and would be with him forever unless he could find a way to send him back to hell for a man of ninety travis was remarkably well preserved in fact he did not appear to be much over twenty his age when he had called up the demon dark with dark eyes and lean travis had sharp features that would have seemed evil if not for the constant look of confusion he wore as if there were one answer that would make everything in life clear to him if he could only remember the question he had never bargained for the endless days on the road with the demon trying to figure out how to stop the killing sometimes the demon ate daily sometimes he would go for weeks without killing travis had never found a reason a connection or a pattern to it sometimes he could dissuade the demon from killing sometimes he could only steer him toward certain victims when he could he had the demon eat pimps or pushers those that humanity could do without but other times he had to choose vagrants and vagabonds those that would not be missed there was a time when he had cried while sending catch after a hobo or a baglady hed made friends among the homeless when he was riding the rails with the demon back before there were so many automobiles often a bum who didnt know where his next roof or drink was coming from had shared a boxcar and a bottle with travis and travis had learned that there was no evil in being poor poverty merely opened one up to evil but over the years he had learned to push aside the remorse and time and again catch dined on bums he wondered what went through the minds of catchs victims just before they died he had seen them wave their hands before their eyes as if the monster looming before them was an illusion a trick of the light he wondered what would happen now if oncoming drivers could see catch perched on the front of the chevy waving like a parade queen from the black lagoon they would panic swerve off the narrow road and over the oceanside bank windshields would shatter and gasoline would explode and people would die death and the demon were never separated for long coming soon to a town near you travis thought but perhaps this is the last one as a seagull cry dopplered off to traviss left he turned to look out the window over the ocean the morning sun was reflecting off the face of the waves illuminating a sparkling halo of spray for a moment he forgot about catch and drank in the beauty of the scene but when he turned to look at the road again there was the demon standing on the bumper reminding him of his responsibility travis pushed the accelerator to the floor and the impalas engine hesitated then roared as the automatic transmission dropped into passing gear when the speedometer hit sixty he locked up the brakes catch hit the roadway face first and skidded headlong throwing up sparks where his scales scraped the asphalt he bounced off a signpost and into a ditch where he lay for a moment trying to gather his thoughts the impala fishtailed and came to a stop sideways in the road travis slammed the chevy into reverse righted the car then threw it into drive and screeched toward the demon keeping the wheels out of the ditch until the moment of impact the impalas headlights shattered against catchs chest the corner of the bumper caught him in the waist and drove him deep into the mud of the ditch the engine sputtered to a stop and the damaged radiator hissed a rusty cloud of steam into catchs face the drivers side door was jammed against the ditch so travis crawled out the window and ran around the car to see what damage he had done catch was lying in the ditch with the bumper against his chest nice driving aj catch said you going to try for indy next year travis was disappointed he hadnt really expected to hurt catch he knew from experience that the demon was virtually indestructible but he had hoped at least to piss him off just trying to keep you on your toes he said a little test to see how you hold up under stress catch lifted the car crawled out and stood next to travis in the ditch whats the verdict did i pass are you dead nope i feel great then you have failed miserably im sorry but ill have to run you over again not with this car the demon said shaking his head travis surveyed the steam rising from the radiator and wondered whether he might not have been a little hasty in giving way to his anger can you get it out of the ditch piece of cake the demon hoisted the front of the car and began to walk it up onto the berm but youre not going to get far without a new radiator oh youre all of a sudden an expert mechanic mr helpmeicantchangethechannelwhilethemagicfingersison all of a sudden has a degree in automotive diagnostics well what do you think i think theres a town just ahead where we can get it fixed didnt you read that sign you bounced off of it was a dig travis knew the demon couldnt read in fact he often watched subtitled movies with the sound off just to irritate catch whats it say it says pine cove five miles thats where were going i think we can limp the car five miles with a bad radiator if not you can push you run over me and wreck the car and i get to push correct travis said crawling back through the car window at your command master catch said sarcastically travis tried the ignition the car whined and died it wont start get behind and push okay catch said he went around to the back of the car put his shoulder to the bumper and began pushing it the rest of the way out of the ditch but pushing cars is very hungry work robert robert masterson had drunk a gallon of red wine most of a fiveliter coors minikeg and a halfpint of tequila and still the dream came a desert a big bright sandy bastard the sahara he is naked tied to a chair with barbed wire before him is a great canopied bed covered in black satin under the cool shade of the canopy his wife jennifer is making love to a stranger a young muscular darkhaired man tears run down roberts cheeks and crystallize into salt he cannot close his eyes or turn away he tries to scream but every time he opens his mouth a squat lizardlike monster the size of a chimpanzee shoves a saltine cracker into his mouth the heat and the pain in his chest are agonizing the lovers are oblivious to his pain the little reptile man tightens the barbed wire around his chest by twisting a stick every time he sobs the wire cuts deeper the lovers turn to him in slow motion maintaining their embrace they wave to him a big homemovie wave postcard smiles greetings from the heart of anguish awake the dreampain in his chest replaced by a real pain in his head light is the enemy its out there waiting for you to open your eyes no no way thirst brave the light to slake the thirst it must be done he opened his eyes to a dim forgiving light must be cloudy out he looked around pillows full ashtrays empty wine bottles a chair a calendar from the wrong year with a picture of a surfer riding a huge swell pizza boxes this wasnt home he didnt live like this humans dont live like this he was on someones couch where he sat up and waited in vertigo until his brain snapped back into his head which it did with a vengeful impact ah yes he knew where he was this was hangover hangover california pine cove where he was thrown out of the house by his wife heartbreak california jenny call jenny tell her that humans dont live this way no one lives this way except the breeze he was in the breezes trailer he looked around for water there was the kitchen fourteen miles away over there at the end of the couch water was in the kitchen he crawled naked off the couch across the floor of the kitchen to the sink and pulled himself up the faucet was gone or at least buried under a stack of dirty dishes he reached into an opening cautiously searching for the faucet like a diver reaching into an underwater crevice for a moray eel plates skidded down the pile and crashed on the floor he looked at the china shards scattered around his knees and spotted the mirage of a coors minikeg he managed a controlled fall toward the mirage and his hand struck the nozzle it was real salvation hair of the dog in a handy fiveliter disposable package he started to drink from the nozzle and instantly filled his mouth throat sinuses aural cavity and chest hair with foam use a glass jenny would say what are you an animal he must call jenny and apologize as soon as the thirst was gone first a glass dirty dishes were strewn across every horizontal surface in the kitchen the counter stove table breakfast bar and the top of the refrigerator the oven was filled with dirty dishes nobody lives like this he spotted a glass among the miasma the holy grail he grabbed it and filled it with beer mold floated on the settling foam he threw the glass into the oven and slammed the door before an avalanche could gain momentum a clean glass perhaps he checked the cupboard where the dishes had once been kept a single cereal bowl stared out at him from the bottom of the bowl fred flintstone congratulated him good kid youre a cleanplater robert filled the bowl and sat crosslegged on the floor amid the broken dishes while he drank fred flintstone congratulated him three times before his thirst abated good old fred the mans a saint saint fred of bedrock fred how could she do this to me nobody can live like this good kid youre a cleanplater fred said call jenny robert said reminding himself he stood and staggered through the offal toward the phone nausea swept over him and he bounced back through the trailers narrow hallway and fell into the bathroom where he retched into the toilet until he passed out the breeze called it talking to ralph on the big white phone this one was a toll call five minutes later he came to and found the phone it seemed a superhuman effort to hit the right buttons why did they have to keep moving at last he connected and someone answered on the first ring jenny honey im sorry can i thank you for calling pizza on wheels we will open at eleven am and deliveries begin at four pm why cook when robert hung up hed dialed the number written on the phones emergency numbers sticker instead of his home again he chased down the buttons and pegged them one by one it was like shooting skeet you had to lead them a little hello jenny sounded sleepy honey im sorry ill never do it again can i come home robert what time is it he thought for a moment then guessed noon its five in the morning robert ive been asleep about an hour robert there were dogs barking in the neighborhood all night long robert im not ready

with your life okay thats a plan he would clean up this place and clean up his life never drink again things were going to change soon she would remember what a great guy he was but first he had to go to the bathroom to answer an emergency call from ralph the smoke alarm was screaming like a tortured lamb robert now back on the couch pulled a cushion over his head and wondered why the breeze didnt have a sleeper button on his smoke alarm then the pounding started it was a door buzzer not the smoke alarm breeze answer the door robert shouted into the cushion the pounding continued he crawled off the couch and waded through the litter to the door hold on a minute man im coming he threw the door open and caught the man outside with his fist poised for another pounding he was a sharpfaced hispanic in a raw silk suit his hair was slicked back and tied in a ponytail with a black silk ribbon robert could see a flagship model bmw parked in the driveway shit jehovahs witnesses must make a lot of money robert said the hispanic was not amused i need to talk to the breeze at that point robert realized that he was naked and picked an empty gallon wine bottle from the floor to cover his privates come in robert said backing away from the door ill see if hes awake the hispanic stepped in robert stumbled down the narrow hall to the breezes room he knocked on the door breeze theres some big money here to see you no answer he opened the door and went in and searched through the piles of blankets sheets pillows beer cans and wine bottles but found no breeze on the way back to the living room robert grabbed a mildewed towel from the bathroom and wrapped it around his hips the hispanic was standing in the middle of a small clearing peering around the trailer with concentrated disgust it looked to robert as if he were trying to levitate to avoid having his italian shoes contact the filth on the floor hes not here robert said how do you live like this the hispanic said he had no discernible accent this is subhuman man did my mother send you the hispanic ignored the question where is the breeze we had a meeting this morning he put an extra emphasis on the word meeting robert got the message the breeze had been hinting that he had some big deal going down the guy must be the buyer silk suits and bmws were not the usual accouterments of the breezes clientele he left last night i dont know where he went you could check down at the slug the slug head of the slug saloon on cypress he hangs out there sometimes the hispanic tiptoed through the garbage to the door then paused on the step tell him im looking for him he should call me tell him i do not do business this way robert didnt like the commanding tone in the hispanics voice he affected the obsequious tone of an english butler and whom shall i say has called sir dont fuck with me cabron this is business robert took a deep breath then sighed look pancho im hung over my wife just threw me out and my life is not worth shit so if you want me to take messages you can damn well tell me who the fuck you are or should i tell the breeze to look for a mexican with a gucci loafer shoved up his ass comprende pachuco the hispanic turned on the step and started to reach into his suit coat robert felt adrenaline shoot through his body and he tightened his grip on the towel oh yeah he thought pull a gun and ill snap your eyes out with this towel he suddenly felt extremely helpless the hispanic kept his hand in his coat who are you im the breezes decorator were redoing the whole place in an abstract expressionist motif robert wondered if he wasnt really trying to get shot well smart ass when the breeze shows up you tell him to call rivera and you tell him that when the business is done his decorator is mine you understand robert nodded weakly adios dogmeat rivera turned and walked toward the bmw robert closed the door and leaned against it trying to catch his breath the breeze was going to be pissed when he heard about this roberts fear was replaced by selfloathing maybe jenny was right maybe he had no idea how to maintain a relationship with anybody he was worthless and weak and dehydrated he looked around for something to drink and vaguely remembered having done this before déjà vu nobody lives like this it was going to change goddammit as soon as he found his clothes he was going to change it rivera detective sergeant alphonso rivera of the san junipero county sheriffs department sat in the rented bmw and cursed fuck fuck and double fuck then he remembered the transmitter taped to his chest okay cowboys hes not here i should have known the vans been gone for a week call it off in the distance he could hear cars starting two beige plymouths drove by a few seconds later the drivers conspicuously not looking at the bmw as they passed what could have gone wrong three months setting it all up hed gone out on a limb with the captain to convince him that charles l belew aka the breeze was their ticket into the big sur growers business hes gone down twice for cocaine if we pop him for dealing hell give us everything but his favorite recipe to stay out of soledad hes small time the captain had said yeah but he knows everybody and hes hungry best of all he knows hes small time so he thinks we wouldnt bother with him finally the captain had relented and it had been set up rivera could hear him now rivera if you got made by a druggedout loser like belew maybe we should put you back in uniform where your high visibility will be an asset maybe we can put you in pr or recruitment riveras ass was hanging out worse than that drunken jerk in the trailer who was he anyway as far as anyone knew the breeze lived alone but this guy seemed to know something why else would he give rivera such a hard time maybe he could pull this off with the drunk desperate thinking a long shot rivera memorized the license number of the old ford truck parked outside the breezes trailer he would run it through the computer when he got back to the station maybe he could convince the captain that he still had something maybe he did and then again maybe he could just climb a stream of angel piss to heaven rivera sat in the file room of the sheriffs office drinking coffee and watching a videotape after running the license number through the computer rivera found that the pickup belonged to a robert masterson age twentynine born in ohio married to jennifer masterson also twentynine his only prior was a drunkdriving conviction two years ago the video was a record of mastersons breathalyzer test several years ago the department had begun taping all breathalyzer tests to avoid legaldefense strategies based on procedural mistakes made by arresting officers during testing on the television screen a very drunk robert w masterson ft lbs eyes green hair brown was spouting nonsense to two uniformed deputies we work for a common purpose you serve the state with your minds and bodies i serve the state by opposing it drinking is an act of civil disobedience i drink to end world hunger i drink to protest the united states involvement in central america i drink to protest nuclear power i drink a sense of doom descended on rivera as he watched unless the breeze reappeared his career was in the hands of this tightly wound loosely wrapped drunken idiot he wondered what life might be like as a bank security guard on the screen the two officers looked away from their prisoner to the door of the testing room the camera was mounted in the corner and fitted with a wideangle lens to cover anything that happened without having to be adjusted a little arab man in a red stocking cap had come through the door and the deputies were telling him that he had the wrong room and to please leave could i trouble you for a small quantity of salt the little man asked then he blinked off the screen as if the tape had been stopped and he had been edited out rivera rewound the tape and ran it again the second time masterson performed the test without interruption the door did not open and there was no little man rivera ran it back again no little man he must have dozed off while the tape was running his subconscious had continued the tape while he slept inserting the little mans entrance that was the only viable explanation i dont need this shit he said then he ejected the tape and drained his coffee his tenth cup of the day augustus brine he was an old man who fished off the beaches of pine cove and he had gone eightyfour days without catching a fish this however was of little consequence because he owned the general store and made a comfortable enough living to indulge his passions which were fishing and drinking california wines augustus brine was old but he was still strong and vital and a dangerous man in a fight although he had had little cause to prove it in over thirty years except for the few occasions when he picked up a teenage boy by the scruff of the neck and dragged him terrified to the stockroom where he lectured him alternately on the merits of hard work and the folly of shoplifting from brines bait tackle and fine wines and while a weariness had come upon him with age his mind was still sharp and agile on any evening one might find him stretched out before his fireplace in a leather chair toasting his bare feet on the hearth reading aristotle or laotzu or joyce he lived on a hillside overlooking the pacific in a small wooden house he had designed and built himself so that he might live there alone without having his surroundings seem lonely during the day windows and skylights filled the house with light and even on the most dismal foggy day every corner was illuminated in the evening three stone fireplaces which took up whole walls in the living room bedroom and study warmed the house they offered a soft orange comfort to the old man who burned cord after cord of red oak and eucalyptus which he cut and split himself when he considered his own mortality which was seldom augustus brine knew he would die in this house he had built it on one floor with wide halls and doorways so that if he were ever confined to a wheelchair he might remain selfsufficient until the day when he would take the black pill sent to him by the hemlock society he kept the house neat and orderly not so much because he desired order for brine believed chaos to be the way of the world but because he did not wish to make life difficult for his cleaning lady who came in once a week to dust and shovel ashes from the fireplaces he also wished to avoid acquiring the reputation of being a slob for he knew peoples propensity for judging a man on one aspect of his character and even augustus brine was not above some degree of vanity despite his belief that the pursuit of order in a chaotic universe was futile brine lived a very ordered life and this paradox upon reflection amused him he rose each day at five indulged himself in a halfhourlong shower dressed and ate the same breakfast of six eggs and half a loaf of sourdough toast heavily buttered cholesterol seemed too silent and sneaky to be dangerous and brine had decided long ago that until cholesterol gathered its forces and charged him headlong across the plate with light brigade abandon he would ignore it after breakfast brine lit his meerschaum pipe for the first time of the day crawled onto his truck and drove downtown to open his store for the first two hours he puffed around the store like a great whitebearded locomotive making coffee selling pastries trading idle banter with the old men who greeted him each morning and preparing the store to run under full steam until midnight under the supervision of a handful of clerks at eight oclock the first of brines employees arrived to man the register while brine busied himself ordering what he called epicurean necessities pastries imported cheeses and beers pipe tobacco and cigarettes homemade pasta and sauces freshly baked bread gourmet coffees and california wines brine believed like epicurus that a good life was one dedicated to the pursuit of simple pleasures tempered with justice and prudence years ago while working as a bouncer in a whorehouse brine had repeatedly seen depressed angry men turned to gentleness and gaiety by a few moments of pleasure he had vowed then to someday open a brothel but when the ramshackle general store with its two gas pumps had been put up for sale brine had compromised his dream by buying it and bringing pleasure of a different sort to the public from time to time however a needling suspicion arose in his mind that he had missed his true calling as a madam each day when the orders were finished brine selected a bottle of red wine from his shelves packed it in a basket with some bread cheese and bait and took off for the beach he passed the rest of the day sitting on the beach in a canvas directors chair sipping wine and smoking his pipe waiting for the long surfcasting rod to bend with a strike on most days brine let his mind go as clear as water without worry or thought he became one with everything around him neither conscious nor unconscious the state of zen mushin or nomind he had come to zen after the fact recognizing in the writings of suzuki and watts an attitude he had come to without discipline by simply sitting on the beach staring into an empty sky and becoming just as empty zen was his religion and it brought him peace and humor on this particular morning brine was having a difficult time clearing his mind the visit of the little arab man to the store vexed him brine did not speak arabic yet he had understood every word the little man had said he had seen the air cut with swirling blue curses and he had seen the arabs eyes glow white with anger he smoked his pipe the meerschaum mermaid carved so that brines index finger fell across her breasts and tried to apply some meaning to a situation that was outside the context of his reality he knew that if he were to accept the fluid of this experience the cup of his mind had to be empty but right now he had a better chance of buying bread with moonlight than reaching a zen calm it vexed him it is a mystery is it not someone said startled brine looked around the little arab man stood about three feet from brines side drinking from a large styrofoam cup his red stocking cap was glistening damp with the morning spray im sorry brine said i didnt see you come up it is a mystery is it not how this dashing figure seems to appear out of nowhere you must be awestruck paralyzed with fear perhaps brine looked at the withered little man in the rumpled flannel suit and silly red hat very close to paralyzed he said i am augustus brine he extended his hand to the little man are you not afraid that by touching me you will burst into flames is that a danger no but you know how superstitious fishermen are perhaps you believe that you will be transformed into a toad you hide your fear well augustus brine brine smiled he was baffled and amused it didnt occur to him to be afraid the arab drained his cup and dipped it into the surf to refill it please call me gus brine said his hand still extended and you are the arab drained his cup again then took brines hand his skin had the feel of parchment i am gian hen gian king of the djinn ruler of the netherworld do not tremble i wish you no harm i am not trembling brine said you might go easy on that seawater it works hell on your blood pressure do not fall to your knees there is no need to prostrate yourself before my greatness i am here in your service thank you i am honored brine said despite the strange happenings in the store he was having a hard time taking this pompous little man seriously the arab was obviously a nuthouse napoleon hed seen hundreds of them living in cardboard castles and feasting from dumpsters all over america but this one had some credentials he could curse in blue swirls it is good that you are not afraid augustus brine terrible evil is at hand you will have to call upon your courage it is a good sign that you have kept your wits in the presence of the great gian hen gian the grandeur is sometimes too much for weaker men may i offer you some wine brine extended the bottle of cabernet he had brought from the store no i have a great thirst for this he sloshed the cup of seawater from a time when it was all i could drink as you wish brine sipped from the bottle there is little time augustus brine and what i am to tell you may overwhelm your tiny mind please prepare yourself my tiny mind is steeled for anything o king but first tell me did i see you curse blue swirls this morning a minor loss of temper nothing really would you have had me turn the clumsy dolt into a snake who forever gnaws his own tail no the cursing was fine although in vances case the snake might be an improvement your curses were in arabic though right a language i prefer for its music but i dont speak arabic yet i understood you you did say may the irs find that you deduct your pet sheep as an entertainment expense didnt you i can be most colorful and inventive when i am angry the arab flashed a bright grin of pride his teeth were pointed and sawedged like a sharks you have been chosen augustus brine why me somehow brine had suspended his disbelief and denied the absurdity of the situation if there was no order in the universe then why should it be out of order to be sitting on the beach talking to an arab dwarf who claimed to be king of the djinn whatever the hell that was strangely enough brine took comfort in the fact that this experience was invalidating every assumption he had ever made about the nature of the world he had tapped into the zen of ignorance the enlightenment of absurdity gian hen gian laughed i have chosen you because you are a fisherman who catches no fish i have had an affinity for such men since i was fished from the sea a thousand years ago and released from solomons jar one gets ever so cramped passing the centuries inside a jar and ever so wrinkled it would seem brine said gian hen gian ignored brines comment i found you here augustus brine listening to the noise of the universe holding in your heart a spark of hope like all fishermen but resolved to be disappointed you have no love no faith and no purpose you shall be my instrument and in return you shall gain the things you lack brine wanted to protest the arabs judgment but he realized that it was true hed been enlightened for exactly thirty seconds and already he was back on the path of desire and karma postenlightenment depression he thought the djinns story brine said excuse me o king but what exactly is a djinn gian hen gian spit into the surf and cursed but this time brine did not understand the language and no blue swirls cut the air i am djinn the djinn were the first people this was our world long before the first human have you not read the tales of scheherazade i thought those were just stories by aladdins lamplit scrotum man everything is a story what is there but stories stories are the only truth the djinn knew this we had power over our own stories we shaped our world as we wished it to be it was our glory we were created by jehovah as a race of creators and he became jealous of us he sent satan and an army of angels against us we were banished to the netherworld where we could not make our stories then he created a race who could not create and so would stand in awe of the creator man brine asked the djinn nodded when satan drove us into the netherworld he saw our power he saw that he was no more than a servant while jehovah had given the djinn the power of gods he returned to jehovah demanding the same power he proclaimed that he and his army would not serve until they were given the power to create jehovah was sorely angered he banished satan to hell where the angel might have the power he wished but only over his own army of rebels to further humiliate satan jehovah created a new race of beings and gave them control over their own destinies made them masters of their own world and he made satan watch it all from hell these beings were parodies of the angels resembling them physically but with none of the angels grace or intelligence and because he had made two mistakes before jehovah made these creatures mortal to keep them humble are you saying brine interrupted that the human race was created to irritate satan that is correct jehovah is infinite in his snottiness brine reflected on this for a moment and regretted that he had not become a criminal at an early age and what happened to the djinn we were left without form purpose or power the netherworld is timeless and unchanging and boring much like a doctors waiting room but youre here youre not in the netherworld be patient augustus brine i will tell you how i came here you see many years passed on earth and we remained undisturbed then was born solomon the thief you mean king solomon son of david the thief the djinn spat he asked for wisdom from jehovah that he might build a great temple to assist him jehovah gave him a great silver seal which he carried in a scepter and the power to call the djinn from the netherworld to act as slaves solomon was given power over the djinn on earth that by all rights belonged to me and as if that was not enough the seal also gave him the power to call up the deposed angels from hell satan was furious that such power be given to a mortal which of course was jehovahs plan solomon called first upon me to help him build his temple he spread the temple plans before me and i laughed in his face it was little more than a shack of stone his imagination was as limited as his intelligence nevertheless i began work on his temple building it stone by stone as he instructed i could have built it in an instant had he commanded it but the thief could only imagine a temple being built as it might be built by men i worked slowly for even under the reign of the thief my time on earth was better than the emptiness of the netherworld after some time i convinced solomon that i needed help and i was given slaves to assist me in the construction work slowed even more for while some of them worked most stood by and chatted about their dreams of freedom i have seen that such methods are used today in building your highways its standard brine said solomon grew impatient with my progress and called from hell one of the deposed angels a warrior seraph named catch thus did his troubles begin catch had once been a tall and beautiful angel but his time in hell steeping in his own bitterness had changed him when he appeared before solomon he was a squat monster no bigger than a dwarf his skin was like that of a snake his eyes like those of a cat he was so hideous that solomon would not allow him to be seen by the people of jerusalem so he made the demon invisible to all but himself catch carried in his heart a loathing for humans as deep as satan himself i had no quarrel with the race of man catch however wanted revenge fortunately he did not have the powers of a djinn solomon told the slaves who worked on the temple that they were being given divine assistance and that they should behave as if nothing was out of the ordinary so the people of jerusalem might not notice the demons presence the demon threw himself into the construction honing huge blocks of stone and hauling them into place solomon was pleased with the demons work and told him so catch said that the work would go faster if he didnt have to work with a djinn so i stood by and watched as the temple rose from time to time great stones dropped from the walls crushing the slaves below while the blood ran i could hear catch laughing and shouting whoops from the top of the wall solomon believed these killings to be accidents but i knew them to be murder it was then that i realized that solomons control over the demon was not absolute and therefore his control over me must have its limits as well my first impulse was to try to escape but if i were wrong i knew that i would be sent back to the netherworld and all would be lost perhaps i could persuade solomon to set me free by offering him something he could attain only through my power to create solomons appetite for women was infamous i offered to bring him the most beautiful woman he had ever seen if he would allow me to remain on earth he agreed i retreated to my quarters and contemplated what sort of woman might most please the idiot king i had seen his thousand wives and found no common thread among their charms that revealed solomons preferences in the end i was left to my own creativity i gave her fair hair and blue eyes and skin as white and smooth as marble she was all things that men wish of women in body and mind she was a virgin with a courtesans knowledge in the ways of pleasure she was kind intelligent forgiving and warm with humor solomon fell in love with the woman as soon as i presented her to him she shines like a jewel he said jewel shall be her name he spent an hour or more just staring at her captivated with her beauty when finally his senses returned he said we will talk later of your reward gian hen gian then he took jewel by the hand and led her to his bedchamber i felt a strength return to me the moment i presented jewel to the king i was not free to escape but for the first time i was able to leave the city without being compelled by some invisible bond to return to solomon i went into the desert and spent the night enjoying the freedom i had gained it was not until i returned the next morning that i realized that solomons control over me and the demon depended upon the concentration of his will as well as the invocations and the seal given to him by jehovah the woman jewel had broken his will i found solomon in his palace weeping one moment then screaming with rage the next while i had been away catch had come to solomons bedchamber not in the form that solomon recognized but in the form of a huge monster taller than two men and as wide as a team of horses and the slaves could see him as well while solomon watched in horror the demon snatched jewel from the bed with a single talonlike hand and bit her head off then the monster swallowed the girls body and reached for solomon but some force protected the king and solomon commanded the demon to return to his smaller form catch laughed in his face and skulked off to the wives quarters through the night the palace was filled with the screams of terrified women solomon ordered his guards to attack the demon catch swatted them away as if they were flies by dawn the palace was littered with the crushed bodies of the guards of solomons thousand wives only two hundred remained alive catch was gone during the attack solomon had called upon the power of the seal and prayed to jehovah to stop the demon but the kings will was broken and so it did no good i sensed then that i might escape solomons control altogether and live free but even the idiot king would eventually make the connection and my fate would lie in the netherworld i bade solomon allow me to bring catch to justice i knew my power to be much greater than the demons but solomon had only the building of the temple by which to judge my powers and in that example the demon appeared superior do what you can he said if you capture the demon you may remain on earth i found catch in the great desert wantonly slaughtering tribes of nomads when i bound him with my magic he protested that he had planned to return for he was enslaved to solomon by the invocation and could never really escape he was only having a little sport with the humans he said to quiet him i filled his mouth with sand for the journey back to jerusalem when i brought catch to solomon the king commanded me to devise a punishment to torment the demon so that the people of jerusalem might watch him suffer i chained catch to a giant stone outside the palace then i created a huge bird of prey that swooped on the demon and tore at his liver which grew back at once for like the djinn the demon was immortal solomon was pleased with my work during my absence he had regained his senses somewhat and thereby his will i stood before the king awaiting my reward feeling my powers wane as solomons will returned i have promised that you shall never be returned to the netherworld and you shall not he said but this demon has put me off of immortals more than somewhat and i do not wish that you be allowed to roam free you shall be imprisoned in a jar and cast into the sea should the time come when you are set free to walk the earth again you shall have no power over the realm of man except as is commanded by my will which shall be from now to the end of time the goodwill of all men by this you shall be bound he had a jar fashioned from lead and marked it on all sides with a silver seal before he imprisoned me solomon promised that catch would remain chained to the rock until his screams burned into the kings soul so that solomon might never lose his will or his wisdom again he said he would then send the demon back to hell and destroy the tablets with the invocations as well as the great seal he swore these things to me as if he believed the fate of the demon meant something to me i didnt give a camels fart about catch then he gave me a last command and sealed the jar his soldiers cast the jar into the red sea for two thousand years i languished inside the jar my only comfort a trickle of seawater that seeped in which i drank with relish for it tasted of freedom when the jar was finally pulled from the sea by a fisherman and i was released i cared nothing about solomon or catch only about my freedom i have lived as a man would live these last thousand years bound by solomons will of this solomon spoke truly but about the demon he lied the little man paused and refilled his cup in the ocean augustus brine was at a loss it couldnt possibly be true there was nothing to corroborate the story begging your pardon gian hen gian but why is none of this told in the bible editing the djinn said but arent you confusing greek myth with christian myth the birds eating the demons liver sounds an awful lot like the story of prometheus it was my idea the greeks were thieves no better than solomon brine considered this for a moment he was seeing evidence of the supernatural wasnt he wasnt this little arab drinking seawater as he watched with no apparent ill effects and even if some of it could be explained by hallucination he was pretty sure that he hadnt been the only one to see the strange blue swirls in the store this morning what if for a moment just a moment he took the arabs outrageous story for the truth if this is true then how do you know after all this time that solomon lied to you and why tell me about it because augustus brine i knew you would believe and i know solomon lied because i can feel the presence of the demon catch and im sure that he has come to pine cove swell brine said arrival virgil long backed out from under the hood of the impala wiped his hands on his coveralls and scratched at his fourday growth of beard he reminded travis of a fat weasel with the mange so youre thinking its the radiator virgil asked its the radiator travis said it might be the whole engine is gone you were running pretty quiet when you drove in not a good sign do you have a charge card virgil was unprecedented in his inability to diagnose specific engine problems when he was dealing with tourists his strategy was usually to start replacing things and keep replacing them until he solved the problem or reached the limit on the customers credit card whichever came first it wasnt running at all when i came in travis protested and i dont have a credit card its the radiator i promise now son virgil drawled i know you think you know what youre talking about but i got a certificate from the ford factory there on the wall that says im a master mechanic virgil pointed a fat finger toward the service stations office one wall was covered with framed certificates along with a poster of a nude woman sitting on the hood of a corvette buffing her private parts with a scarf in order to sell motor oil virgil had purchased the master mechanic certificates from an outfit in new hampshire two for five dollars six for ten dollars fifteen for twenty he had gone for the twentydollar package those who took the time to read the certificates were somewhat surprised to find out that pine coves only service station and car wash had its own factorycertified snowmobile mechanic it had never snowed in pine cove this is a chevy travis said got a certificate for those too you probably need new rings the radiators just a symptom like these broken headlights you treat the symptom the disease just gets worse virgil had heard that on a doctor show once and liked the sound of it what will it cost to just fix the radiator virgil stared deep into the grease spots on the garage floor as if by reading their patterns and by some mystic mode of divination petrolmancy perhaps he would arrive at a price that would not alienate the dark young man but would still assure him an exorbitant hourly rate for his labor hundred bucks it had a nice round ring to it fine travis said fix it when can i have it back virgil consulted the grease spots again then emerged with a goodolboy smile hows noon sound fine travis said is there a pool hall around here and someplace i can get some breakfast no pool hall the head of the slug is open down the street they got a couple of tables and breakfast only thing open this end of town is hps a block off cypress down from the slug but its a locals joint is there a problem getting served no the menu might throw you for a bit it well youll see travis thanked the mechanic and started off in the direction of hps the demon skulking along behind him as they passed the selfserve carwash stalls travis noticed a tall man of about thirty unloading plastic laundry baskets full of dirty dishes from the bed of an old ford pickup he seemed to be having trouble getting quarters to go into the coin box looking at him travis said you know catch ill bet theres a lot of incest in this town probably the only entertainment the demon agreed the man in the car wash had activated the highpressure nozzle and was sweeping it back and forth across the baskets of dishes with each sweep he repeated nobody lives like this nobody some of the overspray caught on the wind and settled over travis and catch for a moment the demon became visible in the spray im melting catch whined in perfect wicked witch of the west pitch lets go travis said moving quickly to avoid more spray we need a hundred bucks before noon jenny in the two hours since jenny masterson had arrived at the cafe she had managed to drop a tray full of glasses mix up the orders on three tables fill the saltshakers with sugar and the sugar dispensers with salt and pour hot coffee on the hands of two customers who had covered their cups to indicate that theyd had enough a patently stupid gesture on their part she thought the worst of it was not that she normally performed her duties flawlessly which she did the worst of it was that everyone was so damned understanding about it youre going through a rough time honey its okay divorce is always hard their consolations ranged from too bad you couldnt work it out to he was a worthless drunk anyway youre better off without him shed been separated from robert exactly four days and everybody in pine cove knew about it and they couldnt just let it lie why didnt they let her go through the process without running this cloying gauntlet of sympathy it was as if she had a big red d sewed to her clothing a signal to the townsfolk to close around her like a hungry amoeba when the second tray of glasses hit the floor she stood amid the shards trying to catch her breath and could not she had to do something scream cry pass out but she just stood there paralyzed while the busboy cleaned up the glass two bony hands closed on her shoulders she heard a voice in her ear that seemed to come from very far away you are having an anxiety attack dear it shall pass relax and breathe deeply she felt the hands gently leading her through the kitchen door to the office in the back sit down and put your head between your knees she let herself be guided into a chair her mind went white and her breath caught in her throat a bony hand rubbed her back breathe jennifer ill not have you shuffling off this mortal coil in the middle of the breakfast shift in a moment her head cleared and she looked up to see howard phillips the owner of hps standing over her he was a tall skeletal man who always wore a black suit and button shoes that had been fashionable a hundred years ago except for the dark depressions on his cheeks howards skin was as white as a carrion worm robert had once said that hp looked like the master of ceremonies at a chemotherapy funfest howard had been born and raised in maine yet when he spoke he affected the accent of an erudite londoner the prospect of change is a manyfanged beast my dear it is not however appropriate to pay fearful obeisance to that beast by cowering in the ruins of my stemware while you have orders up im sorry howard robert called this morning he sounded so helpless pathetic a tragedy to be sure yet as we sit ensconced in our grief two perfectly healthy daily specials languish under the heat lamps metamorphosing into gelatinous invitations to botulism jenny was relieved that in his own cryptically charming way howard was not giving her sympathy but telling her to get off her ass and live her life i think im okay now thanks howard jenny stood and wiped her eyes with a paper napkin she took from her apron then she went off to deliver her orders howard having exhausted his compassion for the day closed the door of his office and began working on the books when jenny returned to the floor she found that the restaurant had cleared except for a few regular customers and a dark young man she didnt recognize who was standing by the please wait to be seated sign at least he wouldnt ask about robert thank god it was a welcome relief not many tourists found hps it was tucked in a treelined culdesac off cypress street in a remodeled victorian bungalow the sign outside small and tasteful simply read cafe howard did not believe in advertising and though he was an anglophile at heart loving all things british and feeling that they were somehow superior to their american counterparts his restaurant displayed none of the ersatz british decor that might draw in the tourists the cafe served simple food at fair prices if the menu exhibited howard phillipss eccentricity in style it did not discourage the locals from eating at his place next to brines bait tackle and fine wines hps cafe had the most loyal clientele in pine cove smoking or nonsmoking jenny asked the young man he was very goodlooking but jenny noticed this only in passing she was conditioned by years of monogamy not to dwell on such things nonsmoking he said jenny led him to a table in the back before he sat down he pulled out the chair across from him as if he were going to put his feet up will someone be joining you jenny asked handing him a menu he looked up at her as if he were seeing her for the first time he stared into her eyes without saying a word embarrassed jenny looked down todays special is eggssothoth a fiendishly toothsome amalgamation of scrumptious ingredients so delicious that the mere description of the palatable gestalt could drive one mad she said youre joking no the owner insists that we memorize the daily specials verbatim the dark man kept staring at her what does all that mean he asked scrambled eggs with ham and cheese and a side of toast why didnt you just say that the owner is a little eccentric he believes that his daily specials may be the only thing keeping the old ones at bay the old ones jenny sighed the nice thing about regular customers is she didnt have to keep explaining howards weird menu to them this guy was obviously from out of town but why did he have to keep staring at her like that its his religion or something he believes that the world was once populated by another race he calls them the old ones for some reason they were banished from earth but he believes that they are trying to return and take over youre joking stop saying that im not joking im sorry he looked at the menu okay give me an eggssothoth with a side order of the spuds of madness would you like coffee that would be great jenny wrote out the ticket and turned to put the order in at the kitchen window excuse me the man said jenny turned in midstep yes you have incredible eyes thanks she felt herself blush as she headed off to get his coffee she wasnt ready for this she needed some sort of break between being married and being divorced divorce leave they had pregnancy leave didnt they when she returned with his coffee she looked at him for the first time as a single woman might he was handsome in a sharp dark sort of way he looked younger than she was twentythree maybe twentyfour she was studying his clothes and trying to get a feel for what he did for a living when she ran into the chair he had pushed out from the table and spilled most of the coffee into the saucer god im sorry its okay he said are you having a bad day getting worse by the minute ill get you another cup no he raised a hand in protest its fine he took the cup and saucer from her separated them and poured the coffee back into the cup see good as new i dont want to add to your bad day he was staring again no youre fine i mean im fine thanks she felt like a geek she cursed robert for causing all this if he hadnt no it wasnt roberts fault shed made the decision to end the marriage im travis the man extended his hand she took it tentatively jennifer she was about to tell him that she was married and that he was nice and all im not married she said she immediately wanted to disappear into the kitchen and never come back me either travis said im new in town he didnt seem to notice how awkward she was look jennifer im looking for an address and i wonder if you could tell me how to find it do you know how to get to cheshire street jenny was relieved to be talking about anything but herself she rattled off a series of streets and turns landmarks and signs that would lead travis to cheshire street when she finished he just looked at her quizzically ill draw you a map she said she took a pen from her apron bent over the table and began drawing on a napkin their faces were inches apart youre very beautiful he said she looked at him she didnt know whether to smile or scream not yet she thought im not ready he didnt wait for her to respond you remind me of someone i used to know thank you she tried to remember his name travis have dinner with me tonight she searched for an excuse none came she couldnt use the one she had used for a decade it wasnt true anymore and she hadnt been alone long enough to brush up on some new lies in fact she felt that she was somehow being unfaithful to robert just by talking to this guy but she was a single woman finally she wrote her phone number under the map on the napkin and handed it to him my numbers on the bottom why dont you call me tonight around five and well take it from there okay travis folded the napkin and put it in his shirt pocket until tonight he said oh spare me a gravely voice said jenny turned toward the voice but there was only the empty chair to travis she said did you hear that hear what travis glared at the empty chair nothing jenny said im starting to go over the edge i think relax travis said i wont bite you he shot a glance at the chair your order is up ill be right back she retrieved the food from the window and delivered it to travis while he ate she stood behind the counter separating coffee filters for the lunch shift occasionally looking up and smiling at the dark young man who paused between bites and smiled back she was fine just fine she was a single woman and could do any damned thing she wanted to she could go out with anyone she wanted to she was young and attractive and she had just made her first date in ten years sort of over all of her affirmations her fears flew up and perched like a murder of crows it occurred to her that she didnt have the slightest idea what she was going to wear the freedom of single life had suddenly become a burden a mixed blessing herpes on the popes ring maybe she wouldnt answer the phone when he called travis finished eating and paid his bill leaving her far too large a tip see you tonight he said you bet she smiled she watched him walk across the parking lot he seemed to be talking to someone as he walked probably just singing guys did that right after they made a date didnt they maybe he was just a whacko for the hundredth time that morning she resisted the urge to call robert and tell him to come home robert robert loaded the last of the laundry baskets full of dishes into the bed of the pickup the sight of a truckload of clean dishes did not raise his spirits nearly as much as he thought it would he was still depressed he was still heartbroken and he was still hung over for a moment he thought that washing the dishes might have been a mistake having created a single bright spot no matter how small seemed to make the rest of his life look even more dismal by contrast maybe he should have just gone with the downward flow like the pilot who pushes down the stick to pull out of an uncontrolled spin secretly robert believed that if things got so bad that he couldnt see his way out something would come along and not only save him from disaster but improve his life overall it was a skewed brand of faith that he had developed through years of watching television where no problem was so great that it could not be surmounted by the last commercial break and through two events in his own life as a boy in ohio he had taken his first summer job at the local county fair picking up trash on the midways the job had been great fun for the first two weeks he and the other boys on the cleanup crew spent their days wandering the midways using long sticks with nails extending from one end to spear paper cups and hot dog wrappers as if they were hunting lions on the serengeti they were paid in cash at the end of each day the next day they spent their pay on games of chance and repeated rides on the zipper which was the beginning of roberts lifelong habit of exchanging money for dizziness and nausea the day after the fair ended robert and the boys were told to report to the livestock area of the fairgrounds they arrived before dawn wondering what they would do now that the colorful carny trailers and rides were gone and the midways were as barren as airport runways the man from the county met them outside the big exhibition barns with a dump truck a pile of pitchforks and some wheelbarrows clean out those pens boys load the manure on the truck he had said then he went away leaving the boys unsupervised robert had loaded only three forkfuls when he and the boys ran out of the barn gasping for breath the odor of ammonia burning in their noses and lungs again and again they tried to clean the stables only to be overcome by the stench as they stood outside the barn swearing and complaining robert noticed something sticking up out of the morning fog on the adjacent show ground it looked like the head of a dragon it was beginning to get light and the boys could hear banging and clanging and strange animal noises coming from the show ground they stared into the fog trying to make out the shapes moving there glad for the distraction from their miserable task when the sun broke over the trees to the east of the fairgrounds a scraggly man in blue work clothes walked out of the mist toward the barn hey you kids he shouted and they all prepared to be admonished for standing around instead of working you want to work for the circus the boys dropped their pitchforks as if they were redhot rods of steel and ran to the man the dragon had been a camel the strange noises were the trumpeting of elephants under the mist a crew of men were unrolling the big top of the clyde beatty circus robert and the boys worked all morning beside the circus people lacing together the brightyellow canvas panels of the tent and fitting together giant sections of aluminum poles that would support the big top it was hot sweaty heavy work and it was wonderful and exciting when the poles lay out across the canvas cables were hitched to a team of elephants and the poles were hoisted skyward robert thought his heart would burst with excitement the canvas was connected by cables to a winch the boys watched in awe as the big top rose up the poles like a great yellow dream it was only one day but it was glorious and robert thought of it often of the roustabouts who sipped from their hip flasks and called each other by the names of their home states or towns kansas bring that strut over here new york we need a sledge over here robert thought of the thickthighed women who walked the wire and flew on the trapeze their heavy makeup was grotesque up close but beautiful at a distance when they were flying through the air above the crowd that day was an adventure and a dream it was one of the finest in roberts life but what had impressed him was that it had come right when things seemed the most bleak when everything had gone literally to shit the next time roberts life took a nosedive he was in santa barbara and his salvation arrived in the form of a woman he had come to california with everything he owned packed into a volkswagen beetle determined to pursue a dream that he thought would begin at the california border with music by the beach boys and a long white beach full of shapely blondes dying for the company of a young photographer from ohio what he found was alienation and poverty robert had chosen the prestigious photography school in santa barbara because it was reputed to be the best as photographer for the high school yearbook he had gained a reputation as one of the best photographers in town but in santa barbara he was just another teenager among hundreds of students who were if anything more skilled than he he took a job in a grocery store stocking shelves from midnight to eight in the morning he had to work fulltime to pay his exorbitant tuition and rent and soon he fell behind in his assignments after two months he had to leave school to avoid flunking out he found himself in a strange town with no friends and barely enough money to survive he started drinking beer every morning with the night crew in the parking lot he drove home in a stupor and slept through the day until his next shift with the added expense of alcohol robert had to hock his cameras to pay rent and with them went his last hope for a future beyond stocking shelves one morning after his shift the manager called him into the office do you know anything about this the manager pointed to four jars of peanut butter that lay open on his desk these were returned by customers yesterday on the smooth surface of the peanut butter in each jar was etched help im trapped in supermarket hell robert stocked the glass aisle there was no denying it he had written the messages one night during his shift after drinking several bottles of cough medicine he had stolen from the shelves pick up your check on friday the manager said he shuffled away broke unemployed two thousand miles from home a failure at nineteen as he left the store one of the cashiers a pretty redhead about his age who was coming in to open the store stopped him your name is robert isnt it yes he said youre the photographer arent you i was robert was in no mood to chat well i hope you dont mind she said but i saw your portfolio sitting in the break room one morning and i looked at it youre very good i dont do it anymore oh thats too bad i have a friend whos getting married on saturday and she needs a photographer look robert said i appreciate the thought but i just got fired and im going home to get hammered besides i hocked my cameras the girl smiled she had incredible blue eyes you were wasting your talent here how much would it cost to get your cameras out of hock her name was jennifer she paid to get his cameras out of hock and showered him with praise and encouragement robert began to make money picking up weddings and bar mitzvahs but it wasnt enough to make rent there were too many good photographers competing in santa barbara he moved into her tiny studio apartment after a few months of living together they were married and they moved north to pine cove where robert would find less competition for photography jobs once again robert had sunk to a lifetime low and once again dame fate had provided him with a miraculous rescue the sharp edges of roberts world were rounded by jennifers love and dedication life had been good until now roberts world was dropping out from under him like a trapdoor and he found himself in a disoriented freefall trying to control things by design would only delay his inevitable rescue the sooner he hit bottom he reasoned the sooner his life would improve each time this had happened before things had gotten a little worse only to get a little better one day the good times had to keep on rolling and all of lifes horseshit would turn to circuses robert had faith that it would happen but to rise from the ashes you had to crash and burn first with that in mind he took his last ten dollars and headed down the street to the head of the slug saloon the head of the slug mavis sand the owner of the head of the slug saloon had lived so long with the specter of death hanging over her shoulders that she had started to think of him as one might regard a comfortable old sweater she had made her peace with death a long time ago and death in return had agreed to whittle away at mavis rather than take her all at once in her seventy years death had taken her right lung her gall bladder her appendix and the lenses of both eyes complete with cataracts death had her aortic heart valve and mavis had in its place a steel and plastic gizmo that opened and closed like the automatic doors at the thrifty mart death had most of maviss hair and mavis had a polyester wig that irritated her scalp she had also lost most of her hearing all of her teeth and her complete collection of liberty dimes although she suspected a neerdowell nephew rather than death in the disappearance of the dimes thirty years ago she had lost her uterus but that was at a time when doctors were yanking them so frequently that it seemed as if they were competing for a prize so she didnt blame death for that with the loss of her uterus mavis grew a mustache that she shaved every morning before leaving to open the saloon at the slug she ambled around behind the bar on a pair of stainless steel ball and sockets as death had taken her hips but not before she had offered them up to a legion of cowboys and construction workers over the years death had taken so much of mavis that when her time finally came to pass into the next world she felt it would be like slipping slowly into a steaminghot bath she was afraid of nothing when robert walked into the head of the slug mavis was perched on her stool behind the bar smoking a taryton extralong lording over the saloon like the quintessential queen of the lipstick lizards after each few drags on her cigarette she applied a thick paste of fireenginered lipstick actually getting a large percentage of it where it was supposed to go each time she butted a taryton she sprayed her abysmal cleavage and behind her ears with a shot of midnight seduction from an atomizer she kept by her ashtray on occasion when she had rendered herself wobbly by too many shots of bushmills she would shoot perfume directly into one of her hearing aids causing a short circuit and making the act of ordering drinks a screaming ordeal to avoid the problem someone had once given her a pair of earrings fashioned from cardboard air fresheners shaped like christmas trees guaranteed to give mavis that new car smell but mavis insisted that it was midnight seduction or nothing so the earrings hung on the wall in a place of honor next to the plaque listing the winners of the annual head of the slug eightball tournament and chili cookoff known locally as the slugfest robert stood by the bar trying to get his eyes to adjust to the smoky darkness of the slug what can i get for you sweet cheeks mavis asked batting her false eyelashes behind popbottlethick rhinestonerimmed glasses they put robert in mind of spiders trying to escape a jar he fingered the tendollar bill in his pocket and climbed onto the bar stool a draft please hair of the dog does it show robert asked in earnest not much i was just going to ask you to close your eyes before you bled to death mavis giggled like a coquettish gargoyle then burst into a coughing fit she drew a mug of beer and set it in front of robert taking his ten and replacing it with nine ones robert took a long pull from the beer as he turned on the stool and looked around the bar mavis kept the bar dimly lit except for the lights over the pool tables and roberts eyes were still adjusting to the darkness it occurred to him that he had never seen the floor of the saloon which stuck to his shoes when he walked except for the occasional crunch underfoot identifying a piece of popcorn or a peanut shell the floor of the slug was a murky mystery whatever was down there should be left alone to evolve white and eyeless in peace he promised himself to make it to the door before he passed out he squinted into the lights over the pool tables there was a heated eightball match going on at the back table a half dozen locals had gathered at the end of the bar to watch society called them the hardcore unemployed mavis called them the daytime regulars on the table slick mccall was playing a dark young man robert did not recognize the man seemed familiar though and for some reason robert found that he did not like him whos the stranger robert asked mavis over his shoulder something about the young mans aquiline good looks repelled robert like biting down on tin foil with a filling new meat for slick mavis said came in about fifteen minutes ago and wanted to play for money shoots a pretty lame stick if you ask me slick is keeping his cue behind the bar until the money gets big enough robert watched the wiry slick mccall move around the table stopping to drill a solid ball into the side pocket with a bar cue slick left himself without a following shot he stood and ran his fingers over his greasedback brown hair he said shit snookered myself slick was on the hustle the phone rang and mavis picked it up den of iniquity den mother speaking no he aint here just a minute she covered the mouthpiece and turned to robert you seen the breeze whos calling into the phone whos calling mavis listened for a moment then covered the mouthpiece again its his landlord hes out of town robert said hell be back soon mavis conveyed the message and hung up the phone rang again immediately mavis answered garden of eden snake speaking there was a pause what am i his answering service pause hes out of town hell be back soon why dont you guys take a social risk and call him at home pause yeah hes here mavis shot a glance at robert you want to talk to him okay she hung up that for the breeze robert asked mavis lit a taryton he got popular all of a sudden who was it didnt ask sounded mexican asked about you shit robert said mavis set him up with another draft he turned to watch the game the stranger had won he was collecting five dollars from slick guess you showed me pard slick said you gonna give a chance to win my money back double or nothing the stranger said fine ill rack em slick pushed the quarters into the coin slot on the side of the pool table the balls dropped into the gutter and slick began racking them slick was wearing a redandblue polkadotted polyester shirt with long pointed collars that had been fashionable around the time that disco died about the same time that slick had stopped brushing his teeth robert guessed slick wore a perpetual brown and broken grin a grin that was burned into the memories of countless tourists who had strayed into the slug to be fleeced at the end of slicks intrepid cue the stranger reared back and broke his stick made the sickly vibrato sound of a miscue the cue ball rocketed down the table barely grazing the rack then bounced off two corner rails and made a beeline toward the corner pocket where the stranger stood sorry brother slick said chalking his cue and preparing to shoot the scratch when it reached the corner pocket the cue ball stopped dead on the lip almost as an afterthought one of the solid balls moved out of the pack and fell into the opposite corner with a plop damn slick said that was some pretty fancy english i thought youd scratched for sure was that a solid the stranger asked mavis leaned over the bar and whispered to robert did you see that ball stop it should have been a scratch maybe theres a piece of chalk on the table that stopped it robert speculated the stranger made two more balls in an unremarkable fashion then called a straightin shot on the three ball when he shot the cue ball curved off his stick describing a cshaped curve and sunk the six ball in the opposite corner i said the three ball the stranger shouted i know you did slick said looks like you were a little heavy on the english my shot the stranger seemed to be angry at someone but it wasnt slick how can you confuse the six with the three you idiot you got me said slick dont be so hard on yourself pard youre up one game already slick ran four balls then missed a shot that was so obvious it made robert wince slicks hustles were usually more subtle five in the side the stranger shouted got that five i got it slick said and all these folks got it along with half the people out in the street you dont need to yell pard this is just a friendly game the stranger bent over the table and shot the five ball careened off the cue ball headed for the rail then changed its path and curved into the side pocket robert was amazed as were all the observers it was an impossible shot yet they all had seen it damn slick said to no one in particular then to mavis mavis when was the last time you leveled this table yesterday slick well it sure as shit went catywumpus fast give me my cue mavis mavis waddled to the end of the bar and pulled out a threefootlong black leather case she handled it carefully and presented it to slick with reverence a decrepit lady of the lake presenting a hardwood excaliber to the rightful king slick flipped the case open and screwed the cue together never taking his eyes off the stranger at the sight of the cue the stranger smiled slick smiled back the game was defined two hustlers recognized each other a tacit agreement passed between them lets cut the bullshit and play robert had become so engrossed in watching the tension between the two men and trying to figure out why the stranger angered him so that he failed to notice that someone had slipped onto the stool next to him then she spoke how are you robert her voice was deep and throaty she placed her hand on his arm and gave it a sympathetic squeeze robert turned and was taken aback by her appearance she always affected him that way she affected most men that way she was wearing a black body stocking belted at the waist with wide leather in which she had tucked a multitude of chiffon scarves that danced around her hips when she walked like diaphanous ghosts of salome her wrists were adorned with layers of silver bangles her nails were sculptured long and lacquered black her eyes were wide and green set far apart over a small straight nose and full lips glossed blood red her hair hung to her waist blueblack an inverted silver pentagram dangled between her breasts on a silver chain im miserable robert said thanks for asking ms henderson my friends call me rachel okay im miserable ms henderson rachel was thirtyfive but she could have passed for twenty if it werent for the arrogant sensuality with which she moved and the mocking smile in her eyes that evinced experience confidence and guile beyond any twentyyearold her body did not betray her age it was her manner she went through men like water robert had known her for years but her presence never failed to awaken in him a feeling that his marital fidelity was nothing more than an absurd notion in retrospect perhaps it was still she made him feel uneasy im not your enemy robert no matter what you think jenny has been thinking about leaving you for a long time we didnt have anything to do with it how are things with the coven robert asked sarcastically its not a coven the pagan vegetarians for peace are dedicated to earth consciousness both spiritual and physical robert drained his fifth beer and slammed the mug down on the bar the pagan vegetarians for peace are a group of bitter ballbiting man haters dedicated to breaking up marriages and turning men into toads thats not true and you know it what i know robert said is that within a year of joining every woman in your coven has divorced her husband i was against jenny getting into this mumbo jumbo from the beginning i told her you would brainwash her and you have rachel reared back on the bar stool like a hissing cat you believe what you want to believe robert i show women the goddess within i put them in touch with their own personal power what they do with it is their own business we arent against men men just cant stand to see a woman discover herself maybe if youd exalted jennys growth instead of criticizing shed still be around robert turned away from her and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror behind the bar he was overcome by a wave of selfloathing she was right he covered his face with his hands and leaned forward on the bar look i didnt come here to fight with you rachel said i saw your truck outside and i thought you might be able to use a little money i have some work for you it might take your mind off the hurt what robert said through his hands were sponsoring the annual tofu sculpture contest at the park this year we need someone to take pictures for the poster and the press package i know youre broke robert no he said without looking up fine suit yourself rachel slid off the stood and started to leave mavis sat another beer in front of robert and counted his money on the bar very smooth she said youve got four bucks left to your name robert looked up rachel was almost to the door rachel she turned and waited an elegant hand on an exquisite hip im staying at the breezes trailer he told her the phone number call me okay rachel smiled okay robert ill call she turned to walk out robert called out to her again you havent seen the breeze have you rachel grimaced robert just being in the same room with the breeze makes me want to take a bath in bleach come on hes a fun guy hes a fungus rachel said but have you seen him no thanks he said call me i will she turned and walked out when she opened the door light spilling in blinded robert when his vision returned a little man in a red stocking cap was sitting next to him he hadnt seen him come in to mavis the little man said could i trouble you for a small quantity of salt how about a margarita with extra salt handsome mavis batted her spiderlashes yes that will be good thank you robert looked the little man over for a moment then turned away to watch the pool game while he contemplated his destiny maybe this job for rachel was his way out strange though things didnt seem to be bad enough yet and the idea that rachel could be his fairy godmother in disguise made him smile no the downward spiral to salvation was going quite nicely the breeze was missing the rent was due he had made enemies with a crazed mexican drug dealer and it was driving him nuts trying to figure out where he had seen the stranger at the pool table the game was still going strong slick was running the balls with machinelike precision when he did miss the stranger cleared the table with a series of impossible erratic curving shots while the crowd watched with their jaws hanging and slick broke into a nervous sweat slick mccall had been the undisputed king of eight ball at the head of the slug saloon since before it had been called the head of the slug the bar had been the head of the wolf for fifty years until mavis grew tired of the protests of drunken environmentalists who insisted that timber wolves were an endangered species and that the saloon was somehow sanctioning their killing one day she had taken the stuffed wolf head that hung over the bar to the salvation army and had a local artist render a giant slug head in fiberglass to replace it then she changed the sign and waited for some halfwit from the save the slugs society to show up and protest it never happened in business as in politics the public is ever so tolerant of those who slime years ago slick and mavis had come to a mutually beneficial business agreement mavis allowed slick to make his living on her pool table and in return slick agreed to pay her twenty percent of his winnings and to excuse himself from the slugs annual eightball tournament robert had been coming into the slug for seven years and in that time he had never seen slick rattled over a pool game slick was rattled now occasionally some tourist who had won the sheeps penis kansas nineball tournament would come into the slug puffed up like the omnipotent god of the green felt and slick would return him to earth deflating his ego with gentle pokes from his custommade ivoryinlaid cue but those fellows played within the known laws of physics the dark stranger played as if newton had been dropped on his head at birth to his credit slick played his usual methodical game but robert could tell that he was afraid when the stranger sank the eight ball in a hundreddollar game slicks fear turned to anger and he threw his custom cue across the room like a crazed zulu goddammit boy i dont know how youre doing it but no one can shoot like that slick was screaming into the strangers face his fists were balled at his sides back off the stranger said all the boyishness drained from his face he could have been a thousand years old carved in stone his eyes were locked on slicks the game is over he might have been stating that water is wet it was truth it was deadly serious slick reached into the pocket of his jeans fished out a handful of crumpled twenties and threw them on the table the stranger picked up the bills and walked out slick retrieved his stick and began taking it apart the daytime regulars remained silent allowing slick to gather his dignity that was like a fucking bad dream he said to the onlookers the comment hit robert like a sock full of birdshot he suddenly remembered where he had seen the stranger the dream of the desert came back to him with crippling clarity he turned back to his beer stunned you want a margarita mavis asked him she was holding a baseball bat she had pulled from under the bar when things had heated up at the pool table robert looked to the stool next to him the little man was gone he saw that guy make one shot and ran out of here like his ass was on fire mavis said robert picked up the margarita and downed its frozen contents in one gulp giving himself an instant headache outside on the street travis and catch headed toward the service station well maybe you should learn to shoot pool if youre going to get money this way maybe you could pay attention when i call a shot i didnt hear you i dont understand why we just dont steal our money i dont like to steal you stole from the pimp in la that was okay whats the difference stealing is immoral and cheating at pool isnt i didnt cheat i just had an unfair advantage he had a custommade pool cue i had you to push the balls in i dont understand morality thats not surprising i dont think you understand it either we have to pick up the car where are we going to see an old friend you say that everywhere we go this is the last one sure be quiet people are looking youre trying to be tricky whats morality its the difference between what is right and what you can rationalize must be a human thing exactly augustus brine augustus brine sat in one of his highbacked leather chairs massaging his temples trying to formulate a plan of action rather than answers the question why me repeated in his mind like a perplexing mantra despite his size strength and a lifetime of learning augustus brine felt small weak and stupid why me a few minutes before gian hen gian had rushed into the house babbling in arabic like a madman when brine finally calmed him down the genie had told him he had found the demon you must find the dark one he must have the seal of solomon you must find him now the genie was sitting in the chair across from brine munching potato chips and watching a videotape of a marx brothers movie the genie insisted that brine take some sort of action but he had no suggestions on how to proceed brine examined the options and found them wanting he could call the police tell them that a genie had told him that an invisible maneating demon had invaded pine cove and spend the rest of his life under sedation not good or he could find the dark one insist that he send the demon back to hell and be eaten by the demon not good or he could find the dark one sneak around hoping that he wasnt noticed by an invisible demon that could be anywhere steal the seal and send the demon back to hell himself but probably get eaten in the process also not good of course he could deny that he believed the story deny that he had seen gian hen gian drink enough saltwater to kill a battalion deny the existence of the supernatural altogether open an impudent little bottle of merlot and sit by his fireplace drinking wine while a demon from hell ate his neighbors but he did believe it and that option too was not good for now he decided to rub his temples and think why me the genie would be no help at all without a master he was as powerless as brine himself without the seal and invocation he could have no master brine had run through the more obvious courses of action with gian hen gian to have each doomed in succession no he could not kill the demon he was immortal no he could not kill the dark one he was under the protection of the demon and killing him if it were possible might release the demon to his own will to attempt an exorcism would be silly the genie reasoned would some mingy prelate be able to override the power of solomon perhaps they could separate the demon from his keeper somehow force the dark one to send the demon back brine started to ask gian hen gian if it was feasible but stopped himself tears were coursing down the genies face whats the matter brine asked gian hen gian kept his eyes trained on the television screen where harpo marx was pulling a collection of objects from his coat objects obviously too large to be stored there it has been so long since i have seen one of my own kind this one who does not speak i do not recognize him but he is djinn what magic brine considered for a moment the possibility that harpo marx might have been one of the djinn then berated himself for even thinking about it too much had happened today that was outside the frame of his experience and it had opened him up to thinking that anything was possible if he werent careful he would lose his sense of judgment completely youve been here a thousand years and youve never seen a movie before brine asked what is a movie slowly and gently augustus brine explained to the king of the djinn about the illusion created by motion pictures when he finished he felt like he had just raped the tooth fairy in front of a class of kindergartners then i am alone still the genie said not completely yes the genie said eager to leave the moment behind but what are you going to do about catch augustus brine effrom effrom elliot awoke that morning eagerly anticipating his nap hed been dreaming about women about a time when he had hair and choices he hadnt slept well some barking dogs had awakened him during the night and he wished he could sleep in but as soon as the sun broke through his bedroom window he was wide awake without a hope of getting back to sleep and recapturing his dream until nap time it had been that way since he had retired twentyfive years ago as soon as his life had eased so that he might sleep in his body would not let him he crept from bed and dressed in the halflight of the bedroom putting on corduroys and a wool flannel shirt the wife had laid out for him he put on his slippers and tiptoed out of the bedroom palming the door shut so as not to wake the wife then he remembered that the wife was gone to monterey or was it santa barbara anyway she wasnt home still he continued his morning routine with the usual stealth in the kitchen he put on the water for his morning cup of decaf outside the kitchen window the hummingbirds were already hovering up to the feeder stopping for drinks of red sugar water on their route through the wifes fuchias and honeysuckle he thought of the hummingbirds as the wifes pets they moved too fast for his tastes he had seen a nature show on television that said that their metabolism was so fast that they might not even be able to see humans the whole world had gone the way of the hummingbirds as far as effrom was concerned everything and everybody was too fast and sometimes he felt invisible he couldnt drive anymore the last time he had tried the police had stopped him for obstructing traffic he had told the cop to stop and smell the flowers he told the cop that he had been driving since before the cop was a glimmer in his daddys eye it had been the wrong approach the policeman took his license the wife did all the driving now imagine it when he had taught her to drive he had to keep grabbing the wheel to keep her from putting the model t into the ditch what would the snotnosed cop say about that the water was beginning to boil on the stove effrom rummaged through the old tin bread box and found the package of chocolatecovered graham crackers the wife had left for him in the cupboard the jar of sanka sat next to the real coffee why not the wife was gone why not live a little he took the regular coffee from the shelf and set about finding the filters and filter holder he hadnt the slightest idea where they were kept the wife took care of that sort of thing he finally found the filters the holder and the serving carafe on the shelf below he poured some coffee into the filter eyeballed it and poured in some more then he poured the water over the grounds the coffee came through strong and black as the kaisers heart he poured himself a cup and there was still a little left in the carafe no sense wasting it he opened the kitchen window and after fumbling with the lid for a moment poured the remaining coffee into the hummingbird feeder live a little boys he wondered if the coffee might not speed them up to the point where they just burnt up in the atmosphere he toyed with the idea of watching for a while then he remembered that his exercise show was about to start he picked up his graham crackers and coffee and headed for the living room and his big easy chair in front of the rca he made sure the sound was turned down then turned on the old console set when the picture came on a young blond woman in iridescent tights was leading three other young women through a series of stretches effrom guessed that there was music playing from the way they moved but he always watched with the sound turned off so as not to wake the wife since he had discovered his exercise program the women in his dreams all wore iridescent tights the girls were all on their backs now waving their legs in the air effrom munched his graham crackers and watched in fascination time was when a man had to spend the better part of a weeks pay to see a show like that now you could get it on cable for only well the wife took care of the cable bill but he guessed that it was pretty cheap life was grand effrom considered going out to his workshop and getting his cigarettes a smoke would go good right now after all the wife was gone why should he sneak around in his own house no the wife would know and when she confronted him she wouldnt yell she would just look at him she would get that sad look in her blue eyes and she would say oh effrom thats all oh effrom and he would feel as if he had betrayed her nope he could wait until his show was over and go smoke in his workshop where the wife would never dare to set foot suddenly the house felt very empty it was like a great vacant warehouse where the slightest noise rattles in the rafters a presence was missing he never saw the wife until she knocked on his workshop door at noon to call him to lunch but somehow he felt her absence as if the insulation had been ripped from around him leaving him raw to the elements for the first time in a long time effrom felt afraid the wife was coming back but maybe someday she would be gone forever someday he would really be alone he wished for a moment that he would die first then thinking of the wife alone knocking on the workshop door from which he would never emerge made him feel selfish and ashamed he tried to concentrate on the exercise show but found no solace in spandex tights he rose and turned off the tv he went to the kitchen and put his coffee in the sink outside the window the hummingbirds went about their business shimmering in the morning sun a sense of urgency came over him it became suddenly very important to get to his workshop and finish his latest carving time seemed as fleeting and fragile as the little birds in his younger days he might have met the feeling with a naive denial of his own mortality age had given him a different defense and his thoughts returned to the image of he and the wife going to bed together and never waking their lives and memories going out all at once this too he knew was a naive fantasy when the wife got home he was going to give her hell for going away he knew that for sure before unlocking his workshop he set the alarm on his watch to go off at lunchtime if he worked through lunch he might miss his nap there was no sense in wasting the day just because the wife was out of town when the knock came on his workshop door effrom thought at first that the wife had come home early to surprise him with lunch he ground out his cigarette in an empty toolbox that he kept for that purpose he blew the last lungful of smoke into the exhaust fan he had installed to take out the sawdust coming just a minute he said he revved up one of his highspeed polishing tools for effect the knocking continued and effrom realized that it was not coming from the inside door that the wife usually knocked on but from the one leading out into the front yard probably jehovahs witnesses he climbed down from his stool checked the pockets of his corduroys for quarters and found one if you bought a watchtower from them they would go away but if they caught you without spare change they would be on you like soulsaving terriers effrom threw the door open and the young man outside jumped back he was dressed in a black sweatshirt and jeans rather casual effrom thought for someone carrying the formal invitation to the end of the world are you effrom elliot he asked i am effrom said he held out his quarter thanks for stopping by but im busy so you can just give me my watchtower and ill read it later mr elliot im not a jehovahs witness well i have all the insurance i can afford but if you leave me your card ill give it to the wife is your wife still alive mr elliot of course shes alive what did you think i was going to tape your business card to her tombstone son youre not cut out to be a salesman you should get an honest job im not a salesman mr elliot im an old friend of your wifes i need to talk to her its very important she aint home your wifes name is amanda right thats right but dont you try any of your sneaky tricks you aint no friend of the wife or id know you and we got a vacuum cleaner thatd suck the hide off a bear so go away effrom started to close the door no please mr elliot i really need to speak to your wife she aint home when will she be home shes coming home tomorrow but im warning you son shes even tougher than i am on flimflam men mean as a snake youd be best to just pack up your carpetbag and go look for honest work you were a world war one veteran werent you i was what of it thank you mr elliot ill be back tomorrow dont bother thank you mr elliot effrom slammed the door his angina wrenched his chest like a scaly talon he tried to breathe deeply while he fingered a nitroglycerin pill from his shirt pocket he popped it into his mouth and it dissolved on his tongue immediately in a few seconds the pain in his chest subsided maybe he would skip lunch today go right to his nap why the wife kept sending in those cards about insurance was beyond him didnt she know that no salesman will call was one of the three great lies he resolved again to give her hell when she got home when travis got back into the car he tried to hide his excitement from the demon he fought the urge to shout eureka to pound on the steering wheel to sing hallelujah at the top of his lungs it might finally be coming to an end he wouldnt let himself think about it it was only a long shot but he felt closer than he ever had to being free of the demon so hows your old friend catch said sarcastically they had played this scene literally thousands of times travis tried to assume the same attitude he always had when faced with those failures hes fine travis said he asked about you he started the car and pulled away from the curb slowly the old chevys engine sputtered and tried to die then caught he did yeah he couldnt understand why your mother didnt eat her young i didnt have a mother do you think shed claim you catch grinned your mother wet herself before i finished her the anger came sliding back over the years travis shut off the engine get out and push he said then he waited sometimes the demon would do exactly what he said and other times catch laughed at him travis had never been able to figure out the inconsistency no catch said do it the demon opened the car door lovely girl youre going out with tonight travis dont even think about it the demon licked his chops think what get out catch got out travis left the chevy in drive when the car started moving travis could hear the demons clawed feet cutting furrows in the asphalt just one more day maybe he tried to think of the girl jenny and it occurred to him that he was the only man he had ever heard of who had waited until he was in his nineties before going on his first date he didnt have the slightest idea why he had asked her out something about her eyes there was something there that reminded him of happiness his own happiness travis smiled jennifer when jennifer arrived home from work the phone was ringing she ran to the phone then stopped with her hand on the receiver checked her watch and decided to let the answering machine get it it was too early to be travis the machine clicked and began its message jennifer cringed as she heard roberts voice on the answer tape youve reached the studios of photography in the pines please leave your name and number at the tone the machine beeped and roberts voice continued honey pick up if youre there im so sorry i need to come home i dont have any clean underwear are you there pick up jenny im so lonely call me okay im still at the breezes when you get in the machine cut him off jennifer ran the tape back and listened to the other messages there were nine others all from robert all whining drunken pleading for forgiveness promising changes that would never happen jenny reset the machine on the message pad next to the phone she wrote change message on machine there was a list of notes to herself clean beer out of refrigerator pack up darkroom separate records tapes books all were designed to wash reminders of robert out of her life right now though she needed to wash the residue of eight hours of restaurant work off her body robert used to grab her and kiss her as she came in the door the smell of grease drives me mad hed say jenny went to the bathroom to run her bath she opened various bottles and poured them into the water essential algae revitalizes the skin all natural its from france the clerk had said with import as if the french had mastered the secret of bathwater along with the elements of rudeness a dash of amino extract all vegetable protein in an absorbable form makes stretch marks as smooth as if youd spackled them the clerk had said hed been a drywall man moonlighting at the cosmetic counter and was not yet versed in the nomenclature of beauty two capfuls of herbal honesty a fragrant mix of organically grown herbs harvested by the loving hands of spiritually enlightened descendants of the mayans and last a squeeze of female e vitamin e oil and dong quai root extract to bring out the goddess in every woman rachel had given her the female e at the last meeting of the pagan vegetarians for peace when jenny had consulted the group about divorcing robert youre just a little yanged out rachel had said try some of this when jenny finished adding all the ingredients the water was the soft translucent green of cheese mold it would have come as a great surprise to jennifer that two hundred miles north in the laboratories of the stanford primordial slime research building some graduate students were combining the very same ingredients albeit under scientific names in a climatecontrolled vat in an attempt to replicate the original conditions in which life had first evolved on earth it would have further surprised her that if she had turned on a sunlamp in the bathroom the last element needed her bath water would have stood up and said howdy immediately qualifying her for the nobel prize and millions in grant money while jennifers chance at scientific immortality bubbled away in the tub she counted her tips fortyseven dollars and thirtytwo cents worth of change and dollar bills into a gallon jar then marked the total into a logbook on her dresser it wasnt much but it was enough her tips and wages provided enough to make the house payment pay utilities buy food and keep her toyota and roberts truck in marginal running order she made enough to keep alive roberts illusion that he was making it as a professional photographer what little he made on the occasional wedding or senior portrait went into film and equipment or for the most part wine robert seemed to think that the key to his creativity was a corkscrew keeping roberts photography business buoyant was jennifers rationalization for putting her own life on hold and wasting her time working as a waitress it seemed that she had always been on hold waiting for her life to start in school they told her if she worked hard and got good grades she would get into a good college hold please then there had been robert work hard be patient the photography will take off and well have a life shed hitched herself to that dream and put her life on hold once again and she had kept pumping energy into the dream long after it had died in robert it happened one morning after robert had been up drinking all night she had found him in front of the television with empty wine bottles lined up in front of him like tombstones dont you have a wedding to shoot today im not going to do it i dont feel up to it she had gone over the edge screaming at him kicking wine bottles around the room and finally storming out right then she resolved to start her life she was almost thirty and shed be damned if shed spend the rest of her life as the grieving widow of someone elses dream she asked him to leave that afternoon then called a lawyer now that her life had finally started she had no idea what she was going to do slipping into the tub she realized she was in fact nothing more than a waitress and a wife once again she fought the urge to call robert and ask him to come home not because she loved him the love had worn so thin it was hard to perceive but because he was her purpose her direction and most important her excuse for being mediocre sitting in the safety of her bathroom she found she was afraid this morning pine cove had seemed like a sweatbox closing in on her and cutting off her breath now pine cove and the world seemed a very large and hostile place it would be easy to slip under the warm water and never come up escape it wasnt a serious consideration just a momentary fantasy she was stronger than that things werent hopeless just difficult concentrate on the positive she told herself there was this guy travis he seemed nice he was very goodlooking too everything is fine this is not an end its a beginning her paltry attempt at positive thinking suddenly dissolved into a whole agenda of firstdate fears which somehow seemed more comfortable than the limitless possibilities of positive thinking because she had been through them before she took a bar of deodorant soap from the soap dish lost her grip and dropped it into the water the splash covered the faint death gasp the water let out as the soaps toxic chemicals hit it part three sunday night millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen both when we wake and when we sleep john milton nightfall overall the village of pine cove was in a cranky mood no one had slept well saturday night through most of sunday the weekend tourists were finding ugly chips in pine coves veneer of smalltown charm shopkeepers had been abrupt and sarcastic when asked the usual inane questions about whales and sea otters waiters and waitresses lost their tolerance for complaints about the unpalatable english food they served and either snapped at their customers outright or intentionally gave them bad service motel desk clerks indulged themselves by arbitrarily changing checkout times refusing reservations and turning on the no vacancy signs every time someone pulled up to the office proclaiming that they had just filled their last room rosa cruz who was a chambermaid at the roomsrus motel slipped sanitized for your protection bands across all the toilets without even lifting the lids that afternoon when a guest protested and she was called on the carpet by the manager who stood over the toilet in room pointing to a floating turd as if it were a smoking murder weapon rosa said well i sanitized that too it might have been declared tourist abuse day in pine cove for all the injustices that were inflicted on unsuspecting travelers as far as the locals were concerned the world would be a better place if every tourist decided to hang bugeyed and bluetongued by his camera strap from a motel shower rod as the day wore into evening and the tourists vacated the streets the residents of pine cove turned to each other to vent their irritability at the slug mavis sand who was stocking her bar for the evening and who was a keen observer of social behavior had watched the tension grow in her customers and herself all afternoon she must have told the story of slick mccalls eightball match with the dark stranger thirty times mavis usually enjoyed the telling and retelling of the events that occurred in the head of the slug even to the point of keeping a microcassette recorder under the bar to save some of her better versions she allowed the tales to grow into myths and legends as she replaced truths forgotten with details fabricated often a tale that started out as a onebeer anecdote would become in the retelling a threebeer epic for mavis let no glass go dry when she was telling a story storytelling for mavis was just good business but today people had been impatient they wanted mavis to draw a beer and get to the point they questioned her credibility denied the facts and all but called her a liar the story was too fantastic to be taken at face value mavis lost her patience with those who asked about the incident and they did ask news travels fast in a small town if you dont want to know what happened dont ask mavis snapped what did they expect slick mccall was an institution a hero in his own greasy way the story of his defeat should be an epic not an obituary even that goodlooking fellow who owned the general store had rushed her through the story what was his name asbestos wine no augustus brine that was it now there was a man she could spend some time under but he too had been impatient and had rushed out of the bar without even buying a drink it had pissed her off mavis watched her own mood changes like the needle on a barometer given her current crankiness the social climate in the slug tonight would be stormy she predicted fights the liquor she stocked into the well that evening was diluted to half strength with distilled water if people were going to get drunk and break up her place it was going to cost them in her heart of hearts she hoped she would get an opportunity to whack someone with her baseball bat augustus as darkness fell on pine cove that evening augustus brine was filled with an uncharacteristic feeling of dread in the past he had always seen sunset as a promise a beginning as a young man sunset had been a call to romance and excitement more recently it signaled a time of rest and contemplation tonight it was not sunset the promise but sundown the threat with nightfall the full weight of his responsibility fell across his back like a leaden yoke and try as he might brine could not shrug it off gian hen gian had convinced him that he must find the one that commanded the demon brine had driven to the head of the slug and after enduring a barrage of lewd advances from mavis sand he was able to pry out of her the direction the dark stranger had gone when he left the bar virgil long the mechanic gave him a description of the car and tried to convince him that his truck needed a tuneup brine had then returned home to discuss a course of action with the king of the djinn who was engrossed in his fourth marx brothers movie but how did you know he was coming here brine asked it was a feeling then why cant you get a feeling of where he is now you must find him augustus brine and do what get the seal of solomon and send catch back to hell or get eaten yes there is that possibility why dont you do it he cant hurt you if the dark one has the seal of solomon then i too could become his slave this would not be good you must do it the biggest problem for brine was that pine cove was small enough that he could actually search the entire town in los angles or san francisco he might have been able to give up before starting open a bottle of wine and let the mass of humanity bear the responsibility while he sank into a peaceful fog of nonaction brine had come to pine cove to avoid conflict to pursue a life of simple pleasures to meditate and find peace and oneness with all things now forced to act he realized how deluded he had become life was action and there was no peace this side of the grave he had read about the kendo swordsman who affected the zen of controlled spontaneity never anticipating a move so that he might never have to correct his strategy to an unanticipated attack but always ready to act brine had removed himself from the flow of action built his life into a fortress of comfort and safety without realizing that his fortress was also a prison think long and hard on your fate augustus brine the djinn said around a mouthful of potato chips your neighbors pay for this time with their lives brine pushed himself out of the chair and stormed into his study he riffled through the drawers of the desk until he found a street map of pine cove he spread the map out on the desk and began to divide the village into blocks with a red marker gian hen gian came into the study while he worked what will you do find the demon brine said through gritted teeth and when you find him i dont know you are a good man augustus brine you are a pain in the ass gian hen gian brine gathered up the map and headed out of the room if it be so then so be it the djinn shouted after him but i am a grand pain in the ass augustus brine did not answer he was already making his way to his truck he drove off feeling quite alone and afraid robert augustus brine was not alone in his feeling of dread at the onset of evening robert returned at sunset to the breezes trailer to find three threatening messages on the answering machine two from the landlord and one ominous threat from the drug dealer in the bmw robert played the tape back three times in hope of finding a message from jennifer but it was not there he had failed miserably in his attempt to crash and burn at the slug running out of money long before passing out the job offer from rachel wasnt enough either thinking it over nothing would really be enough he was a loser plain and simple no one was going to rescue him this time and he wasnt up to pulling himself up by his own bootstraps he had to see jenny she would understand but he couldnt go looking like this a threeday growth of beard clothes he had slept in reeking of sweat and beer he stripped off his clothes and walked into the bathroom he took some shaving cream and a razor from the medicine cabinet and stepped into the shower maybe if he showed up looking like he had some selfrespect she would take him back she had to be missing him right and he wasnt sure he could spend another night alone thinking about it going though the nightmare he turned on the shower and the breath jumped from his body the water was ice cold the breeze hadnt paid the gas bill robert steeled himself to endure the cold shower he had to look good if he was going to rebuild his life then the lights went out rivera rivera was sitting in a coffee shop near the police station sipping from a cup of decaf smoking a cigarette waiting in his fifteen years on the force he estimated that ten of them had been spent in waiting for once though he had the warrants the budget the manpower and probable cause but he had no suspect it had to go down tomorrow one way or another if the breeze showed up then rivera was in line for a promotion if however he had gotten wind of the sting then rivera would take down the drunk in the trailer and hope that he knew something it was a dismal prospect rivera envisioned his task force swooping in with sirens blaring lights flashing only to chalk up a bust for unsafe vehicle perhaps unlawful copying of a videotape or tearing the tag off a mattress rivera shivered at the thought and ground out his cigarette in the ashtray he wondered if they would let him smoke when he was working behind the counter at seveneleven the breeze when the jaws of the demon had clamped down on him the breeze felt a moment of pain then a lightheadedness and a floating feeling he had come to associate with certain kinds of hallucinogenic mushrooms then he looked down to see the monster stuffing his body into its gaping mouth it looked funny and the ethereal breeze giggled to himself no this was more like the feeling of nitrous oxide than mushrooms he thought he watched the monster shrink and disappear then the door to the old chevy opened and closed the car sped off and the breeze felt himself bouncing on the air currents in its wake death was fine with the breeze sort of the ultimate acid trip only cheaper and with no side effects suddenly he found himself in a long tunnel at the end he saw a bright light he had seen a movie about this once you were supposed to go toward the light time had lost meaning for the breeze he floated down the tunnel for a whole day but to him it seemed only minutes he was just riding the buzz everything was copacetic as he approached the light he could make out the figures of people waiting for him thats right your family and friends welcome you to the next life the breeze prepared himself for a truly bitchin party on the astral plane coming out of the tunnel the breeze was enveloped by an intense white light it was warm and comforting the peoples faces came into view and as the breeze floated up to them he realized that he owed every one of them money predators while night fell on some like a curtain of foreboding others were meeting the advent of darkness with excited anticipation creatures of the night were rising from their resting places and venturing forth to feed on their unsuspecting victims they were feeding machines armed with tooth and claw instinctively driven to seek out their prey gifted with stealth and night vision perfectly adapted to the hunt when they stalked the streets of pine cove no ones garbage cans were safe when they awakened that evening they found a curious machine in their den the supernatural sentience they had experienced the night before had passed and they retained no memory of having stolen the tape player they might have been frightened by the noise but the battery had long since run down they would push the machine out of the den when they returned but now there was a scent on the wind that drove them to the hunt with urgent hunger two blocks away mrs eddleman had discarded a particularly gamey tunafish salad and their acute olfactory systems had picked up the scent even while they slept the raccoons bounded into the night like wolves on the fold jennifer for jenny evening came as a mix of blessing and curses the call from travis had come at five as promised and she found herself elated at being wanted but also thrown into a quandary about what to wear how to behave and where to go travis had left it up to her she was a local and knew the best places to go he had said and he was right he had even asked her to drive as soon as she had hung up she ran to the garage for the shop vac to clean out her car while she cleaned she ran possibilities through her mind should she pick the most expensive restaurant no that might scare him away there was a romantic italian place south of town but what if he got the wrong idea pizza was too informal for a dinner date burgers were out of the question she was a vegetarian english food no why punish the guy she found herself resenting travis for making her decide finally she opted for the italian place when the car was clean she returned to the house to pick out what she would wear she dressed and undressed seven times in the next half hour and finally decided on a sleeveless black dress and heels she posed before the fulllength mirror the black dress definitely was the best and if she splashed marinara sauce on it the stain wouldnt show she looked good the heels showed off her calves nicely but you could also see the lightred hair on her legs she hadnt thought about it until now she rummaged through her drawers found some black panty hose and slipped them on that problem taken care of she resumed her posing affecting the bored pouty look she had seen on fashion models in magazines she was thin and fairly tall and her legs were tight and muscular from waiting tables pretty nice for a thirtyyearold broad she thought then she raised her arms and stretched languidly two curly tufts of armpit hair stared at her from the mirror it was natural unpretentious she thought she had stopped shaving about the same time she had stopped eating meat it was all part of getting in touch with herself of getting connected to the earth it was a way to show that she did not conform to the female ideal created by hollywood and madison avenue that she was a natural woman did the goddess shave her armpits she did not but the goddess was not going out on her first date in over ten years jenny suddenly realized how unaware she had become of her appearance in the last few years not that she had let herself go but the changes she had made away from makeup and complicated hairstyles had been so slow she had hardly noticed and robert hadnt seemed to notice or at least he had not objected but that was the past robert was in the past or he would be soon she went to the bathroom in search of a razor billy winston billy winston had no such dilemma about shaving he did his legs and underarms as a matter of course every time he showered the idea of conforming to a diet softdrink ideal of the perfect woman didnt bother him in the least on the contrary billy felt compromised by the fact that he had to maintain his appearance as a sixfootthreeinch tall man with a protruding adams apple in order to keep his job as night auditor at the roomsrus motel in his heart billy was a buxom blond vixen named roxanne but roxanne had to stay in the closet until billy finished doing the motels books until midnight when the rest of the staff left the motel and billy was alone on the desk only then could roxanne dance through the night on her silicon chip slippers stroking the libidos of lonely men and breaking hearts when the iron tongue of midnight told twelve the sex fairy would find her online lovers until then she was billy winston and billy winston was getting ready to go to work he slipped the red silk panties and garter belt over his long thin legs then slowly worked the black seamed stockings up teasing himself in the fulllength mirror at the end of the bed he smiled coyly at himself as he clipped the garters into place then he put on his jeans and flannel shirt and laced up his tennis shoes over his shirt pocket he pinned his name badge billy winston night auditor it was a sad irony billy thought that the thing he loved most being roxanne depended on the thing he liked least his job each evening he awoke feeling a mix of excitement and dread oh well a joint would get him through the first three hours of his shift and roxanne would get him through the last five he dreamed of the day when he could afford his own computer and become roxanne anytime he wanted he would quit his job and make his living like the breeze fast and loose just a few more months behind the desk and he would have the money he needed catch catch was a demon of the twentyseventh order in the hierarchy of hell this put him far below the archdemons like mammon master of avarice but far above the bluecollar demons like arrrgg who was responsible for leeching the styrofoam taste into takeout coffee catch had been created as a servant and a destroyer and endowed with a simplemindedness that suited those roles his distinction in hell was that he had spent more time on earth than any other demon where in the company of men he had learned to be devious and ambitious his ambition took the form of looking for a master who would allow him to indulge himself in destruction and terror of all the masters that catch had served since solomon travis had been the worst travis had an irritating streak of righteousness that grated on catchs nerves in the past catch had been called up by devious men who limited the demons destruction only to keep his presence secret from other men most of the time this was accomplished by the death of all witnesses catch always made sure that there were witnesses with travis catchs need for destruction was controlled and allowed to build inside him until travis was forced to unleash him always it was someone travis had chosen always it was in private and it was never enough for catchs appetite serving under travis his mind always seemed foggy and the fire inside him confined to a smolder only when travis directed him toward a victim did he feel crispness in his thoughts and a blazing in his nature the times were too few the demon longed again for a master with enemies but his thoughts were never clear enough to devise a plan to find one traviss will was overpowering but today the demon had felt a release it had started when travis met the woman in the cafe when they went to the old mans house he felt a power surge through him unlike anything he had felt in years again when travis called the girl the power had increased he began to remember what he was a creature who had brought kings and popes to power and in turn had usurped others satan himself sitting on his throne in the great city of pandemonium had spoken to a multitude of hellish hosts in our exile we must be beholden unto jehovah for two things one that we exist and two that catch has no ambition the fallen angels laughed with catch at the joke for that was a time before catch had walked among men men had been a bad influence on catch he would have a new master one who could be corrupted by his power he had seen her that afternoon in the saloon and sensed her hunger for control over others together they would rule the world the key was near he felt it if travis found it catch would be sent back to hell he had to find it first and get it into the hands of the witch after all it was better to rule on earth than to serve in hell dinner travis parked the chevy on the street in front of jennys house he turned off the engine and turned to catch you stay here you understand ill be back in a little while to check on you thanks dad dont play the radio and dont beep the horn just wait i promise ill be good the demon attempted an innocent grin and failed keep an eye on that travis pointed to an aluminum suitcase on the backseat enjoy your date the car will be fine whats wrong with you nothing catch grinned why are you being so nice its good to see you getting out youre lying travis im crushed that would be nice travis said now dont eat anybody i just ate last night i dont even feel hungry ill just sit here and meditate travis reached into the inside pocket of his sport coat and pulled out a comic book i got this for you he held it out to the demon you can look at it while you wait the demon fumbled the comic book away from travis and spread it out on the seat cookie monster my favorite thanks travis see you later travis got out of the car and slammed the door catch watched him walk across the yard i already looked at this one asshole he hissed to himself when i get a new master i will tear your arms off and eat them while you watch travis looked back over his shoulder catch waved him on with his best effort at a smile the doorbell rang precisely at seven jennys reactions went like this dont answer it change clothes answer it and feign sickness clean the house redecorate schedule plastic surgery change hair color take a handful of valium appeal to the goddess for divine intervention stand here and explore the possibilities of paralyzing panic she opened the door and smiled hi travis stood there in jeans and a gray herringbone tweed jacket he was transfixed travis jenny said youre beautiful he said finally they stood in the doorway jenny blushing travis staring jenny had decided to stick with the black dress evidently it had been the right choice a full minute passed without a word between them would you like to come in no okay she shut the door in his face well that hadnt been so bad now she could put on some sweatpants load the refrigerator onto a tray and settle down for a night in front of the television there was a timid knock on the door jenny opened it again sorry im a little nervous she said its all right travis said shall we go sure ill get my purse she closed the door in his face there was an uncomfortable silence between them while they drove to the restaurant typically this would be the time for trading life stories but jenny had resolved not to talk about her marriage which closed most of her adult life to conversation and travis had resolved not to talk about the demon which eliminated most of the twentieth century so jenny said do you like italian food yep travis said they drove in silence the rest of the way to the restaurant it was a warm night and the toyota had no air conditioning jenny didnt dare roll down the window and risk blowing her hair she had spent an hour styling and pinning it back so that it fell in long curls to the middle of her back when she began to perspire she remembered that she still had two wads of toilet paper tucked under her arms to stop the bleeding from shaving cuts for the next few minutes all she could think of was getting to a restroom where she could remove the spotted wads she decided not to mention it the restaurant the old italian pasta factory was housed in an old creamery building a remnant of the time when pine coves economy was based on livestock rather than tourism the concrete floors remained intact as did the corrugated steel roof the owners had taken care to preserve the rusticity of the structure while adding the warmth of a fireplace soft lighting and the traditional redandwhite tablecloths of an italian restaurant the tables were small but comfortably spaced and each was decorated with fresh flowers and a candle the pasta factory it was agreed was the most romantic restaurant in the area as soon as the hostess seated them jenny excused herself to the restroom order whatever wine you want she said im not picky i dont drink but if you want some no thats fine itll be a nice change as soon as jenny left the waitress an efficientlooking woman in her thirties came to the table good evening sir what can i bring you to drink this evening she pulled her order pad out of her pocket in a quick liquid movement like a gunslinger drawing a sixshooter a career waitress travis thought i thought id wait for the lady to return he said oh jenny shell have an herbal tea and you want lets see she looked him up and down crossedreferenced him pigeonholed him and announced youll have some sort of imported beer right i dont drink so i should have known the waitress slapped her forehead as if shed just caught herself in the middle of a grave error like serving the salad with plutonium instead of creamy italian her husband is a drunk its only natural that shed go out with a nondrinker on the rebound can i bring you a mineral water that would be fine travis said the waitresss pen scratched but she did not look at the order pad or lose her we aim to please smile and would you like some garlic bread while youre waiting sure travis said he watched the waitress walk away she took small quick mechanical steps and was gone to the kitchen in an instant travis wondered why some people seemed to be able to walk faster than he could run theyre professionals he thought jenny took five minutes to get all the toilet paper unstuck from her underarms and there had been an embarrassing moment when another woman came into the restroom and found her before the mirror with her elbow in the air when she returned to the table travis was staring over a basket of garlic bread she saw the herbal tea on the table and said how did you know psychic i guess he said i ordered garlic bread yes she said seating herself they stared at the garlic bread as if it were a bubbling caldron of hemlock you like garlic bread she asked love it and you one of my favorites she said he picked up the basket and offered it to her have some not right now you go ahead no thanks im not in the mood he put the basket down the garlic bread lay there between them steaming with implications they of course must both eat it or neither could garlic bread meant garlic breath there might be a kiss later maybe more there was just too damn much intimacy in garlic bread they sat in silence reading the menu she looking for the cheapest entree which she had no intention of eating and he looking for the item that would be the least embarrassing to eat in front of someone what are you going to have she asked not spaghetti he snapped okay jenny had forgotten what dating was like although she couldnt remember for sure she thought that she might have gotten married to avoid ever having to go through this kind of discomfort again it was like driving with the emergency brake set she decided to release the brake im starved pass the garlic bread travis smiled sure he passed it to her then took a piece for himself they paused in midbite and eyed each other across the table like two poker players on the bluff jenny laughed spraying crumbs all over the table the evening was on so travis what do you do date married women evidently how did you know the waitress told me were separated good he said and they both laughed they ordered and as dinner progressed they found common ground in the awkwardness of the situation jenny told travis about her marriage and her job travis made up a history of working as a traveling insurance salesman with no real ties to home or family in a frank exchange of truth for lies they found they liked each other were in fact quite taken with one another they left the restaurant arm in arm laughing rachel rachel henderson lived alone in a small house that lay amid a grove of eucalyptus trees at the edge of the beer bar cattle ranch the house was owned by jim beer a lanky fortyfiveyearold cowboy who lived with his wife and two children in a fourteenroom house his grandfather had built on the far side of the ranch rachel had lived on the ranch for five years she had never paid any rent rachel had met jim beer in the head of the slug saloon when she first arrived in pine cove jim had been drinking all day and was feeling the weight of his rugged cowboy charisma when rachel sat down on the bar stool next to him and put a newspaper on the bar well darlin im damned if youre not a fresh wind on a stale pasture can i buy you a drink the banjo twang in jims accent was pure oklahoma picked up from the hands that had worked the beer bar when jim was a boy jim was the third generation of beers to work the ranch and would probably be the last his teenage son zane grey beer had decided early on that he would rather ride a surfboard than a horse that was part of the reason that jim was drinking away the afternoon at the slug that and the fact that his wife had just purchased a new mercedes turbodiesel wagon that cost the annual net income of the beer bar ranch rachel unfolded the classified section of the pine cove gazette on the bar just an orange juice thanks im house hunting today she curled one leg under herself on the bar stool you dont know anybody that has a house for rent do you jim beer would look back on that day many times in the years to come but he could never quite remember what had happened next what he did remember was driving his pickup down the back road into the ranch with rachel following behind in an old volkswagen van from there his memory was a montage of images rachel naked on the small bunk his turquoise belt buckle hitting the wooden floor with a thud silk scarves tied around his wrists rachel bouncing above him riding him like a bronco climbing back into his pickup after sundown sore and sweaty leaning his forehead on the wheel of the truck and thinking about his wife and kids in the five years since jim beer had never gone near the little house on the far side of the ranch every month he penciled the rent collected into a ledger then deposited cash from his poker fund in the business checking account to cover it a few of his friends had seen him leave the head of the slug with rachel that afternoon when they saw him again they ribbed him made crude jokes and asked pointed questions jim answered the jibes by pushing his summer stetson back on his head and saying boys all i got to say is that male menopause is a rough trail to ride hank williams couldnt have sung it any sadder after jim left that evening rachel picked several gray hairs from the bunks pillow around the hairs she carefully tied a single red thread which she knotted twice two knots were enough for the bond she wanted over jim beer she placed the tiny bundle in a babyfood jar labeled it with a marking pen and stored it away in a cupboard over the kitchen sink now the cupboard was full of jars each one containing a similar bundle each bundle tied with a red thread the number of knots in the thread varied three of the bundles were tied with four knots these contained the hair of men rachel had loved those men were long gone the rest of rachels house was decorated with objects of power eagle feathers crystals pentagrams and tapestries embroidered with magic symbols there was no evidence of a past in rachels house any photos she had of herself had been taken after she arrived in pine cove people who knew rachel had no clue as to where she had lived or who she had been before she came to town they knew her as a beautiful mysterious woman who taught aerobics for a living or they knew her as a witch her past was an enigma which was just the way she wanted it no one knew that rachel had grown up in bakersfield the daughter of an illiterate oilfield worker they didnt know that she had been a fat ugly little girl who spent most of her life doing degrading things for disgusting men so that she might receive some sort of acceptance butterflies do not wax nostalgic about the time they spent as caterpillars rachel had married a cropduster pilot who was twenty years her senior she was eighteen at the time it happened in the front seat of a pickup truck in the parking lot of a roadhouse outside of visalia california the pilot whose name was merle henderson was still breathing hard and rachel was washing the foul taste out of her mouth with a lukewarm budweiser if you do that again ill marry you merle gasped an hour later they were flying over the mojave desert heading for las vegas in merles cessna merle came at ten thousand feet they were married under a neon arch in a ramshackle concreteblock chapel just off the vegas strip they had known each other exactly six hours rachel regarded the next eight years of her life as her term on the wheel of abuse merle henderson deposited her in his house trailer by the landing strip and kept her there he allowed her to visit town once a week to go to the laundromat and the grocery store the rest of her time was spent waiting on or waiting for merle and helping him work on his planes each morning merle took off in the crop duster taking with him the keys to the pickup rachel spent the days cleaning up the trailer eating and watching television she grew fatter and merle began to refer to her as his fat little mama what little selfesteem she had drained away and was absorbed by merles overpowering male ego merle had flown helicopter gunships in vietnam and he still talked about it as the happiest time in his life when he opened the tanks of insecticide over a field of lettuce he imagined he was releasing airtoground missiles into a vietnamese village the army had sensed a destructive edge in merle vietnam had honed it to razor sharpness and it had not dulled when he came home until he married rachel he released his pentup violence by starting fights in bars and flying with dangerous abandon with rachel waiting for him at home he went to bars less often and released his aggression on her in the form of constant criticism verbal abuse and finally beatings rachel bore the abuse as if it were a penance sent down by god for the sin of being a woman her mother had endured the same sort of abuse from her father with the same resignation it was just the way things worked then one day while rachel was waiting at the laundromat for merles shirts to dry a woman approached her it was the day after a particularly vicious beating and rachels face was bruised and swollen its none of my business the woman said she was tall and stately and in her midforties she had a way about her that frightened rachel a presence but her voice was soft and strong but when you get some time you might read this she held out a pamphlet to rachel and rachel took it the title was the wheel of abuse there are some numbers in the back that you can call everything will be okay the woman said rachel thought it a strange thing to say everything was okay but the woman had impressed her so she read the pamphlet it talked about human rights and dignity and personal power it spoke to rachel about her life in a way that she had never thought possible the wheel of abuse was her life story how did they know mostly it talked about courage to change she kept the pamphlet and hid it away in a box of tampons under the bathroom sink it stayed there for two weeks until the morning she ran out of coffee she could hear the sound of merles plane disappearing in the distance as she stared into the mirror at the bloody hole where her front teeth used to be she dug out the pamphlet and called one of the numbers on the back within a half hour two women arrived at the trailer they packed rachels belongings and drove her to the shelter rachel wanted to leave a note for merle but the two women insisted that it was not a good idea for the next three weeks rachel lived at the shelter the women at the shelter cared for her they gave her food and understanding and affection and in return they asked only that she acknowledge her own dignity when she made the call to merle to tell him where she was they all stood by her merle promised that it would all change he missed her he needed her she returned to the trailer for a month merle did not hit her he did not touch her at all he didnt even speak to her the women at the shelter had warned her about this type of abuse the withdrawal of affection when she brought it up to merle one evening while he was eating he threw a plate in her face then he proceeded to give her the worst beating of her life afterward he locked her outside the trailer for the night the trailer was fifteen miles from the nearest neighbor so rachel was forced to cower under the front steps to escape the cold she was not sure she could walk fifteen miles in the middle of the night merle opened the door and shouted by the way i ripped the phone out so dont waste your time thinking about it he slammed and locked the door when the sun broke in the east merle reappeared rachel had crawled under the trailer where he could not reach her he lifted the plastic skirting and shouted to her listen bitch youd better be here when i get home or youll get worse rachel waited in the darkness under the trailer until she heard the biplane roar down the strip she climbed out and watched the plane climb gradually into the distance although it hurt her face and the cuts on her mouth split open she couldnt help smiling she had discovered her personal power it lay hidden under the trailer in a fivegallon asphalt can now half full of aviation grade motor oil a policeman came to the trailer that afternoon his jaw was set with the stoic resolve of a man who knows he has an unpleasant task to perform and is determined to do it but when he saw rachel sitting on the steps of the trailer the color drained from his face and he ran to her are you all right rachel could not speak garbled sounds bubbled from her broken mouth the policeman drove her to the hospital in his cruiser later after she had been cleaned up and bandaged the policeman came to her room and told her about the crash it seemed that merles biplane lost power after a pass over a field he was unable to climb fast enough to avoid a hightension tower and flaming bits of merle were scattered across a field of budding strawberries later at the funeral rachel would comment it was how he would have wanted to go a few weeks later a man from the federal aviation administration came around the trailer asking questions rachel told him that merle had beat her then had stormed out to the plane and taken off the faa concluded that merle in his anger had forgotten to check out his plane thoroughly before taking off no one ever suspected rachel of draining the oil out of the plane howard howard phillips the owner of hps cafe had just settled down in the study of his stone cottage when he looked out the window and saw something moving through the trees howard had spent most of his adult life trying to prove three theories he had formulated in college one that before man had walked the earth there had been a powerful race of intelligent beings who had achieved a high level of civilization then for some unknown reason had disappeared two that the remnants of their civilization still existed underground or under the ocean and through extreme cunning and guile had escaped detection by man and three that they were planning to return as masters of the planet in a very unfriendly way what lurked in the woods outside howard phillipss cottage was the first physical evidence of his theories that he had ever encountered he was at once elated and terrified like the child who is delighted by the idea of santa claus then cries and cowers behind its mother when confronted with the corpulent redsuited reality of a departmentstore santa howard phillips was not fully prepared for a physical manifestation of what he had long believed extant he was a scholar not an adventurer he preferred his experiences to come secondhand through books howards idea of adventure was trying whole wheat toast with his daily ham and eggs instead of the usual white bread he stared out the window at the creature moving in the moonlight it was very much like the creatures he had read about in ancient manuscripts bipedal like a man but with long apelike arms reptilian howard could see scales reflecting in the moonlight the one inconsistency that bothered him was its size in the manuscripts these creatures who were said to be kept as slaves by the old ones had always been small in stature no more than a few feet tall this one was enormous four maybe five meters tall the creature stopped for moment then turned slowly and looked directly at howards window howard resisted the urge to dive to the floor and so stood staring straight into the eyes of the nightmare the creatures eyes were the size of car headlamps and they glowed a faint orange around slotted feline pupils long pointed scales lay back against its head giving the impression of ears they stood there staring at each other the creature and the man neither moving until howard could bear it no longer he grabbed the curtains and pulled them shut almost ripping them from the rod in the process outside he could hear the sound of laughter when he dared to peak through the gap in the curtains the creature was gone why hadnt he been more scientific in his observation why hadnt he run for his camera for all his work at putting together clues from arcane grimoirs to prove the existence of the old ones people had labeled him a crackpot one photograph would have convinced them but he had missed his chance or had he suddenly it occurred to howard that the creature had seen him why should the old ones be so careful not to be discovered for so long then walk in the moonlight as if out for a sunday stroll perhaps it had not moved on at all but was circling the house to do away with the witness first he thought of weapons he had none in the house many of the old books in his library had spells for protection but he had no idea where to start looking besides the verge of panic was not the ideal mental state in which to do research he might still be able to bolt to his old jaguar and escape then again he might bolt into the claws of the creature all these thoughts passed through his mind in a second the phone he snatched the phone from his desk and dialed it seemed forever for the dial to spin but finally there was a ring and a womans voice at the other end nineoneone emergency she said yes i wish to report a lurker in the woods what is your name sir howard phillips and what is the address you are calling from fiveohnine cambridge street in pine cove are you in any immediate danger well yes that is why i called you say you have a prowler is he attempting to enter the house not yet you have seen the prowler yes outside my window in the woods can you describe him he is an abomination of such abysmal hideousness that the mere recollection of this monstrosity perambulating in the dark outside my domicile fills me with the preternatural chill of the charnel house that would be about how tall howard paused to think obviously the law enforcement system was not prepared to deal with perversions from the transcosmic gulfs of the nethermost craters of the underworld yet he needed assistance the fiend stands two meters he said could you see what he was wearing again howard considered the truth and rejected it jeans i believe and a leather jacket could you tell if he was armed armed i should say so the beast is armed with monstrous claws and a toothed maw of the most villainous predator calm down sir i am dispatching a unit to your home make sure the doors are locked stay calm ill stay on the line until the officers arrive how long will that be about twenty minutes young woman in twenty minutes i shall be little more than a shredded memory howard hung up the phone it had to be escape then he took his greatcoat and car keys from the foyer and stood leaning against the front door slowly he slipped the lock and grabbed the door handle on three then he said to himself one he turned the door handle two he bent preparing to run three he didnt move all right then steel yourself howard he started the count again one perhaps the beast was not outside two if it was a slave creature it wasnt dangerous at all three he did not move howard repeated the process of counting over and over each time measuring the fear in his heart against the danger that lurked outside finally disgusted with his own cowardliness he threw the door open and bolted into the dark billy billy winston was on the final stretch of the nightly audit at the roomsrus motel his fingers danced across the calculator like a spastic fred astaire the sooner he finished the sooner he could log onto the computer and become roxanne only thirtyseven of the motels one hundred rooms were rented tonight so he was going to finish early he couldnt wait he needed roxannes ego boost after being ditched by the breeze the night before he hit the total button with a flourish as if he had just played the final note of a piano concerto then wrote the figure into the ledger and slammed the book billy was alone in the motel the only sound was the hum of the fluorescent lights from the windows by his desk he had a degree view of the highway and the parking lot but there was nothing to see at that time of night a car or two passed every half hour or so just as well he didnt like distractions while he was being roxanne billy pushed a stool up to the front counter behind the computer he typed in his access code and logged on witksas hows your dog sweetie send pncvcal the roomsrus motel chain maintained a computer network for making reservations at their motels all over the world from any location a desk clerk could contact any of the two hundred motels in the chain by simply entering a sevenletter code billy had just

goddess witksas yes and beat him softly on the ears bad dog bad dog send pncvcal again billy waited for the response a message appeared on the screen where are you darling i miss you tulsokl it was his lover from tulsa roxanne could handle two or three at once but she wasnt in the mood for it right now she was feeling a little crampy billy adjusted his crotch his panties were riding up a bit he typed two messages witksas go pet your doggie for a while auntie roxanne will check on you in a while send pncvcal tulsokl took an evening off to shop for something lacy to wear for you i hope you dont find it too shocking send pncvcal while he was waiting for a response from oklahoma billy dug into his gym bag for his red high heels he liked to hook the stiletto heels into the rungs of the stool while he talked to his lovers when he glanced up he thought he saw something moving out in the parking lot probably just a guest getting something from the car pncvcal you sweet little thing you could never shock me tell me what you bought tulsokl billy started to type in a modest description of a lace teddy he had seen in a catalog to the guy in tulsa roxanne was a shy little flower to wichita she was a dominatrix the desk clerk in seattle saw her as a leatherclad biker chick the old man in arizona thought she was a struggling single mother of two barely making it on a desk clerks salary he always wanted to send her money there were ten of them in all roxanne gave them what they needed they loved her billy heard the double doors of the lobby open but he did not look up he finished typing his message and pressed the send button can i help you he said mechanically still not looking up you betcha a voice said two huge reptilian hands clacked down on the counter about four feet on each side of billy he looked up into the open mouth of the demon coming at his face billy pushed back from the keyboard his heel caught in the rung of the stool and he went over backward as the giant maw snapped shut above him billy let loose a long sirenlike scream and began scrambling on his hands and knees behind the counter toward the back office looking back over his shoulder he saw the demon crawling over the counter after him once in the office billy leapt to his feet and slammed the door as he turned to run out the back door he heard the door fly open and slam against the wall the back door of the office led into a long corridor of rooms billy pounded on the doors as he passed no one opened a door but there were angry shouts from inside the rooms billy turned and saw the demon filling the far end of the corridor it was in a crouch moving down the corridor on all fours crawling awkward and batlike in the confined space billy dug in his pocket for his pass key found it and ran down the hallway and around the corner making the corner he twisted his ankle white pain shot up his leg and he cried out he limped to the closest door the images of women in horror movies who twisted their ankles and feebly fell into the clutches of the monster raced through his head damn high heels he fumbled the key into the lock while looking back down the hallway the door opened and billy fell into the room just as the monster rounded the corner behind him he kicked the stiletto heel off his good foot vaulted up and hopped across the empty room to the sliding glass door the safety bar was set he fell to his knees and began clawing at it the only light in the room was coming from the hallway and suddenly that was eclipsed the monster was working its way through the doorway what the fuck are you billy screamed the monster stopped just inside the room even crouching over its shoulders hit the ceiling billy cowered by the sliding door still clawing under the curtains at the safety bar the monster looked around the room its huge head turning back and forth like a searchlight to billys amazement it reached around and turned on the lights it seemed to be studying the bed does that have magic fingers it said what billy said it came out a scream that bed has magic fingers right billy pulled the safety bar loose and hurled it at the monster the heavy steel bar hit the monster in the face and rattled to the floor the monster showed no reaction billy reached for the latch on the door and started to pull it open the monster scuttled forward reached over billys head and pushed the door shut with one clawed finger billy yanked on the door but it was held fast he collapsed under the monster with a long agonizing wail give me a quarter the monster said billy looked up into the huge lizard face the monsters grin was nearly two feet wide give me a quarter it repeated billy dug into his pocket came out with a handful of change and timidly held it up to the monster still holding the door shut with one hand the monster reached down with the other and plucked a quarter from billys hand with two claws using them like chopsticks thanks it said i love magic fingers the demon let go of the door you can go now it said before he could think about it billy threw the door open and dove through he was climbing to his feet when something caught him by the leg from behind and dragged him back into the room i was just kidding you cant go the monster held billy upside down by his leg while it dropped the quarter into the little metal box on the nightstand billy flailed in the air screaming and clawing at the demon ripping his fingernails against its scales the monster took billy into its arms like a teddy bear and lay back on the bed its feet hung off the end and nearly touched the dresser on the opposite wall billy could not scream there was no breath for a scream the monster let go with one arm and placed one long claw at billys ear dont you just love magic fingers it said then it drove the claw though billys brain rachel after merle died and rachel observed a respectable period of mourning which was precisely the same amount of time it took the courts to transfer merles property to her she sold the cessna and the trailer bought herself a volkswagen van and on the advice of the women at the shelter headed for berkeley in berkeley they insisted she would find a community of women who could help her stay off the wheel of abuse they were right the women in berkeley welcomed rachel with open arms they helped her find a place to live enrolled her in exercise and selfactualization courses taught her to defend herself nurture herself and most important to respect herself she lost weight and grew strong she thrived within a year she took the remainder of her inheritance and bought a lease on a small studio adjacent to the university of california campus and began teaching highintensity aerobics she soon gained a reputation as a tough domineering bitch of an instructor there was a waiting list to get into her classes the fat little girl had come into her own as a beautiful and powerful woman rachel taught six classes a day putting herself through the rigors of each workout along with her students after a few months of that regimen she fell ill waking one morning to find that she had just enough strength to call the women in her classes to cancel and no more one of her students a statuesque grayhaired woman in her forties named bella appeared at rachels door a few hours later once through the door bella began giving orders take off your clothes and get back in bed ill bring you some tea in a moment her voice was deep and strong yet somehow soothing rachel did as she was told i dont know what you think youve done to deserve the punishment you are giving yourself rachel bella said but it has to stop bella sat on the edge of rachels bed and watched while rachel drank the tea now lie on your stomach and relax bella applied fragrant oil to rachels back and began rubbing first with long slow strokes that spread the oil then gradually digging her fingers into the muscles until rachel thought she would cry out in pain when the message was finished rachel felt even more exhausted than before she fell into a deep sleep when rachel awoke bella repeated the process forcing rachel to drink the bitter tea then kneading her muscles until they ached again rachel slept when rachel awoke the fourth time bella again served her the tea but this time she had rachel lie on her back to receive her massage bellas hands played gently over her body lingering between her legs and on her breasts through the drugged haze of the tea rachel noticed that the older woman was almost naked and had rubbed her own body with the same fragrant oils that she used on rachel it didnt occur to rachel to resist since bella had come through the door she had been giving orders and rachel had obeyed in the dim light of rachels little apartment they became lovers it had been two years since rachel had been with a man trading soft caresses with bella she didnt care if she was ever again when rachel was back on her feet bella introduced her to a group of women who met at bellas house once a week to perform ceremonies and rituals among these women rachel learned about a new power she carried within herself the power of the goddess bella tutored her in the machinations of white magic and soon rachel was leading the coven in rituals while bella looked on like a proud mother modulate your voice bella told her no matter what you are saying it should sound like a chant to the goddess the coven should be taken with the chant that is the meaning of enchantment my dear rachel gave up her apartment and moved into bellas restored victorian house near the uc campus for the first time in her life she felt truly happy of course it didnt last one afternoon she came home to find bella in bed with a bald and bewhiskered professor of music rachel was livid she threatened the professor with a fireplace poker and chased him halfnaked into the street he exited clutching his tweed jacket and corduroy slacks in front of him you said you loved me rachel screamed at bella i do love you dear bella did not seem the least bit upset her voice was deep and modulated like a chant this was about power not love if i wasnt filling your needs you should have said something you are the most wonderful lover i have known dear rachel but dr mendenhall holds the mortgage on our house that loan is interest free in case you hadnt noticed you whore arent we all dear im not you are i am the goddess is we all have our price be it love or money or power rachel why do you think the women in your exercise classes put themselves through so much pain youre changing the subject answer me bella demanded why they want a sound body they want a strong vessel to carry a strong spirit they dont give a rats ass about a strong spirit they want a tight ass so men will want them they will deny it to the death but its true the sooner you realize that the sooner you will realize your own power youre sick this goes against everything youve ever taught me this is the most important thing i ever will teach you so listen know your price rachel no you think im some cheap slut do you you think youre above selling yourself how much rent have you ever paid here i offered you said it didnt matter i loved you thats your price then its not its love sold bella climbed out of bed and strode across the room her long gray hair flying behind her she took her robe from the closet threw it around herself and tied the sash love me for what i am rachel just as i love you for what you are nothing has changed dr mendenhall will be back whimpering like a puppy if it will make you feel better you can be the one that takes him maybe we can do it together youre sick how could you even suggest such a thing rachel as long as you see men as human beings we are going to have a problem they are inferior beings incapable of love how could a few moments of animal friction with a subhuman affect us what we have between us you sound like a man caught with his pants down bella sighed i dont want you around the others until you calm down theres some money in my jewelry box why dont you take it and go down to esalen for a week or so think this over youll feel better when you get back what about the others rachel asked how do you think theyll feel when they find out that all the magic all the spiritualism you preach is just so much bullshit everything is true they follow me because they admire my power this is part of that power i havent betrayed anyone youve betrayed me if you feel that way then perhaps youd better leave bella went into the bathroom and began drawing a bath rachel followed her why should i leave i could just tell them i know as much as you do now i could lead them dear rachel bella was adding oils to her bath and not looking up didnt you learn anything from killing your husband destruction is a mans way rachel was stunned she had told bella about the accident but not that she had caused it she had told no one bella looked up at her at last you can stay if you wish i still love you ill go im sorry rachel i thought you were more highly evolved bella slipped out of her robe and into her bath rachel stood in the doorway staring down at her i love you she said i know you do dear now go pack your things rachel couldnt bear the idea of staying in berkeley everywhere she went she encountered reminders of bella she loaded up her van and spent a month driving around california looking for a place where she might fit in then one morning while reading the paper over breakfast she spotted a column called california facts it was a simple list of figures that informed readers of obscure facts such as which california county produces the most pistachios sacramento where one had the best chance of having ones car stolen north hollywood and tucked amid a mélange of seemingly insignificant demographics which california town had the highest per capita percentage of divorced women pine cove rachel had found her destination now five years later she was firmly set in the community respected by the women and feared and lusted after by the men she had moved slowly recruiting into her coven only women who sought her out mostly women who were on the verge of leaving their husbands and who needed something to shore them up during the divorce process rachel provided them with the support they required and in return they gave her their loyalty just six months ago she initiated the thirteenth and final member of the coven at last she was able to perform the rituals that she had worked so hard to learn from bella for years they seemed ineffective and rachel attributed their failure to not having a full coven now she was starting to suspect that the earth magic they were trying to perform just did not work that there was no real power to be had she could lead the coven to attempt anything and on her command they would do it that was a power of sorts she could extract favors from men with no more than a seductive glance and in that there was a power but none of it was enough she wanted the magic to work she wanted real power catch had sensed rachels lust for power in the head of the slug that afternoon recognizing in her what he had seen in his ruthless masters before travis that night while rachel lay in the dark of her cabin contemplating her own impotence the demon came to her she had locked the door that night more out of habit than need as there was very little crime in pine cove around nine she heard someone try the doorknob and she sat upright in bed who is it as if in answer the door bent slowly inward and the doorjamb cracked then splintered away the door opened but there was no one behind it rachel pulled the quilt up around her chin and scooted up into the corner of the bed who is it a voice growled out of the darkness dont be afraid i will not hurt you the moon was bright if someone was there she should have been able to see his silhouette in the doorway but strain as she might she saw nothing who are you what do you want no what do you want the voice said rachel was truly frightened the voice was coming from an empty spot not two feet away from her bed i asked you first she said who are you ooooooooooo i am the ghost of christmas past rachel poked herself in the leg with her thumbnail to make sure she was not dreaming she wasnt she found herself speaking to the disembodied voice in spite of herself christmas is months away i know i lied im not the ghost of christmas past i saw that in a movie once who are you rachel was near hysteria i am all your dreams come true someone must have planted a speaker somewhere in the house rachels fear turned to anger she leapt from bed to find the offending device two steps out of bed she ran into something and fell to the floor something that felt like claws wrapped around her waist she felt herself being lifted and put back on the bed panic seized her she began to scream as her bladder let go stop it the voice drowned her screams and rattled the windows of the cabin i dont have time for this rachel cowered on the bed she was panting and felt herself getting lightheaded she started to sink back into unconsciousness but something caught her by the hair and yanked her back her mind searched for a touchstone in reality a ghost it was a ghost did she believe in ghosts perhaps it was time to start maybe it was him returned for revenge merle is that you who im sorry merle i had to who is merle youre not merle never heard of him then who what in the hell are you i am the defeat of your enemies i am the power you crave i am live and direct from hell the demon catch tada there was a clicking on the floor like a tapdancing step youre an earth spirit er uh yes an earth spirit thats me catch the earth spirit but i didnt think the ritual worked ritual we tried to call you up at the meeting last week but i didnt think it worked because i didnt draw the circle of power with a virgin blade that had been quenched in blood what did you use a nail file there was a pause had she offended the earth spirit here was the first evidence that her magic could work and she had blown it by compromising the materials called for in the ritual im sorry she said but its not easy to find a blade thats been quenched in blood its okay if i had known i no really its okay are you offended great spirit i am about to bestow the greatest power in the world upon a woman who draws circles in the dirt with nail files i dont know give me a minute then you will grant harmony to the hearts of the women in the coven what the fuck are you talking about the voice said that is why we summoned you o spirit to bring us harmony oh yeah harmony but there is a condition tell me what you require of me o spirit i will return to you later witch if i find what i am looking for i will need you to renounce the creator and perform a ritual in return you will be given the command of a power that can rule the earth will you do this rachel could not believe what she was hearing accepting that her magic worked was a huge step yet she was speaking to the evidence but to be offered the power to rule the world she wasnt sure her career in exercise instruction had prepared her for this speak woman or would you rather spend your life collecting gobs of hair from shower drains and fingernail parings from ashtrays how do you know about that i was destroying pagans when charlemagne was alive now answer there is a hunger rising in me and i must go destroying pagans i thought the earth spirits were benevolent we have our moments now will you renounce the creator renounce the goddess i dont know not the goddess the creator but the goddess wrong the creator the allpowerful help me out here babe im not allowed to say his name you mean the christian god bingo will you renounce him i did that a long time ago good wait here i will be back rachel searched for a last word but nothing came she heard a rustling in the leaves outside and ran to the door in the moonlight she could see the shapes of cattle standing in the nearby pasture and something moving among them something that was growing larger as it moved away toward town jennys house jenny parked the toyota behind traviss chevy and killed the lights well travis said jenny said would you like to come in well travis acted as if he had to think about it yes id love to give me a minute to go in and clear a path okay no problem i need to check on something in my car thanks jenny smiled with relief they got out of the car jenny went into the house travis leaned against the door of the chevy and waited for her to get inside then he threw open the car door and peeked inside catch was sitting on the passenger side his face stuck in a comic book he looked up at travis and grinned oh youre back did you play the radio no way good its wired into the battery directly itll drain the current didnt touch it travis glanced at the suitcase on the backseat keep an eye on that you got it travis didnt move is there something wrong well youre being awfully agreeable i told you im just glad to see you having a good time you may have to stay the night in the car you arent hungry are you get a grip travis i just ate last night travis nodded ill check on you later so stay here travis closed the car door catch jumped to his feet and watched over the dashboard while travis went into the house ironically they were both thinking the same thing in a little while this will all be over catch coughed and a red spiked heel shot out of his mouth and bounced off the windshield spattering the glass with hellish spit robert had parked his truck a block away from his old house and walked up hoping and dreading that he would catch jenny with another man as he approached the house he saw the old chevy parked in front of her toyota he had run through this scene a hundred times in his mind walk out of the dark catch her with the guy and shout ah ha then things got sketchy what was the point he didnt really want to catch her at anything he wanted her to come to the door with tears streaming down her cheeks he wanted her to throw her arms around him and beg him to come home he wanted to assure her that everything would be fine and forgive her for throwing him out he had run that scene through his mind a hundred times as well after they made love for the third time things got sketchy the chevy was not part of his preconceived scenes it was like a preview a teaser it meant that someone was in the house with jenny someone who unlike robert had been invited new scenes ran through his mind knocking on the door having jenny answer looking around her shoulder to see another man sitting on the couch and being sent away he couldnt stand that it was too real maybe it wasnt a guy at all maybe it was one of the women from the coven who had stopped over to comfort jenny in her time of need then the dream came back to him he was tied to a chair in the desert again watching jenny make love with another man the little monster was shoving saltines in his mouth robert realized he had been standing in the middle of the street staring at the house for several minutes torturing himself just be adult about it go up and knock on the door if she is with someone else just excuse yourself and come back later he felt an ache rising in his chest at the thought no just walk away go back to the breezes trailer and call her tomorrow the thought of another night alone with his heartbreak increased the ache in his chest roberts indecision had always angered jenny now it was paralyzing him just pick a direction and go robert she would say it cant be any worse than sitting here pitying yourself but its the only thing im good at he thought a truck rounded the corner and started slowly to roll up the street robert was galvanized into action he ran to the chevy and ducked behind it im hiding in front of my own house this is silly he thought still it was as if anyone who passed would know how small and weak he was he didnt want to be seen the truck slowed almost to a stop as it passed the house then the driver gunned the engine and sped off robert stayed in a crouch behind the chevy for several minutes before he moved he had to know just pick a direction and go he decided to peek in the windows there were two windows in the living room about six feet off the ground both were oldstyle weightedsash types jenny had planted geraniums in the window boxes outside if the window boxes were strong enough he could hoist himself up and peek through the gap in the drawn curtains spying on your own wife was sleazy it was dirty it was perverse he thought about it for a moment then made his way across the yard to the windows sleazy dirty and perverse would be improvements over how he felt now he grabbed the edge of the window box and tested his weight against it it held he pulled himself up hooked his chin on the window box and peered through the gap in the curtains they were on the couch facing away from him jenny and some man for a moment he thought jenny was naked then he saw the thin straps of her black dress she never wore that dress anymore it gave out the wrong kind of message she used to say meaning it was too sexy he stared at them in fascination caught by the reality of his fear like a deer caught in car headlights the man turned to say something to jenny and robert caught his profile it was the guy from the nightmare the guy he had seen in the slug that afternoon he couldnt look any longer he lowered himself to the ground a knot of sad questions beat at him who was this guy what was so great about this guy what does he have that i dont worst of all how long has this been going on robert stumbled away from the house toward the street they were sitting in his house on his couch the couch he and jenny had saved up to buy how could she do that didnt everything in the house remind her of their marriage how could she sit on his couch with some other man would they screw in his bed the ache rose up in his chest at the thought almost doubling him over he thought about trashing the guys car it was pretty trashed already though flatten the tires break the windshield piss in the gas tank no then he would have to admit to spying but he had to do something maybe he could find something in the car that would tell him who this home wrecker was he peered through the chevys windows nothing much to see a few fastfood wrappers a comic book on the front seat and a haliburton suitcase on the backseat robert recognized it immediately he used to carry his fourbyfive camera in the same model suitcase he had sold the camera and given the suitcase to the breeze for rent was this guy a photographer one way to find out he hesitated his hand on the car door handle what if the guy came out while robert was rummaging through the car what would he do fuck it the guy was rummaging through his life wasnt he robert tried the door it was unlocked he threw it open and reached in effrom he was a soldier like all soldiers in his spare moments he was thinking of home and the girl who waited for him there he sat on a hill looking out over the rolling english countryside it was dark but his eyes had adjusted during his long guard duty he smoked a cigarette and watched the patterns the full moon made on the hills when the low cloud cover parted he was a boy just seventeen he was in love with a brownhaired blueeyed girl named amanda she had downsoft hair on her thighs that tickled his palms when he pushed her skirt up around her hips he could see the autumn sun on her thighs even though he was staring over the springgreen hills of england the clouds opened and let the moon light up the whole countryside the girl pulled his pants down around his knees the trenches were only four days away he took a deep drag on the cigarette and stubbed it out in the grass he let the smoke out with a sigh the girl kissed him hard and wet and pulled him down on her a shadow appeared on the distant hill black and sharply defined he watched the shadow undulate across the hills it cant be he thought they never fly under a full moon but the cloud cover he looked in the sky for the airship but could see nothing it was silent except for the crickets singing sex songs the countryside was still but for the shadow he lost the vision of the girl everything was the huge cigarshaped shadow moving toward him silent as death he knew he should run sound the alarm warn his friends but he just sat watching the shadow eclipsed the moonlight and he shivered the airship was directly over him he could just hear the engines as it passed then he was bathed in moonlight the shadow behind him he had survived the airship had held its bellyful of death then he heard the explosions begin behind him he turned and watched the flashes and fires in the distance listened to the screams as his friends at the base woke to find themselves on fire he moaned and curled into a ball flinching each time a bomb exploded then he woke up there was no justice effrom was sure of it not an iota not one scintilla not a molecule of justice in the world if there was justice would he be plagued by nightmares from the war if there was any justice would he be losing sleep over something that had happened over seventy years ago no justice was a myth and it had died like all myths strangled by the overwhelming reality of experience effrom was too uncomfortable to mourn the passing of justice the wife had put the flannel sheets on the bed to keep him cozy and warm in her absence they still slept together after all those years it never occurred to them to do any different now the sheets were heavy and cold with sweat effroms pajamas clung to him like a rainblown shroud after missing his nap he had gone to bed early to try to recapture his dreams of spandexclad young women but his subconscious had conspired with his stomach to send him a nightmare instead sitting on the edge of the bed he could feel his stomach bubbling away like a cannibals caldron trying to digest him from the inside out to say that effrom was not a particularly good cook was an understatement akin to saying that genocide is not a particularly effective public relations strategy he had decided that tater tots would provide as good a meal as anything without challenging his culinary abilities he read the cooking instructions carefully then did some simple mathematics to expedite the preparation twenty minutes at degrees would mean only eleven minutes at degrees the results of his calculation resembled charcoal briquettes with frozen centers but because he was in a hurry to get to bed he drowned the suffering tots in catsup and ate them anyway little did he know that their spirits would return carrying nightmare images of the zeppelin attack he had never been so frightened even in the trenches with bullets flying overhead and mustard gas on the wind that shadow moving silently across the hills had been the worst but now sitting on the edge of the bed he felt the same paralyzing fear though the dream was fading instead of the relief of finding himself safe at home in bed he felt he had awakened into something worse than the nightmare someone was moving in the house someone was thrashing around like a twoyearold in a panrattling contest whoever it was was coming through the living room the house had a wooden floor and effrom knew its every squeak and creak the creaks were moving up the hall the intruder opened the bathroom door two doors from effroms bedroom effrom remembered the old pistol in his sock drawer was there time effrom shook off his fear and hobbled to the dresser his legs were stiff and wobbly and he nearly fell into the front of the dresser the floor was creaking outside the guest bedroom he heard the guest room door open hurry he opened the dresser drawer and dug around under his socks until he found the pistol it was a british revolver he had brought home from the war a webley chambered for automatic cartridges he broke the pistol open like a shotgun and looked into the cylinders empty holding the gun open he dug under his socks for the bullets three cartridges were held in a plate of steel shaped like a halfmoon so the pistols six cylinders could be loaded in two quick motions the british had developed the system so they could use the same rimless cartridges in their revolvers that the americans used in their colt automatics effrom located one of the halfmoon clips and dropped it into the pistol then he started searching for the sound the doorknob of his room started to turn no time he flipped the gun upward and it slammed shut only half loaded the door slowly started to swing open effrom aimed the webley at the center of the door and pulled the trigger the gun clicked the hammer fell on an empty chamber he pulled the trigger again and the gun fired inside the small bedroom the guns report sounded like the end of the world a large ragged hole appeared in the door from the hall came the highpitched scream of a woman effrom dropped the gun for a moment he stood there gunfire and the scream echoing in his head then he thought of his wife oh my god amanda he ran forward oh my god amanda oh my he threw the door open leapt back and grabbed his chest the monster was down on its hands and knees his arms and head filled the doorway he was laughing fooled you fooled you the monster chanted effrom backed into the bed and fell his mouth moved like windup chatter dentures but he made no sound nice shot old fella the monster said effrom could see the squashed remains of the bullet just above the monsters upper lip stuck like an obscene beauty mark the monster flipped the bullet off with a single claw the heavy slug thudded on the carpet effrom has having trouble breathing his chest was growing tighter with each breath he slid off the bed to the floor dont die old man i have questions for you you cant imagine how pissed ill be if you die now effroms mind was a white blur his chest was on fire he sensed someone talking to him but he couldnt understand the words he tried to speak but no words would come finally he found a breath im sorry amanda im sorry he gasped the monster crawled into the room and laid a hand on effroms chest effrom could feel the hand hard and scaly through his pajamas he gave up no the monster shouted you will not die effrom was no longer in the room he was sitting on a hill in england watching the shadow of death floating toward him across the fields this time the zeppelin was coming for him not the base he sat on the hill and waited to die im sorry amanda no not tonight who said that he was alone on the hill suddenly he became aware of a searing pain in his chest the shadow of the airship began to fade then the whole english countryside dissolved he could hear himself breathing he was back in the bedroom a warm glow filled his chest he looked up and saw the monster looming over him the pain in his chest subsided he grabbed one of the monsters claws and tried to pry it from his chest but it remained fast not biting into the flesh just laid upon it the monster spoke to him you were doing so good with the gun and everything i was thinking this old fuck really has some gumption then you go and start drooling and wheezing and ruining a perfectly good first impression wheres your selfrespect effrom felt the warmth on his chest spreading to his limbs his mind wanted to switch off dive under the covers of unconsciousness and hide until daylight but something kept bringing him back now thats better isnt it the monster removed his hand and backed to the corner of the bedroom where he sat crosslegged looking like the buddha of the lizards his pointy ears scraped against the ceiling when he turned his head effrom looked at the door the monster was perhaps eight feet away from it if he could get through it maybe how fast could a beast that size move in the confines of the house your jammies are all wet the monster said you should change or youll catch your death effrom was amazed at the reality shift his mind had made he was accepting this a monster was in his house talking to him and he was accepting it no it couldnt be real youre not real he said neither are you the monster retorted yes i am effrom said feeling stupid prove it the monster said effrom lay on the bed thinking much of his fear had been replaced by a macabre sense of wonder he said i dont have to prove it im right here sure the monster said incredulously effrom climbed to his feet upon rising he realized that the creak in his knees and the stiffness he had carried in his back for forty years were gone despite the strangeness of this situation he felt great what did you do to me me im not real how could i do anything effrom realized he had backed himself into a metaphysical corner from which the only escape was acceptance all right he said youre real what did you do to me i kept you from croaking effrom made a connection at last he had seen a movie about this aliens who come to earth with the power to heal granted this wasnt the cute little leatherfaced lightbulbheaded alien from the movie but it was no monster it was a perfectly normal person from another planet so effrom said do you want to use the phone or something why to phone home dont you want to phone home dont play with me old man i want to know why travis was here this afternoon i dont know anyone named travis he was here this afternoon you spoke with him i saw it you mean the insurance man he wanted to talk to my wife the monster moved across the room so quickly that effrom almost fell back on the bed to avoid him his hopes of making it through the door dissolved in an instant the monster loomed over him effrom could smell his fetid breath he was here for the magic and i want it now old man or ill hang your entrails from the curtain rods he wanted to talk to the wife i dont know nothin about any magic maybe you should have landed in washington they run things from there the monster picked effrom up and shook him like a rag doll where is your wife old man effrom could almost hear his brain rattling in his head the monsters hand squeezed the breath out of him he tried to answer but all he could produce was a pathetic croak where the monster threw him on the bed effrom felt the air burn back into his lungs shes in monterey visiting our daughter when will she be back dont lie ill know if you are lying how will you know try me your guts should go well with this decor shell be home in the morning thats enough the monster said he grabbed effrom by the shoulder and dragged him through the door effrom felt his shoulder pop out of its socket and a grinding pain flashed across his chest and back his last thought before passing out was god help me ive killed the wife augustus brine i found them the car is parked in front of jenny mastersons house augustus brine stormed into the house carrying a grocery bag in each arm gian hen gian was in the kitchen pouring salt from a round blue box into a pitcher of koolaid brine set the bags down on the hearth help me bring some of this stuff in theres more bags in the truck the genie walked to the fireplace and looked in the bags one was filled with drycell batteries and spools of wire the other was full of brown cardboard cylinders about four inches long and an inch in diameter gian hen gian took one of the cylinders out of the bag and held it up a green waterproof fuse extended from one end what are these seal bombs brine said the department of fish and game distributes them to fishermen to scare seals away from their lines and nets i had a bunch at the store explosives are useless against the demon there are five more bags in the truck would you bring them in please brine began to lay the seal bombs out in a line on the hearth i dont know how much time we have what am i some scrounging servant am i a beast of burden should i gian hen gian king of the djinn be reduced to bearing loads for an ignorant mortal who would attack a demon from hell with firecrackers o king brine said exasperated please bring in the goddamn bags so i can finish this before dawn it is useless im not going to try to blow him up i just want to know where he is unless you can use your great power to restrain him o king of the djinn you know i cannot the bags you are a stupid meanspirited man augustus brine ive seen more intelligence in the crotch lice of harem whores the genie walked out the door and his diatribe faded into the night brine was methodically wrapping the fuses of the seal bombs with thin monofilament silver wire designed to heat up when a current was applied it was an inexact method of detonation but brine had no access to blasting caps at this hour of the morning the genie returned in a moment carrying two grocery bags put them on the chairs brine gestured with his head these bags are filled with flour gian hen gian said are you going to bake bread augustus brine travis and jenny there was something about her that made travis want to dump his life out on the coffee table like a pocket full of coins let her sort through and keep what she wanted if he was still here in the morning hed tell her about catch but not now do you like traveling jenny asked im getting tired of it i could use a break she sipped from a glass of red wine and pulled her skirt down for the tenth time there was still a neutral zone between them on the couch she said you dont seem like any insurance salesman ive ever known i hope you dont mind my saying but usually insurance men dress in loud blazers and reek of cheap cologne ive never met one that seemed sincere about anything its a job travis hoped she wouldnt ask about the details of his job he didnt know a thing about insurance he had decided on the career because effrom elliot had mistaken him for an insurance man that afternoon so it was the first thing that came to mind when i was a kid an insurance man came to our house to sell my father some life insurance jenny said he gathered the family together in front of the fireplace and took our picture with a polaroid camera it was a nice picture my father was standing at one side of us all looking proud as we were passing the picture around the insurance man snatched the picture out of my fathers hands and said what a nice family then he ripped my father out of the picture and said now what will they do i burst into tears my father was frightened travis said im sorry jenny perhaps he should have told her he was a brush salesman did she have any traumatic brushsalesman stories do you do that travis do you frighten people for a living what do you think like i said you dont seem like an insurance man jennifer i need to tell you something its okay im sorry i got a little heavy on you you do what you do i never thought id be waiting tables at this age what did you want to do i mean when you were a little girl what did you want to be when you grew up honestly of course i wanted to be a mom i wanted to have a family and a man who loved me and a nice house pretty unambitious huh no theres nothing wrong with that what happened she drained her wineglass and poured herself another from the bottle on the coffee table you cant have a family alone but travis i dont want to ruin the evening by talking more about my marriage im trying to make some changes travis let it go she picked up his silence as understanding and brightened so what did you want to do when you grew up honestly dont tell me you wanted to be a housewife too when i was growing up thats all any girl wanted to be where did you grow up siberia pennsylvania i grew up on a farm and what did the farm boy from pennsylvania want to be when he grew up a priest jenny laughed i never knew anyone who wanted to be a priest what did you do while the other boys were playing army give last rights to the dead no it wasnt like that my mother always wanted me to be a priest as soon as i was old enough i went away to seminary it didnt work out so you became an insurance man i suppose that works i read once that all religions and insurance companies are supported by the fear of death thats pretty cynical the demonkeeper said im sorry travis i dont have much faith in the concept of an allpowerful being that would glorify war and violence you should are you trying to convert me no its just that i know absolutely that god exists no one knows anything absolutely im not without faith i have my own beliefs but i have my doubts too so did i did what happened did the holy spirit come to you in the night and say go forth and sell insurance something like that travis forced a smile travis you are a very strange man i really didnt want to talk about religion good ill tell you my beliefs in the morning youll be quite shocked im sure i doubt that i really do did you say in the morning jenny held her hand out to him inside she was unsure of what she was doing but it seemed fine at least it didnt feel wrong did i miss something travis asked i thought you were angry with me no why would i be angry at you because of my faith i think its cute cute cute you think the roman catholic church is cute a hundred popes are rolling in their graves jenny good they arent invited move over here are you sure he said youve had a lot of wine she was not sure at all nevertheless she nodded to him she was single right she liked him right well hell it was started now he slid down the couch to her side and took her in his arms they kissed awkwardly at first he was too aware of himself and she was still wondering if she should have invited him in in the first place he held her tighter and she arched her back and pushed against him and they both forgot their reservations the world outside ceased to exist when they finally broke the kiss he buried his face in her hair and held her tight so she could not pull away and see the tears in his eyes jenny he said softly its been a long time she shushed him and dug her hands into his hair everything will be fine just fine perhaps it was because they were both afraid or perhaps it was because they really didnt know each other it might even have been that by playing a role they would not have to face anything but the moment the roles they played throughout the night changed first each gave when the other needed and later when need was no longer an issue they played their roles out to felicity it progressed thusly she was the comforter he the comforted then he was the understanding counselor she the confused confessor she became the nurse he the patient in traction he took the role of the naive stable boy she the seductive duchess he was the drill sergeant she the raw recruit she was the cruel master he the helpless slave girl the small hours of the morning found them naked on the kitchen floor after travis had played a rampaging godzilla to jennifers unsuspecting tokyo they were crouched over a cooking toaster oven each with a table knife loaded with butter poised like executioners waiting for the signal to drop their blades they polished off a loaf of toast a halfpound of butter a quart of tofu ice cream a box of whole wheat creamsandwich cookies a bag of unsalted blue corn chips and an organically grown watermelon that gushed pink juice down their chins while they laughed stuffed satisfied and stickysweet they returned to bed and fell asleep in a warm tangle perhaps it wasnt love that they had in common perhaps it was only a need for escape and forgetting but they found it three hours later the alarm clock sounded and jenny left to go wait tables at hps cafe travis slept dreamless groaning and smiling when she kissed him goodbye on the forehead when the explosions started travis woke up screaming part four monday the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand slimy things lived on and so did i samuel taylor coleridge rime of the ancient mariner rivera rivera came through the trailer door followed by two uniformed officers robert sat up on the couch and was immediately rolled over and handcuffed rivera read him his miranda rights before he was completely awake when roberts vision cleared rivera was sitting in a chair in front of him holding a piece of paper in his face robert i am detective sergeant alphonse rivera a badge wallet flipped open in riveras other hand this is a warrant for your and the breezes arrest theres one here to search this trailer as well which is what i and deputies deforest and perez will be doing in just a moment a uniformed officer appeared from the far end of the trailer hes not here sergeant thanks rivera said to the uniform to robert he said things will go easier for you if you tell me right now where i can find the breeze robert was starting to get a foggy idea of what was going on so youre not a dealer he asked sleepily youre quick masterson wheres the breeze the breeze didnt have anything to do with it hes been gone for two days i took the suitcase because i wanted to know who the guy was that was with my wife what suitcase robert nodded toward the livingroom floor the haliburton case lay there unopened rivera picked it up and tried the latches its got a combination lock robert said i couldnt get it open sheriffs deputies were riffling through the trailer from the back bedroom one shouted rivera weve got it stay here robert ill be right back rivera rose and started toward the bedroom just as perez appeared in the kitchen holding another aluminum suitcase that it rivera asked perez a dark hispanic who seemed too small to be a deputy threw the suitcase on the kitchen table and opened the lid jackpot he said neat square blocks of plasticcovered green weed lay in even rows across the suitcase robert could smell a faint odor like skunk coming from the marijuana ill get the testing kit perez said rivera took a deep sniff and looked at perez quizzically right it could be just lawn clippings that they weighed out in pounds perez looked hurt by riveras sarcasm but for the record rivera waved him away then returned to the couch and sat down next to robert you are in deep trouble my friend you know robert said i felt really bad about being so rude to you yesterday when you came by he smiled weakly ive been going through some really hard times make it up to me robert tell me where the breeze is i dont know then you are going to eat shit for all that pot over there on the table i didnt even know it was there i thought you guys were here about the suitcase i took the other one robert you and i are going to go back to the station and have a really long talk you can tell me all about the suitcase and all the folks that the breeze has been keeping company with sergeant rivera i dont mean to be rude or anything but i wasnt quite awake when you were telling me the charges sir rivera helped robert to his feet and led him out of the trailer possession of marijuana for sale and conspiracy to sell marijuana actually the conspiracy charge is the nastier of the two so you didnt even know about the suitcase i took i couldnt care less about the suitcase rivera pushed robert into the cruiser watch your head you should bring it along just to see who the guy was that it belonged to your guys in the lab can open it and rivera slammed the car door on roberts comment he turned to deforest who was coming out of the trailer grab that suitcase out of the living room and tag it more pot sarge i dont think so but the whacko seems to think its important augustus brine augustus brine was sitting in his pickup parked a block away from jennys house in the morning twilight he could just make out the outline of jennys toyota and an old chevy parked in front the king of the djinn sat in the passenger seat next to brine his rheumy blue eyes just clearing the dashboard brine was sipping from a cup of his special secret roast coffee the thermos was empty and he was savoring the last full cup the last cup perhaps that he would ever drink he tried to call up a zen calm but it was not forthcoming and he berated himself trying to think about it pushed it farther from his grasp like trying to bite the teeth the zen proverb went there is not only nothing to grasp but nothing with which to grasp it the closest he was going to get to nomind was to go home and destroy a few million brain cells with a few bottles of wine not an option you are troubled augustus brine the djinn had been silent for over an hour at the sound of his voice brine was startled and almost spilled his coffee its the car brine said what if the demon is in the car theres no way to know i will go look look you said he was invisible i will get in the car and feel around i will sense him if he is that close and if hes there i will come back and tell you he cannot harm me no brine stroked his beard i dont want them to know were here until the last minute ill risk it i hope you can move fast augustus brine if catch sees you he will be on you in an instant i can move brine said with a confidence that he did not feel he felt like a fat old man tired and a little wired from too much coffee and not enough sleep the woman the djinn poked brine with a bony finger jenny was coming out of the house in her waitress uniform she made her way down the front steps and across the shallow front yard to her toyota at least shes still alive brine was preparing to move with jenny out of the house one of their problems was solved but there would be little time to act the demonkeeper could come out at any moment if their trap was not set all would be lost the toyota turned over twice and died a cloud of blue smoke coughed out of the exhaust pipe the engine cranked caught again sputtered and died blue smoke if she goes back to the house we have to stop her brine said you will give yourself away the trap will not work i cant let her go back in that house she is only one woman augustus brine the demon catch will kill thousands if he is not stopped shes a friend of mine the toyota cranked again weakly whining like an injured animal then fired up jenny revved the engine and pulled away leaving a trail of oily smoke thats it brine said lets go brine started the truck pulled forward and stopped turn off the engine the djinn said youre out of your mind we leave it running how will you hear the demon if he comes before you are ready begrudgingly brine turned off the key go he said brine and the djinn jumped out of the truck and ran around to the bed brine dropped the tailgate there were twenty tenpound bags of flour each with a wire sticking out of the top brine grabbed a bag in each hand ran to the middle of the yard paying out wire behind him as he went the djinn wrestled one bag out of the truck and carried it like a babe in his arms to the far corner of the yard with each trip to the truck brine could feel panic growing inside him the demon could be anywhere behind him the djinn stepped on a twig and brine swung around clutching his chest it is only me the djinn said if the demon is here he will come after me first you may have time to escape just get these unloaded brine said ninety seconds after they had started the front yard was dotted with flour bags and a spider web of wires led back to the truck brine hoisted the djinn into the bed of the truck and handed him two lead wires the djinn took the wires and crouched over a car battery that brine had secured to the bed of the truck with duct tape count ten then touch the wires to the battery brine said after they go off start the truck brine turned and ran across the yard to the front steps the small porch was too close to the ground for brine to crawl under so he crouched beside it covering his face with his arms counting to himself seven eight nine ten brine braced himself for the explosion the seal bombs were not powerful enough to cause injury when detonated one at a time but twenty at once might produce a considerable shock wave eleven twelve thirteen fourteen shit brine stood up and tried to see into the bed of the truck the wires gian hen gian it is done came the answer before brine could say anything else the explosions began not a single blast but a series of blasts like a huge string of firecrackers for a moment the world turned white with flour then storms of flame swirled around the front of the house and mushroomed into the sky as the airborne flour was ignited by successive explosions the lower branches of the pines were seared and pine needles crackled as they burned at the sight of the fire storms brine dove to the ground and covered his head when the explosion subsided he stood and tried to see through the fog of flour smoke and soot that hung in the air behind him he heard the front door open he turned and reached up into the doorway felt his hand close around the front of a mans shirt and yanked back hoping he was not pulling a demon down off the steps catch the man screamed catch unable to see though the gritty air brine punched blindly at the squirming man his meaty fist connected with something hard and the man went limp in his arms brine heard the truck start he dragged the unconscious man across the yard toward the sound of the running engine in the distance a siren began to wail he bumped into the truck before he saw it he opened the door and threw the man onto the front seat knocking gian hen gian against the opposite door brine jumped into the truck put it into gear and sped out of the doughy conflagration into the light of morning you did not tell me there would be fire the djinn said i didnt know brine coughed and wiped flour out of his eyes i thought all the charges would go off at once i forgot that the fuses would burn at different rates i didnt know that flour would catch fire it was just supposed to cover everything so we could see the demon coming the demon catch was not there brine was on the verge of losing control covered in flour and soot he looked like an enraged abominable snowman how do you know that if we didnt have the cover of the flour i might be dead now you didnt know where he was before how can you know he wasnt there huh how do you know the demonkeeper has lost control of catch otherwise you would not have been able to harm him why didnt you tell me that before why dont you tell me these things in advance i forgot i might have been killed to die in the service of the great gian hen gian what an honor i envy you augustus brine the djinn removed his stocking cap shook off the flour and held it to his chest in salute his bald head was the only part of him that was not covered in flour augustus brine began to laugh what is funny the djinn asked you look like a worn brown crayon brine was snorting with laughter king of the djinn give me a break whats so funny travis said groggily keeping his left hand on the wheel augustus brine snapped out his right fist and coldcocked the demonkeeper amanda amanda elliot told her daughter that she wanted to leave early to beat the monterey traffic but the truth was that she didnt sleep well away from home the idea of spending another morning in estelles guest room trying to be quiet while waiting for the house to awaken was more than she could stand she was up at five dressed and on the road before fivethirty estelle stood in the driveway in her nightgown waving as her mother drove away over the last few years amandas visits had been tearful and miserable estelle could not resist pointing out that each moment she spent with her mother might be the last amanda responded at first by comforting her daughter and assuring her that she would be around for many more years to come but as time passed estelle refused to let the subject lie and amanda answered her concern with pointed comparisons between her own energy level and that of estelles layabout husband herb if it werent for his finger moving on the remote control youd never know he was alive at all as much as amanda was irritated by effrom marauding around the house like an old tomcat she needed only to think of herb permanently affixed to estelles couch to put her own husband in a favorable light compared to herb effrom was errol flynn and douglas fairbanks rolled into one a connubial hero amanda missed him she drove five miles per hour over the speed limit changing lanes aggressively and checking her mirrors for highway patrol cars she was an old woman but she refused to drive like one she made the hundred miles to pine cove in just over an hour and a half effrom would be in his workshop now working on his wood carvings and smoking cigarettes she wasnt supposed to know about the cigarettes any more than she was supposed to know that effrom spent every morning watching the womens exercise show men have to have their secret lives and forbidden pleasures real or perceived cookies snitched from the jar are always sweeter than those served on a plate and nothing evokes the prurient like puritanism amanda played her role for effrom staying on his tail keeping him alert to the possibility of discovery but never quite catching him in the act today she would pull in the driveway and rev the engine take a long time getting into the house to make sure that effrom heard her coming so he could take a shot of breath spray to cover the smell of tobacco on his breath didnt it occur to the old fart that she was the one who bought the breath spray and brought it home with the groceries each week silly old man when amanda entered the house she noticed an acrid burnt smell in the air she had never smelled cordite so she assumed that effrom had been cooking she went to the kitchen expecting to see the ruined remains of one of her frying pans but the kitchen except for a few cracker crumbs on the counter was clean maybe the smell was coming from the workshop amanda usually avoided going near effroms workshop when he was working mainly to avoid the sound of the highspeed drills he used for carving which reminded her of the unpleasantness of the dentists office today there was no sound coming from the workshop she knocked on the door gently so as not to startle him effrom im home he had to be able to hear her a chill ran through her she had imagined finding effrom cold and stiff a thousand times but always she was able to push the thought out of her mind effrom open this door she had never entered the workshop except for a few toys that effrom dragged out at christmastime to donate to local charities amanda never even saw any of the carvings he produced the workshop was effroms sacred domain amanda paused her hand on the doorknob maybe she should call someone maybe she should call her granddaughter jennifer and have her come over if effrom were dead she didnt want to face it alone but what if he was just hurt lying there on the floor waiting for help she opened the door effrom was not there she breathed a sigh of relief then her anxiety returned where was he the workshops shelves were filled with carved wooden figures some only a few inches high some several feet long every one of them was a figure of a nude woman hundreds of nude women she studied each figure fascinated with this new aspect of her husbands secret life the figures were running reclining crouching and dancing except for a few figures on the workbench that were still in the rough stage each of the carvings was polished and oiled and incredibly detailed and they all had something in common they were studies of amanda most were of her when she was younger but they were unmistakably her amanda standing amanda reclining amanda dancing as if effrom were trying to preserve her she felt a scream rising in her chest and tears filling her eyes she turned away from the carvings and left the workshop effrom where are you you old fart she went from room to room looking in every corner and closet no effrom effrom didnt go for walks and even if hed had a car he didnt drive anymore if he had gone somewhere with a friend he would have left a note besides all his friends were dead the pine cove poker club had lost its members one by one until solitaire was the only game in town she went to the kitchen and stood by the phone call who the police the hospital what would they say when she told them she had been home almost five minutes and couldnt find her husband they would tell her to wait they wouldnt understand that effrom had to be here he couldnt be anywhere else she would call her granddaughter jenny would know what to do she would understand amanda took a deep breath and dialed the number a machine answered the phone she stood there waiting for the beep when it came she tried to keep her voice controlled jenny honey this is grandma call me i cant find your grandfather then she hung up and began sobbing the phone rang and amanda jumped back she picked it up before the second ring hello oh good youre home it was a womans voice mrs elliot youve probably seen the bullet hole in your bedroom door dont be frightened if you listen carefully and follow my instructions everything will be fine traviss story augustus brine sat in one of the big leather chairs in front of his fireplace drinking red wine from a balloon goblet and puffing away on his meerschaum he had promised himself that he would have only one glass of wine just to take the edge off the adrenaline and caffeine jangle he had worked himself into during the kidnapping now he was on his third glass and the wine had infused him with a warm oozy feeling he let his mind drift in a dreamy vertigo before attacking the task at hand interrogating the demonkeeper the fellow looked harmless enough propped up and tied to the other wing chair but if gian hen gian was to be believed this dark young man was the most dangerous human on earth brine considered washing up before waking the demonkeeper he had caught a glimpse of himself in the bathroom mirror his beard and clothing covered with flour and soot his skin caked with sweatstreaked goo and decided that he would make a more intimidating impression in his current condition he had found the smelling salts in the medicine cabinet and sent gian hen gian to the bathroom to bathe while he rested actually he wanted the djinn out of the room while he questioned the demonkeeper the djinns curses and ravings would only complicate an already difficult task brine set his wineglass and his pipe on the end table and picked up a cottonwrapped smellingsalt capsule he leaned over to the demonkeeper and snapped the capsule under his nose for a moment nothing happened and brine feared that he had hit him too hard then the demonkeeper started coughing looked at brine and screamed calm down youre all right brine said catch help me the demonkeeper struggled against his bonds brine picked up his pipe and lit it affecting a bored nonchalance after a moment the demonkeeper settled down brine blew a thin stream of smoke into the air between them catch isnt here youre on your own travis seemed to forget that he had been beaten kidnapped and tied up his concentration was focused on brines last statement what do you mean catch isnt here you know about catch brine considered giving him the imaskingthequestionshere line that he had heard so many times in detective movies but upon reflection it seemed silly he wasnt a hardass why play the role yes i know about the demon i know that he eats people and i know you are his master how do you know all that it doesnt matter brine said i also know that youve lost control of catch i have travis seemed genuinely shaken by this look i dont know who you are but you cant keep me here if catch is out of control again im the only one that can stop him im really close to ending all this you cant stop me now why should you care what do you mean why should i care you might know about catch but you cant imagine what hes like when hes out of control what i mean brine said is why should you care about the damage he causes you called him up didnt you you send him out to kill dont you travis shook his head violently you dont understand im not what you think i never wanted this and now i have a chance to stop it let me go i can end it why should i trust you youre a murderer no catch is whats the difference if i do let you go it will be because you will have told me what i want to know and how i can use that information now ill listen and youll talk i cant tell you anything and you dont want to know anyway i promise you i want to know where the seal of solomon is and i want to know the incantation that sends catch back until i know youre not going anywhere seal of solomon i dont know what youre talking about look what is your name anyway travis look travis brine said my associate wants to use torture i dont like the idea but if you jerk me around torture might be the only way to go dont you have to have two guys to play good cop bad cop my associate is taking a bath i wanted to see if i could reason with you before i let him near you i really dont know what hes capable of im not even sure what he is so if we could get on with this it would be better for the both of us wheres jenny travis asked shes fine shes at work you wont hurt her im not some kind of terrorist travis i didnt ask to be involved in this but i am i dont want to hurt you and i would never hurt jenny shes a friend of mine so if i tell you what i know youll let me go thats the deal but ill have to make sure that what you tell me is true brine relaxed this young man didnt seem to have any of the qualities of a mass murderer if anything he seemed a little naive okay ill tell you everything i know about catch and the incantations but i swear to you i dont know anything about any seal of solomon its a pretty strange story i guessed that brine said shoot he poured himself a glass of wine relit his pipe and sat back propping his feet up on the hearth like i said its a pretty strange story strange is my middle name brine said that must have been difficult for you as a child travis said would you get on with it you asked for it travis took a deep breath i was born in clarion pennsylvania in the year nineteen hundred bullshit brine interrupted youre not a day over twentyfive this is going to take a lot more time if i have to keep stopping just listen itll all fall into place brine grumbled and nodded for travis to continue i was born on a farm my parents were irish immigrants black irish i was the oldest of six children two boys and four girls my parents were staunch catholics my mother wanted me to be a priest she pushed me to study so i could get into seminary she was working on the local diocese to recommend me while i was still in the womb when world war i broke out she begged the bishop to get me into seminary early everybody knew it was just a matter of time before america entered the war my mother wanted me in seminary before the army could draft me boys from secular colleges were already in europe driving ambulances and some of them had been killed my mother wasnt going to lose her chance to have a son become a priest to something as insignificant as a world war you see my little brother was a bit slow mentally i mean i was my mothers only chance so you went to seminary brine interjected he was becoming impatient with the progress of the story i went in at sixteen which made me at least four years younger than the other boys my mother packed me some sandwiches and i packed myself into a threadbare black suit that was three sizes too small for me and i was on the train to illinois you have to understand i didnt want any part of this stuff with the demon i really wanted to be a priest of all the people i had known as a child the priest seemed like the only one who had any control over things the crops could fail banks could close people could get sick and die but the priest and the church were always there calm and steadfast and all that mysticism was pretty nifty too what about women brine asked he had resolved himself to hearing an epic and it seemed as if travis needed to tell it brine found he liked the strange young man in spite of himself you dont miss what youve never known i mean i had these urges but they were sinful right i just had to say get thee behind me satan and get on with it thats the most incredible thing youve told me so far brine said when i was sixteen sex seemed like the only reason to go on living thats what they thought at seminary too because i was younger than the others the prefect of discipline father jasper took me on as his special project to keep me from impure thoughts he made me work constantly in the evenings when the others were given time for prayer and meditation i was sent to the chapel to polish the silver while the others ate i worked in the kitchen serving and washing dishes for two years the only rest i had from dawn until midnight was during classes and mass when i fell behind in my studies father jasper rode me even harder the vatican had given the seminary a set of silver candlesticks for the altar supposedly they had been commissioned by one of the early popes and were over six hundred years old the candlesticks were the most prized possession of the seminary and it was my job to polish them father jasper stood over me evening after evening chiding me and berating me for being impure in thought i polished the silver until my hands were black from the compound and still father jasper found fault with me if i had impure thoughts it was because he kept reminding me to have them i had no friends in seminary father jasper had put his mark on me and the other students shunned me for fear of invoking the prefect of disciplines wrath i wrote home when i had a chance but for some reason my letters were never answered i began to suspect that father jasper was keeping my letters from getting to me one evening while i was polishing the silver on the altar father jasper came to the chapel and started to lecture me on my evil nature you are impure in thought and deed yet you do not confess he said you are evil travis and it is my duty to drive that evil out i couldnt take it any longer where are my letters i blurted out you are keeping me from my family father jasper was furious yes i keep your letters you are spawned from a womb of evil how else could you have come here so young i waited for eight years to come to saint anthonys waited in the cold of the world while others were taken into the warm bosom of christ at last i knew why i had been singled out for punishment it had nothing to do with my spiritual impurity it was jealousy i said and you father jasper have you confessed your jealousy and your pride have you confessed your cruelty cruel am i he said he laughed at me and for the first time i was really afraid of him there is no cruelty in the bosom of christ only tests of faith your faith is wanting travis i will show you he told me to lie with arms outstretched on the steps before the altar and pray for strength he left the chapel for a moment and when he returned i could hear something whistling through the air i looked up and saw that he was carrying a thin whip cut from a willow branch have you no humility travis bow your head before our lord i could hear him moving behind me but i could not see him why i didnt leave right then i dont know perhaps i believed that father jasper was actually testing my faith that he was the cross i had to bear he tore my robe up the back exposing my bare back and legs you will not cry out travis after each blow a hail mary now he said then i felt the whip across my back and i thought i would scream but instead i said a hail mary he threw a rosary in front of me and told me to take it i held it behind my head feeling the pain come with every bead you are a coward travis you dont deserve to serve our lord you are here to avoid the war arent you travis i didnt answer him and the whip fell again after a while i heard him laughing with each stroke of the whip i did not look back for fear he might strike me across the eyes before i had finished the rosary i heard him gasp and drop to the floor behind me i thought no i hoped he had had a heart attack but when i looked back he was kneeling behind me gasping for air exhausted but smiling face down sinner he screamed he drew back the whip as if he were going to strike me in the face and i covered my head you will tell no one of this he said his voice was low and calm for some reason that scared me more than his anger you are to stay the night here polish the silver and pray for forgiveness i will return in the morning with a new robe for you if you speak of this to anyone i will see that you are expelled from saint anthonys and if i can manage it excommunicated i hadnt ever heard excommunication used as a threat it was something we studied in class the popes had used it as an instrument of political control but the reality of being excluded from salvation by someone else had never really occurred to me i didnt believe that father jasper could really excommunicate me but i wasnt going to test it while father jasper watched i began to polish the candlesticks rubbing furiously to take my mind off the pain in my back and legs and to try to forget that he was watching finally he left the chapel when i heard the door close i threw the candlestick i was holding at the door father jasper had tested my faith and i had failed i cursed the trinity the virgin and all the saints i could remember eventually my anger subsided and i feared father jasper would return and see what i had done i retrieved the candlestick and inspected it to see if i had done any damage father jasper would check them in the morning as he always did and i would be lost there was a deep scratch across the axis of the candlestick i rubbed at it harder and harder but it only seemed to get worse soon i realized that it wasnt a scratch at all but a seam that had been concealed by the silversmith the priceless artifact from the vatican was a sham it was supposed to be solid silver but here was evidence that it was hollow i grabbed both ends of the candlestick and twisted as i suspected it unscrewed there was a sort of triumph in it i wanted to be holding the two pieces when father jasper returned i wanted to wave them in his face here i would say these are as hollow and false as you are i would expose him ruin him and if i was expelled and damned i didnt care but i never got the chance to confront him when i pulled the two pieces apart a tightly rolled piece of parchment fell out the invocation brine interrupted yes but i didnt know what it was i unrolled it and started to read there was a passage at the top in latin which i didnt have much trouble translating it said something about calling down help from god to deal with enemies of the church it was signed by his holiness pope leo the third the second part was written in greek as i said i had fallen behind in my studies so the greek was difficult i started reading it aloud working on each word as i went by the time i was through the first passage it had started to get cold in the chapel i wasnt sure what i was reading some of the words were mysteries to me i just read over them trying to glean what i could from the context then something seemed to take over my mind i started reading the greek as if it were my native language pronouncing the words perfectly without having the slightest idea of what they meant a wind whipped up inside the chapel blowing out all the candles except for a little moonlight coming through the windows it was completely dark but the words on the parchment began to glow and i kept reading i was locked into the parchment as if i had grabbed an electric wire and couldnt let go when i read the last line i found i was screaming the words lightning flashed down from the roof and struck the candlestick which was lying on the floor in front of me the wind stopped and smoke filled the chapel nothing prepares you for something like that you can spend your life preparing to be the instrument of god you can read accounts of possession and exorcism and try to imagine yourself in the situation but when it actually happens you just shut down i did anyway i sat there trying to figure out what i had done but my mind wouldnt work the smoke floated up into the rafters of the chapel and i could make out a huge figure standing at the altar it was catch in his eating form whats his eating form brine asked i assume from the deal with the flour that you know catch is visible to others only when he is in his eating form most of the time i see him as a threefoot imp covered with scales when he feeds or goes out of control hes a giant ive seen him cut a man in half with one swipe of his claws i dont know why it works that way i just know that when i saw him for the first time i had never been so frightened he looked around the chapel then at me then at the chapel i was praying under my breath begging god for protection stop it he said ill take care of everything then he went down the aisle and through the chapel doors knocking them off their hinges he turned and looked back at me he said you have to open these things right i forgot its been a while as soon as he was gone i picked up the candlesticks and ran i got as far as the front gates before i realized that i was still wearing the torn robe i wanted to get away hide forget what i had seen but i had to go back and get my clothes i ran back to my quarters since i was in my third year at seminary i been given a small private room so thankfully i didnt have to go through the dormitory ward rooms where the newer students slept the only clothes i had were the suit i had worn when i came and a pair of overalls i wore when i worked in the seminary fields i tried to put on the suit but the pants were just too tight so i put the overalls on and wore the suit jacket over them to cover my shoulders i wrapped the candlesticks in a blanket and headed for the gate when i was just outside the gate i heard a horrible scream from the rectory there was no mistaking it was father jasper i ran the six miles into town without stopping the sun was coming up as i reached the train station and a train was pulling away from the platform i didnt know where it was going but i ran after it and managed to swing myself on board before i collapsed id like to tell you i had some kind of plan but i didnt my only thought was to get as far away from st anthonys as i could i dont know why i took the candlesticks i wasnt interested in their value i guess i didnt want to leave any evidence of what id done or maybe it was the influence of the supernatural anyway i caught my breath and went into the passenger car to find a seat the train was nearly full soldiers and a few civilians here and there i staggered down the aisle and fell into the first empty seat i could find it was next to a young woman who was reading a book this seat is taken she said please just let me rest here for a minute i begged ill get up when your companion returns she looked up from her book and i found myself staring into the biggest bluest eyes id ever seen i will never forget them she was young about my age and wore her dark hair pinned up under a hat which was the style in those days she looked genuinely frightened of me i guess i was wearing my own fright on my face are you all right shall i call the conductor she asked i thanked her but told her that i just needed to rest a moment she was looking at the strange way i was dressed trying to be polite but obviously perplexed i looked up and noticed that everyone in the car was staring at me could they know about what id done i wondered then i realized why they were staring there was a war on and i was obviously the right age for the army yet i was dressed in civilian clothes im a seminary student i blurted out to them causing a breeze of incredulous whispers the girl blushed im sorry i said to her ill move on i started to rise but she put her hand on my shoulder to push me back into my seat and i winced when she touched my injured shoulder no she said im traveling alone ive just been saving this seat to ward off the soldiers you know how they can be sometimes father im not a priest yet i said i dont know what to call you then she said call me travis i said im amanda she said she smiled and for a moment i completely forgot why i was running she was an attractive girl but when she smiled she was absolutely stunning it was my turn to blush im going to new york to stay with my fiancés family hes in europe she said so this train is going east i asked she was surprised you dont even know where the train is going she asked ive had a bad night i said then i started to laugh i dont know why it seemed so unreal the idea of trying to explain it to her seemed silly she looked away and started digging in her purse im sorry i said i didnt mean to offend you you didnt offend me i need to have my ticket ready for the conductor id completely forgotten about not having a ticket i looked up and saw the conductor coming down the aisle i jumped up and a wave of fatigue hit me i almost fell into her lap is something wrong she asked amanda i said you have been very kind but i should find another seat and let you travel in peace you dont have a ticket do you she said i shook my head ive been in seminary id forgotten we dont have any need for money there and i have some traveling money she said i couldnt ask you to do that i said then i remembered the candlesticks look you can have these theyre worth a lot of money hold them and ill send you the money for the ticket when i get home i said i unrolled the blanket and dropped the candlesticks in her lap thats not necessary she said ill loan you the money no i insist you take them i said trying to be gallant i must have looked ridiculous standing there in my overalls and tattered suit jacket if you insist she said i understand my fiancé is a proud man too she gave me the money i needed and i bought a ticket all the way to clarion which was only about ten miles from my parents farm the train broke down somewhere in indiana and we were forced to wait in the station while they changed engines it was midsummer and terribly hot without thinking i took off my jacket and amanda gasped when she saw my back she insisted that i see a doctor but i refused knowing that i would only have to borrow more money from her to pay for it we sat on a bench in the station while she cleaned my back with damp napkins from the dining car in those days the sight of a woman bathing a halfnaked man in a train station would have been scandalous but most of the passengers were soldiers and were much more concerned with being awol or with their ultimate destination europe so we were ignored for the most part amanda disappeared for a while and returned just before our train was ready to leave ive reserved a berth in the sleeping car for us she said i was shocked i started to protest but she stopped me she said you are going to sleep and i am going to watch over you you are a priest and im engaged so there is nothing wrong with it besides you are in no shape to spend the night sitting up in a train i think it was then that i realized that i was in love with her not that it mattered it was just that after living so long with father jaspers abuse i wasnt prepared for the kindness she was showing me it never occurred to me that i might be putting her in danger as we pulled away from the station i looked out on the platform and for the first time i saw catch in his smaller form why it happened then and not before i dont know maybe i didnt have any strength left but when i saw him there on the platform flashing a big razortoothed grin i fainted when i came to i felt like my back was on fire i was lying in the sleeping berth and amanda was bathing my back with alcohol i told them youd been wounded in france she said the porter helped me get you in here i think its about time you told me who did this to you i told her what father jasper had done leaving out the parts about the demon i was in tears when i finished and she was holding me rocking me back and forth im not sure how it happened the passion of the moment and all that i guess but the next thing i knew we were kissing and i was undressing her just as we were about to make love she stopped me i have to take this off she said she was wearing a wooden bracelet with the initials e a burnt into it we dont have to do this i said have you mr brine ever said something that you know you will always regret i have it was we dont have to do this she said oh then lets not she fell asleep holding me while i lay awake thinking about sex and damnation which really wasnt any different from what id thought about each night in the seminary a little more immediate i guess i was just dozing off when i heard a commotion coming from the opposite end of our sleeping car i peeked through the curtains of the berth to see what was happening catch was coming down the aisle looking into berths as he went i didnt know at the time that catch was invisible to other people and i couldnt understand why they werent screaming at the sight of him people were shouting and looking out of their berths but all they were seeing was empty air i grabbed my overalls and jumped into the aisle leaving my jacket and the candlesticks in the berth with amanda i didnt even thank her i ran down the aisle toward the back of the car away from catch as i ran i could hear him yelling why are you running dont you know the rules i went through the door between the cars and slid it shut behind me by now people were screaming not out of fear of catch but because a naked man was running through the sleeping car i looked into the next car and saw the conductor coming down the aisle toward me catch was almost to the door behind me without thinking or even looking i opened the door to the outside and leapt off the train naked my overalls still in hand the train was on a trestle at the time and it was a long drop to the ground fifty or sixty feet by all rights i should have been killed when i hit the wind was knocked out of me and i remember thinking that my back was broken but in seconds i was up and running through a wooden valley i didnt realize until later that i had been protected by my pact with the demon even through he was not under my control at the time i dont really know the extent of his protection but ive been in a hundred accidents since then that should have killed me and come out without a scratch i ran through the woods until i came to a dirt road i had no idea where i was i just walked until i couldnt walk anymore and then sat down at the side of the road just after sunup a rickety wagon pulled up beside me and the farmer asked me if i was all right in those days it wasnt uncommon to see a barefoot kid in overalls by the side of the road the farmer informed me that i was only about twenty miles from home i told him that i was a student on holiday trying to hitchhike home and he offered to drive me i fell asleep in the wagon when the farmer woke me we were stopped at the gate of my parents farm i thanked him and walked up the road toward the house i guess i should have known right away that something was wrong at that time of the morning everyone should have been out working but the barnyard was deserted except for a few chickens i could hear the two dairy cows mooing in the barn when they should have already been milked and put out to pasture i had no idea what i would tell my parents i hadnt thought about what i would do when i got home only that i wanted to get there i ran in the back door expecting to find my mother in the kitchen but she wasnt there my family rarely left the farm and they certainly wouldnt have gone anywhere without taking care of the animals first my first thought was that there had been an accident perhaps my father had fallen from the tractor and they had taken him to the hospital in clarion i ran to the front of the house my fathers wagon was tied up out front i bolted through the house shouting into every room but there was no one home i found myself standing on the front porch wondering what to do next when i heard his voice from behind me you cant run from me catch said i turned he was sitting on the porch swing dangling his feet in the air i was afraid but i was also angry where is my family i screamed he patted his stomach gone he said what have you done with them i said theyre gone forever he said i ate them i was enraged i grabbed the porch swing and pushed it with everything i had the swing banged against the porch rail and catch went over the edge into the dirt my father kept a chopping block and an ax in front of the house for splitting kindling i jumped off the porch and snatched up the ax catch was just picking himself up when i him in the forehead with it sparks flew and the ax blade bounced off his head as if it had hit cast iron before i knew it i was on my back and catch was sitting on my chest grinning like the demon in that fuselli painting the nightmare he didnt seem at all angry i flailed under him but could not get up look he said this is silly you called me up to do a job and i did it so whats all the commotion about by the way you would have loved it i clipped the priests hamstrings and watched him crawl around begging for a while i really like eating priests theyre always convinced that the creator is testing them you killed my family i said i was still trying to free myself well that sort of thing happens when you run away its all your fault if you didnt want the responsibility you shouldnt have called me up you knew what you were getting into when you renounced the creator but i didnt i protested then i remembered my curses in the chapel i had renounced god i didnt know i said well if youre going to be a weenie about it ill fill you in on the rules he said first you cant run away from me you called me up and i am more or less your servant forever when i say forever i mean forever you are not going to age and you are not going to be sick the second thing you need to know is that i am immortal you whack me with axes all you want and all youll get is a dull ax and a sore back so just save your energy third i am catch they call me the destroyer and thats what i do with my help you can rule the world and other really swell stuff in the past my masters havent used me to the best advantage but you might be the exception although i doubt it fourth when im in this form you are the only one who can see me when i take on my destroyer form i am visible to everyone its stupid and why its that way is a long story but thats the way it is in the past they decided to keep me a secret but theres no rule about it he paused and climbed off my chest i got to my feet and dusted myself off my head was spinning with what catch had told me i had no way of knowing whether he was telling the truth but i had nothing else to go on when you encounter the supernatural your mind searches for an explanation id had the explanation laid in my lap but i didnt want to believe it i said so youre from hell i know it was a stupid question but even a seminary education doesnt prepare you for a conversation with a demon no he said im from paradise youre lying i said it was the beginning of a string of lies and misdirections that have gone on for seventy years he said no really im from paradise its a little town about thirty miles outside of newark then he started laughing and rolling around in the dirt holding his sides how can i get rid of you i asked sorry he said ive told you everything that i have to at the time i didnt know how dangerous catch was somehow i realized that i was in no immediate danger so i tried to come up with some sort of plan to get rid of him i didnt want to stay there at the farm and i didnt have anywhere i could go my first instinct was to turn to the church if i could get to a priest perhaps i could have the demon exorcised i led catch into town where i asked the local priest to perform an exorcism before i could convince him of catchs existence the demon became visible and ate the priest piece by piece before my eyes i realized then that catchs power was beyond the comprehension of any normal priest perhaps the entire church christians are supposed to believe in evil as an active force if you deny evil you deny good and therefore god but belief in evil is as much an act of faith as belief in god and here i was faced with evil as a reality not an abstraction my faith was gone it was no longer required there was indeed evil in the world and that evil was me it was my responsibility i reasoned to not let that evil become manifest to other people and thereby steal their faith i had to keep catchs existence a secret i might not be able to stop him from taking lives but i could keep him from taking souls i decided to remove him to a safe place where there were no people for him to feed on we hopped a freight and rode it to colorado where i led catch high into the mountains there i found a remote cabin where i thought he would be without victims weeks passed and i found that i had some control over the demon i could make him fetch water and wood sometimes but other times he defied me ive never understood the inconsistency of his obedience once i had accepted the fact that i couldnt run away from catch i questioned him constantly looking for some clue that might send him back to hell he was vague to say the least giving me little to go on except that he had been on earth before and that someone had sent him back after we had been in the mountains for two months a search party came to the cabin it seemed that hunters in the area of the cabin as well as people in villages as far as twenty miles away had been disappearing when i was asleep at night catch had been ranging for victims it was obvious that isolation wasnt going to keep the demon from killing i sent the search party away and set myself on coming up with some kind of plan i knew we would have to move or people would discover that catch existed i knew there had to be some sort of logic to his presence on earth then while we were hiking out of the mountains it occurred to me that the key to sending catch back must have been concealed in another candlestick and i had left them on the train with the girl jumping off the train to escape catch may have cost me the only chance i had to get rid of him i searched my memory for anything that could lead me to the girl i had never asked where she was going or what her last name was in trying to recall details of my time with her i kept coming up with the image of those striking blue eyes they seemed etched into my memory while everything else faded could i go around the eastern united states asking anyone if they had seen a young girl with beautiful blue eyes something nagged at me there was something that could lead me to the girl i just had to remember it then it hit me the wooden bracelet she wore the initials carved inside the heart were e a how hard could it be to search service records for a soldier with the first initial e his service records would have his next of kin and she was staying with his family i had a plan i took catch back east and began checking local draft boards i told them i had been in europe and a man whose first name began with e had saved my life and i wanted to find him they always asked about divisions and stations and where the battle had taken place i told them i had taken a shell fragment in the head and could remember nothing but the mans first initial no one believed me of course but they gave me what i asked for out of pity i think meanwhile catch kept taking his victims i tried to point him toward thieves and grifters when i could reasoning that if he must kill at least i could protect the innocent i haunted libraries looking for the oldest books on magic and demonology i could find perhaps somewhere i could find an incantation to send the demon back i performed hundreds of rituals drawing pentagrams collecting bizarre talismans and putting myself through all sorts of physical rigors and diets that were supposed to purify the sorcerer so the magic would work after repeated failures i realized that the volumes of magic were nothing more than the work of medieval snakeoil salesmen they always added the purity of the sorcerer as a condition so they would have an excuse for their customers when the magic did not work during this same time i was still looking for a priest who would perform an exorcism in baltimore i finally found one who believed my story he agreed to perform an exorcism for his protection we arranged to have him stand on a balcony while catch and i remained in the street below catch laughed himself silly through the entire ritual and when it was over he broke into the building and ate the priest i knew then that finding the girl was my only hope catch and i kept moving never staying in one place longer than two or three days fortunately there were no computers in those days that might have tracked the disappearances of catchs victims in each town i collected a list of veterans then ran leads to the ground by knocking on doors and questioning the families ive been doing that for over seventy years yesterday i think i found the man i was looking for as it turned out e was his middle initial his name is j effrom elliot i thought my luck had finally turned i mean the fact that the man is still alive is pretty lucky in itself i thought that i might have to trace the candlesticks through surviving relatives hoping that someone remembered them perhaps had kept them as an heirloom i thought it was all over but now catch is out of control and you are keeping me from stopping him forever augustus augustus brine lit his pipe and played back the details of traviss story in his mind he had finished the bottle of wine but if anything it had brought clarity to his thoughts by washing away the adrenaline from the mornings adventure there was a time travis that if someone had told me a story like that i would have called the mentalhealth people to come and pick him up but in the last twentyfour hours reality has been riding the dragons back and im just trying to hang on myself meaning what travis asked meaning i believe you brine rose from the chair and began untying the ropes that bound travis there was a scuffling behind them and brine turned to see gian hen gian coming through the living room wearing a flowered towel around his waist and another around his head brine thought he looked like a prune in a carmen miranda costume i am refreshed and ready for the torture augustus brine the djinn stopped when he saw brine untying the demonkeeper so will we hang the beast from a tall building by his heels until he talks lighten up king brine said travis flexed his arms to get the blood flowing who is that he asked that brine said is gian hen gian king of the djinn as in genie correct brine said i dont believe it you are not in a position to be incredulous toward the existence of supernatural beings travis besides the djinn was the one who told me how to find you he knew catch twentyfive centuries before you were born gian hen gian stepped forward and shook a knotted brown finger in traviss face tell us where the seal of solomon is hidden or we will have your genitals in a ninespeed reverse action blender with a fiveyear guarantee before you can say shazam brine raised an eyebrow toward the djinn you found the sears catalog in the bathroom the djinn nodded it is filled with many fine instruments of torture there wont be any need for that travis is trying to find the seal so he can send the demon back i told you travis said ive never seen the seal of solomon its a myth i read about it a hundred times in books of magic but it was always described differently i think they made it up in the middle ages to sell books of magic the djinn hissed at travis and there was a wisp of blue damask in the air you lie you could not call up catch without the seal brine raised a hand to the djinn to quiet him travis found the invocation for calling up the demon in a candlestick he never saw the seal but i believe it was concealed in the candlestick where he could not see it gian hen gian have you ever seen the seal of solomon would it be possible to conceal it in a candlestick it was a silver scepter in solomons time the djinn said i suppose it could have been made into a candlestick well travis thinks that the invocation for sending the demon back is concealed in the candlestick he didnt open id guess that anyone who had that knowledge and the seal of solomon would also have an invocation for giving you your power in fact id bet my life on it it is possible but it is also possible that the dark one is misdirecting you i dont think so brine said i dont think he wanted to be involved in this any more than i did in seventy years hes never figured out that its his will that controls catch the dark one is retarded then hey travis said enough brine said we have things to do gian hen gian go get dressed the djinn left the room without protest and brine turned again to travis i think you found the woman youve been looking for he said amanda and effrom elliot were married right after he returned from world war one they get their picture in the local paper every year on their anniversary you know under a caption that reads and they said it wouldnt last as soon as the king is ready well go over there and see if we can get the candlesticks if she still has them i need your word that i can trust you not to try to escape you have it travis said but i think we should go back to jennys house be ready when catch returns brine said i want you to try to put jenny out of your mind travis thats the only way youll regain control of the demon but first theres something you ought to know about her i know shes married no shes amandas granddaughter effrom never having died before effrom was confused about how he should go about it it didnt seem fair that a man his age should have to adapt to new and difficult situations but life was seldom fair and it was probably safe to assume that death wasnt fair either this wasnt the first time he had been tempted to firmly demand to speak to the person in charge it had never worked at the post office the dmv or return counters at department stores perhaps it would work here but where was here he heard voices that was a good sign it didnt seem uncomfortably warm a good sign he sniffed the air no sulfur fumes brimstone the bible called it that was a good sign perhaps he had done all right he did a quick inventory of his life good father good husband responsible if not dedicated worker okay so he cheated at cards at the vfw but eternity seemed like an awfully long sentence for shuffling aces to the bottom of the deck he opened his eyes he had always imagined heaven to be bigger and brighter this looked like the inside of a cabin then he spotted the woman she was dressed in an iridescent purple body stocking her ravenblack hair hung to her waist heaven effrom thought she was talking on the phone they have phones in heaven why not he tried to sit up and found that he was tied to the bed why was that hell well which is it he demanded the woman covered the receiver with her hand and turned to him say something so your wife will know youre okay she said im not okay im dead and i dont know where i am the woman spoke into the phone you see mrs elliot your husband is safe and will remain so as long as you do exactly as i have instructed the woman covered the mouthpiece again she says she doesnt know about any invocation effrom heard a gravely male voice answer her but he couldnt see anyone else in the cabin shes lying the voice said i dont think so shes crying ask her about travis the voice said into the phone the woman said mrs elliot do you know someone named travis she listened for a second and held the receiver to her breast she says no it might have been a long time ago the voice said effrom kept looking for who was talking but could see no one think the woman said into the phone it might have been a long time ago the woman listened and nodded with a smile effrom looked in the direction of her nod who the hell was she nodding to did he give you anything the woman listened candlesticks bingo the voice said yes said the woman bring the candlesticks here and your husband will be released unharmed tell no one mrs elliot fifteen minutes or he dies the voice said thank you mrs elliot the woman said she hung up to effrom she said your wife is on the way to pick you up who else is in this room effrom asked who have you been talking to you met him earlier today the woman said the alien i thought he killed me not yet the voice said is she coming catch asked rachel was looking out the cabin window at a cloud of dust rising from the dirt road i cant tell she said mr elliot what kind of car does your wife drive a white ford effrom said its her rachel felt a shiver of excitement run through her her sense of wonder had been stretched and tested many times in the last twentyfour hours leaving her open and raw to every emotion she was afraid of the power she was about to gain but at the same time the myriad possibilities that power created diluted her fear with a breathless giddiness she felt guilty about abusing the old couple in order to gain the invocation but perhaps with her newfound power she could repay them in any case it would be over soon and they would be going home the actual nature of the earth spirit bothered her as well why did it seem well so impious and why did it seem so male the ford pulled up in front of the cabin and stopped rachel watched a frail old woman get out of the car holding two ornate candlesticks the woman clutched the candlesticks to her and stood by the car looking around waiting she was obviously terrified and rachel feeling a stab of guilt looked away shes here rachel said catch said tell her to come in effrom looked up from the bed but he could not rise enough to see out the window what are you going to do to the wife he demanded nothing at all rachel said she has something i need when i get it you can both go home rachel went to the door and threw it open as if she were welcoming home a longlost relative amanda stood by the car thirty feet away mrs elliot youll need to bring the candlesticks in so we can inspect them no amanda stood firm not until i know that effrom is safe rachel turned to effrom say something to your wife mr elliot nope effrom said im not speaking to her this is all her fault please cooperate mr elliot so we can let you go home to amanda rachel said he doesnt want to talk mrs elliot why dont you bring the candlesticks in i assure you that neither one of you will be harmed rachel couldnt believe that she was saying these things she felt as if she were reading the script from a bad gangster movie amanda stood clutching the candlesticks uncertain of what she should do rachel watched the old woman take a tentative step toward the cabin then suddenly the candlesticks were ripped from her grasp and amanda was thrown to the ground as if shed been hit by a shotgun blast no rachel screamed the candlesticks seemed to float in the air as catch carried them to her she ignored them and ran to where amanda lay on the ground she cradled the old womans head in her arms amanda opened her eyes and rachel breathed a sigh of relief are you all right mrs elliot im so sorry leave her catch said ill take care of both of them in a second rachel turned toward catchs voice the candlesticks were shaking in the air she still found it unsettling to talk to a disembodied voice i dont want these people hurt do you understand but now that we have the invocation they are insignificant the candlesticks turned in the air as catch examined them come now i think theres a seam on one of these but i cant grip it come open it in a minute rachel said she helped amanda get to her feet lets go in the house mrs elliot its all over you can go home as soon as you feel up to it rachel led amanda through the front door holding her by the shoulders the old woman seemed dazed and listless rachel was afraid she would drop any second but when amanda saw effrom tied to the bed she shrugged off rachels support and went to him effrom she sat on the bed and stroked his bald head well wife effrom said i hope youre happy you go gallivanting all over the state and you see what happens i get kidnapped by invisible moonmen i hope you had a good trip i cant even feel my hands anymore probably gangrene theyll probably have to cut them off im sorry effrom amanda turned to rachel can i untie him please the pleading in her eyes almost broke rachels heart she had never felt so cruel she nodded you can go now im sorry it had to be this way open this catch said he was tapping a candlestick on rachels shoulder while amanda untied effroms wrists and ankles and rubbed them to restore the circulation rachel examined one of the candlesticks she gave it a quick twist and it unscrewed at the seam from the weight of it rachel would have never guessed that it was hollow as she unscrewed it she noticed that the threads were gold that accounted for the extra weight whoever had made the candlesticks had gone to great lengths to conceal the hollow interior the two pieces separated a piece of parchment was tightly rolled inside rachel placed the base of the candlestick on the table slid out the yellow tube of parchment and slowly began to unroll it the parchment crackled and the edges flaked away as it unrolled rachel felt her pulse increase as the first few letters appeared when half the page was revealed her excitement was replaced with anxiety we may be in trouble she said why catchs voice emanated from a spot only inches away from her face i cant read this its in some foreign language greek i think can you read greek i cant read at all catch said open the other candlestick maybe what we need is in there rachel picked up the other candlestick and turned it in her hands theres no seam on this one look for one it might be hidden the demon said rachel went to the kitchen area of the cabin and got a knife from the silverware drawer to scrape away the silver amanda was helping effrom get to his feet urging him across the room rachel found the seam and worked the knife into it ive got it she unscrewed the candlestick and pulled out a second parchment can you read this one catch said no this ones in greek too well have to get it translated i dont even know anyone who reads greek travis catch said amanda had effrom almost to the door when she heard traviss name is he still alive she asked for a while catch said who is this travis rachel asked she was supposed to be the one in charge here yet the old woman and the demon seemed to know more about what was going on than she did they cant go catch said why we have the invocation we just need to get it translated let them go no catch said if they warn travis he will find a way to protect the girl what girl rachel felt as if she had walked into the middle of a plotheavy mystery movie and no one was going to tell her what was happening we have to get the girl and hold her hostage until travis translates the invocation what girl rachel repeated a waitress at the cafe in town her name is jenny jenny masterson shes a member of the coven what does she have to do with this travis loves her who is travis there was a pause rachel amanda and effrom all stared at empty air waiting for the answer he is my master catch said this is really weird rachel said youre a little slow on the uptake arent you honey effrom said rivera right in the middle of the interrogation detective sergeant alphonse rivera had a vision he saw himself behind the counter at seveneleven bagging microwave burritos and pumping slushpuppies it was obvious that the suspect robert masterson was telling the truth what was worse was that he not only didnt have any connection with the marijuana riveras men had found in the trailer but he didnt have the slightest idea where the breeze had gone the deputy district attorney an officious little weasel who was only putting time in at the das office until his fangs were sharp enough for private practice had made the states position on the case clear and simple youre fucked rivera cut him loose rivera was clinging to a single microthin strand of hope the second suitcase the one that masterson had made such a big deal about back at the trailer it lay open on riveras desk a jumble of notebook paper cocktail napkins matchbook covers old business cards and candy wrappers stared out of the suitcase at him on each one was written a name an address and a date the dates were obviously bogus as they went back to the s rivera had riffled through the mess a dozen times without making any sort of connection deputy perez approached riveras desk he was doing his best to affect an attitude of sympathy without much success everything he had said that morning had carried with it a sideways smirk twain had put it succinctly never underestimate the number of people who would love to see you fail find anything yet perez asked the smirk was there rivera looked up from the papers took out a cigarette and lit it a long stream of smoke came out with his sigh i cant see how any of this connects with the breeze the addresses are spread all over the country the dates run too far back to be real maybe its a list of connections the breeze was planning to dump the pot on perez suggested you know the feds estimate that more than ten percent of the drugs in this country move through the postal system what about the dates some kind of code maybe did the handwriting check out rivera had sent perez back to the trailer to find a sample of the breezes handwriting he had returned with a list of engine parts for a ford truck no match rivera said maybe the list was written by his connection rivera blew a blast of smoke in perezs face think about it dipshit i was his connection well someone blew your cover and the breeze ran why didnt he take the pot i dont know sergeant im just a uniformed deputy this sounds like detective work to me perez had stopped trying to hide his smirk id take it to the spider if i were you that made a consensus everyone who had seen or heard about the suitcase had suggested that rivera take it to the spider he sat back in his chair and finished his cigarette enjoying his last few moments of peace before the inevitable confrontation with the spider after a few long drags he stubbed the cigarette in the ashtray on his desk gathered the papers into the suitcase closed it and started down the steps into the bowels of the station and the spiders lair throughout his life rivera had known half a dozen men nicknamed spider most were tall men with angular features and the wiry agility that one associates with a wolf spider chief technical sergeant irving nailsworth was the exception nailsworth stood five feet nine inches tall and weighed over three hundred pounds when he sat before his consoles in the main computer room of the san junipero sheriff department he was locked into a matrix that extended not only throughout the county but to every state capital in the nation as well as to the main computer banks at the fbi and the justice department in washington the matrix was the spiders web and he lorded over it like a fat black widow as rivera opened the steel door that led into the computer room he was hit with a blast of cold dry air nailsworth insisted the computers functioned better in this environment so the department had installed a special climate control and filtration system to accommodate him rivera entered and suppressing a shudder closed the door behind him the computer room was dark except for the soft green glow of a dozen computer screens the spider sat in the middle of a horseshoe of keyboards and screens his huge buttocks spilling over the sides of a tiny typists chair beside him a steel typing table was covered with junk food in various stages of distress mostly cupcakes covered with marshmallow and pink coconut while rivera watched the spider peeled the marshmallow cap off a cupcake and popped it in his mouth he threw the chocolatecake insides into a wastebasket atop a pile of crumpled tractorfeed paper because of the sedentary nature of the spiders job the department had excused him from the minimum physical fitness standards set for field officers the department had also created the position of chief technical sergeant in order to feed the spiders ego and keep him happily clicking away at the keyboards the spider had never gone on patrol never arrested a suspect never even qualified on the shooting range yet after only four years with the department nailsworth effectively held the same rank that rivera had attained in fifteen years on the street it was criminal the spider looked up his eyes were sunk so far into his fat face that rivera could see only a beady green glow you smell of smoke the spider said you cant smoke in here im not here to smoke i need some help the spider checked the data spooling across his screens then turned his full attention to rivera bits of pink coconut phosphoresced on the front of his uniform youve been working up in pine cove havent you a narcotics sting rivera held up the suitcase we found this its full of names and addresses but i cant make any connections i thought you might no problem the spider said the nailgun will find an opening where there was none the spider had given himself the nickname nailgun no one called him the spider to his face and no one called him nailgun unless they needed something yeah rivera said i thought it needed some of the nailguns wizardry the spider swept the junk food from the top of the typing table into the wastebasket and patted the top of the table lets see what you have rivera placed the suitcase on the table and opened it the spider immediately began to shuffle through the papers picking up a piece here or there reading it and throwing it back into the pile this is a mess thats why im here ill need to put this into the system to make any sense of it i cant use a scanner on handwritten material youll have to read it to me while i input the spider turned to one of his keyboards and began typing give me a second to set up a data base format as far as rivera was concerned the spider could be speaking swahili despite himself rivera admired the mans efficiency and expertise his fat fingers were a blur on the keyboard after thirty seconds of furious typing the spider paused okay read me the names addresses and dates in that order so you need me to sort them out no the machine will do that rivera began to read the names and addresses from each slip of paper deliberately pausing so as not to get ahead of the spiders typing faster rivera you wont get ahead of me rivera read faster throwing each paper on the floor as he finished with it faster the spider demanded i cant go any faster at this speed if i mispronounce a name i could lose control and get a serious tongue injury for the first time since rivera had known him the spider laughed take a break rivera i get so used to working with machines that i forget people have limitations whats going on here rivera said is the nailgun losing his sarcastic edge the spider looked embarrassed no i wanted to ask you about something rivera was shocked the spider was almost omniscient or so he pretended this was a day for firsts what do you need he said the spider blushed rivera had never seen that much flaccid flesh change color he imagined that it put an incredible strain on the spiders heart youve been working in pine cove right yes have you ever run into a girl up there named roxanne rivera thought for a moment then said no are you sure the spiders voice had taken on a tone of desperation its probably a nickname she works at the roomsrus motel ive run the name against social security records credit reports everything i cant seem to find her there are over ten thousand women in california with the name roxanne but none of them check out why dont you just drive up to pine cove and meet her the spiders color deepened i couldnt do that why not whats the deal with this woman anyway does it have to do with a case no its its a personal thing were in love but youve never met her well yes sort of we talk by modem every night last night she didnt log on im worried about her nailsworth are you telling me that you are having a love affair with a woman by computer its more than an affair what do you want me to do well if you could just check on her see if shes all right but she cant know i sent you you mustnt tell her i sent you nailsworth im an undercover cop being sneaky is what i do for a living then youll do it if you can find something in these names that will bail me out ill do it thanks rivera lets finish this rivera picked up a matchbook and read the name and address the spider typed the information but as rivera began to read the next name he heard the spider pause on the keyboard is something wrong rivera asked just one more thing nailsworth said what could you find out if shes modeming someone else santa maria nailsworth you are a real person three hours later rivera was sitting at his desk waiting for a call from the spider while he was in the computer room someone had left a dogeared paperback on his desk its title was you can have a career in private investigation rivera suspected perez he had thrown the book in the wastebasket now with his only suspect back out on the street and nothing forthcoming from the spider rivera considered fishing the book out of the trash the phone rang and rivera ripped it from its cradle rivera he said rivera its the nailgun did you find something rivera fumbled for a cigarette from the pack on his desk he found it impossible to talk on the phone without smoking i think i have a connection but it doesnt work out dont be cryptic nailsworth i need something well first i ran the names through the social security computer most of them are deceased then i noticed that they were all vets vietnam world war one youre kidding no they were all world war one vets and all of them had a first or middle initial e i should have caught that before i even input it i tried to run a correlation program on that and came up with nothing then i ran the addresses to see if there was a geographical connection anything there no for a minute i thought youd found someones research project on world war one but just to be sure i ran the file through the new data bank set up by the justice department in washington they use it to find criminal patterns where there arent any in effect it makes the random logical they use it to track serial killers and psychopaths and you found nothing not exactly the files at the justice department only go back thirty years so that eliminated about half of the names on your list but the other ones rang the bell nailsworth please try to get to the point in each of the cities listed in your file there was at least one unexplained disappearance around the date listed not the vets other people you can eliminate the large cities as coincidence but hundreds of these disappearances were in small towns people disappear in small towns too they run away to the city they drown you cant call that a connection i thought youd say that so i ran a probability program to get the odds on all of this being coincidence so rivera was getting tired of nailsworths dramatics so the odds of someone having a file of the dates and locations of unexplained disappearances over the last thirty years and it being a coincidence is ten to the power of fifty against which means what which means about the same odds as youd have of dragging the wreck of the titanic out of a trout stream with a fly rod which means rivera you have a serious problem are you telling me that this suitcase belongs to a serial killer a very old serial killer most serial killers dont even start until their thirties if we assume that this one was cooperative enough to start when the justice departments files start thirty years ago hed be over sixty now do you think it goes farther back i picked some dates and locations randomly going back as far as i called the libraries in the towns and had them check the newspapers for stories of disappearances it checked out your man could be in his nineties or it could be a son carrying on his fathers work thats impossible there must be another explanation come on nailsworth i need a bailout here i cant pursue an investigation of a geriatric serial killer well it could be an elaborate research project that someone is doing on missing persons but that doesnt explain the world war one vets and it doesnt explain why the researcher would write the information on matchbook covers and business cards from places that have been out of business for years i dont understand rivera felt as if he were stuck in the spiders web and was waiting to be eaten it appears that the notes themselves were written as far back as fifty years ago i could send them to the lab to confirm it if you want no dont do that rivera didnt want it confirmed he wanted it to go away nailsworth isnt possible that the computer is making some impossible connections i mean its programmed to find patterns maybe it went overboard and made this one up you know the odds sergeant the computer cant make anything up it can only interpret whats put into it if i were you id pull my suspect out of holding and find out where he got the suitcase i cut him loose the da said i didnt have enough to charge him find him nailsworth said rivera resented the authoritarian tone in nailsworths voice but he let it go im going now one more thing yes one of your addresses was in pine cove you want it of course nailsworth read the name and address to rivera who wrote it down on a memo pad there was no date on this one sergeant your killer might still be in the area if you get him it would be the bailout youre looking for its too fantastic and dont forget to check on roxanne for me okay the spider hung up jenny jenny had arrived at work a half hour late expecting to find howard waiting behind the counter to reprimand her in his own erudite way strangely enough she didnt care even more strange was the fact that howard had not shown up at the cafe all morning considering that she had drunk two bottles of wine eaten a heavy italian meal and everything in the refrigerator and stayed up all night making love she should have been tired but she wasnt she felt wonderful full of humor and energy and not a little excited when she thought of her night with travis she grinned and shivered there should be guilt she thought she was technically a married woman technically she was having an illicit affair but she had never been very technically minded instead of guilt she felt happy and eager to do it all again from the moment she got to work she began counting the hours until she got off after the lunch shift she was at one hour and counting when the cook announced that there was a call for her in the office she quickly refilled her customers coffee cups and headed to the back if it was robert she would just act like nothing had happened she wasnt exactly in love with someone else as he suspected it was it didnt matter what it was she didnt have to explain anything if it was travis she hoped it was travis she picked up the phone hello jenny it was a womans voice its rachel look im having a special ritual this afternoon at the caves i need you to be there jennifer did not want to go to a ritual i dont know rachel i have plans after work jennifer this is the most important thing weve ever done and i need you to be there what time do you get off im off at two but i need to go home and change first no dont do that come as you are its really important but i really please jenny it will only take a few minutes jennifer had never heard rachel sound so adamant maybe it really was important okay i guess i can make it do you need me to call any of the others no ill do it you just be at the caves as soon as you can after two okay fine ill be there and jenny rachels voice had lowered an octave dont tell anyone where you are going rachel hung up jennifer immediately dialed her home phone and got the answering machine travis if youre there pick up she waited he was probably still sleeping im going to be a little late ill be home later this afternoon she almost said i love you but decided not to she pushed the thought out of her mind bye she said and hung up now if she could only avoid robert until she could think of a way to destroy his hope for their reconciliation returning to the floor of the cafe she realized that somewhere along the way her feeling of wellbeing had vanished and she felt very tired good guys augustus brine travis and gian hen gian were squeezed into the seat of brines pickup as they approached effrom and amandas house they spotted a beige dodge parked in the driveway do you know what kind of car they drive travis asked brine was slowing down an old ford i think dont slow down keep going travis said but why id bet anything that dodge is a police car theres a whip antenna pinned down on the back so what you havent done anything illegal brine wanted to get it over with and get some sleep keep going i dont want to answer a lot of questions we dont know what catch has been doing we can come back later after the police leave the djinn said he has a point augustus brine all right brine gunned the pickup and sped by in a few minutes they were sitting in jennys kitchen listening to the answering machine they had gone in the back way to avoid the burnt doughy mess in the front yard well travis said resetting the machine that buys us a little time before we have to explain it to jenny do you think catch will come back here brine asked i hope so travis said cant you concentrate your will on bringing him back until we can find out if amanda still has the candlesticks ive been trying i dont understand this much more than you do well i need a drink brine said is there anything in the house i doubt it jenny said she couldnt keep anything in the house or her husband would drink it she drank all the wine last night even some cooking sherry would be fine brine said feeling a little sleazy as he spoke travis began going through the cupboards should you find a small quantity of salt i would be most grateful the djinn said travis found a box of salt among the spices and was handing it to the djinn when the phone rang they all froze and listened as the machine played jennys outgoing message after the beep there was a pause then a womans voice travis pick up it was not jenny travis looked to brine no one knows im here they do now pick it up travis picked up the phone and the answering machine clicked off this is travis brine watched the color drain out of the demonkeepers face as he listened is she all right travis said into the phone let me talk to her who are you do you know what youre getting yourself into brine couldnt imagine what was going on in the conversation suddenly travis screamed into the phone hes not an earth spirit hes a demon how can you be so stupid travis listened for a moment more then looked at augustus brine and covered the receiver with his hand do you know where there are some caves to the north of town yes brine said the old mushroom farm travis spoke into the phone yes i can find it ill be there at four he sat down hard on one of the kitchen chairs and let the phone fall into its cradle whats going on brine demanded travis was shaking his head some woman is holding jennifer and amanda and her husband hostage catch is with her and she has the candlesticks and you were right there are three invocations i dont understand brine said what does she want she thinks that catch is some kind of benevolent earth spirit she wants his power humans are so ignorant the djinn said but what does she want with you brine asked she has the candlesticks and the invocations theyre in greek they want me to translate the invocations or theyll kill jenny let them the djinn said perhaps you can bring catch under control with the woman dead travis exploded they thought of that you little troll if i dont show up at four theyll kill jenny and destroy the invocation then well never be able to send catch back augustus brine checked his watch weve got exactly an hour and a half to come up with a plan let us retire to the saloon and consider our options the djinn said the head of the slug augustus brine led the way into the head of the slug travis followed and gian hen gian shuffled in last the saloon was nearly empty robert was sitting at the bar another man sat in the dark at a table in the back and mavis was behind the bar robert turned as they entered when he saw travis he jumped off the stool you fucking asshole robert screamed he stormed toward travis with his fist cocked for a knockout blow he got four steps before augustus brine threw out a massive forearm that caught him in the forehead there was a flash of tennis shoes flailing in the air as robert experienced the full dynamic range of the clothesline effect a second later he lay on the floor unconscious who is that travis asked jennys husband brine answered bending over and inspecting roberts neck for any jutting vertebrae hell be okay maybe we should go somewhere else there isnt time brine said besides he might be able to help mavis sand was standing on a plastic milk box peering over the bar at roberts supine form nice move asbestos she said i like a man that can handle himself brine ignored the compliment do you have any smelling salts mavis climbed down from her milk box rummaged under the bar for a moment and came up with a gallon bottle of ammonia this should do it to travis and the djinn she said you boys want anything gian hen gian stepped up to the bar could i trouble you for a small quantity a salty dog and a draft please travis interrupted brine wrapped one arm under roberts armpits and dragged him to a table he propped him up in a chair retrieved the ammonia bottle from the bar and waved it under roberts nose robert came to gagging bring this boy a beer mavis brine said he aint drinking today ive been pouring him cokes since noon a coke then travis and the djinn took their drinks and joined brine and robert at the table where robert sat looking around as if he were experiencing reality for the first time a nasty bump was rising on his forehead he rubbed it and winced what hit me i did brine said robert i know youre angry at travis but you have to put it aside jennys in trouble robert started to protest but brine raised a hand and he fell silent for once in your life robert do the right thing and listen it took fifteen minutes for brine to relate the condensed version of the demons story during which time the only interruption was the screeching feedback of mavis sands hearing aid which she had cranked up to maximum so she could eavesdrop when brine finished he drained his beer and ordered a pitcher well he said robert said gus youre the sanest man i know and i believe that you believe jenny is in trouble but i dont believe this little man is a genie and i dont believe in demons i have seen the demon came a voice from the dark end of the bar the figure who had been sitting quietly when they came in stood and walked toward them they all turned to see a rumpled and wrinkled howard phillips staggering out of the dark obviously drunk i saw it outside of my house last night i thought it was one of the slave creatures kept by the old ones what in the hell are you talking about howard robert asked it doesnt matter any longer what matters is that these men are telling you the truth so now what robert said what do we do now howard pulled a pocket watch from his vest and checked the time you have one hour to plan a course of action if i can be of any assistance sit down howard before you fall down brine said lets lay it out i think its obvious from what we know that there is no way to hurt the demon true travis said therefore brine continued the only way to stop him and his new master is to get the invocation from the second candlestick which will either send catch back to hell or empower gian hen gian when travis meets them why dont we just rush them and take it robert said travis shook his head catch would kill jenny and the elliotts before we ever got close even if we got hold of the invocation it has to be translated that takes time its been years since ive read any greek you would all be killed and catch would find another translator yes robert brine added did we mention that unless catch is in his eating form which must have been what howard saw no one can see him but travis i am fluent in greek howard said they all looked at him no brine said they expect travis to be alone the mouth of the cave is at least fifty yards from any cover as soon as howard stepped out it would be over maybe we should let it be over travis said no wait a minute robert said he took a pen from howards pocket and began scribbling figures on a cocktail napkin you say theres cover fifty yards from the caves brine nodded robert did some scribbling okay travis exactly how big is the print on the invocation can you remember what does it matter it matters robert insisted how big is the print i dont know its been a long time it was handwritten and the parchment was pretty long id guess the characters were maybe a halfinch tall robert scribbled furiously on the napkin then put the pen down if you can get them out of the cave and hold up the invocation tell them you need more light or something i can set up a telephoto lens on a tripod in the woods and howard can translate the invocation i dont think theyll let me hold the parchment up long enough for howard to translate theyll suspect something no you dont understand robert pushed the napkin he had been writing on in front of travis it was covered with fractions and ratios looking at it travis was baffled what does this mean it means that i can put a polaroid back on one of my nikons and when you hold up the parchments i can photograph them hand the polaroid to howard and thirty seconds later he can start translating the ratios show that the print will be readable on the polaroid i just need enough time to focus and set exposure maybe three seconds robert looked around the table howard phillips was the first to speak it sounds feasible although fraught with contingencies augustus brine was smiling what do you think gus robert asked you know i always thought you were a lost cause but i think ive changed my mind howards right though theres lot of ifs involved but it might work he is still a lost cause the djinn chimed in the invocation is useless without the silver seal of solomon which is part of one of the candlesticks its hopeless travis said brine said no its not its just very difficult we have to get the candlesticks before they know about the seal well use a diversion are you going to explode more flour asked gian hen gian no were going to use you as bait if catch hates you as much as you say hell come after you and travis can grab the candlesticks and run i dont like it travis said not unless we can get jenny and the elliotts clear i agree said robert do you have a better idea brine asked rachel is a bitch robert said but i dont think shes a killer maybe travis can send jenny down the hill from the caves with the candlesticks as a condition to translating the invocation that still leaves the elliotts brine said and besides we dont know if the demon knows the seal is in the candlesticks i think we go for the diversion plan as soon as howard has the invocation translated gian hen gian should step out of the woods and we all go for it howard phillips said but even if you have the seal and the invocation you still have to read the words before the demon kills us all thats right said travis and the process should begin as soon as rachel starts reading the words i translate or catch will know something is up i cant bluff on the translation at my end you dont have to brine said you simply have to be slower than howard which doesnt sound like a problem wait a second robert said he was out of his seat and across the bar to where mavis was standing mavis give me your recorder what recorder she said coyly dont bullshit me mavis youve got a microcassette recorder under the bar so you can listen to peoples conversations mavis pulled the recorder out from under the bar and reluctantly handed it over to robert this is the solution to the time problem robert said we read the invocation into this before the genie comes out of the woods when and if we get the candlesticks we play it back this thing has a high speed for secretaries to use when typing dictation brine looked at travis will it work its not any more risky than anything else were doing whos voice do we use robert asked who gets the responsibility the djinn answered it must be augustus brine he has been chosen robert checked his watch weve got a half hour and i still have to pick up my cameras at the breezes trailer lets meet at the upickem sign in fifteen minutes wait we need to go over this again travis said later brine said he threw a twentydollar bill on the table and headed toward the door robert use howards car i dont want this whole thing depending on your old truck starting travis gian hen gian you ride with me rivera during the drive to pine cove rivera was nagged by the idea that he had forgotten something it wasnt that he hadnt reported where he was going he had planned that until he had physical evidence that there was a serial killer in the area he wasnt saying a word but when he knocked on the elliotts front door and it swung open he suddenly remembered that his bulletproof vest was hanging in his locker back at the station he called into the house and waited for an answer none came only cops and vampires have to have an invitation to enter he thought but there is probable cause the part of his mind that functioned like a district attorney kicked in so sergeant rivera the lawyer said you entered a private residence based on a computer data base that could have been no more than a mailing list i believed that effrom elliotts name on the list represented a clear and present danger to a private citizen so i entered the residence rivera drew his revolver and held it in his right hand while he held his badge out in his left mr and mrs elliott this is sergeant rivera from the sheriffs department im coming in the house he moved from room to room announcing his presence before he entered the bedroom door was closed he saw the splintered bullet hole in the door and felt his adrenaline surge should he call for backup the da said and so you entered the house on what basis rivera came through the door low and rolled he lay for a moment on the floor of the empty room feeling stupid what now he couldnt call in and report a bullet hole in a residence that he had probably entered illegally especially when he hadnt reported that he was in pine cove in the first place one step at a time he told himself rivera returned to his unmarked car and reported that he was in pine cove sergeant rivera the dispatcher said there is a message for you from technical sergeant nailsworth he said to tell you that robert masterson is married to the granddaughter of effrom elliott he said he doesnt know what it means but he thought you should know it meant that he had to find robert masterson he acknowledged the message and signed off fifteen minutes later he was at the breezes trailer the old pickup was gone and no one answered the door he radioed the station and requested a direct patch to the spider nailgun can you get me mastersons wifes home address he gave the trailer as residence when we brought him in and give me the place where she works hold on itll be just a second for her address rivera lit a cigarette while he waited before he took the second drag nailsworth came back with the address and the shortest route from riveras location it will take a little longer for the employer i have to access the social security files how long five maybe ten minutes im on my way to the house maybe i wont need it rivera there was a fire call at that address this morning that mean anything to you nothing means anything to me anymore nailsworth five minutes later rivera pulled up in front of jennys house everything was covered with a gummy gray goo a mix of ashes flour and water from the fire hoses as rivera climbed out of the car nailsworth called back jennifer masterson is currently employed at hps cafe off cypress in pine cove you want the phone number no rivera said if shes not here ill go over there its just a few doors down from my next stop you need anything else nailsworth sounded as if he was holding something back no rivera said ill call if i do rivera dont forget about that other matter what matter roxanne check on her for me as soon as i can nailsworth rivera threw the radio mike onto the passenger seat as he walked up to the house he heard someone come on the radio singing a chorus to the song roxanne in a horrible falsetto nailsworth had shown his weakness over an open frequency and now rivera knew the whole department would ride the fat mans humiliation into the ground when this was over rivera promised himself he would concoct a story to vindicate the spiders pride he owed him that of course that depended on rivera vindicating himself the walk to the door covered his shoes with gray goo he waited for an answer and returned to the car cursing in spanish his shoes converted to dough balls he didnt get out of the car at hps cafe it was obvious from the darkened windows that no one was inside his last chance was the head of the slug saloon if masterson wasnt there he was out of leads and he would have to report what he knew or what was more embarrassing what he didnt know to the captain rivera found a parking place in front of the slug behind roberts truck and after taking a few minutes to get his right shoe unstuck from the gas pedal he went in upickem the pagan vegetarians for peace called them the sacred caves because they believed that the caves had once been used by ohlone indians for religious ceremonies this in fact was not true for the ohlone had avoided the caves as much as possible due to the huge population of bats that lived there bats that were inextricably locked into the destiny of the caves the first human occupation of the caves came in the s when a downandout farmer named homer styles decided to use the damp interior of the caves to cultivate mushrooms homer started his business with five hundred wooden crates of the sort used for carting soda bottles and a halfgallon carton of mailorder mushroom spores total investment sixteen dollars homer had stolen the crates from behind the thriftymart a few at a time over the period of weeks that it took him to read the pamphlet fungus for fun and profit put out by the us department of agriculture after filling the crates with moist peat and laying them out on the cave floor homer spread his spores and waited for the money to roll in what homer didnt figure on was the rapid growth rate of the mushrooms hed skipped that part of the pamphlet and within days he found himself sitting in a cave full of mushrooms with no market and no money to pay for help in harvesting the solution to homers problem came from another government pamphlet entitled the consumerharvested farm which had come by mistake in the same envelope with fungus for fun homer took his last ten dollars and placed an ad in the local paper mushrooms lb upickem your container old creek road daily mushroomhungry pine covers came in droves as fast as the mushrooms were harvested they grew back and the money rolled in homer spent his first profits on a generator and a string of lights for the caves figuring that by extending his business hours into the evening his profits would grow in proportion it would have been a sound business move had the bats not decided to rear their furry heads in protest during the day the bats had been content to hang out on the roof of the cave while homer ran his business below but on the first night of homers extended hours when the bats woke to find their home invaded by harshly lit mushroom pickers their tolerance ended there were twenty customers in the caves when the lights went on in an instant the air above them was a maelstrom of screeching furry flying rodents in the rush to exit one woman fell and broke a hip and another was bitten on the hand while extracting a bat from her hair the cloud of bats soon disappeared into the night only to be replaced the next day by an equally dense cloud of landbound vermin personalinjury lawyers the varmints prevailed in court homers business was destroyed and once again the bats slept in peace a depressed homer styles went on a binge in the head of the slug he spent four days in an irish whiskey haze before his money ran out and mavis sand sent him to an alcoholics anonymous meeting mavis could tell when a man had hit bottom and she felt no need to pump a dry well homer found himself in the meeting room of the first national bank telling his story it happened that at that same meeting a young surfer who called himself the breeze was working off a courtordered sentence he had earned by drunkenly crashing a volkswagen into a police cruiser and promptly puking on the arresting officers shoes the farmers story touched off an entrepreneurial spark in the surfer and after the meeting the breeze cornered homer with a proposition homer how would you like to make some heavy bread growing magic mushrooms the next day the farmer and the surfer were hauling bags of manure into the caves spreading it over the peat and scattering a completely different type of spore according to the breeze their crop would sell for ten to twenty dollars an ounce instead of the fifty cents a pound that homer received for his last crop homer was enraptured with the possibility of becoming rich and he would have if not for the bats as the day of their first harvest neared the breeze had to take his leave of their plantation to serve the weekend in the county jail the first of fifty the judge had not been amused at having barfcovered police shoes presented as evidence in his courtroom before he left the breeze assured homer that he would return monday to help with the drying and marketing of the mushrooms in the meantime the woman who had been bitten during the debacle of the bats came down with rabies county animalcontrol agents were ordered to the caves to destroy the bat colony when the agents arrived they found homer styles crouched over a tray of psychedelic mushrooms the agents offered homer the option of walking away and leaving the mushrooms but homer refused so they radioed the sheriff homer was led away in handcuffs the animalcontrol agents left with their pockets filled with mushrooms and the bats were left alone when the breeze was released on monday he found himself in search of a new scam a few months later while incarcerated at the state prison in lompoc homer styles received a letter from the breeze the letter was covered with a fine yellow powder and read sorry about your bust hope we can bury the hatchet homer buried the letter in a shoe box he kept under his bunk and spent the next ten years living in relative luxury on the profits he made from selling psychedelic mushrooms to the other inmates homer sampled his crop only once then swore off mushrooms for life when he hallucinated that he was drowning in a sea of bats bad guys good guys rachel was drawing figures in the dirt of the cave floor with a dagger when she heard something flutter by her ear what was that a bat catch said he was invisible we are out of here rachel said take them outside effrom amanda and jenny were sitting with their backs against the cave wall tied hand and foot and gagged i dont know why we couldnt have waited at your cabin catch said i have my reasons help me get them outside now youre afraid of bats catch asked no i just feel that this ritual should take place in the open rachel insisted if you have a problem with bats youre going to love it when you see me a quarter mile down the road from the cave augustus brine travis and gian hen gian were waiting for howard and robert to arrive do you think we can pull this off travis asked brine why ask me i know less about this than the two of you whether we pull it off depends mostly on your powers of persuasion can we go over it again brine checked his watch lets wait for robert and howard we still have a few minutes and i dont think that it will hurt to be a little late as far as catch and rachel are concerned you are the only game in town just then they heard a car downshifting and turned to see howards old black jag turning onto the dirt road howard parked behind brines truck he and robert got out and robert reached into the backseat and began handing things to brine and travis a camera bag a heavyduty tripod a long aluminum lens case and finally a hunting rifle with a scope brine did not take the rifle from robert whats that for robert stood up rifle in hand if it looks like it isnt going to work we use it to take out rachel before she gets power over catch what will that accomplish brine asked it will keep travis in control of the demon no travis said one way or another it ends here but we dont shoot anyone were here to end the killing not add to it whos to say that rachel wont have more control over catch than i do but she doesnt know what she is getting into you said that yourself if she gets power over catch he has to tell her just like he told me at least i will be free of him and jenny will be dead robert spat augustus brine said the rifle stays in the car we are going to do this on the assumption that it will work period normally id say that if anyone wants out they can go now but the fact is we all have to be here for it to work brine looked around the group they were waiting well are we going to do this robert threw the rifle into the backseat of the car lets do it then good brine said travis you have to get them out of the cave and into the open you have to hold the invocation up long enough for robert to get a picture and you have to get the candlesticks back to us preferably by sending them down the hill with jenny and the elliotts theyll never go for that without the hostages why should i translate the invocation then hold it as a condition play it the best you can maybe you can get one of them down if i make the candlesticks a condition theyll be suspicious shit robert said this isnt going to work i dont know why i thought it would through the whole discussion the djinn had remained in the background now he stepped into the circle give them what they want once the woman has control of catch they will have no need to be suspicious but catch will kill the hostages and probably all of us travis said wait a minute robert said where is rachels van what does that have to do with anything brine said well they didnt walk here with hostages in tow and the van isnt parked here that means that her van must be up by the cave so travis said so it means that if we have to storm them we can go in guss truck the road must come out of the woods and loop around the hill to the caves we already have the recorder so the invocation can be played back fast gus can drive up the hill travis can throw the candlesticks into the truck and all gus has to do is hit the play button they considered it for a moment then brine said everyone in the bed of the truck we park it in the woods as close to the caves as we can without it being seen its the closest thing to a plan that we have on the grassy hill outside the cave rachel said hes late lets kill one of them the demon said jenny and her grandparents sat on the ground back to back once this ritual is over i wont have you talking like that rachel said yes mistress i yearn for your guidance rachel paced the hill making an effort not to look at her hostages what if travis doesnt come hell come catch said i think i hear a car rachel watched the point where the road emerged from the woods when nothing came she said what if youre wrong what if he doesnt come there he is catch said rachel turned to see travis walking out of the woods and up the gentle slope toward them robert screwed the tripod into the socket of the telephoto lens tested its steadiness then fitted the camera body on the back of the lens and turned it until it clicked into place from the camera bag at his feet he took a pack of polaroid film and snapped it into the bottom of the nikons back ive never seen a camera like that said augustus brine robert was focusing the long lens the cameras a regular thirtyfive millimeter i bought the polaroid back for it to preview results in the studio i never got around to using it howard phillips stood poised with notebook in hand and a fountain pen at ready check the batteries in that recorder robert said to brine there are some fresh ones in my camera bag if you need them gian hen gian was craning his neck to see over the undergrowth into the clearing where travis stood what is happening i cannot see what is happening nothing yet brine said are you set robert im ready robert said without looking up from the camera im filling the frame with rachels face the parchment should be easily readable are you ready howard short of the unlikely possibility that i may be stricken with writers cramp at the crucial moment i am prepared brine snapped four penlight batteries into the recorder and tested the mechanism its up to travis now he said travis topped halfway up the hill okay im here let them go and ill translate the invocation for you i dont think so rachel said once the ritual has been performed and im sure it has worked then you can all go free you dont have any idea what youre talking about catch will kill us all i dont believe you the earth spirit will be in my control and i wont allow it travis laughed sarcastically you havent even seen him have you what do you think you have there the easter bunny he kills people thats the reason hes here i still dont believe you rachel was beginning to lose her resolve travis watched catch move to where the hostages were tied come do it now travis or the old woman dies he raised a clawed hand over amandas head travis trudged up the hill and stood in front of rachel very quietly her said to her you know you deserve what you are going to get i never thought i could wish catch on anyone but you deserve it he looked at jenny and her eyes pleaded for an explanation he looked away give me the invocation he said to rachel i hope you brought a pencil and paper i cant do this from memory rachel reached into an airline bag that she had brought and pulled out the candlesticks one at a time she unscrewed them and removed the invocations then replaced the pieces in the airline bag she handed travis the parchments put the candlesticks over by jenny he said why rachel asked because the ritual wont work if they are too close to the parchments in fact youd be better off if you untied them and sent them away with the candlesticks get them out of the area altogether the lie seemed so obvious that travis feared he had ruined everything by putting too much importance on the candlesticks rachel stared at him trying to make sense of it i dont understand she said neither do i travis said but this is mystical stuff you cant tell me that taking hostages so you can call up a demon is consistent with the logical world earth spirit not demon and i will use this power for good travis considered trying to convince her of her folly then decided against it the lives of jenny and the elliotts depended on catch maintaining his charade as a benevolent earth spirit until it was too late he glared at the demon who grinned back well travis said rachel picked up the airline bag and took it to a spot a few feet down the hill from the hostages no farther away travis said she slung the bag over her shoulder and took it another twenty yards down the hill then turned to travis for approval what is this about catch asked travis afraid to push his luck nodded to rachel and she set the bag down now the candlesticks were twenty yards closer to the road that ran around the back of the hill the road that augustus brine would drive when the shit hit the fan rachel returned to the hilltop ill need that pencil and paper now he said its in the bag rachel went back toward the bag while she was retrieving the pencil and paper from the airline bag travis held the parchments out before him one at a time counting to six before he put the first one down and picked up the next he hoped he had the angle to roberts camera right and that his body was not in the way of the lens here rachel handed him a pencil and a steno pad travis sat down crosslegged with the parchments out in front of him sit down and relax this is going to take some time he started on the parchment from the second candlestick hoping to buy some time he translated the greek letter by letter searching his memory first for each letter then for the meaning of the words by the time he finished the first line he had fallen into a rhythm and had to make an effort to slow down read what he has written catch said but hes just done one line rachel said read it rachel took the steno pad from travis and read being in possession of the power of solomon i call upon the race that walked before man she stopped thats all there is its the wrong paper catch said travis translate the other one if its not right this time the girl dies thats the last time i buy you a cookie monster comic book you scaly fucker reluctantly travis shuffled the parchments and began to translate the invocation he had spoken in saint anthonys chapel seventy years before howard phillips had two polaroid prints out on the ground before him he was writing a translation out on a notepad while augustus brine and gian hen gian looked over his shoulder robert was looking through the camera theyve made him change parchments he must have been translating the wrong one brine said howard are you translating the one we need i am not sure yet ive only translated a few lines of the greek this latin passage at the top appears to be a message rather than an invocation cant you just scan it we dont have time for mistakes howard read what he had written no this is wrong he tore the sheet from the notepad and began again concentrating on the other polaroid this one seems to have two shorter invocations the first one seems to be the one that empowers the djinn it talks about a race that walked before man that is right translate the one with two invocations the djinn said hurry robert said travis has half a page gus im going to ride up the hill in the bed of the truck when you go ill jump out and grab the bag with the candlesticks theyre still a good thirty yards from the road and i can move faster than you can im finished howard said he handed his notebook to brine record it at normal speed robert said then play it back at high speed brine held the recorder up to his face his finger on the record button gian hen gian is this going to work i mean is a voice on a tape going to have the same effect as speaking the words it would be best to assume that it will you mean you dont know how would i know swell brine said he pushed the record button and read howards translation into the recorder when he finished he rewound the tape and said okay lets go police dont anyone move they turned to see rivera standing in the road behind them his in hand panning back and forth to cover them everybody down on the ground facedown they stood frozen in position on the ground now rivera cocked his revolver officer there must be a mistake brine said feeling stupid as he said it down reluctantly brine robert and howard lay facedown on the ground gian hen gian remained standing cursing in arabic riveras eyes widened as blue swirls appeared in the air over the djinns head stop that rivera said the djinn ignored him and continued cursing on your belly you little fucker robert pushed himself up on his arms and looked around whats this about rivera we were just out here taking some pictures yeah and thats why you have a highpowered rifle in your car thats nothing robert said i dont know what it is but its more than nothing and none of you are going anywhere until i get some answers youre making a mistake officer brine said if we dont continue with what we were doing people are going to die first its sergeant second im getting to be a master at making mistakes so one more is no big deal and third the only person who is going to die is this little arab if he doesnt get his ass on the ground what was taking them so long travis had dragged the translation out as long as he could stalling on a word here and there but he could tell that catch was getting impatient and to delay any long would endanger jenny he tore two sheets from the steno pad and handed them to rachel its finished now you can untie them he gestured to jenny and the elliotts no catch said first we see if it works please rachel you have what you want theres no reason to keep these people here rachel took the pages ill make it up to them once i have the power it wont hurt to keep them here a few more minutes travis fought the urge to look back toward the woods instead he cradled his head in his hands and sighed deeply as rachel began to read the invocation aloud augustus brine finally convinced gian hen gian to lie down on the ground it was obvious that rivera would not listen to anyone until the djinn relented now masterson where in the hell did you get that metal suitcase i told you i stole it out of the chevy who owns the chevy i cant tell you that you can tell me or you can go up on murder charges murder who was murdered about a thousand people it looks like where is the owner of that suitcase is it one of these guys rivera i will tell you everything i know about everything in about fifteen minutes but now youve got to let us finish what we started and what was that brine spoke up sergeant my name is augustus brine im a businessman here in town i have done nothing wrong so i have no reason to lie to you so rivera said so you are right there is a killer we are here to stop him if we dont act right now he will get away so please please let us go im not buying it mr brine where is this killer and why didnt you call the police about him take it nice and slow and dont leave anything out we dont have time brine insisted just then they heard a loud thump and the sound of a body slumping to the ground brine turned around to see mavis sand standing over the collapsed detective her baseball bat in hand hi cutie she said to brine they all jumped to their feet mavis what are you doing here he threatened to close me down if i didnt tell him where you went after he left i got to feeling like a shit about telling him so here i am thanks mavis brine said lets go howard you stay here robert in the bed of the truck whenever youre ready king he said to the djinn brine jumped into the truck fired it up and engaged the fourwheel drive rachel read the last line of the invocation with a grandiose flourish of her arm in the name of solomon the king i command thee to appear rachel said nothing happened catch said nothing happened travis travis said give it a minute he had almost given up hope something had gone horribly wrong now he was faced with either telling them about the candlesticks or keeping his bond with the demon either way the hostages were doomed fine travis catch said the old man is the first to go catch wrapped one hand around effroms neck as travis and rachel watched the demon grew into his eating form and lifted effrom off the ground oh my god rachel put her fist to her mouth and started backing away from the demon oh no travis tried to focus his will on the demon put him down catch he commanded from somewhere down the hill came the sound of a truck starting gian hen gian stepped out of the woods catch he shouted will you never give up your toys the djinn started up the hill catch threw effrom to the side he landed like a rag doll ten yards away rachel was shaking her head violently as if trying to shake away the demons image tears streamed down her cheeks so someone let the little fart out of his jar catch said he stalked down the hill toward the djinn an engine roared and augustus brines pickup broke out of the tree line and bounced up the dirt road throwing up a cloud of dust in its wake robert stood in the bed holding onto the roll bar for support travis darted past catch to amanda and jenny still a coward king of the djinn catch said pausing a second to look at the speeding truck i am still your superior the djinn said is that why you surrendered your people to the netherworld without a fight this time you lose catch catch spun to watch the truck slide around the last turn and off the road to bound across the open grass toward the candlesticks later djinn catch said he began to run toward the truck taking five yards at a stride the demon was over the hill and past travis and the women in seconds augustus brine saw the demon coming at them hold on robert he wrenched the wheel to the side to throw the truck into a slide catch lowered his shoulder and rammed into the right front fender of the truck robert saw the impact coming and tried to decide whether to brace himself or jump in an instant the decision was made for him as the fender crumpled under the demon and the truck went up on two wheels then over onto its roof robert lay on the ground trying to get his wind back he tried to move and a searing pain shot through his arm broken a thick cloud of dust hung in the air obscuring his vision he could hear the demon roaring behind him and the screeching sound of tearing metal as the dust settled he could just make out the shape of the upsidedown truck the demon was pinned under the hood ripping at the metal with his claws augustus brine hung by his seat belt robert could see him moving robert climbed to his feet using his good arm to push himself up gus he shouted the candlesticks came back robert looked around on the ground there was the bag he had almost landed on it he started to reach for it with both hands and nearly passed out when the pain from his broken arm hit him from his knees he was able to scoop up the bag heavy with the candlesticks in his good arm hurry brine shouted catch had stopped clawing at the metal with a great roar he shoved the truck up and off of him standing before the truck he threw his head back and roared with such intensity that robert nearly dropped the candlesticks every bone in roberts body said flee get the hell out of here he stood frozen robert im stuck bring them to me brine was struggling with the seat belt at the sound of his voice the demon leapt to the drivers side of the truck and clawed at the door brine heard the skin of the door go with the first slash he stared at the door in terror expecting a claw to come through the window at any second the demons claws raked the support beam inside the door gus here ouch shit robert was lying outside the passenger side window pushing the bag with the candlesticks across the roof of the truck the play button gus push it brine felt the pocket of his flannel shirt maviss recorder was still clipped there he fumbled for the play button found it and pushed just as a daggerlike claw ripped into his shoulder a hundred miles south at vandenberg air force base a radar technician reported a ufo entering restricted air space from over the pacific when the aircraft refused to respond to radio warning four jet fighters were scrambled to intercept three of the fighter pilots would report no visual contact the fourth upon landing would be given a urinalysis and confined to quarters until he could be debriefed by an officer from the air force department of stress management the bogey would be officially explained as radar interference caused by unusually high swell conditions offshore of the thirtysix reports filed in triplicate with various departments of the military complex not one would mention an enormous white owl with an eightyfoot wingspan however after some consideration the pentagon would award seventeen million dollars to the massachusetts institute of technology for a secret study on the feasibility of an owlshaped aircraft after two years of computer simulations and windtunnel prototype tests the research team would conclude that an owlshaped aircraft would indeed be an effective weapon but only if the enemy should ever mobilize a corps of fieldmouseshaped tanks augustus brine realized that he was going to die in that same moment he realized that he was not afraid and that it did not matter the monster clawing to get at him didnt matter the chipmunk chatter of his voice playing back doublespeed on the recorder didnt matter the shouting of robert and now travis outside the truck didnt matter he was acutely aware of it all he was part of it all but it did not matter even the gunfire didnt matter he accepted it and let it go rivera came to when brine had started the truck mavis sand was standing over the policeman with his revolver but she and howard were watching what was going on up the hill rivera glanced up the hill to see catch materializing in his eating form holding effrom by the throat santa maria what the hell is that mavis trained the gun on him stay right there ignoring her rivera stood and ran down the road toward his patrol car at his car he popped the trunk lid and pulled the riot gun out of its bracket as he ran back past howards jag he paused then opened the back door and grabbed roberts hunting rifle by the time he was again in view of the hill the truck was upside down and the monster was clawing at the door he threw the riot gun to the ground and shouldered the rifle he braced the barrel against a tree threw the bolt to jack a shell into the chamber sighted through the scope and brought the crosshairs down on the monsters face resisting the urge to scream he squeezed the trigger the round hit the demon in his open mouth and knocked him back a foot rivera quickly jacked another shell into the chamber and fired then another when the firing pin clicked on an empty chamber the monster had been knocked back from the truck a few feet but was still coming santa fucking maria rivera said gian hen gian had reached the top of the hill where travis knelt by amanda and jenny it is done the djinn said then do something travis said help gus without his orders i may carry out only the command of my last master gian hen gian pointed to the sky travis looked up to see something white coming out of the clouds but it was too far away to make out what it was catch recovered from the rifle slugs and went forward he hooked his huge hand behind the reinforcement beam of the trucks door ripped it off and threw it behind him inside the truck still hanging from the seat belt augustus brine turned calmly and looked at the demon catch drew back his hand to deliver a blow that would rip brines head from his shoulders brine smiled at him the demon paused what are you some kind of wacko catch said brine didnt have time to answer the reverberation of the owls screech shattered the windshield of the truck catch looked up as the talons locked around his body and he was swept into the air flailing at the owls legs the owl climbed into the sky so rapidly that in seconds it was nothing more than a tiny silhouette against the sun which was making its way toward the horizon augustus brine continued to smile as travis released the seat belt he hit the roof of the truck with his injured shoulder and passed out when brine regained consciousness they were all standing over him jenny was holding amandas head to her shoulder the old woman was sobbing brine looked from face to face someone was missing robert spoke first tell gian hen gian to heal your shoulder gus he cant do it until you tell him while youre at it tell him to fix my arm do it brine said as he said it the pain was gone from his shoulder he sat up wheres effrom he didnt make it gus robert said his heart gave out when the demon threw him brine looked to the djinn bring him back the djinn shook his head balefully this i cannot do brine said im sorry amanda then to gian hen gian what happened to catch he is on his way to jerusalem i dont understand i have lied to you augustus brine i am sorry i was bound to the last command of my last master solomon bade me take the demon back to jerusalem and chain him to a rock outside the great temple why didnt you tell me that i thought you would never give me my power if you knew i am a coward dont be ridiculous it is as catch said when the angels came to drive my people into the netherworld i would not let them fight there was no battle as i told you we went like sheep to the slaughter gian hen gian you are not a coward you are a creator you told me that yourself its not in your nature to destroy to make war but i did so i have tried to vindicate myself by stopping catch i wanted to do for the humans what i did not do for my own people it doesnt matter brine said its finished no its not travis said you cant chain catch to a rock in the middle of jerusalem you have to send him back you have to read the last invocation howard translated it while we were waiting for you to wake up but travis you dont know what will happen to you you may die on the spot im still bound to him gus that isnt living anyway i want to be free travis handed him the invocation and the candlestick with the seal of solomon concealed in it if you dont i will it has to be done all right ill do it brine said travis looked up at jenny she looked away im sorry travis said robert went to jennys side and held her travis walked down the hill and when he was out of sight augustus brine began reading the words that would send catch back to hell they found travis slumped in the backseat of howards jaguar augustus brine was the first to reach the car i did it travis are you all right as travis looked up brine had to fight the urge to recoil the demonkeepers face was deeply furrowed and shot with broken veins his dark hair and brows had turned white but for his eyes which were still young with intensity brine would not have recognized him travis smiled there were still a couple of teeth left in front his voice was still young it didnt hurt i expected one of those wrenching lon chaney transformations but it didnt happen suddenly i was old that was it im glad it didnt hurt brine said what am i going to do i dont know travis i need to think jenny robert rivera amanda travis howard and the spider rivera drove robert and jennifer to their house they sat in the back holding each other the whole way not saying a word until they thanked him when he dropped them off on the drive back to the station rivera tried to formulate a story that would save his career any version of the true story seemed like a sure ticket to a psychological disability retirement in the end he decided to tell the story as far as the point where the breeze disappeared a month later rivera was pumping slushpuppies at the seveneleven working undercover for the robbery division however with the arrest of a team of robbers that had terrorized convenience stores in the county for six months he was promoted to lieutenant amanda and travis rode with howard at amandas request gian hen gian saw that effroms body was turned to stone and placed inside the cave when howard stopped in front of amandas house she invited travis to come inside he refused at first wanting to leave her alone with her grief have you completely missed the significance of all this travis she asked i guess so he said did it occur to you that the presence of catch and gian hen gian proves that effrom is not gone completely i will miss him but he goes on and i dont want to be alone right now i helped you when you needed it she said and she waited travis went in howard went home to work on a new menu for his restaurant chief technical sergeant nailsworth never found out what happened to roxanne or who she really was and he was heartbroken because of his grief he was unable to eat lost a hundred and fifty pounds met a girl at a computer users meeting and married her he never had computer sex again outside the privacy of his home good guys augustus brine declined offers for a ride home he wanted to walk he needed to think gian hen gian walked at his side i can repair your truck make it fly if you wish the djinn said i dont want it brine said im not even sure i want to go home you may do as you wish augustus brine i dont want to go back to the store either i think ill give the business to robert and jenny is it wise to put the drunkard in the wine barrel he wont drink anymore i want them to have the house too ill start the paperwork in the morning it is done just like that you doubt the word of the king of the djinn they walked in silence for a while before brine spoke again it seems wrong that travis has lived so long without having a life without love like yourself you mean no not like myself ive had a good life would you have me make him young again brine thought for a moment before he answered could you make him age in reverse for each year that passes he is a year younger it can be done and her too her amanda could you make them grow young together it can be done if you command it i do it is done will you tell them no not right away it will be a nice surprise and what of yourself augustus brine what is it you wish i dont know i always thought id make a good madam before the djinn could say anything else rachels van sputtered up beside them and stopped she rolled down the window and said do you need a ride gus he is trying to think the djinn snapped dont be rude brine said to the djinn which way are you going i dont know for sure i dont feel like going home maybe ever brine walked around the front of the van and slid open the cargo door get in gian hen gian the djinn got into the van brine slammed the cargo door and climbed into the passenger seat next to rachel well she said east brine said nevada it was called kings lake when it appeared in the desert it simultaneously appeared on every map of nevada that had ever been printed people who had passed through that part of the state swore that they had never seen it before yet there it was on the map above the treelined banks of kings lake stood a palace with a hundred rooms atop the palace a massive electric sign read brines bait tackle and fine women anyone who visited the palace was greeted by a beautiful darkhaired woman who took their money and led them to a room on their way out a tiny brown man in a rumpled suit returned their money and wished them well upon returning home the visitors told of a whitehaired man who sat all day in the lotus position at the end of a pier in front of the palace fishing and smoking a pipe they said that when evening approached the darkhaired woman would join the man and together they would watch the sun go down the visitors were never quite clear as to what had happened to them while they were at the palace it didnt seem to matter but after a visit they found that they appreciated the simple pleasures that life presented to them and they were happy and although they recommended brines to their friends they never returned themselves what went on in the rooms is
