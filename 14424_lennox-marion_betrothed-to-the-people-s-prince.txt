marion lennox betrothed to the peoples prince a book in the marrying his majesty series chapter one into her crowd of beautiful people camenikos she was taking a last visual sweep of the room noting descriptions for tomorrows fashion column the men were almost uniformly in blackblack tshirts black jeans and designer stubble the women were audrey hepburn clones cinched waists wide skirts and pearls the fifties look was now there was little eating cinched waists and body slimmers didnt allow for snacking the waiters were sparse and it wasnt cool to graze nikos was holding a beer and as the waiter passed with a tray of tiny caviarloaded blinis he snagged four he tipped one into his mouth then turned back to search the room for her after all these years he could still stop her world shed forgotten to breathe it was important to breathe she took a toobig sip of her toodry martini and it went down the wrong way uhoh if it wasnt cool to eat it was even more uncool to choke but help was at hand smooth and fast as a panther nikos moved through the crowd to be by her side in an instant he took her drink slapped her back with just the right amount of force and then calmly waited for her to recover nikos she could faint she thought wildly an ambulance could take her away and shed be in a nice safe emergency room safe from the man shed walked away from almost ten years ago but fainting took skills she didnt have no one seemed about to call for help no one seemed more than politely interested that she was choking except nikos she didnt remember him as this big and thisgorgeous he was wearing faded blue jeans instead of the designer black that was de rigueur in this crowd his shirt was worn white cotton missing the top two buttons he had an ancient leather jacket slung over his arm the fashion editor part of her was appreciative nice more than nice nikos she coughed on more than she needed to trying desperately to give herself space his dark hair was curly unruly and a bit too long his brownblack eyes were crinkled at the edges weathered from a life at sea among this crowd of fake tans his was undeniably real his whole body was weathered by his work nikos fisherman her childhood love hed grown from a gorgeous boy into awhat she didnt have words to describe it she was the fashion editor of one of the worlds leading glossies and she was lost for words words were what she needed she had to think of something to say anything almost every eye in the room was on them now she couldnt retreat to choking again you want your drink back his tone was neutrally amused deeper than last time shed heard him a bit gravelly with a gorgeous greek accent sexy as hell he was balancing his beer her martini and his three remaining blinis hed used his spare hand to thump her he was large and capable and nikos now shed stopped choking the crowd had turned their attention to him well why wouldnt they the models designers media and buyers were openly interested maybe more than interested their concentrated attention contained more than a hint of lust you going to live nikos asked mildly and she thought about it she might if he went away what are you doing here looking for you its invitation only yep he said as if that hadnt even crossed his mind as something to bother about how had he done it people would kill for an invitation to this launch hed simply walked in you look cute he said raking her from head to toe right shed gone to some trouble with her outfit her tiny red skirt was clinging in the right places shed managed to make her unruly black curls stay in a knot that was almost sophisticated but in this crowd of fashion extremists she knew she disappeared go away she said and he shook his head i cant do that princess dont call me that its what you are please nikos not here whatever he said easily but we need to talk phones dont work you keep hanging up you dont hang up phones any more very knowledgeable she thought what sort of inane talk was this on argyros we hang up telephones after we talk to people i dont live on argyros yeah thats what i want to talk to you about its time you came home he handed her back her martini he drained his beer and ate his three bitesized blinis then looked about for more two waiters were beside him in an instant he always had been charismatic athena thought people gravitated to him shed gravitated to him so how about it he said smiling his thanks to the waiters oh that smile why would i want to come home theres the little matter of the crown im thinking you must have read the newspapers your cousin demos says hes talked to you im thinking alexandros must have talked to you as wellor did you hang up on him too of course i didnt so you do know youre crown princess of argyros im not crown princess of anything demos can have it she said savagely he wants it demos is second in line youre first it has to be you i have the power to abdicate consider me abdicated royaltys outdated and absurd and my lifes here so if youll excuse me thena you dont have a choice you have to come home thena he was the only one whod ever shortened her name it made her feelas she had no business feeling just tell it like it is and move on she told herself be blunt and cold and not interested he was talking history argyros was no longer anything to do with her youre right she managed i dont have a choice my life is here but not in this room all of a sudden the room was claustrophobic her past was colliding with her present and it made her feel as if the ground was shaking underneath her she and nikos in the same room no no no she and nikos in the same city she and nikos and their son no fear had her almost frozen nikos this is futile she managed theres no use telling me to go home my home is here meanwhile i have things to attend to so if youll excuse me she handed her martini glass back to him and before he could respond she swivelled and made her way swiftly through the crowd she reached the doorand she kept on walking she hadnt retrieved her checked coat it didnt matter outside was cold but she wasnt feeling cold her face was burning she was shaking maybe hed let her be or maybe not he hadnt come all the way from argyros to be ignored it was raining her stilettos werent built for walking she wanted to take them off and run because of course hed follow of course he did when he fell in step beside her she felt as if shed been punched nikoshe threatened her world where are we going he asked mildly nowhere youre welcome is this any way to greet family im not your family tell that to my mother his mothershe thought of annia and felt a stab of real regret she glanced sideways at nikosand then looked swiftly away anniaargyros nikos shed walked away from them ten years ago leaving had broken her heart its your heritage he said mildly as if he was simply continuing the conversation from back at the fashion launch i never had a heritage it was all about giorgos the kings dead athena he died without an heir you know that and that makes a difference how it means the diamond isles become three principalities again the original royal families can resume rule but you know this by the waydid you also know that youre beautiful and he took her arm and forced her to stop shed been striding angry fearful confused rain was turning to sleet her heels her tight skirt and sheer pashmina wrap were designed for cocktail hour not for street wear she should keep going but she wasnt all that sure where to go she couldnt outwalk nikos and she surely wasnt leading him back to her apartment she surely wasnt leading him to her son she might as well stop get it over with now she turned to face him a blast of icy wind hit full on and she felt herself shudder nikoss ancient leather jacket was suddenly around her warm from his body smelling of old leather and nikos andhome argyros fishing boats in an ancient harbour white stone villas hugging island cliffs sapphire seas and brilliant sun the diamond isles suddenly stupidly she wanted to cry we need to get out of this nikos said his hand was under her elbow and he was steering her into the brightly lit portico of a restaurant as if this was his town and he wasnt half a world away from where he lived and worked nikos you call those clothes he growled and she remembered how bossy hed been when they were kids and how he was always right bossy and arrogant andfun pushing her past her comfort zone daring her to join him the number of times shed ended up with skinned knees battered and bruised because of course we can get up that cliff youre not going to sit and watch like some girl are you she never did sit and watch even when theyd been older and the boys from the other islands became part of their pack shed always been included until lets not go there she told herself shed moved on she was fashion editor for one of the worlds bestselling magazines she lived in new york and she was fine so what was nikos doing here ushering her into a restaurant she recognised this place usually involved queuing or a month or mores notice but nikos was a man who turned heads who waiters automatically found a place for because even if they couldnt place him they felt they should he was obviously someone he always had been and his power hadnt waned one bit stunned to speechlessness she found herself being steered to an isolated table for two one of the best in the house the waiter tried to take her jackethis jacketbut she clung it was dumb but she needed its warmth she needed its comfort whats good nikos asked the waiter waving away the menu savoury sweet definitely something sweet he said and smiled across the table at her the way the ladys feeling right now we need all the sugar we can get she refused to smile back she couldnt allow herself to sink into that smile crêpes the waiter proffered or if you have timeour raspberry soufflés a house speciality crêpes followed by soufflé for both of us then he said easily and the waiter beamed and nodded and backed away almost as if he sensed he shouldnt turn his back on royalty nikos once upon a time no get a grip im not going anywhere she muttered into the silence you cant make me go back nikos smiled againhis smile wide and white his eyes deep and shaded an automatic defence against the sun his smile was a heart stopper in anyones language especially hers youre right i cant make you you need to decide yourself but thats why im hereto help you to decide that you need to come home my homes here your career until now has been here he agreed youve done very well theres no need to sound patronising im not patronising like youd know about my career he raised his brows half mocking there were seven candidates for the position youre now in he said softly each of them was older more experienced you won the job over all of them and your boss believes he made a brilliant decision how do you know ive made it my business to find out well butt out theres no need there is a need there was always a chance that youd inherit and now you have i have no intention of inheriting demos wants it demos can have it it should be you but if thats not possibledemos it was never going to be me youre nephew to the king you know the score he said evenly yes my mother was the kings sister but the kings lineage has to be direct and male thats me out but the individual island crowns have malefemale equality first in line for the throne of argyros is you princess athena crown princess of argyros sounds good hey he smiled and tried to take her hand across the table she snatched it away as if he burned this is crazy ive told you nikos im not coming home can i ask why not i dont belong there of course you do my family has always welcomed your family she interrupted flatly of course hows your wife why had she asked that what possible difference did it make but suddenlyshe had to know nikos didnt answer directly hed given up trying to take her hand instead hed clasped his hands loosely on the table top he flexed them now still linked big hands and powerful he wasnt wearing a wedding ring she shouldnt even care she shouldnt have asked but she had asked and there was something in his face that said the answer was never going to be easy for a couple of moments she thought he wouldnt answer at all but finally he beckoned a waiter ordered a beer and answered marika and i are divorced shes remarried and left the island his gaze was expressionless not giving a clue if this still had the power to hurt ten years agotwo months after shed left the islandher aunt had written by the way nikos has married marika rumour is theres a baby on the way but i guess no one worries about such things any more you know i always thought you and nikos would marry but i know king giorgos would hate that so youre best out of it until then shed hoped desperately that nikos would follow her but when shed read that marika was a distant relation of nikos giggly flirtatious and ambitious shed always thought marika was in love with her cousin demosbut obviously it had been nikos all the time shed been so shocked shed been physically ill then four months later her aunt had written a much shorter note a baby a little girl for nikos and marika her note had trailed off unfinished and the writing on the envelope had been scrawly it was no wonder the letter had been delivered two days after her aunts death shed wept then for not going home in time for not guessing her aunt was ill until shed received the letter for knowing her last link to the island was ended and if shed wept for the fact that nikos had a baby with marika then so be it the whole thing was grey im sorry she said now feeling useless howhow long how long ago since she left nine years it wasnt what you might call a longterm marriage his tone was bitter oh nikos she thought you too wounds might heal but scars remained im sorry she said again but then made a belated attempt to pull herself together butits nothing to do with me nothing from the islands anything to do with me my aunt was the last family i had and shes dead the whole islands your family you rule it was said explosively with passion and athena flinched and couldnt think how to reply the crêpes arrived light and hot oozing a wonderful lemon liqueur and doused with clotted cream this was everything she most denied herself in food nikos picked up a fork and started inthen paused whats wrong i didnt really want these youre ill no then eat he said youre stupidly thin i am not are too he said and grinned and suddenly there it was againthe bossiness the arguments the fun childhood with nikos had been wonderful magic cant make me she responded before she could help herself a response shed made over and over as a kid his dark eyes gleamed with challenge want to bet no eat your crêpes thene she smiled despite herself picked up a fork and ate how long since shed indulged in something this full of calories they tasted fantastic youre not a model nikos said halfway through his crêpes and finally pausing for breath why starve its expected she said you can never be too rich or too thin yeah ive heard that too he growled so theyll fire you if you gain a pound or six that party we were at tonightif id turned up as a size fourteen you think id get a foot in the door youre invited to write about it not be it im part of the scene they like their scene perfect and this is a career you like it beats pulling craypots more silence but he wasnt angry she thought he kept on eating as if shed just commented on the weather shed never been able to needle him oh shed missed him for ten long years it had felt like an ache a limb missing phantom pains shooting when she least expected watching him now it felt as if she was suddenly whole again he was intent on his pancake maybe giving her spacewho knew with nikos hed fitted right in with the people at the party she thought but then she thought no shed got that wrong nikos was an embodiment of what the people she worked with wanted to be they went to gyms and solariums and plastic surgeons and every other expensive way to get their bodies to where nikos had his all they had to do was haul fifty or so craypots a day for life she thought and found she was smiling what he said and she was suddenly smiling straight at him almost pleading for him to return the smile and he did in force his smile had the capacity to knock her sideways the waiter about to descend to take away their plates paused with the strength of it this was a classy establishment their waiter knew enough not to intrude on such a smile ive missed you thene nikos said and his hand was reaching over the table for hers no she found enough sense to tug her hands off the table and put them sensibly in her lap but she couldnt stop herself saying the automatic reply ive missed you too so come home because ive missed you because the country needs you here it was again duty guilt no she closed her eyes and the waiter decided it was safe to come close he cleared the plates and set them again ready for soufflé maybe nikos was watching her she didnt know duty it had torn her in two ten years ago to go back now you know demos wants to open the diamond mines again he said almost conversationally and her eyes flew open what thewhy hes wanted to for years it was only giorgoss greed that stopped him giorgos wasnt fussed about mining themhe had more money than he knew what to do with thankfully but the royal money chests have gone to alexandros on sappheiros theres little money in the argyros exchequer which mines does he want to open she shouldnt care she thought she shouldnt all of them all the island will be ripped apart you think demos cares she stared at him but she was no longer seeing him argyrosthe diamond isles three magic island nations in the mediterranean all whitewashed stone steep cliffs sapphire seas three diamonds glittering in the sun home once upon a time the isles had been three separate nationssappheiros argyros and khryseis but for the last two hundred years theyd been ruled as a kingdom now however with the death of king giorgos without an heir the islands were principalities again and she was crown princess athena ha shed walked away from the royal title when shed walked away from the island but it always had been a hollow tag nikos had more right to rule than she she thought hed lived and worked on argyros all his life he loved it and demos demos was the son of athenas uncle because his father was younger than athenas mother he was second in the ancient lineage where she was first but neither of them had expected to rule from time to time shed read about demos in the society pages whereas shed left her title of princess on the island demos still valued the title prince and he used it hed phoned her a week ago and asked that she abdicate and leave the crown to him shed tentatively agreed because what was the alternative going homegoing back herself was impossible demos arrived back on the island the day after we learned the kings rule was ended nikos said and she realised hed been following her thoughts he wants it so badly hell do whatever it takes to get it hes assuming you dont want it do you know why he rang and asked alexandros rang you as well yes alexandros the new crown prince of sappheiros was trying to untangle the mess that was the succession and you told him you were confused i was she said until demos phoned so youd let demos have it its an empty title anyway demos will enjoy it and how can i come home now she demanded its not an empty title not if he opens the diamond mines it doesnt matter it cant matter my life is here its not much of a life if it doesnt include crêpes or soufflé hey look at this the house speciality was arriving the soufflé this dish was famous how had nikos manoeuvred his way in here who do you think you are she demanded and he grinned a fisherman from argyros a kid in a lolly shop wow shut up and eat thene this food needs serious respect she opened her mouth to deny it she so did not need another sweet her raspberry soufflé was exploding upward and outward crusty dusted with sugar irresistible while she thought weakly about denial the waiter produced a jug and poured a thin hot trickle of bloodred juice down into the soufflé the crust burst at the centre the soufflé swallowed the juice and athena conceded that maybe nikos was right this demanded serious respect she shut up and ate heaven right here on the plate seriously wonderful food missing out on such treats was the price she paid for being where she was if she got up at five tomorrow and jogged double her normal distancemaybe let it go thene nick said he was wiping the inside of his bowl with his forefinger and licking in deep appreciation you had a bigger butt when you were eleven its not natural its what i do she finished and set down her spoon who licked their fingers she had a sudden blast of memory nikoss mother annia standing at her kitchen table endlessly baking she remembered a plum pie that was to die for before she could help herself she let her finger drop into the bowl ran it round the edges and licked not sure whether she was tasting soufflé now or pie from the past hows your mother she asked great nikos said she sends her love she says come homethough if i take you home looking like this shell have forty fits i loved your mother it was said without thinking she hadnt meant it orshe hadnt meant to say it she hated it when you went away thene yeah well suddenly shed had enough more than enough emotion was threatening to overwhelm her she stood up too fast it made her feel dizzy disoriented nikos was beside her in a flash gripping her elbow supporting her she should wrench away he made hermelt i need to go home my cars close you have a car here in manhattan borrowed from stefanos stefanos of course the third member of the guardians stefanos alexandros and nikos had been friends from childhood three intelligent boys bound by one common goal to free their respective islands theyd run together as a pack only of course while giorgos was alive they could do nothing but now stefanos is still in new york she asked shed seen him once when shed walked into a city hospital to visit a friend shed turned and walked out before hed seen her shed even thought of moving to another city because he was here but that was ridiculous it was a big city stefanos is in australia trying to find the heir to the throne of khryseis hes prince regent of that island like you he doesnt have a choice i do have a choice she snapped and one of them is to make my own way home to my home to where i live now how do you get home from here he asked as if mildly interested not taking up her nuances a cab ill drive you i ride the subway the subway this is my neighbourhood nikos she said and made her voice sound sure and mature anddetermined this is where i live but i need to go oscar and nicholas are expecting me who are oscar and nicholas my family she said and the thought of nicholas brought fear flooding back soso if youll excuse meoh you need to pay sorry if i dont wait goodnight and she turned and walked from the restaurant when she reached the pavement she slipped off her shoes and she started to run chapter two carrie was watching tv when she let herself into her apartment lovely comforting carrie middleaged and buxom knitting endless squares to turn into endless blankets for the homeless she closed the door leant on it as if to lock the world out and let herself be comforted by the domesticity in front of her oscar was lying draped over carries feet the big basset hound looked up at her with soulful reproach as if to say you expect me to get up at this time of night you need to be kidding she smiled oscar helped as well hey great jacket carrie said equably from the couch you swap jackets with a boy whoops shed forgotten she was wearing it or maybe subconsciously shed known and she liked it she fingered the soft worn leather and found comfort there as well yep she said a goodlooking one yep to that as well really goodlooking excellent carrie said and dumped her knitting into her carrier bag he ask you out we did already we ate soufflé and crêpes and crêpes wow you going to see him again once is enough once in one lifetime carries face puckered into disappointment why the heck she demanded seriously displeased you know i can take nicky whenever you want you need a love life ive had one but youve kept his jacket carrie said thoughtful smart girl a guys going to miss a jacket like that does he know where you live no ill post it to him dont post it for a couple of days carrie said give the man a challenge she pushed her more than ample self to her feet made her way across the room and gave athena a hug you deserve some excitement and nicky needs a dad carrie just saying carrie said placidly just going and she went leaving silence she sat on cushions still warm from carrie she stared mindlessly at the soap carrie had been watching oscar sighed heaved himself sideways and redraped himself over her feet she needed comfort she needed to stop being angry why the anger after ten years surely she had no right to still be angry with nikos or maybe she had ten years ago shed ached for him to follow her just one wordsomethinga message to find out if she was okay her aunt had known her address nikos had known her aunt but it was as if the moment shed walked off the island shed walked out of nikoss life and nowhere he was demanding she take a part in the islands future demanding she think about argyros and all she could think was that she hadnt told him he had a son he was here the time to tell him was now the time to tell him was ten years ago for him to find out now it had to happen she had to find the courage maybe hed leave without trying to see her again maybe shed have to go to argyros to tell him he was in new york right now she had to get over her anger and tell him and then say goodbye for to go back to argyroseven if demos were to destroy the island with his greed for diamonds no it couldnt happen shed have to do something what nothing she told herself but there was desperation behind the word it had to be nothing shed left argyros behind that first dreadful year shed coped with homesickness isolation fear and the birth of nicky and shed faced it alone shed fought to make herself a living knowing she was all her baby had that which doesnt kill us makes us stronger the often used platitude had become her mantra shed never again let herself need anyone as shed needed nikos she no longer loved nikos and she no longer called argyros home her head hurt thinking hurt she needed to sleep but sleep wasnt going to come easily tonight if she filed her story nowthatd mean tomorrow was free saturdaynicky had the day off school they could go to the parksomething anything just to get her away from here buy her a little time she should take off nikoss jacket not yet for just a little bit longer shed allow herself that one small comfort who the hell were oscar and nicholas husband son sons he was going nuts not knowing hed hired someone to find her the firm hed hired had given him the magazine she worked for and a brief summary of her career it was hardly personal why had he never thought she could be married she wasnt wearing a ring that could mean anything rings werent compulsory nor was marriage its lack didnt necessarily mean you were without a longterm partner why had she responded to him with anger hed hardly expected her to fall into his arms as her long lost friend hed married someone else marikahe thought of his exwife now and fought back anger that stayed with him still but you needed to move on he needed to move on he had or he thought he had until hed seen athena tonight she was every bit the girl he rememberedbut now she was a woman her eyes had tiny creasessmile lines did she smile often did the unknown oscar and nicholas make her smile hed forgotten how shed made him feelor maybe hed blocked it out looking at her across the restaurant table tonightit had taken all the power he had to keep his voice neutral to keep his feelings in check she was still athenathe girl hed loved to the point of madnessand then shed chosen her career over him the woman hed held in a corner of his heart for ten long years oh thered been other womenof course there had as the owner of the biggest fishing fleet in the diamond isles he was considered more than eligible he was never lost forcompanionship only every woman he dated compared with athena even the woman hed married especially the woman hed married the old anger gripped him tore at him the old hunger only it wasnt an old hunger it was as real and as raw tonight as it had ever been he opened the door to the adjoining hotel room the woman from the hotel sitting service rose to leave shes been very good sir i read her the book like you said she even undressed herself i didnt think thats great he said he didnt want to hear what she didnt think goodnight then the woman said and slipped away into the night he stood for a moment gazing down at christa his daughter was sucking her thumb even in sleep she shouldntbut who cared he crossed to the bed and sat down beside his sleeping child he stroked her pretty dark hair she opened her eyes and smiled sleepily at him papa go to sleep kitten he said softly nnice she closed her eyes again and was instantly asleep how could he still be angry athena had moved away but now in his heart in her stead he had his little daughter for years hed tried to think that it didnt work it never had for years hed envisaged athena in a barren lonely existence in a strange land hed almost hoped for it shed left him he should have cut off all thoughts of her he shouldnt care but it wasnt possible not then and not now athenaor his daughter athena and the unknown oscar and nicholas so she had a family too well so be it he thought trying to be rational he had his christa and he was content what he was feeling now was the echoes of the past from now on the personal had to be set aside for the good of the island tomorrow he had to find her again she had to face her duty she must hed take christa sightseeing tomorrow morning maybe they could take a buggy ride round central park shed enjoy that then in the afternoon hed go to see athena again and get his jacket back he thought of his jacket as hed last seen it draped round athenas shoulders as shed fled the restaurant maybe he should have followed her butand it was a big but there had been fear in her eyes as shed fled real fear he didnt know why he intended to find out but for nowhe was inexplicably glad shed worn his jacket home how could she explain a mans jacket to the unknown nicholas and oscar unaccountably he found himself smiling he hoped they were good to her yeah that was a rational thought generous even butshe had to come back to the island even if it meant she brought this unknown oscar and nicholas with her though their existence could make things much more complicated whatever tomorrow could be faced tomorrow he told himself trying to block out the unwanted image of athena with another man by her side trying to block out how it made him feel after all this time surely jealousy was crazy of course it was he kissed his daughter softly on the forehead the touch and scent of her soft little body helping him put things into perspective goodnight sweetheart he whispered well have a good time tomorrow just see if we dont and then well persuade the princess athena to come home where we belong and where she belongs too in the morning the sun finally decided to shine nikos and his little daughter did the circuit of central park twice and then they did it again christas unalloyed happiness the sun on her face the beauty of the horses the garishness of the decoration on the buggyshe loved it she clung to him breathless with excitement laughing out loud for sheer joy halfway through their third circuit he saw athena and a dog and a child how could it be how could fate be this cruel why on earth had she decided to come to a tourist destination this morning stupid stupid stupid theyd been using their ballthrower dogs were supposed to be on leads here but she knew a placemost dog owners did so theyd tossed the ball until oscar was out of puff nicky had run more than the dog oscar wasnt the brightest light on the christmas tree so about half the time it had been nicky whod had to retrieve it finally theyd bought ice cream cones and now they were waiting for oscar to finish his before they walked home oscar a big lumbering bear of canine dopiness took his ice cream eating seriously a horse and buggy was wheeling briskly along the path towards them the horses looked gorgeous she thought the day was gorgeous making up for last nights misery she was dumb to be anxious on a day like this she chuckled at oscars pink nose the buggy grew closer the driver raised his crop in salute it was that sort of day she smiled she waved back and then she saw who was in the buggy nikos and a child the sounds around them faded everything faded she heard nikoss snapped order as if it came from a distance the buggy stopped nikos climbed down paid the driver and lifted the little girl down after him the child was little and dark and beautifully dressed in a pink dress with a wide pink bow white socks edged with pink lace and shiny pink shoes a pink alice band held back her glossy black hair shoulderlength with bangs smiling and smiling downs syndrome the little girl laughed as nikos swung her down and nikos laughed back athenas heart did a back flip landed upside down somewhere else in her chest than where it should be downs syndrome her aunts letter came back to her a little girl for nikos and marika hi she managed and if her voice came out a squeak she couldnt help it hi nikos said back he sounded as incredulous as she wasand as wary the horse and buggy bowled on leaving nikos and his daughter on the verge of the path nikos wasnt looking at her he was looking at nicky nicky who was the spitting image of his fathera mirror image of the younger nikos fatherand son she should haveshe should have it was too late for should haves the time was now this is christa nikos said at last and his voice seemed to come from a distance christa this is my friend athena dog christa said in greek still smiling pointing to oscar iceice cream the ice cream vendor was right behind them wouldwould you like an ice cream christa athena asked and then thought desperately what if she had a dairy allergy what if yes christa said very firmly she looked up at her father searched for another word and found it please she smiled again she was gorgeous athena thought and suddenly found she was blinking back tears nikos was holding his little daughters hand with pride with tenderness with love ice cream papa christa asked and nikos nodded he hadnt taken his eyes from nicky introduce us he said this is nicky she said trying to find the right words and then because she didnt want him to get the wrong ideaeven if there was no denying the wrong idea was rightshe added quickly nicholas of course he said noncommittal and the dog oscar she turned awayfast ill buy christa a cone would you like one no thank you it took time to get the cone there were people queuing ahead of her then she thought she should have asked christa what she wanted but somehowshe knew strawberry and she was right pink christa said with huge pleasure she looked at the bench where nicky and oscar were seated sit she said nicky smiled and shifted just slightly so there was room for christa to sit between him and oscar athena thought im going to cry she was not going to cry still nikos said nothing neither did she words were too big or too small there was nothing to fill this silence finally nikos found words that might do for now filler words its good to meet you nicholas is oscar your dog or your mothers mine nicky said and she thought great question generally shy discussions of oscar made nicky blossom how old is he were not sure he was in our street one day when we came home he was dirty and really really hungry we took him to the animal shelter cos mama said someone might be looking for him but no one wanted him so we got him back i called him oscar cos mama told me she had a dog called oscar when she was little before my mamas mama died i remember oscar nikos said softly gravely he was great if your oscars like him he must be really special he is does he eat everything like that oscar was still licking stretching the experience for as long as he could nicky had chosen a rainbow ice cream for him and hed wedged it between the planks on the bench oscar had a paw on either side of the cone so it couldnt tip his nose colour had changed now to green he enjoys his pleasures does oscar athena said and nikos finally looked at her really looked at her the look would stay with her all her life she thought numbly disbelief awe anger and raw undisguised pain he is isnt he he asked and there was only one way to answer that he is he closed his eyes where to go from here you cant do this thena he said and his voice was suddenly harsh no more you walked away with this i didnt know it was a cry of pain but she knew it was no excuse you walked away and now he paused took a deep breath then another leave it he said and she wasnt sure if he was talking to himself or to her i cant take it in just come back to the island and well sort it there we need to get the succession in place if you dont come home the island will be ruined how selfish can you be selfish she would have gasped if she hadnt felt so winded me selfish then before she could stop herself she produced the question that had slammed at her heart for almost ten years how old is christa nine and her birthday is when june so there you go she snapped the old stupid grief welling up in her all over again nickys nine and he was born in september what does that tell you nikos nothing he snapped except that you should have told me so maybe you should have asked when i leftthere was nothing you told me not to follow i didnt expect you to believe me she yelledreally yelledand everyone looked at her even oscar christas ice cream started to drip on the side she wasnt licking nikos automatically stooped and turned it around for her wiping her chin before it dripped on her dress it was a tiny gesture but for some stupid reason the sight of it cut through her anger and made her want to weep again its time we went home she whispered and nicky looked up at her in surprise we were going to walk right round im tired im not he said clearly astonished tell you what nikos said why dont we compromise nicky im from the island where your mother was born i know your mama just shouted at me but maybe thats becausebecause we both got a shock your mother and i have known each other since we were children but this is the first time ive been to new york yes nicky said not sure where this conversation was going what if christa stays here with your mama christa gets tired easilyshe has a problem with her heart that makes her tired but shell be happy here with a dog and an ice cream so your mama and christa can rest here christa can finish her ice cream and you can show me all the way round nicky looked doubtfully at his mother she was too numb to respond thene nikos said urgently and she tried to pull herself together what was he asking fine she decided anything the gods would have to take control from now on she couldnt can i take oscar nicky asked yes nikos said you really knew my mother when she was little her son asked when she was princess athena nikos told him your mother needs to be princess athena again come with me and ill tell you why will oscar come with us nicky was looking at her waiting for her approval what did it matter she was no longer in control here she knew nothing fine she said weakly taketake your time christa and i will look at the zoo she sat on the bench and watched christa finish her ice cream and the desire to weep grew almost overwhelming what was it with men how could she have thrown those two birth dates together and have nikos react without the slightest regret or shame or guilt hed called her selfish for leaving the island shed told him she wanted to leave for an exciting job in new york and hed looked at her with shock and disbeliefand hed let her walk away but if he knew the true reasonthat if shed stayed his family would be ruined that the old king had threatened everything nikos loved if she stayed how could he never have guessed hed never ever asked hed never so much as written and when shed learned of christas birth she knew the reason why he hadnt her fingers were clenched into her palms so hard they hurt papa christa said suddenly as if shed just realised nikos was gone she looked worried this wasnt christas fault she had no right to let her own misery and confusion spread to this little girl hell be back soon she said gently papa theres a little zoo just near here do you like animals the little girl considered big she asked little funny animals friends friends christa said and put out a hand for athena to help her to her feet she smoothed her dress tucked a sticky hand into athenas and had another lick of her ice cream friends there were so many questionswhere to start an inquisition could be a good way to send nicky straight back to his mother where do you go to school he asked and then thought great very insightful not over there the little boy told him pointing south east good that got him places do you like school sometimes i hafta go to greek lessons after school too you speak greek mama does she makes me he needed time to take that one in they walked along kicking stones nikos suddenly realisedhe was kicking stones in front of him so was nicky with his left foot youre lefthanded mmm nicky said your mamas righthanded mmm riveting stuff both being lefthanded it meant nothing it meant everything has your mother told you about argyros yes he said are you a fisherman yes i like boats have you been on boats twice i dont get seasick mama does this is the place where a beatle was shot right nikos said he gave up there were too many questions for one small boy to handle there were too many questions for him to handle they were sitting right where hed left them only christa had replaced her ice cream with a hand puppet a squirrel she wiggled it as they approached her face lighting up as she saw him thena boughtmesquirrel he grinned and swung her up into his arms no matter what else was happening here this mustnt touch her that had been his mantra for almost ten years and he wasnt budging now thank you he said gravely to athena we didnt get all the way round nicky said we caught another buggy nikos says john was his favourite beatle he was yours too wasnt he mama yes she said sounding repressive imagine he said softly and watched her wince it had been the last night theyd been together i have to go away shed said but shed sobbed and clung he hadnt understood why she had to leave shed completed her university degree by correspondence far younger than most her writing was brilliant everyone said so she could take a job with the local paper and write the novel to end all novels theyd agreed she could stand by him in his battle with giorgos that was what theyd planned but suddenly she was crumpled broken sobbing about having to leave i need to go i just need to go please nikos dont make it any harder hed thought it was her writing that was driving her youll come back i dont know i cant nikos shed run out of words hed been angry shocked bewildered that night in his familys boatshedtheir last night hed played music by john lennon on his tinny little sound system imagine he thought now nicky must have been conceived that night no matter he had to get rid of the white noise there was only one absolute you need to come home he told her no then demos wins he made an almost superhuman effort to rid himself of his emotional tangle and concentrate on what was important i need to go home tomorrow he said i thought i had a week to persuade you but demos has already contacted mining companies hes acting as if he owns the place i darent stay longer but its your birthright athena and he added its your sons and your and my daughters he finished for her harshly for maybe she was going places he wasnt ready to go just yet our childrens you must come home no think about it he said briefly harshly theres so much happening here i cant take it in whatevers gone on in the past he glanced at nicky and felt as if he was on a shifting deck unsure of his footing unsure of anything for now we need to put that aside if you dont come home then some time soon ill be back here tosort whats mine but my priority right now has to be the islanders thousands of livelihoods thena princess athena theyre your people you answer to them and not to me except he hesitated and then said the words that had to be said the words that had been in his head for the entire tour of the park except on the question of my son he said she gasped thats not fair lifes not fair get over it athena and come home princess nicky had been listening on the sidelines troubled not understanding but trying you said my son he pointed out trying to be helpful did you mean your daughter nikos nodded grave as nicky i must have he agreed but im a bit upset right now i need your mama to come back to the island where she was born you called her a princess she is a princess shes my mama she can be both i bet your mama says you can be anything you want if you try hard enough he turned and faced athena straight on she was lovely he thought in her casual sweatshirt her jeans her tumbled curls tied back with a piece of red ribbonshe was a mature version of the girl hed fallen for ten years ago longer the girl hed loved for ever he couldnt think that your mama can do anything she wants he said to nicky but he kept right on looking at athena i think its time for your mama to do just that because i think she wants the island of argyros to be safe just as much as i do chapter three so two weeks latermaybe she was out of her mind but she was going back to a place shed thought shed never set foot on again argyros the silver island of the diamond isles if giorgos had had a son this never would have happened generations of islanders had ached for the islands to revert to the three principalities they had once been now with giorgoss death they had but why did it have to happen on my watch athena muttered as she stood on the deck of the athensargyros ferry and watched her island home grow bigger beside her was nicky he was practically bursting with excitement he should be in school she thought how could he get into the college of his choice if she kept interrupting his education that was only one of the arguments shed thrown at nikos during the tense phone calls that followed his visit but always it had returned to the bottom line if she backed away from her role as crown princess then demos would open all six diamond mines whereas nikos had a very different proposalto open one mine avoiding mess and with minimal effect on the islands environment profits to go into the islands infrastructure and the island could prosper nikos had told her all of this by phone talking of nothing but the island making no mention of how these children had happened how nicky and christa affected their futurenothing nothing nothing apart from that one outburst in the park hed contained his rage as shed contained hers weve been civilised she thought and tried to feel proud of herself instead she felt small belittled by the latent anger she heard behind nikoss civility frightened of what lay ahead how long will we stay by her side at the rails nicky suddenly sounded as scared as she was for ever ive taken a months leave im hoping by the end of the month nikos should be able to take over the running of the place running likethe government if i can organise things then nikos will be the government when i leave are you the government now technically yes though my cousin has been filling in we dont like your cousin demos im not sure we do she said nikos says hes greedy but lets just see for ourselves shall we okay he said and tucked his hand into hers with the infinite trust of childhood she needed someone to trust too she thought what was she letting herself in for well just slip in quietly do what we have to do and leave she said im hoping well hardly be noticed ill show you the places where i swam and played when i was a little girl ill figure how to stop demos digging his great big diamond mines then we can go home with as little contact with the locals as possible so we wont see nikos and christa he sounded astounded more sad i guess we will she said and he lit up again good i like them christa likes oscar oscar she glanced down at the dog on the deck beside her crazy coming all this way and bringing a dog but she needed to she needed as much family as she could get nicky and oscar were it we slip in quietly do what we need to do and leave she said to herself again as shed told herself countless times before ill give nikos the authority he needs and leave but what aboutnicky the small matter of nikoss son it cant matter she thought yes nikos was angrymaybe he even had a right to that anger but there was still the matter of christa conceived three months before nicky when he and she it didnt bear thinking about well get in do what we have to and get out again she said again to nicky no fuss nothing and then the boat passed the headland and turned towards the harbour and she discovered that no fuss wasnt in the islands equation shed come right up until now hed thought shed back out but he knew shed boarded the ferry in athens short of jumping off she had to be here so hed let it be known demos had been acting crown prince if athena arrived on the quiet as if she didnt want the crown it would give everyone the wrong idea the islanders were terrified by demoss plans they needed athena andthey knew her the only child of a lone and timid mother home schooled because the king didnt want her to mix with the island children athena had every reason to be isolated and aloof but athena had been irrepressible born a tomboy shed declared aged eight that nikos was her very best friend and whatever he did was cool with her as children theyd roamed the island looking for mischief looking for adventure looking for fun tumbling in and out of trouble giving their respective mothers cause for palpitations hed loved her the islanders had loved her they had been kids who together just might make a difference to this islands future and now that time had come he watched the ferry dock and knew that how athena reacted in the next few moments affected the future of every islander including him mama why are all these people here uhoh she said what does uhoh mean it means nikos is making a statement what sort of statement that im a princess coming home she said so the streamers and balloons and the great big signs saying welcome home to our princess that would be for us what do we do im not sure stay on board until they get tired of waiting and go home i dont think thats a good idea nicky said dubiously so it wasnt a good idea she conceded it was an excellent idea but she knew nikos was down there she knew how much he loved this island and she knew for certain that if she didnt walk back onto her island home hed come aboard and carry her balloons had drifted into the water a couple of excited kids had jumped in to retrieve them and the ferry captain was forced to reverse and wait for his men to verify it was safe to dock nikos watched and waited feeling as if he shouldnt be here feeling as if he had no choice the islanders were going crazy their pleasure in athenas arrival was a measure of how terrified theyd been that demos would destroy them it was also a measure of confidence that athena wouldnt betray them did he believe it up until she was nineteen hed believed it he and athena had plotted what theyd do if giorgos was to die without an heir he grinned now as he thought of their plans theyd build a cinema theyd set up a surf schoolthena thought shed make a great surf instructorand what the heck theyd invite a few rock groups over but in their serious moments theyd had a few more solemn ideas theyd slowstart the diamond mines theyd ensure every child had the funds to get a decent education theyd set up a democracy all of these things had been discussed over and over as theyd wandered the island as shed come with him in his familys fishing boat and helped him haul pots as shed sat at his mothers kitchen table and helped shell peas or stir cakes when had he first figured he loved her it had crept up on him so slowly he hardly knew but suddenly their laughter had turned to passion and their intensity for politics had turned to intensity of another kind the night her mother had diedshed been seventeen hed cradled her against his heart and thought his own heart would break and thensuddenly it had been over it seemed she had a chance of a journalist apprenticeship in new york leaving had never been in his vocabulary and hed never believed it could be in hers and now shed returnedshe was standing at the ferrys rail looking lost and he was standing on the jetty wondering where he could take it from here she had nicky by the hand mother and son and dog the sight made him feelhell he didnt know how he felt go on nikos his mother annia was beside him holding christa go and speak for all the islanders you know its your place its not my place it is annia said fiercely no one else will do it and hadnt that always been the case as the kings sister nikoss mother had always stood up to the old king shed fought for the islanders rights and as hed matured nikos had taken her fights onto his own shoulders hed built up a fishing fleet that was second to none but the islanders knew he worked for the whole island they looked to him now as leader he was in an uncomfortable position but he had no choicethere was no one else willing or able to take it on and nowif the only way athena would rule was for him to stand beside her and guide her every step of the way then hed do it hed been raised to love this island and he would not see it destroyed so nowhe shoved aside anger loss confusion a host of mixed emotions he wasnt near to understanding and he strode up the gangplank with the determination of a man who knew where his duty lay and as he reached athena he took her in his arms and he hugged her whether she willed it or not whether he willed it or not welcome home he said and lifted her and swung her round in his arms a precarious thing to do on a gangplank but jubilation was called for princess athena welcome he said in a voice to be heard by all we all welcome you dont we he demanded of the crowd and the islanders roared their assent its our royal family someone yelled princess athena and prince nikos nikos is only a prince if he marries athena someone else yelled and there was a huge cheer of enthusiasm hey demos is already a prince maybe she should marry him someone yelled as the applause died and the crowd laughed the laughter was derisive and nikos glanced to the back of the crowd and saw demos even from this distance his body language was unmistakable he was rigid with mortification and with fury athena had a real enemy there he thought in the mood he was in demos could do harm not if he stayed close he had no choice in order to protect this island then he needed to protect this woman he intended to stay very close indeed athenas smile looked pinned in place she was terrified he thought its okay he murmured no she murmured back its not okay at all im doing this because i have no choice if you think i like being hugged by you the crowds cheers were building athena waved and so did nicky and nikos had no choice either he waved they stood together theres a reception tonight at the palace he told her theres a what they were all in the royal limousine heading for the palace nikos hadnt wanted to come with her but once again thered been no choice someone had to introduce her to the palace staff hed brought christa along to lighten the atmosphere a bit to stop things getting too personal oscar lay on the floor looking exhausted it had been a very long waddle down the gangplank giorgos would have had a fit if he could have seen this dog in his limo nikos thought and suppressed a grin the limousine the palace these trappings of royalty had been kept so giorgos could come in state whenever he wished they could get rid of it all now nikos thought but then he considered the crowd whod turned up to see athena arrive theyd cheered her with joy she was giving the island its identity back did she even realise it a reception he repeated trying to get his head round practicalities everyone whos anyone on the island and a few more three hundred people how many you need to make a statement i dont of course you do he said flatly thats what youve come for but im not staying she said sounding desperate nikos i cant do this a reception people cheering its not who i am its what you were born to i was born to be nothing thats a dumb statement do you need to sound angry im not what have i done to make you angry nikos she demanded suddenly as angry as he was i could tell you he glanced across at nicky but not here why not its hardlyappropriate how about if i decide that she snapped they were being chauffeured along the magnificent coastal road that wound round headland after headland stretching on until it reached the royal palace of argyros but athena wasnt looking at scenery she was focused on him i dont think how about we stop thinking she snapped she closed her eyes for a long moment then she opened them and she reached for her sons hand nicky had been alternately looking out of the window and looking at his mother he was a smart kid nikos thought he could hear the undercurrents of her anger there were things going on that he didnt understand and he obviously didnt like it nicky i want you to listen for a bit athena said full attention he gave it athena glanced at nikos glanced away took a deep breath nicky when i saw the people at the boat she said faltering for a start and then making her voice firmer i realised there was something that nikos and i need to tell you that maybe we should have told you before this do you remember asking about who your father is i told you your father was someone i met when i was very young i told you that he was my best friend but then he married someone else that man is nikos nicky nikos is your papa what the what had she just said shed taken all the wind out of his sails and then some it had clearly astounded nicholas as well nikos isnikos is nicky said and faltered to a stop staring at him as if he had two heads do you see his hair all at once athena sounded wearystrained to breaking point its the same colour as yours it curls the same you see how that little bit sticks up right at the top of nikoss head yours does too nicky stuck his hand on top of his head and felt the offending tuft his eyes grew enormous it was all nikos could do not to do the same i told you that your papa was a fisherman athena said thats what nikos is isnt that right nikos shed given him a son just like that like it or not where to go from here she should have done this nine years ago he thought dazed fighting anger but knowing instinctively that his anger was no reason to mess with things now to say no lets talk about this at a more sensible time maybe we need dna tests maybe we needcounselling or something nicky was looking at him with eyes that were blank with shock what happened in the next few moments would affect him for ever he didnt need a counsellor to tell him that he had the power to mess this for life so where to go what to say when youve just been given the gift of a son i should have been there for your mother he said softly i should have been around for you im very very sorry that i wasnt why werent you nicky said and there was only one answer only the truth would serve i didnt know he said heavily your mother left the island a long time ago when she was expecting you and she didnt tell me you were born maybe because we were both very young she thought it was the right thing to do maybe she thought it would be easier to bring you up on her own when i lived so far away i wish id known nicky but thats in the past whats important now is that youre my son im so proud that your mothers finally told me about you im so proud to finally have the chance to know you he glanced at athena and her eyes were brimful of tears she wrenched her head around so she was looking out of the window but not before hed seen those tears id like to teach you to fish he told nicky fighting for somethinganythingto say hell there should be a book on what he was doing now it was too important to mess with and all he could do was flounder id love to take you in my boat you really own a fishing boat really i dont get seasick nicky said as if that was important neither do i nikos said and felt something grow in his chest the heart swells to fit all comers maybe the corny saying was right his son the thought was overwhelming nicky and christa his son and his daughter his family you have a grandma he said a grandma nicky was clearly overwhelmed her name is annia shes a princess like your mother my grandmothers a princess shes not as pretty a princess as your mother nikos told him and like your mother she doesnt wear a tiara but i hope youll likei hope youll love her shes a better fisherman than i am does she get seasick no one in my family gets seasick he said and he saw athena flinch nicky fell silent no one spoke athena was looking out of the window as if her life depended on it why didnt you tell me mama nicky asked and the question hung for a moment he thought she wasnt going to answer for a moment he thought how could she i was very young she said at last and her voice sounded as if it came from a long way away i was in america and i was by myself and i knewi knew nikosyour papaand his wife were having a baby here that baby is christa so i thought your papa needed to stay here to take care of christa i knew i could take care of you and i did and behind those words raw unresolved pain bleak stark dreadful how to take that pain away nikos knew that he couldnt ten years of pain and the only way he could alleviate it was a truth that wasnt his to tell and he hadnt caused that pain it was athena whod left why didnt you come back here nicky asked her obviously fighting to find some sense in all this i have a great job nicky athena said i needed to work to support you but nicky paused and looked from athena to nikos and back again his mother and his father and a history he didnt understand this was too heavy nikos thought it was way way too hard maybe they should have left this for the future for some more appropriate time to tell him but what was done was done and somewhere in this mess they had to find joy he had a son yes there was heartache and regret but he had a son and his son needed to lose that look of confusion andand yes even the echo of his own sense of betrayal see that rock out there in the bay he said fighting for the right note the big one with the flat top about two hundred yards from shore mmm nicky said still dazed i taught your mother to dive off that rock or i tried to she kept doing bellywhackers i did not athena retorted struggling not to falter and he knew that where he went shed follow how could she help it now you did too he said and managed a strained sort of grin you get your mama to take you out and show you her diving skills he told nicky shell do bellywhackers every single time christa can you swim athena asked still sounding desperate and nikos thought maybe hed got it right hed deflected the father bit giving nicky time to come to terms with it as he wanted he knew there was a lot more discussion to come some of that would have to be personal between athena and nicky some of that needed to be between himself and athena i likeswimming christa said shed pushed her shoes offshe hated shoesand her feet were resting on oscar i likedog i think oscar likes you athena said does this mean christa is my sister nicky asked and nikoss thoughts went flying again the issues were too big huge i guess she is athena said softly your halfsister then she said gently christa has something called downs syndrome that means she was born with something a little different from most children all the bits that start a baby growingtheyre called chromosomes christa got an extra one it makes the tips of her ears a bit small it makes her tongue a little bit big and her eyes really dark and pretty and it affects her in other ways too including her speech but she likes oscar she does athena said gravely smiling at christa i think christa is our friend already i think having her as your sister might be really cool so much for leading the conversation nikos thought it was now about the three of them he was right out of the equation somewhere once hed read some scathing comment on fatherhood mothers knew all about their childrens dramas their love lives the spots on the back of their necks fathers were vaguely aware there were short people in the house not him he thought with christa hed been so much more hands on but he felt sidelined here i wanted a sister nicky was saying cautious a little sister but christas nine im nine christa said nodding grave agreement but shes much shorter than you thena said i think she always will be so that means shell always be your little sister so i get to look after her if you want do i hafta share i guess you and christa can work those things out for yourselves athena said and christa looked at nicky and beamed nicky she said brother nicky said importantly and thumped his chest brother christa repeated and thumped her chest they giggled just like that nikos thought stunned it was over just like that yeah thered be complications yeah thered be difficulties but for nowit was sorted now athena said in a voice that boded ill now what about this reception what were they thinking talking of social events when shed casually given him his son he felt as if all the wind had been sucked from his lungs and he wasnt the least sure how to get it back nicky and christa were looking at each other sizing each other up still grinning occasionally giggling having a sister was obviously a big deal for nicky bigger than having a father hed missed out on nine years of having a son he looked back to athena and she was looking as dazed as he was i wanted to tell you she whispered i didnt know how likethe phone he couldnt keep anger from his voice and he got anger in return you think so i should have phoned youand your wifeand thought about the consequences later a host of angry rejoinders crowded his head none of them could be said in front of the children maybe none could be said at all the reception she said again flatly moving on seven tonight that at least was easy the crown prince and princess of sappheiros will be welcoming home the crown princess of argyros officially handing over control and then what he saw panic flare nikos i cant do this alone i cant do this at all run this country i have no experience i have nothing to qualify me for such a role ive taken four weeks leave thats it if thats it then youre handing the crown to demos this isnt fair lifes not he said shortly he had evidence of this right in front of him hed had a son for nine years and he hadnt known she stared at him speechless he stared out of the window tried not to think that yes it was unfair as kids theyd planned to do this side by side they still could if sheif he it had to be thought of the lawyers had demanded he think of it how could he think about it you will be there tonight she said urgently and a blunt voice inside him said no let her sink not telling him he had a son but then he looked at her he caught the terror and he caught something else the athena hed once loved she was still in there and this islandit was his home and he loved it he had to support her come what may and he had to convince her to stay enough one step at a time ill be there he told her with me she said urgently i wont remember names people will know me and i wont remember them ill say the wrong thing nikos you have to help me ill help you he hadnt said it right he sounded petty angry resentful and she got it terror turned to anger again just like that dont you dare dare what dump this on me you talked me into this you made me come home im your responsibility nikos i came home because of you you came home because of the island i came home because we talked ourselves into loving this island together if youre even thinking you need me to stay then you need to support me every step of the way ill support you tonight he said beyond tonight was a place he was too fearful to think about chapter four the castle was a time warp the limousine pulled up in the castle forecourt athena climbed out argyros circa eighteen hundred it was almost enough to jerk her out of the emotional mess shed just landed herself in it was almost enough to make her stop thinking about nikos the palace was built of the stone used throughout these islands whitewashed once but mostly faded to its original soft grey it was two storeys high in the centre with long single storey wings at either end the garden was overgrown to the point of riot vast wisteria vines gnarled their way over the buildings like great knots on ancient gift wrapping there were olive trees bougainvillea wild daisies and clumps of blue and yellow irisesa riot of colour the palace looked half buried by gardena fantastic wilderness and behind the castle was the backdrop of the sea as a child shed heard the palace had the best swimming beach on the island but who knew shed never been in these grounds the castle had been protected by vast stone walls for as long as she could remember guard dogs were said to roam at night giorgos had hardly ever come here but hed deemed it his what was his he held fiercely so who does this belong to now she whispered to nikos as she stood in the forecourt feeling stunned feeling the warmth of the mediterranean sun on her face hearing the wash of the sea under the cliffs the crown nikos said briefly that would be you unless you abdicate then it goes to demos hes been staying here since giorgos diedsince he phoned you and you told him he could have it i told him you were coming back and he had to vacate she gulped i hadnt thought she whispered demos must hate me he hates me too nikos said but he touched her arm lightly in a gesture of reassurance which was supposed to be steadyingand strangely was but we neednt feel guilty somehow he wheedled his way into the kings favour giorgos left him a personal fortune sadly for demos a fortune will never be enough there was so much here to take inshe was fighting to understand it meanwhile staff were waiting lined up as if in some period play the women were wearing uniforms that were grimasdeath black the men wore black too alleviated only by high starched collars in pristine white in this mediterranean paradise they lookedridiculous you need to meet your staff nikos said and she thought about backing into the limo and slamming the door this was scarier than scary youre kidding me right i cant employ these people maybe you cant he said neutrally giorgos kept the castle fully staffed demos intended to sack them and modernise the place but now its your call they cant like working here she looked again at the uniforms at the stoical faces at their ramrod straight posture looking like this looks dont matter he said briefly apart from a struggling fishing industry theres very little employment her head was starting to spin nikos knew this place she didnt it should be nikos in charge but he was giving her information only and waiting for her to act as she willed waiting for her to fail certainly he was judging her anger stirred she could do this she would she was not going to fail in front of nikos the staff were in two formal lines not a muscle was moving they looked almost like waxworks can i afford to pay them she demanded the royal coffers are at your disposal nikos said neutrally theyre overflowing how can they be overflowing i though we were broke giorgos taxed everything once a year he cleaned out the argyros accounts and moved the money to sappheiros its been nine months since theyve been cleared and alexandros is shifting what funds he knows are ours back youll need to start road repairs harbour deepening the infrastructure you can provide employment and make this a better place to live in the process but im a fashion editor she said and to her horror she heard herself beginning to wail i cant do this your staff are waiting nikos said he was holding christas hand standing apart set oscar downhold him by the leash he told nicky your mother needs to meet the staff and if you intend to live here then you need to meet them too am i going to live here nicky gazed around in awe cool it is cool nikos said gravely im not sure if your mother thinks so i dont think so she was fighting for control she was taking in the crumbling façade of a once magnificent palace the derelict gardens twenty people lined up to see what she would do do i have a choice she muttered no fine then she snapped she was being thrown in at the deep end like it or not she had no choice but to swim i can be a princess if i need to he smiled at that of course you can okay she muttered well then well then she took a deep breath she braced her shoulders and stepped forward she ignored the sensation of nikos at her back watching her judging her hi she said in her best managingthestaff voice a voice she hadnt quite perfected you know who i am i probably should remember all of you but its been almost ten years since ive been on the island so you need to forgive me youll also need to forgive me if i dont get things rightthe things im supposed to do but three things i do know and i might as well say them now first not one of you will lose your job for anything except incompetence or dishonesty not while im here second your salary will stay the same until i have time to review it and even then it wont drop and finallyi hate your uniforms hate em whos interested in giving me suggestions for change she was fabulous she was just as hed always imagined shed be shed been here for whattwenty minutesand the staff were already putty in her hands her career had her moving with some of the worlds wealthiest most flamboyant people she was good at her job it showed he was proud of her how corny was that how patronising he didnt have to tell her what to do he thought he just had to stand back and watch and wonder shed already had volunteers to redesign the uniform shed already said shed like to use first namesif that was okay the staff were already halfway to being in love with her who could blame them so remind me she was at the end of the line looking back at him the reception is at seven yes will my people have the details my people just like that shed taken on the mantel of royalty and once again shed moved him to the sidelines yes he said shortly your staff are putting on the reception so ill see you then yes she nodded the eyes gazing at him were expressionless well be happy to receive you then she said and that was that hed been dismissed by royalty his gaze met hers and held then very slowly he nodded and smiled until then your highness he said softly and gave her a gentle mocking salute off you go and introduce oscar to his new home it took all the courage in the world to watch him gonot to call him backto stop herself whimpering in terror but this role was hers shed returned to the island as crown princess she had to take the responsibility her dream as a kidto take on this responsibility with nikoswas just thata dream hed married someone else hed moved on somehow she must too the housekeepermrs lavrosno first names heregave her a cursory tour of the palace apologising over and over theres not been money for repairs were so thankful youre finally here were so sorry we couldnt get it how wed like it but neither athena or nickyor oscar either for that matterminded shabby ooh its cool nicky said and athena gazed in awe at the vast chandelier in the bedchamber theyd just been ushered into and had to agree this was the kings bedchamber with a smaller bedroom leading off to the side the smaller rooms for the kings valet mrs lavros told her its been years since the kings been here but weve kept it aired theres clean linen on the beds athena was no longer listening she was staring out of the window at the beach that had been forbidden to mere mortals since giorgoss ancestors had plundered this place and made it theirs nicky and oscar were already out on the terrace scrambling through the balustrades figuring how they could clamber down to the cliff path she was a princess did princessesclamber has nikos seen this she breathed the beach was wide and golden curving from headland to headland the sea was glistening diamondsfabulous romantic im not sure the housekeeper told her but if you please maam what will you wear tonight tonight a royal reception how many people she stopped thinking about clambering somethingsimple she ventured the housekeepers face fell everyone wants to meet you she said we so want our own princess prince alexandros and princess lily will be here from sappheiros of course and theyre wonderful but theyre not our ruling family prince alexandros will wear his medals she said wistfully dont you have a formal gown it was said without much hope and athena looked at her two suitcases and knew her lack of hope was justified shed packed for four weeks and shed travelled light shed brought one formal little black dress nikos should have warned her nikos should have warned her about the reception she thought again feeling anger build but but prince alexandros and princess lily would be here andthis was really hugenikos would be here as well nikos whod fathered a child to another woman before shed left the island nikos whod married marika nikos who shed thought she loved with all her heart whod finally dreadfully taught her not to trustanyone hed thrown her in the deep end herebut she would not sink he hadnt warned her hed expect her to beordinary she glanced at her watch it was still only midday she had seven hours could she nikos would be here she would be a princess nothing to it she thought mentally spitting on her hands and getting down and dusty she wasnt fashion editor of one of the worlds biggest glossies for nothing mrs lavros if my cellphone doesnt work here then i need a landline she said and the internet i need help to become a princess and i need it fast she didnt come down until seventhirty she almost didnt come down then she was listening to nicky read she and nicky had changed readerlistener roles about two years back when hed decreed her choice of stories was boring since then this had become her special time of dayto quieten nerves to remind herself what was important to focus solely on the two of them and this night she needed her quiet time more than shed ever needed it in her life this night she was terrified for the moment she went downstairs she turned into a princess nicky was reading from a manual for a model t ford gripping stuff much more gripping than what was happening downstairs but she couldnt stay up here for ever finally the housekeeper appeared maam its nikos she said apologetically he says if youre not downstairs in two minutes hell come up and carry you down and i think he means it youd better go mama nicky said nikos is really strong he smiled shyly at the housekeeper nikos is my papa hes your the housekeepers chin sagged well mama just told me today nicky said proud of the effect hed created christa is my sister well the housekeeper said again i cant say i didnt wonder when i saw you butwell she surveyed athena with growing concern oh my dear demos will hate it youll need to be so careful but you need to get tonight over with first you look lovely you do us proud butif you dont want the father of your child to carry you forcibly down the staircase then youd best come now nikos was close to being out of his mind what was athena playing at keeping them waiting and she should have a gown he hadnt thought of it until everyone had arrived but every woman here was in an evening gown his friend prince alexandros and his wife princess lily looked positively regal but it was athena who should be a princess tonight he thought dammit he should have warned her shed be a real cinderella among this splendour and if she thought hed orchestrated it so that she looked shabbyanger wouldnt begin to describe it but there was no time left for misgivings the housekeeper was on the stairs looking towards him asking a question with her gaze he strode through the crowd and took two steps up so the crowd could see him somewhere above was athena he hoped like hell her dress wasnt too dowdy there was no time to do anything about it now she was up on the landing waiting for his signal to come down waiting for the official introduction ladies and gentlemen he said in a voice that carried to every part of the vast hall i give you her royal highness the princess athena crown princess of argyros chapter five the crowd gasped as one nikos stepped down and turned and saw and gasped himself she took his breath away she took away the breath of every man and woman in the crowded hall nikos had never seen her more beautiful hed never seen anyone so beautiful she looked to be almost gliding down the stairs one elegant hand rested on the balustrade to steady herself her hand was gloved long and elegant and beautiful and her dress her gown was shimmering silk brocade in rich deep crimson its tiny capped sleeves were slipped to just off her shoulders and the neckline dropped to show the glorious swell of her beautiful breasts her bodice was embroidered redblack on the deeper crimson and laced from breast to waist with slivers of silver thread from her hips the gown flared into fold on glorious fold of the same richly embroidered fabric falling to her feet the skirt was slashed at the front showing a soft silk underskirt black shot with crimson magnificent didnt begin to describe it she stepped slowly down the stairs beneath the great central chandelier as if she was aware of dramatic effect her gown shimmered in the light cast by a thousand crystals above her head there were diamonds at her throat and more at her ears her shoes were crimson stilettos to match her gown studded with more diamonds still her beautiful black curls were caught in a simple twisting knot tied with the same silver thread that laced her bodice she was an exquisite portrait she was a royal princess she was the crown princess athena come home to claim her throne around him there were gasps of delight amazement disbelief and the gasps gave way to applause nikos knew why from the uncertainty of the past months finally the islanders could glimpse their future these people would be deeply appreciative of this grand gesture deeply grateful that their princess was taking up her throne thena no not thena this was crown princess athena a woman now so far out of his league that suddenly he feltas if he had no place here what the hell where did she get that dress it was demos standing beside him his face a picture of apoplectic fury how longs she been planning this she told me she told you she wasnt interested in ruling the island nikos said his gaze never leaving athena where had she got the gown it surely hadnt been in one of the small cases shed brought here with her wherever it had come from it was perfect and the islanders were dumbfounded athena had effectively been brought up in isolation families whod shown her friendship had been harshly warned off by giorgos that she had turned out so full of spirit was a testament to her strength and to her courage her mother had homeschooled her on orders from giorgos so nikos hadnt met her until theyd been eight years old hed been birdnestingnot stealing eggs just observing trying to reach the highest nests on the craggy island cliffs shed looked up at him from below and hed said dare you to his astonishment shed come right on up on the way down shed cut her knee regardless of her protests hed taken her home so his mother could fix it he remembered shed stopped outside his back door im not allowed into peoples houses why not hed demanded astonished the king says im not allowed and he remembered his mothers reaction shed come out breathing fire the king doesnt command who comes into my kitchen shed retorted welcome to my home my love nikos bring her in oh look at your poor knee annia had defied the king to marry nikoss father and where athena was concerned she defied him again you stay friends with her nikos giorgos can rant all he wantshe wont scare us he looked at her now and thought giorgos had been right to be worried she was truly regal princess lily tucked her hand through nikoss arm doesnt she look lovely she breathed she does there was no denying such a truth why is demos looking like thunder he thought athena didnt want the crown he thought it was his for the taking hes scary lily said watching demos shove through the crowd and leave he came to see alex a couple of days ago i had a feeling she shivered sorry i just thoughthe seems ruthless theres nothing he can do is there not you look out for her lily said urgently and nikos frowned what do you mean i know what people are capable of when theres money at stake she said be careful nikos the poor womans terrified are you kidding shes every inch a princess youre only seeing the clothes she said and sounded disappointed in him what was there to see but the clothes a lot he knewa lot but hell it hurt to think that then theres your son lily said and he stilled i beg your pardon your son she was all seriousness now alex says rumours flew from the time people saw him at the ship he says the age is right and you and athena were lovers no i what the hell yes then theres another reason to take care of your princess your son is now heir to the throne any threat to athena would also be directed at him have you thought of that no no the thought poleaxed him lily alexandros was ushering athena forward princess athena may i present my wife princess lily lily smiled then astonishingly dropped into a deep curtsey theres no need for curtseys athena said sounding breathless bordering on appalled there certainly is lily said if youre about to take on the role of crown princess you need every bit of respect you can get nikos bow or something were expected in the great hall nikos growled princess athenas kept the kitchen waiting i hope dinners not spoiled which earned him a glance of gentle reproof from lily princess athenas permitted to keep anything she wants waiting she said grandly including you nikos take the ladys hand and lead the way she was seated in the centre of the head table at a royal reception just for her it was almost too much to take in to her left was nikos then alexandros and then lily they were chatting as old friends shed love to be included but on her right was the archbishop talking and drinking at an alarming rate he spoke in theological platitudes and any attempt she made to make the conversation more generalto include nikos or to talk to the woman on the other side of himsaw the platitudes grow louder being royal was suddenly boring she pecked desultorily at her dinner not hungry but then nikos leaned over and murmured into her ear ignoring the archbishops monotone thena the kitchen staff have worked themselves into a lather getting this meal ready tonight there hasnt been a royal reception on this island for twenty years i need to tell you that theyre likely to fall on their kitchen knives if you dont eat your dinner she stared at him astonished and saw he was serious and she had no comeback he was already talking again with alexandros okay shed eat her dinner shed listen to the archbishop shed be a good princess what was she letting herself in for she might look like a princess she didnt feel like one nikos was simply dressed in a black suit beautifully cut with a crisp white linen shirt alexandros was wearing full royal regimentals they looked like two princes she thought they were two princes by right if not by birth this crown should belong to nikos finally the archbishop paused for breath he rose a little unsteadily and headed towards the bathroom alexandros rose and slipped into his seat once upon a time alexandros had been her friend as well as nikoss friend once upon a time when life had been innocent im sorry about this he said softly nikos is throwing you in at the deep end this should be himnot me he smiled and shook his head he works behind the scenes our nikos his mothers done an extraordinary amount for this island and so has nikos but they do it quietly and with no fuss another woman had made an almost unseemly rush to fill alexandross vacant chair beside nikos nikos smiled a welcome at her the woman simpered does he have a girlfriend athena asked alexandros before she could help herself not seriously lots of shortterm encounters but little more i dont think hes ever got over marika that was nine years ago how long does it take after a bad marriage to trust yourself to a good one alex asked quietly to learn to trust another after such betrayal they were quiet for a moment watching nikos watching the woman inch her chair closer you and he he said softly you know we all thought itd work me included she said before she could stop herself marika was a very attractive woman and nikos was very young the same age as me nineteen so maybe you need to forgive each other especially he hesitated and then obviously decided to be frank especially if you have a son i dont need to forgive nikos she looked at alex fullon nikos gave me my son i regret nothing so if he forgives you hell have it flung back in his face the archbishop was back waiting for his chair she turned to him and smiled sweetly im glad youre back where were we nikos could do nothing but watch this dinner was interminable alexandros had abandoned him to talk to others the woman hanging on his words was driving him crazy he wanted out of here he could go but that would mean not watching thena and he was mesmerised by her he sat and watched he responded to the laughter and noise around him the islanders were jubilant that they had their princess home hed brought her home hed done his job he should leave coffee was served an orchestra playing gently in the background until now raised its volume and struck up a waltz this had been prearranged alexandros was to lead athena onto the dance floor alexandros in full ceremonial uniform was every inch a prince as athena was every inch a princess in moments she and alexandros were swirling round the floor with skill and grace if lily hadnt been sitting on the sidelines hed have been jealous jealous he didnt want any part in this goldfish bowl of royalty he needed to support thena from a distancenothing more the waltz ended there was a moments pause and he thought they were about to dance another but alex whispered something to athena and strode back to lily athena stood alone for a moment as if considering and then she walked deliberately back to the head table so she was standing right before him nikos its thanks to you that im here tonight she said steadily clearly so all the room could hear the prince alexandros tells me youve taken care of this islandyouve worked ceaselessly behind the scenes to protect the islanders from the worst excesses of the old monarchy i thank you and i ask you to do me the honour of this dance she was playacting he thought shed swept down those stairs in her magnificent dress and shed assumed the mantle of royalty her words to him were those of a crown princess a woman who knew her place in the world and assumed the respect of her birthright hed be proud of her if he wasnt so bewildered if he wasnt so angry for there was still anger simmering underneath there was still nickys birth to sort but now wasnt the time not when she was holding out her hand there was nothing to do but to take it id be honoured your highness he told her and her control ended it was he who led her back onto the dance floor it was he who took her into his arms and led her into a waltz they could do this one wet winter when school was out and athena was a constant presence annia had declared enough with the television and the card games one day if the gods look favourably on us you may eventually rule this island shed told athena and nikos may well help you so you need to learn to act as royals so his mother had taught them their royal history taught them their ancient rights taught them protocoland shed also taught them to dance he stepped onto the dance floor he took athena into his arms and the years disappeared they might as well be back in his mothers sitting room with her complaining on the sidelinessmooth nikos smooth hold her as if shes precious not a sack of potatoes hold her as if shes precious how could he help but do that she was exquisite her skirts were swirling around him as she melted into his arms and he let the dance take them where they willed the smell of herthe feel of her it felt as if it was yesterday that theyd walked hand in hand over every inch of this island swearing eternal love swearing they could never look at another she was the most beautiful womanthe most beautiful princess the waltz ended but another began as if the orchestra knew this was no time for interruption he had his thena in his arms again it felt as natural as life itself it should be you taking the crown she whispered you deserve it the momentthe magicwas broken he felt it slip away with infinite regret i deserve nothing princess dont call me that its what you are for four weeks he almost misstepped hed have no excuse because dancing with thena was like breathing you cant leave he said you know that i make up my own mind as you did last time walking away i believe i ran she said she was smiling a gentle smile that would have everyone thinking she was enjoying a light conversation with him there was nothing to run from he said angrily oh but there was she said her smile not slipping and i didnt know the half of it i should have run much sooner youre not making sense then arent we a match she said they danced on other couples were joining them on the floor he had to think of something to say anything where did you get your gown he tried you like it she sounded strained to breaking point its worth over ten thousand dollars which is a fraction of what these diamonds are worth what the hell his brow snapped down in confusion youve managed to get your hands on the royal exchequer her eyes flashed fire somehow her feet kept moving her smile stayed in place but daggers could be less lethal than the look she gave him i must have she said and he could see that the effort it cost to keep her smile in place was almost superhuman after all i only have weeks to strip the place bare thena nikos she snapped you know me better than this i dont know you she didnt respond they circled the dance floor twice three times more and the music came to an end thank you she said stiffly and let her hands drop from his he was aware of a sharp stab of loss quickly suppressed lets not let emotions get in the way here he told himself but they already had it was my pleasure he said just as formally but she wasnt finished with him im a fashion editor she said coldly formally i know the value of product placement so i let it be known that the new princess athena of argyros would be presented to the public for the first time tonight the fashion houses marketing teams know me they know i can carry clothessee there are advantages in not eating crepés and soufflés so they moved fast flying clothes and jewellery from athens this afternoon i get to send them all back but not before im photographed by the worlds presswhich if you look to the balcony also seem to be present so ive organised my clothes nikos and ive organised them myself id never touch the island coffers i never will and then she added a more hesitant trailer and nikos my feelings for you are messing with my ability to do this job if this is to work then i need to separate them you want me to leave you alone thats it when you have my son hes not your son unless you earn the right to call him that whats that supposed to mean i dont have a clue she said and sighed and then repinned her smile and turned around to a middleaged lady whod clearly been aching to talk to her audience over it was so hot in here she felt as if she was suffocating this dress was fabulous but it required a serious waist she had lacing not only on the dress but also on the less than glamorous undergarment underneath move over scarlett ohara she thought grimly as the night wore on what women put up with in the name of vanity but the dress the diamonds the effort shed gone to were working there were cameras everywhere she knew the worlds press the glossy magazines liked nothing better than royalty on their front covers so be it shed done the glamorous bit as a clear signal that she was a real princess it was a signal to demos to lay off it was a signal to nikos that she was up to the task she was dancing with one islander after another they were treating her with awe what a difference a frock makes she thought ruefully when she was a child these men and women had obeyed the kings ruling and had nothing to do with her only nikos and his mother had defied the king nikoshe was dancing too with one beautiful woman after another mr popularity that was unfair she conceded shed been here less than a day but already she was being told how much nikos had done for this island hed fought giorgos every step of the way butshe was his tool she thought bleakly as the night wore on she was a tool for nikos to use in his fight to save the island and as for the pasthow much of that had been real and how much had it been nikoss desire to rule this island as he wanted it to be ruled the dancing ended she needed air she left the ballroom and the crowd parted before her as if she wasroyalty could she ever get used to this the room next to the ballroom was the great hall where dinner had been served it was deserted now cleared and empty but its vast windows looked onto a balcony and the balcony looked over the sea she walked out and stood at the parapet gazing out over the ocean breathing the night air breathe in breathe out try to relax she smelled the salt breeze from the sea there was the scent of flowers she hadnt seen or smelled for ten years she loved this island loved it what the hell do you think youre playing at she whirled and it was demos portly and flaccid and simmering with obvious rage he walked out and slammed the door behind him do you seriously think you can get away with this with what its mine he said fiercely stepping towards her with an intent that frightened her giorgos always meant it to go to me giorgos no longer has a say in how this island will be ruled its in the hands of the the gods dont give me that youre not wanted here you promised me i meant the people and i didnt promise you anything liar you lied to me she said evenly you said you cared for this island now i find it was just greed he was so close to her she could feel his breath he was pushing his body into her space so her back was hard against the parapet you left this island to have a kid nikoss kid theyre all saying it you think we want a woman like you to run the island i care for the island more than you do you dont know what care is he closed his eyes regrouped okay heres another solution you know how much these diamond mines are worth we can split it you dont want to live here neither do iits the pitsbut someone has to you go back to your life in new york and ill take over ill do what has to be done and well cut the profits fiftyfifty you cant say fairer than that demos she said trying desperately to keep her voice steady im not opening the mines you might have to i dont know what you mean there are ways he said viciously you care about your kid dont you itd be a shame if anything happened to him you cant watch him all the time you go back to manhattan and hell be safe again she felt cold and she felt sick you cant hurt us she managed and he simply smiled and he raised a hand to hit her onlyhe didnt she was backed as far as she could putting her hands up in a futile attempt to prevent a blow but the sweeping hand didnt reach her a dark shape had sprung from the shadows as if it had always been there demoss hand was held before it had a chance to find its mark demos twisted lashing out with his boots moving so the shadow was now in the light nikos how dare you touch her he let demoss hand drop as if it was slime demos struck out again but nikos was before him he punched so hard that demos sprawled backward crashing over an ornate chair falling hitting the ground with a sickening thud lying there for one long moment while thena thought dear god hes killed him nikos didnt say a word his hand came out and took thenas holding hard an oath came from the tiled floor not dead then nikos tugged her hard against him putting her slightly behind him his body between her and her cousin he watched in grim silence as demos struggled to his feet demos straightened swore again and looked at nikos with murder in his eyes if hed had a gun athena thought with a shiver of pure dread then nikos would be dead or if hed been wearing alexandross ceremonial sword what is she to you he snarled to nikos this has nothing to do with you princess athena is the mother of my son nikos said and his voice made athena shudder it was as cold as ice rigid formal and grim you just threatened my son and he tugged athena closer you were about to strike my woman ill defend whats mine and this woman and her son are mine hear me well demos for i mean every word get yourself out of this palace and off the royal grounds if youre seen within sight of princess athena or her son again youll be thrown off the island never to return then he turned his back on demos as if he had no interest in him at alland he took athena into his arms chapter six athena stayed right where she was held tight against nikos she was shuddering so hard she couldnt stop and it was easier to stay than to pull away for who wanted to pull away she no longer knew what demos was doing she couldnt seenikos didnt let her see she was aware of heavy breathing of his sinister presence nikos must be watching him but her face was buried against his chest leave nikos said again quietly there was a loaded silence then a muttered oath of such invective it took her breath awayand demos was gone he hates me she whispered feeling ill he doesnt love and he doesnt hate nikos said he wants he wants wealth and more wealth thena he put her away from him holding her at arms length thena youre standing between demos and a fortune i dont want it thats why i brought you home he said softly because youd never want it i knew that about you when you were eight years old and people cant change so much demos was greedy from the start hell destroy these islands you can face up to him but but i dont want to no and you also say youre going back to new york i understand your career is important to you you put it before the island once beforeand i understand youll do it again but these people want a figurehead thena im not a figurehead im just me he shook his head at that one look at you he said smiling wryly and once more he had her at arms length youre stunning youre every inch a princess youre who the people want i dont want to be royal sometimes what we want and dont want doesnt come into it he said softly demos isnt alone you know there are heavies behind him heavies yes likearmed thugs people who could hurt my nicky she whirled away from him and headed for the door but his hand came out and caught her let me go she wrenched back but he didnt release her he tugged her closer so her breasts were against his chest he had her by one arm holding it about her tugging her in so she was pulled tight against him where are you going im going to nicky but he was letting her go nowhere hes safe ive had security guards watch you both from the moment you set foot on the island he smiled apologetic longer in fact even in manhattan you lessened the risk by telling demos he could have the throne but even then we didnt trust him we there are many islanders whose livelihoods hang on you inheriting he said demoss heavies dont have it all their own way for if demos succeeds you really think hed hurt nicky yes it was a flat statement with no equivocation then im leaving he can have it i dont want it not if it puts nicky in the slightest danger let me go thena do you really want demos to destroy these islands his voice was grave low and urgent and something about his tone stopped the rising hysteria the rising panic this was the real nikos the nikos shed spent her teenage years with the nikos who cared about this place so passionately that hed taught her to care as well until shed met nikos shed been taught to feel as trapped as her mother was trapped wed leave if we could afford it her mother had told her im so sorry you have to stay here im so sorry the royals are destroying your life as well as mine that was how shed been raised but then along came nikos with his passion his fire his certainty that they could make things right shed fallen in love with his fire and she heard that fire now the sheer singleminded determination to create justice for this island to do whatever needed to be done to achieve that end i cant care she whispered not if nickys in danger youd feel the same if it was christa i feel the same that its nicky he said hes my son too once again hed taken her breath away he was still holding her hand to hand his hold imparting warmth strength and urgency hes noti mean how can you care i would have cared for ten years if youd let me and the old anger stirred for ten long yearsnot one call nikos not one letter thena dammit this is past history its not its here and now its two kids we care deeply about an island we care deeply about and our future my futures in manhattan you wont be safe in manhattan i cant protect you there thena there are six diamond mines at stake were talking billions that money has to be held in trust for the island for ever it cant stay in royal hands we need to get the royal thing sorted the government sorted so we can finally transfer the mines to the community so these mines are no longer owned by one manor one womanbut the island as a whole so they can be worked sensitively as the community needs them you need to stay for three reasons one so i can protect you two so we can keep the mines safe and three he hesitated three because nikos is my son ive missed ten years of his life and i believe i have the right to know him now this was doing her head in the impersonal and the personal were mixing in a combination that was threatening to overwhelm her nikos had been her first love for the last ten years shed tried to forget him but she never could every man shed dated shed compared with nikos and theyd fallen short shed finally decided nikos was a figment of a young girls romantic longings impossible to be true but also impossible to leave behind but here was the dream come spectacularly to life nikos with a body to die for a smile to die forand words so blunt and decisive that she believed him there was no reason to believe him she told herself desperately christa remember christa why cant i sign the diamond mines over now she demanded put them in a community fund or something theres no community fund everythings owned by the crown then set one up i cant set one up princess only you can do that then ill do it she said wildly tomorrow and dont call me princess it cant be done tomorrow you think you can just hand that amount of wealth to the town council and walk away i need to tell you now that it would be a catastrophe itll take years to get this right so how about it thene say youll stay and let me protect you ive told demos ill protect whats mine and i mean just that and amazingly infuriatingly he was smiling that smile was sososeductive he was seducing her with his voice and with his smile she thought wildly im not yours she managed youre the mother of my son oh great what sort of answer was that one that joined them at the hip for ever you saw the press here tonight he said the world has another princess do you think you can escape that the press will follow you all the way to manhattan and so will demos youre scaring me you need to be scared his smile faded im sorry thena but you need to face facts you didnt tell me these facts when you conned me into coming here she snapped that thered be threats to nicky you wouldnt have come exactly you had to come and i will protect both you and nicky youre still angry i didnt tell you about nicky how can i not be she wrenched her hands back so strongly that this time he did let her go well how do you think i feel you betrayed me in the worst possible way i thought you were my best friend as well as my loverand nothing nothing it was your decision to walk away it wasnt he stilled what do you mean but she wasnt going there some things were best left unsaid i need to go to bed nikos she said wearily knowing it was true im exhausted its been some day you will think about what ive said i will think about it she said of course ill think about it youve scared me you seriously think demos could harm me yes hes greedy and shallow but hes my cousin i dont know what you stand to gain by my staying i told you nicky you think i trust you enough to think thats the only reason you can trust me thene this is nonsense nikos she said wearily once upon a time we trusted each other but that was a long time ago im so confused i cant think straight so let me be tomorrow ill think about arrangements for when i return to manhattan ill do my best to protect the island from demos ill talk to lawyersill do what i have to do but trust you how can i ever do that and she turned and walked back into the ballroom her gown swishing around her leaving nikos in the shadows watching with troubled hooded eyes knowing she was walking further into danger knowing there was only one real way he could protect her but to do thatto trust her that far once upon a time we trusted each other it cut both ways finally thankfully the interminable evening was at an end she listened while the archbishop made his ponderous farewells she said a formal goodnight to those she must and then she practically ran upstairs nicky was safe she opened the adjoining door and saw a mound in the bed by the window draped by another mound nicky with oscar on top he wasnt supposed to let oscar onto the bed but who was complaining tonight now all she felt was comfort from the big dogs presence a shape rose from a chair beside the door and she practically yelped maam its only me mrs lavros her heart thudded back into place whwhy are you here she stammered mr nikos asked me to stay here she said his instructions are that were not to leave the little one alone whatwhat right does he have no right mores the pity but he cares about this island so much you think it was hard to stop her voice from squeaking on the second try she managed it you think he should be crown prince everyone knows and trusts him the housekeeper said solidly youve been away so longbut nikos has been here hes always been the one weve turned to in times of trouble hes always been ready to stand up to giorgos in the last few years weve been left more or less alone thanks to nikos but nowyoure hereand nikos says youll make a fine crown princess and im sure you will too maam its demos and his friends who nikos worries about hes fearful for you he shouldnt worry ill be fine i know youll be fine the housekeeper told her for nikos is keeping you that way he has guards in place in the corridor and out in the grounds youre safe she stared bewildered are you

tonight she said mrs lavros raised her brows in polite disbelief has he now its not something id credit all i know is that whatever nikos does theres reason for goodnight maam sleep well and safely for hell be watching over all of us she sat for a while and watched nicky and oscar sleep she tried to sort the events of the day into some sort of order she failed it was a weird kaleidoscope of emotions with nikos front and centre finally so tired she could scarcely stand she walked into her bedroomthe kings bedchamberand started to undress uhoh one of the maids had helped her dress the gown had something akin to a corset underneath designed to make her figure a lot more hourglass than it naturally was there were fine bands of what was surely whalebone inserted inside it was laced down the back this gown was designed to have people help the wearer in and help the wearer out here there was only her she struggled she struggled some more she was almost turning herself inside out it wouldnt even rip and where were a pair of scissors when she needed them she was in a royal palacewhere did she go in a royal palace to find scissors there was a bell pull by the mantel she could pull itbut how loud would it be she might wake the whole palace she struggled and swore some more she was practically breaking her neck trying to see where the lacing was even if she could see how it was laced she couldnt reach she could wake nicky she thought desperately right thatd be a help once he went to sleep nicky slept like the dead shed wake him and itd take a cold shower to get him alert enough to unlace her dammit she could do it if she could just reach an inch further there was a knock on the door she froze it was two in the morning what the who is it nikos there was no mistaking the voice brusque urgent nikos she didnt know whether to be relieved or not are you okay he demanded of course im okay she managed why wouldnt i be okay the security guards in the garden contacted me they said you appeared to be in trouble im not they said you were strugglingthat you appeared distressed what the she stared at the window and winced the great bay windows of her bedroom were hung with fine silken netting that formed the first layer of curtaining but there was a second layer swathes of crimson velvet were pulled back fastened to the sides with huge golden tassels oh no she glanced through into nickys room checking his windows the velvet curtains had been pulled closed until now she hadnt even noticed that there were heavier curtains over the fine ones but nowshed been standing before the dresser trying to see the back of her dress in the mirror there was a chandelier in the centre of the room blazing with light so shed been standing in a netted bay window struggling with her dress while the chandelier shone its light behind her they would have been able to see she blushed and blushed then blushed some more and ached for her nice anonymous manhattan apartment im fine she managed thena whats wrong is someone in there with you im stuck she said and listened to the silence on the other side of the door stuck he said at last cautiously yes stuck this damned dress youre stuck in your dress in my underskirt oh for heavens sake ill let you in but if you dare laugh i wontlaugh he said but laughter was already in his voice of course hed laugh she knew this man too well pull the curtains first he said and she could still hear the laughter i need to radio the men to say theres no drama but if i enterthey can see i know what they can see she hauled the curtains closed with a viciousness she was feeling towards the underskirtand towards the man in the corridorand hauled the door open nikos was no longer in his formal black suit he was in a pair of jeans and a loose battered jacket his hair was tousled and unkempt and she knew they woke you up she said stunned they were worried i couldnt get my dress off and they contacted you it looked like i dont even want to think what it looked like she managed dont you dare grin i wouldnt dare but he was grinning are you sleeping in the palace for the time being wheres christa with my mother she stared at him blankly he gazed back his laughter fading you really are worried about me she whispered we really are princess dont call me that she was close to hysterics she thought she was close to hey its not all bad isnt it its not his hands caught her shoulders and held he was looking down at her his dark eyes fathomless thena dont dont what i dont know she muttered totally bewildered backing away from his hold just unfasten this slip will you im ready to rip it but the fashion house that lent it to me would have forty fits besides she added honestly i tried and it wouldnt why arent you wearing a sword a sword to slice the thing open you want me to slice your underclothes off with a sword he said cautiously i dont know it sounds a bitcavalier youre laughing im not laughing just get it off she said and then looked at his face and thought uhoh the royal command wouldnt work here this was nikos and he always had been one for trouble please she said before he could make another wisecrack can you unfasten it a sword would be more fun will you wait until i find one no just unlace me okay princess he said and smiled again i could never resist a damsel in distress even without my sword ill rescue you come here nno sorry but other sensations were surfacing here something about the night the lateness something about how damned sexy he lookedlaconic strong and sure dressed how shed always known him battered clothes a bit unkempt gorgeous ii think ive changed my mind she stammered can you call the housekeeper you dont think i can unlace you i dont know if i trust you thats a harsh thing to say she bit her lip but she was right shed thought shed known this man as well as shed known herself one nineyearold daughter had put paid to that trust but still this was only lacing she trusted him enough for lacing she conceded okay she said begrudgingly and his smile broadened it was a killer smile it was a smile to melt a womans heart good but if were talking undressing herelets make doubly sure we lose our audience he flicked the light switch the chandelier disappeared into darkness the only light remaining was the fires soft glow in the grate it hadnt been tended for hours so it was now a bed of softglowing coals it was hard to see anything by it was hard to see nikos by but she knew what he looked like hed been her friend for ever hed been her lover as well for just a short sweet time but that loving had been a natural and wonderful extension of their friendship she hadnt forgotten any of it so here he was her nikos in her darkened bedroom moving towards her with intent she should order him out but it was as if this was meant a part of who she was she looked up at him in the dim light not backing away knowing what was intended knowing also that his intent matched hers knowing he knew it she stood simply waiting simply wanting he took her in his armsand he kissed her she froze for a whole three seconds while her mouth registered his touch while her body registered his feel while she realised what was happening and that she wanted it as much as he did she should push him away if she was sensible but the sensible part of her was no longer connected to who she was for she was suddenly the athena of ten years ago athena in nikoss arms half of the thena and nikos partnership forged when theyd been eight years old broken but now magically come back together it was as if two parts of a whole had finally rejoined fusing so the white noise disappeared the voices muted that said this was crazy dangerous stupid this wasnt stupid this was nikos this was his body against hers his mouth on hers his hands holding her tight tighternikos making the night disappear he was pulling her so close she felt she was sinking into him maybe part of her was and it was sinking back where it belonged crazy crazy crazy she didnt care her breasts were on fire where they were touching his body and the fire was spreading heat was building starting low moving upward flooding her body with fierce hot want nikos his tongue was in her mouth exploring searching and she felt herself stagger it didnt matter for his big hands were holding her cradling her against him allowing no chance of her falling away from him she was his woman his mouth said it his hands said it nikos nikos nikos she was surrendering to him she wanted him so much nikos but then cruelly outside intruded the radio at his belt crackled into life you okay boss it was a gruff request full of concern he had to respond she knew he did he pulled away with a muttered oath dammit i should haveyoure distracting me woman is that my fault she demanded even managing to sound indignant and he grinned there were electric charges going off everywhere here zinging around in the darkness like fireflies she felt light and hot and wonderful she hated the voice on the radio its okay zak just a wardrobe malfunction he said into the radio and there was a moments staticfilled silence thenyou want some help fixing it boss i believe we have the situationin hand nikos said and the look he gave her was pure need the zinging started all over again filling the room with wonder he replaced the radio on his belt and took her hands in his like thats done my reputation some good she managed he grinned you want a reputation you just got one but the break had changed things just a little but enough the first desperate tug of attraction had pulled them together now common sense was returning just you want that i should unlace this slip he asked yes she whispered theni think you ought to leave you want me to leave nikos okay his tone was suddenly flat yeah okay we need to keep some sanity here i ami am going back to manhattan you cant he said flatly here it was again this crazy proposition but she was too tired it was doing her head in she said nothing he looked at her for a long considering minute and finally he nodded okay princess youve had enough for one day but you do need to see sense meanwhilemaybe we should stay away from each others bodies its making me crazy so lets sleep on whats the sensible course of action for all of us your career destroyed what was between us personally i cant believe youll let it destroy the island as well it didnt goodnight princess he said softly not letting her finish and it was as if he was closing a door on what had just passed locking a door and throwing away the key think about everythingplease chapter seven athena woke as two bodies landed on her bed nicky and oscar zooming in from the other room launching themselves on top of her oscar barking and nicky whooping breakfast nicky said breakfast in bed mama pancakes there was a soft tap on the door shes awake nicky yelled and a maid appeared holding a tray the maid was dressed in a lovely sapphirecoloured frock a shirtwaister buttoned through from throat to waist the skirt flaring out a little but not too much tied at the waist the difference from the grimly clothed servants shed seen yesterday was astonishing the girl was smiling please maam im sorry but nikos said we were to wake you with breakfast at ten nikos said her bemusement deepened there were so many questions she needed answering nikos gives orders to the palace staff yes maam the girl said as if her question was a bit foolish for the most part there was no one else to do it nikos is a fisherman she said cautiously she had her arms full of dog oscar had obviously missed her deeply all nightand was making up for lost time nikos has six fishing boats and employs many the girl said simply when the king started taxing the fishermen so heavily they could no longer operate nikos started taking fish to the mainland he organised funds there that giorgos couldnt touch in the end the only way the king could stop him was by arresting him and confiscating his boats but somehow he found the courage to face his uncle she smiled wistfully the islanders love him she said simply he would make a wonderful crown prince and thenshe realised what shed said and her eyes widened in horror i didnt mean maami meanwe believe youll make a wonderful crown princess its just that we all know nikos and trust him despite the apology there was still regret in her words athena heard itand she even agreed nikos should be crown prince he would have been she thought if theyd married as theyd once planned marriage to the ruler meant automatic and equal status for the spouse sothe thought was suddenly there what if no there wasnt enough trust in the world to take her down that path was there marriageit was such a huge concept that to take it any further seemed terrifying concentrate on now she told herself feeling suddenly dizzy concentrate on what came next right now any more and her head might explode her bed was big enough to hold a small army someone must have crept in earlier and rebuilt the fire it was crackling cheerfully in the grate the maid was pulling back the curtains nicky was already tucking into pancakesmade by the palace staff and brought to her in bed the morning sun was glimmering across the terrace and beyond the terrace was the sea it made her feel rich it made her feel ostentatious it made her feel that she had no right to be here i love your uniform she managed hauling herself back to reality do you like it the girl smoothed her skirt with pleasure maria sewed all night this is the first she says if you like it shell make more i love it she said with enthusiasm good think of anything but nikos she told herself anything but nikos uniforms you know sapphire looks great on you but some of the staff might like different colours how about we leave the choice of colour to each person oh the girl said and flushed with pleasure wed look like a rainbow it seems there havent been rainbows round here for a long time its a wonder nikos hasnt suggested change already oh he has no authority to change the kings orders the girl said blithely or yours either maam and he never would he knows his place how had they got back to nikos again it seemed as if her mind was a whirlpool and in the centrenikos give in she thought just let it come andand his place is with his fishing fleet iyes maam the girl didnt understand what she was askingand who could blame her he has six boats but the one he uses is the one he built himself when he was a young man the athena he has a fishing boat called the athena she said stunned yes maam the girl said and smiled its nice that he called his boat after his princess yes athena said cautiously umis he on his boat now i believe he left the palace before dawn sonikos was fishing while she played princess what did princesses do all day she wouldnt mind going fishing she wasnt bad at hauling up craypots herself i should talk to my cousin demos she said doubtfully i believe prince demos left on the morning ferry for athens the girl said and blushed ii overheard one of the security guards the day spread before her no demos no nikos there were probably papers she should be reading she thought she glanced out of the window the beach lookedfantastic feel like a swim nicky nicky had been sharing a pancake with oscar he paused shed said the magic word swim nicky said cautiously in the sea thats the one yay he yelled and athena found herself smiling life couldnt be all bad threats were a nightmare something for the dark recesses of the night not for now nikos had gone fishing long may he stay there just as long as he stayed out of her head was he nuts to go fishing he had a team of fishermen working for him now and a solid fleet of boats he hardly needed to fish himself but he hadnt slept if he couldnt sleep he might as well work at least demos had left the island it seemed he was on his way to athens maybe to confer with lawyers to try to figure a way around thenas right to rule he wouldnt get answers hed like athenas right to the throne was inviolate as long as she stayed safe but if she left as she said she wouldanything could happen to her back in manhattan he couldnt watch over her and nickyhow could he get to know his son if he left and demos would still be a threat to him as well what the hell to do he knew what he wanted to do he wanted to lift them up sweep them under his own protection place them in his house and leave them there but he had to concede it wasnt just common sense that was telling him to do that it was sheer unequivocal lust he wanted thena hed wanted her ten years ago and astonishing or not his desire was greater than ever but shed walked away once because of her career and now she was threatening to walk away again was one career so important he loved fishing but would he put it aside if the islands livelihood was in doubt of course he would but thena wasnt him once hed thought hed known her but her leaving had shocked his foundations to the core not telling him about nicky had shaken him even further he no longer trusted her and she didnt trust him he knew why but regardless it had been thenas decision to walk away she hadnt known about christa or marika then so the choice had been hers one phone call from her and his life would have followed a completely different course but it hadnt and now he had christa his little daughter who hed decided years ago would be protected against everything everything lay craypots he told himself sharply work with your hands and not with your head so he laid craypots but he just so happened to have taken his trawler around the headland into the cove below the palace he could watch the palace from here he could see the beach so he was still laying craypots when they came down for a swim athena and nicky followed by oscar unashamedly he found his field glasses and watched they were skipping down the path leading from the palace laughing at their dumb dog wearing swimsuits and carrying towels where were his men he scoured the cliffs and found two watching from above another was melting into the shadows in the cliff below he relaxed she was safe she wouldnt be aware of the security men she could enjoy her swim theyd reached the beach shed thrown off her towel and was chasing nicky into the surf she was wearing a bikini red he could see every curve of her delectable body he wanted her so muchhow the hell was he going to control this they were swimming now nicky was almost as strong a swimmer as his mother they were stroking out from the shallows while oscar barked objections from the shore his heart was doing weird things in his chest he shouldnt be watching his son his woman for the first time since nikos had found her in manhattan she felt at peace shed swum in these watersnot in this cove but in one like itas a child she loved it in manhattan ocean swimming was out of the question but she used public pools and shed taught nicky to swim almost before he could walk any time she could shed take him swimming and now her salary was good thered been a couple of magic holidays where shed been able to introduce him to waves he swam as well as she did and he loved this she watched his face as he hit the waterwatched his incredulous delight she knew hed been torn since theyd arrived telling him nikos was his papa had pleased him on one level but he was also confused hed responded well initially but she needed to follow up ornikos needed to follow up she acknowledged and that scared her nikos getting to know her son nikos getting to know his son they both needed distraction ill race you to the headland she called and he grinned and put his head down and swam she could still beat him she thought but not for long he had nikoss long lean body he had a start on her nowand shed have a struggle to catch him but thenthe sound of an incoming boat reverberated through the water she felt it rather than heard it she lifted her head to see nikos was about to bait a craypot when he heard it he paused shielding his eyes from the sun what the a speedboat was coming in from the north fast this type of boat was almost unknown on argyros no islander had money for a boat that didnt pay its keep and this one looked like a toy of the wealthy it was built for speed and right now the thing was almost airborne as it grew nearer the noise was almost deafening it was heading across the entrance to the cove as if its skipper was intent on circumnavigating the island as some dumb speed challenge he didnt like it he didnt like it one bit instinctively he reached for the throttle he was hauling on the rudder and suddenly he was yelling for he knew suddenly sickeningly he knew thena he yelled he was hauling his boat around with all the power at his disposal yelling into the radio get them out of the water get them out maybe he was mistaken maybe theyd pass but he was right at the last minute the boat swerved in towards the beach its engine still screaming there were two men crouched low dressed in black hooded there wasnt an identifying mark on the vessel all this he saw in the split second before the boat had passed heading straight past him into the cove with one aim thena he yelled again but his boat wouldnt pull round fast enough the fishing trawler was too big she wasnt powerful enough he couldnt get to the woman he loved in time to save her shed just reached nicky she caught his foot and tugged he spluttered and came up laughing you little fish she said and hugged himand then glanced sideways at the source of the noise and grabbed nicky hauling him against her they hung together in the water watching they were close to a beach they were hardly out of the shallows the boat would veer away it wouldnt instead it turned slightly dive she screamed to her son dive deep nicky now nikos was gunning the trawler towards the shore with a speed hed never pushed it to before he was yelling uselessly into the radio his men were out from their cover yelling towards the speedboat running down the cliff face along the beach too late too late and then the boat was spinning making a one hundred and eighty degree turn almost on its own axis and where thered been woman and child there was nothing he was so closeso close the wash of the speedboat as it turned had churned the waves making it impossible to see it must have hit them square on there was no sign of them nothing the boat was screaming back past him one of the hooded figures in the boat had a gun nikos saw it he jerked sideways and felt the zing of a bullet just touching his cheek the other figure grabbed his companion gesticulating back at the water where theyd come from deciding whether to sweep in again there was still no sign of themdear god there was no sign nikos was where hed last seen them now searching the water men were still yelling from the beach yelling at him yelling at the speedboat he glanced aside half expecting it to scream in once more men were wading into the shallows his men were armed he saw zeb raise his rifle and fire it was enough the speedboats motor screamed to full throttle and it blasted its way out of the cove and around the headland and away he didnt see it go he wasnt looking for the boat he was looking for his thena and he was looking for his son nicky was better than she was at this game theyd played it over and overwho could go furthest underwater for the last six months hed been able to go almost a quarter length of the pool further than she could he was one bright kid and hed caught the urgency he was pushing himself through the water beside her at right angles to the boat towards the rocks shed go as far as he would shed go not as far she shoved him away from her gesticulated for him to keep going and she burst upward into sunlight into air the noise of the boat was receding instead she heard the heavy thrum of a bigger engine she wouldnt go down again nicky would surface in secondsdear god please let him get far enough away so she could distract whoever it wasthe maniac a boat was coming nearer not a speedboat something much bigger much more solid a fishing boat nikos she was there he saw her surface glance at his trawler look frantically around searching for the threat searching for her son hell where was nicky the propellerhe cut the motor to silence the men on the beach were still shouting thena he called and she swung round to face him nicky she screamed and her voice was filled with terror but thirty yards away the surface of the water broke a childs face popped up miles further he yelled to his mother and then he burst into tears it took him seconds to haul them up nicky first hugging him hard and fast and thena after he hauled her on board she slithered out of his arms and grabbed nicky and she held him as if shed never let go he looked at them boththena and his sonand his world changed his trawler was wallowing in the swell close to shore itd be grounded if he let it drift any further it didnt matterwho cared about a boat he crouched on the deck with them he put his arms around them and held and he knew whatever else happened whatever thena decided whatever course things took from this day this was his family a month ago hed had his mother and he had christa now he had thena and nicky to love and to cherish as well and hed never let them go again chapter eight it was impossible to downplay the seriousness of what had just happened or how miserably his measures to keep them safe had failed men were waiting for him on the shoregrimfaced men whose instructions had been to protect this pair and theyd missed an obvious threat but it hadnt been an obvious threat this could never be traced to demos he thought this boat had come from nowhere and had gone to nowhere it could be traced to no one even if thena and nicky had died today it would have been written off as a tragedy a fool in a fast boat a fool whod gone to lengths not to be recognised a fool with a lethal boat and a gun theyd been lucky so lucky that these two could swim like fish and that hed been there there was a jetty by the headland at the side of the cove he took the boat in and the men were ready to catch his mooring lines to tell him theyd seen the boat coming and tried to radio him but it had been too late too late they were appalled hed thought demos was capable of anything to get the crown no one had really believed him thena hadnt believed him she believed him now her face said she knew exactly how close shed come well get you up to the palace he said gruffly he put out a hand to help her to her feet she didnt take it she was trembling he wanted to take her in his arms and hold her for ever but she was backing away were okay she said stiffly nicky are you okay can you walk of course i can nicky was recovering more quickly than his mother maybe because he hadnt seen the threat for what it really was they were fools he said now indignant they should know not to go so fast near a beach can you have them arrested if theyre found nikos said though i dont have the power to arrest anyone on this island your mother can though she flashed him a look containing a mixture of fear and anger dont you dare say that this is it nikos were going home the threat will follow you it wont we have police in manhattan demos is rich he can pay i dont care im not listening i wont listen thena well leave this he said softly and he took her hands whether she liked it or not you cant take this in now let my men take you up to the palace ill meet you there what are you going to do ill contact the authorities on sappheiros and khryseis and on mainland greece ill get out a description of the boat there are hundreds of pleasure boats like that all along the greek coast one of his men said theres no chance it will be found i have to try he said heavily thena please let my men take you i will she said and tugged nicky to his feet and then im packing were leaving for manhattan tomorrow he ate a cursory lunch with his mother and checked on christa who was happily drawing pictures of herself and her new brother he told his mother what he needed her to do he rang alexandros and he set a small army in motion then he walked slowly across the headland to the palace she had to see sense she wasnt in her bedroom he knocked and when there was no answer he went in no thena he walked across to the adjoining bedroom and twisted the handle dressed simply in jeans and a crisp white blouse her bare feet tucked up under her she sat in a big squashy armchair watching over her sleeping son and her sleeping dog she put her finger to her lips then rose and came out to him closing the door behind her he was more scared than hell admit she said he heard us talking of demos theres a picture of him in the downstairs entrance nikos asked if that was the man who was trying to kill us she shivered he had a cry but hes had a bit of lunch and weve talked it out she managed a smile hes even talking about what we could do to stop him and we took down demoss picture and put it in the trash so hes okay but the jet lags catching up with him as well im glad hes sleeping you should be sleeping as well he said more roughly than he intended taking in the shadows under her eyes i can sleep tonight i wont sleep while nicky needs me hes asleep now he hesitated thena we need to talk im not talking im leaving she was leaning on the closed door her hair hadnt been brushed since the swim shed obviously showered tugged on her clothes and that had been enough there were damp tendrils wisping down her forehead she obviously didnt care she was concentrating solely on her son did she have any idea how beautiful she was last night in her stunning ballgown hed thought she looked magnificent but magnificent was too small a word he thought he didnt have words to describe how she made him feel she was leaning against the door as if she was protecting the child within if anything happened to nicky it didnt bear thinking about hed thought if anything happened to christa hed be gutted now he had more to care about christa thena and now his son there was no way he could let her go back to manhattan he wanted her to stay he wanted to get to know nicky properly as a father should andhe wanted this woman despite their differences he wanted her but there wasnt time to voice his emotions wanting thena had to wait they had to avert this threat first i want you to go to the eagles nest he told her i want us all to go there you nicky me and christa she stared at him in incomprehension the eagles nest someone in this castle told demos you were down at the cove he said there are people here id trust with my life but the staff is too big for me to know everyone thena i need time to sort things out and i wont have you at risk while i do i wont be at risk ill have left you cant leave i can then youll be watching over your shoulder for the rest of your life he met her gaze with strength and unwavering conviction thena if anything happens to you and your son demos inherits he and his friends if you leave then i cant protect you and thena i will protect you youre saying this because you want nicky she stammered im saying it because youre in danger somehow he maintained that flat convincing tone but i wont lie to you he said softly i do want nicky he needs a father hes managed just fine without one until now but her voice faltered how much had she wanted her own father he wondered athenas father had been a weakwilled man who giorgos had bullied and finally bribed to leave the island almost as soon as thena was born as far as he knew thena had never seen him what would it be like to be raised not knowing your father he couldnt imagine his own father had died when he was twelve but he was still a huge part of who he was and he had grandparents cousins uncles and auntsa huge extended family to constantly remind him he was loved thena had been brought up by a single mother maybe she didnt see the advantages of family maybe he had to teach her sowhy are you saying the eagles nest shed obviously been doing her own thinking asking about the eagles nest was a concession that it could happen the eagles nest was an exquisite castle built for the sole use of the king it sat perched high on cliffs overlooking the ocean one road ran in along winding cliffs that soared as granite buttresses and the cliffs themselves seemed to become its walls its safe he said have you been in it she asked incredulously as kids the place had fascinated them i have he told her its fabulous we should have seen it for the first time together thene we tried hard enough as kids they had the eagles nest explained two matching broken bones one sheer rock face rising from the sea two kids daring each other we can drive in now like normal people he said right no one drives into the nest like normal people i guess they dont he smiled thena come on come to the eagles nest with me she was refusing to meet his gaze she was staring along the hall as if looking for an escape route whatwhat possible purpose can we achieve by locking ourselves in the eagles nest itll give us time he said softly now thats what we need alexandros is flying to athens tonight to try and find demos unfortunately we believe its not just demos behind this the money at stakehes weakwilled therell be real power trying to get him set up as puppet ruler i hate this she whispered so do i he tried to touch her hand but she snatched it away id like you to come home with me now and talk to my mother he said your mother he smiled wryly thena okay you dont trust me and why should you but have you ever had reason to distrust annia no i then come let her talk to you please shell talk me into staying youll be fearful whether you go or whether you stay but if you stay youll be safe we promise you that myself alexandros my mother well be your family thene i dont have a family she whispered except nicky how can i trust you you can she stared at him blindly no she said at last not after she faltered and then seemed to make a conscious decision to go on do you know how terrifying it was being pregnant alone in new york do you know how much i depended on you to follow me how can i trust you nikos he grimaced christa marika always the ghost of that long ago nightmare but now wasnt the time to talk of the past he wasnt sure if there ever would be a time but for now he had to move on what happened in the past is in the past he said maybe we need to remember the time beforebefore christa and nicky were born we talked of this when we were kids we wanted this island to prosper we both wanted it that was kids dreaming it might have been but now we can make it a reality he took her hands and held them whether she willed it or not but she made no move to withdraw thena i believe if you leave the island now then demos will win hell threaten nicky youll cave in to his demands and hell end up as crown prince i will not stand by and let that happen you want to be crown prince yourself i want to change this island he admitted i wont lie to you i want this island to be safe and prosperous i ache for it but youve known this youve known its who i am i did think i knew you she whispered but marikashe stopped me knowing you she was my wife for less than a year it doesnt matter how long she was your wife i thought you loved me i did he said softly i always have he met her gaze directly refusing to let her look away i believe i still do no she tugged her hands back stop it nikos dont you dare say you love me i have to leave you cant leave he said steadily not yet okay forget the emotion concentrate on necessity thene this island needs you maybe he shouldnt be throwing this at her he thought ruefully but if she was only part of the athena he remembered then shed have to share this love this passion look at this palace thenelook at it he told her its fabulous and if it was restoredthe royal family could use part of it but what a wonderful public place it would be alexandros is doing it on sappheiros i want to do it too you have it all planned not me he said us we dreamed it thene we walked this island as kids and we wanted it we were kids and it was dreams he said but giorgoss death without an heir means those dreams can be a reality would you willingly stop them happening by handing over to demos does your career mean so much to you that youd walk away again that youd put nickys life at risk in doing so thats not fair its not he said steadily lifes not but this is your second chance trust me move into the eagles nest until we sort demos out put your career on hold this time its not just yourself youre choosing for its for your son and its for the whole island you think i chose last time she whispered when you left he frowned of course you did i had to go she bit her lip and closed her eyes she was trying desperately to make her muddled mind think if he was rightif she really was in danger and after this morning she had to believe him then maybe she didnt have the luxury of choice but to trust him there were still so many questions she needed answered soso where does the money come from she asked you came to manhattan to find me you obviously paid for these security guards i know your fishing paysbut does it pay that much he smiled at that it does he said ive turned into a businessman when you have a daughter to care for and theres nothing else to distract you its amazing how much energy you can put into a passion im a rich man thena but even if i wasntim not in this alone alexandros cares for these islands and so does stefanos well do whatever it takes to protect our own your own being christa i meant the islands he said softly now and steadily but yes christa too i know you feel betrayed by her existence and im sorry you feel that way but i make no apologies for her existence nothing gets in the way of what i feel for my daughter but it doesnt make one speck of difference to what were planning its onlyyou need to be secure and i need to know my son where i go christa goes so well make it a family holiday if you like you me nicky and christa oh and oscar bringing up the rear she stared up at him she should pull her hands away she thought she shouldshe should nothing gets in the way of what i feel for my daughter that was exactly what she felt for nicky no apologies nothing nicky justwas she gazed at nikos and he gazed straight back unflinching strong direct secure demanding she do what was best for the island demanding he get to know nicky declaring his love for his daughter you should be crown prince she whispered ive never really belonged here anyway youve always been the peoples prince you dont give yourself credit he said youre the true princess by an accident of birth your mother was a princess if things had been different you could have inherited the title i didnt he said flatly i dont want it why the hell would i because itd keep me safe she thought because it would let me get on with my life it doesnt matter she said suddenly weary okay ill stay ill stay until demos isi dont knowhow can you defuse a threat like that it might take years itll ruin my career you wanted to write a book dont even go there she whispered youve just told me i have to sacrifice my job because of this island dont trivialise it i wouldnt thene and dont call me thene how can i not he said his hold on her hands tightened athena then he said softly and smiled i know this isnt what you want but well make it work somehow you did already she said steadily more than you can imagine but in not telling you about nicky then i hurt you too so lets stick to practicalities like drying my hair and agreeing that we sleep in bedrooms separated by at least two kids last night you kissed mewe kissedand it scared me witless i lost control and i will not go there again so i control the locks if i wish to leave i can at any time i agree to stay at the nest for a week and then well reconsider that or nothing fine he said and rose ill go home and tell annia her eyes flared in sudden panic nikos youre safe he told her and before she knew what he was about hed placed his fingers under her chin and kissed her lips it was a feather kiss over before it was begun two of my cousins are at the head of the stairs and theyll stay on guard until we move i promise youre safe for how long if i have my way youll be safe for ever he said and he said it as a vow whats mine i keep mine was he talking about nicky but before she could respond hed kissed her again harder this time a kiss to seal a vow ill be back in a couple of hours to collect you he said me and christa but now i need to organise a supply of dog food and a surfboard how safe does that sound he smiled then he turned and strode down the hallway with athena staring blindly after him hed agreed she could be in control she wasnt even close to being in control she went back into the bedroom and she started to shake shed just agreed to move into the royal retreat with nikos nikos the sexiest man in the known universe the peoples prince a fisherman a businessman a man who ordered security whod saved her life this morning a man who knew how to protect his own she took a couple of deep breaths and tried to steady herself was she overreacting maybe she should stop being a drama queen she told herself shed be moving under the umbrella of his protection for as long as it took to defuse the threat that was all then shed go back to manhattan and start her life again she looked over to the bed her small version of nikos was still fast asleep she wasnt overreacting the threat this morning had been real and dreadful nikos had saved their son as well she closed her eyesand then suddenly she opened the door again she flew down the corridor down the great marble staircase past the two burly fishermen on the stairs nikos was already at the grand entrance striding down to the forecourt nikos he paused and turned thene she stopped he was maybe twelve stairs down from her she wasnt going any closer but shed run after him for a reason and that reason still held i didnt say thank you she said you saved our lives you saved your own lives by diving if you and your men hadnt been therewe couldnt have stayed under for ever dont think about it he said gently put it behind you i will she said but that doesnt meanit doesnt mean i dont feel i dont think were supposed to feel he said dryly he raised his hand in a mock salute and turned again striding down the remaining steps two at a time and then he stopped he swung round to face her hey he said suddenly come with me and see my mother we need to tell her what were planning and you havent seen her since we got back i dont think dont think he said shes not so scary i know i nickys asleep hes likely to stay that way my cousins are here watching over him if you like you can ask mrs lavros to sit with him and phone you the moment he wakes up he held out his hand and smiled so nickys safe i promise and you know my mother would love to see you she looked at his outstretched hand the urge to take it was almost irresistible the urge to trust him was irresistible why wasnt your mother here last night she asked she stayed home and cared for christa and she was putting baklava into the oven when i left her this morning baklava nikoss mothers baklava i shouldnt she whispered got you he was grinning no one can resist my mothers baklava for an hour no more excellent he said and his hand stayed outstretched she walked slowly down the steps towards him she spent most of the time on the way down staring at that hand she shouldnt she should not this was nikos taking her to his mothers to eat baklava as hed done a thousand times before the temptation to slip back into that timethat lifewas irresistible illill talk to mrs lavros already done he said and called to one of his relatives who was watching from the top step joe can you ask mrs lavros to watch over nickyring me the moment he wakes consider it done the man said and disappeared are you sure you can you trust joe hes my cousin he said and grinned my father had eight siblings half the islanders are my blood relatives you should so be the prince here i dont need to be not if you stay and his hand was still outstretched he was still waiting trust wasnt black and white she thought christas birth meant that on a personal level she couldnt trust this man but as guardian of this islandas someone shed hand over the mantle of ruleyes she did trust him his hand was still outstretched trustit was a relative thing she could trust a little just a little starting now okay she would she stepped down towards him and put her hand in his and he led the way out of the palace grounds he hadnt brought a car so they walked as theyd walked so many times before along the cliff path leading from the palace to the tiny hamlet where nikos had lived all his life apart from their disastrous attempt to swim this was the first time shed been out of the palace grounds since her arrival shed forgotten how beautiful the island was or maybe shed blocked it out too painful to remember it was picturepostcard perfect houses clung precariously to the cliff face the cliffs seemed to be almost stepped down to the sea with tiny jetties jutting out into the water at their base boats swung at anchor there were a couple tied up at the jetties fishermen were tossing their catch to brawny helpers loading it into trucks for the local market we should be exporting nikos said conversationally as they reached the cliff path she was so aware of his hand holding hers that she could think of nothing else but he seemed perfectly at ease this place is alive with fishwe could make a great case for a cannery as it is most of the fishermen only catch what the local market can absorb so what about you she managed she should tug her hand away but it felt too right it felt toogood my boats are bigger we can take our catch directly to the mainland which made you independent of giorgos his hold was doing strange things to her she was slipping into the skin of the girl she had once beenthe girl she thought shed left behind for ever almost he said though he was always a threat that shook her out of her preoccupation she knew giorgoss threats only too well should she tell him why shed left the island all those years ago should she share the terror that had made her run why if she told himmaybe it would make him feel better about her but it could never alter what she felt in return he was silent beside her theyd always been able to do this she thought talk when there was a need to talk but otherwise relax with each other so words werent necessary comfortable in each others company i do need to get to know nicky he said finally into the silence as if this was simply an extension of his thoughts you realise hes heir to the throne she hadnt thought this through i guess he is she whispered and the thought of a grownup nicky taking control of these islands was almost overwhelming maybe she did need to accept the throne maybe she had a duty to make these islands safefor nicky he should inherit from his father she thought and then she thought maybe he will he loves boats maybe hell own a fishing fleet like his father maybe he should grow up here maybe it was her duty to keep him here there were too many maybes to take in they rounded the bend on the headland and nikoss home was in view and here was another gut wrench nikoss family home was a cottage tucked into the cliff tops surrounded by scores of craypots in various stages of building or repair two wooden boats both decrepit lay upside down tomatoes were growing between the boats and runner beans were climbing over them a big wooden table lay under straggly olive trees and a couple of faded beach umbrellas were giving shade to hens it should be a messbut athena drew breath with delight home and when nikos opened the back door and ushered her in the feeling of home became almost overwhelming the door opened straight into the kitchen annia was at the table her hands covered with flour she glanced up as athena entered and gave a cry of delight athena was promptly enveloped in a floury hug as wide as it was sincere how long since shed been hugged like this she hugged annia back and felt tears sting behind her eyes these were her people this was her island how could she have walked away ten years ago and not look back she hadnt had a choice shes known it then and she knew it now but it felt so good to be here she needs feeding mama nikos said look how skinny she is how goes it sweetheart for christa was at the table she had a pile of dough and was shaping it into balls im cooking she told her father proudly you will like my cooking i will he swung her out of her chair hugged her and set her down again then straddled a kitchen chair and snagged a taste of whatever was in his mothers mixing bowl athena looked blindly down at him still fighting tears everyone trusted this man he loved his family he could never betray them how could he have betrayed her so badly something of her emotions must be showing for annia was suddenly pulling out a chair and pushing her down youve had a terrifying morning she said peering into her face words gone right round the island that demos she shook her head but she was still looking at athena searching for troubleand obviously finding it youve had a hard time my athena ten years of hard time and then she moved straight to the big question the one athena had known would be asked andi have a grandson she said tentatively thats what theyre saying here everyones saying it that your son is also nikoss son ive asked nikos and he says i need to ask you so im asking you is your nicky my grandson there was no way she could answer this except with the truth he is she said and she didnt look at nikos she couldnt well annia said and put her floury hands on her hips her bosom swelled with indignation you bore my grandson and didnt let us near you were alone and you didnt tell us i would have come in a heartbeat i would have come no you wouldnt she thought you would have been helping marika with christa two grandchildren within three months she wanted to yell it at nikos scream it at him but christa was there happily moulding dough and neither she or annia deserved to be hurt annia held a special role on the islandroyal but not royal she was giorgoss sister thered been twenty years age difference and mutual dislike between brother and sister shed married a fisherman and shed stepped out of the royal limelight but she still knew more than most what royalty meant to the islanders shed have made a good crown princess herself athena thought as she sat at the kitchen table shed sat at so many times before with her earthy good senseand with her fabulous son who could have stepped into the role as his right leave her be mama nikos said shortly its past history im taking thene and nicky and christato the eagles nest annias face stilled she looked from athena to nikos and back again and then she smiled to the kings love nest mama her smile was broadening okay okay ill forget its other name soyoure going to the eagles nestwhy to keep thena safe until we find a way to control demos her smile faded for a moment a good idea she whispered youll be safe there and then her eyes twinkled into another smile and maybe while youre there you can enjoy it i was there as a child with my father the old king my mama showed me their bedroom it was the closest place to heaven a woman could get she told me and its one of the only regrets i had in marrying your fatherthat i never got to sleep in that bedroom then as nikos looked bemused she took athenas face in her floury hands and kissed her you make sure you enjoy it she said and enjoy my ohsoserious son and make him less serious iim only staying until the island is safe annia finished for her how long is a piece of string she smiled you and nikosyou and nikos i suppose the answer to your problems hasnt occurred to you mama nikos said again and his mother kissed him enough its occurred to meever since i heard athena was coming home its occurred to me and im sure its occurred to you too for im sure neither of you is stupid but i will say nothing so athenayou want some baklava its almost cooked ino for she was starting to feel overwhelmed the domesticity the gentle loving teasing the innuendoes of a relationship with nikos the feeling of being on the outside looking in shed hated it all her life and she hated it now once upon a time shed thought she could find her own place within this circle it wasnt possible and annias tentative suggestion that she might still was threatening to break her heart annia and christaand nikoswere gazing at her now with various levels of interest and of concern she didnt want their concern she didnt know what she wanted or she did but there was no way in the wide world shed admit it i need to go back to nicky she said standing so fast she almost tipped her chair nikos stood and caught it as it fell problem ino i shouldnt have left him you know hes not awake yet he gestured to the phone on his belt theyd have contacted me i still need to go without baklava without anything she said and she sounded desperate she knew but there wasnt anything she could do about it it was like claustrophobia only worse this kitchen table this man this familythey were a dream shed had since she was eight years old and twenty years on she wasnt one step closer to achieving it and now shed be trapped on this island for heaven knew how long still on the outside looking in she felt sick and sad and empty thena dont look like that nikos said and her eyes flew to his and held he lookedhe looked as if he really cared he looked as hed looked when shed loved him she had to get out of here now ill walk you home he said as she backed to the door annia and christa were looking at her with concern and confusion they might well be confused she thought she was so confused she might as well share im so sorry she whispered to annia we messed it nikos and i but pleasedont hope dont tease its too late to heal it you know i should have no right to the throne my rights are an accident of birth its you and nikosit should be you and nikos ive just got to figure a way around it thank you annia thank you for everything and im so sorry and she walked out of the cottage before they could say a word she closed the door and she started to run you should go after her nikos stared at the closed door and his mothers voice came as if from a long way off she doesnt want me i think she does he shook his head she left mama ten years ago she left and she had my son and didnt tell me shes strong and independent and willful and she wants to pursue her career she doesnt look like a woman whose career is everything she hesitated nikos can i ask maybe i should have asked this ten years ago i did think of askingbut i knew it was none of my business but nowwhen i see athena so distressedyou and marika she paused why did you and marika marry before a justice of the peace and not a priest he frowned marika was pregnant father antonio would still have married you neither of us wanted to be married in the church i know that she said thoughtfully we were upset about itmarikas mother and i but you were both adamant why were you so adamant mama enough there are so many arrangements to make of course there are she said softly and then she smiled christa what is it that youre making a lady christa said the dough now had a small blob a bigger blob underneath two arms two legs and what might have been a skirt thats lovely annia said and beamed you make yourself a lady nikos you go and make one safe and if you can make both of you happy in the processits time father antonio was put to work chapter nine they took the limousine again only this time nikos was driving nicky and christa were delighted to see each otherfar too immersed in the novelty of each other to notice scenery athena had her nose against the window the whole way she and nikos had been here beforeas kids theyd explored most parts of the island both on foot and on the back of a saddletough ponybut theyd never got past the gates of the eagles nest the gates were twelve feet high and padlocked with locks big enough to deter the most intrepid of explorers mind a twelve feet high fence wasnt actually what had stopped them what had stopped them was the pack of dogs left loose to roam the grounds at will soumwhere are the dogs athena asked nervously as the gates swung open at their approach there was only one left when giorgos died nikos said over his shoulder the old groundsman took him home with him he says hes turned out to be a pussycat do you think you can be royal without killer dobermans ill try she said magnanimously and found herself smiling despite the trauma of the morning despite the confusion of her visit to annia suddenly there was a frisson of excitement she felt eight years old again nose pressed against the twelve foot gateand suddenly the gate swung open cool isnt it nikos said and it was as if hed guessed her thoughts the place has always been kept in readiness for a royal visit of up to a dozen guests so there should be room for us well need four bedrooms she said as a kneejerk reaction he met her gaze in the rearvision mirror and grinned and there it was again that smile pure mischief the smile of the nikos shed once known they drew up before the main entrance here again were servants two servants joe and mrs lavros from the palace i figured wed go with staff we know he told her i can make my own bed and we can make our own sandwiches she said lightness fading why do we need anyone i need joe he said flatly once again he met her gaze and the message was unmistakable her lightness faded joe nikoss cousin big burly and totally dependable security and mrs lavros makes baklava just like mama does he said no aspersions on your cooking princess you think i cant cook i didnt say that mama makes great hamburgers nicky said leaping to her defence then he hesitated one day last winter we madebakbaklawhat you were just talking about lets not go there athena said hurriedly nikos grinnedand nicky grinned with himand she suddenly had two guys with identical smiles and it was doing her head in so how did your mamas baklava turn out he asked we ate it with spoons nicky said still grinning it was good but it didnt look like the picture in the recipe book and mama had to spend half an hour scrubbing honey off the oven i rest my case nikos said opening the door of the car mrs lavros is here to stay okay kids its yours to explore the kids and oscar tumbled out of the limousine mrs lavros and joe smiled a welcome and took themselves off and they were alone on the steps of a fairy tale two kids two adults and one dog her family athena thought and then stomped on the thought and concentrated on this truly excellent building it was a true fairy tale castle built two hundred years ago by a mad monarch with delusions of grandeur all white stone turrets and towers it was like a sugar confection a magic secret fantasy wow nicky breathed awed he was standing dumbstruck staring upwards seeing a white flag with blue stars and pale yellow stripes fluttering from the battlements whats the flag for it means the crown is in residence nikos said the crown that would be your mother welcome to the eagles nest princess dontdont call me that we dont have a choice he said its time you acknowledged it this is your place princess youve come home it was fabulous the more they sawit was more and more wonderful the kids whooped through the castle with joy and wonder and nikos thought hed been right to bring them here hed been right to include christa the terrors of this morning had faded to nothing for nicky he was a kid in a fairy tale castle he had an adoring little sister at his heels he had his dog he had his mother he had his father all was right in his little boys world and nikos watched and listened to his excitement and found a peace settling on his heart that had been missing for ten years for ten years thena had been gone he had his family herehis daughter his mother his aunts and uncles and cousins hed built his fishing fleet hed succeeded on his own terms hed almost thought he had enough he hadnt now standing by thenas side as the kids led them on a tour of exploration he knew his life had suddenly got better how to make it complete ten years ago thena had thought her career was more important than life on this island he had one more chance to make her see he thought to make her understand how wonderful it could be to see how right it was the castle was three storeys high with the eagles nest a tower with parapets as the fourth floor the kids were whooping from room to room on the second floor choosing bedrooms this ones ace nicky breathed as he discovered a vast bedchamber with a huge four poster bed amid a décor that was pure medieval right down to a set of armour on either side of the windows nicky leaped onto the big bed oscar and christa gamely followed nicky tugged the gold tassels holding back the curtains and they were enclosed in a vast velvet tent the adults were left firmly on the outside oscar shoved his nose out to look at his mistress checked she was still there and then dived back to join the kids can we sleep in here please mama nicky breathed from behind the velvet can we can we can we i guess we can she said dubiously its a pretty big bed well both fit nickys head emerged astonished i didnt mean you mama i meant me and christa and oscar so take that mama nikos said at her side and found himself smiling for him too the fears of the morning were dissipating he should have brought them straight here he thought but thenshed had to go to the palace shed had to turn into a princess so she could lay claim to this place ill sleep next door she said sounding desperate and both kids launched themselves out from behind their canopy and onto further exploration dont choose before youve looked at them all nicky ordered grabbing his mothers hand and tugging her from the room there might be another one as good as this one there wasnt not on this floor nicky checked them all and declared them ordinarybedrooms with french windows and terraces that overlooked the sea with beds big enough to fit a king and half his courtiers all were rejected as being not as cool as the one nicky and christa had claimed i guess we could share nicky said with magnanimity nicky ill take the one next to yours theres upstairs nikos said and nicky beamed see mama theres upstairs i like this place come on christa they were flying upstairs hand in hand christa had a brother nikos thought stunned and glanced at thena and saw she was as stunned as he was i thought this might take years he said i didnti cant though maybe theyre like us he said we met when we were eight years old and we knew right then that we were going to be best friends friends for ever dont we were thene he said softly we still could be surely your career can be redirected i dont mean give it up entirely but youve given so much for it already dont she said again and she was close to tears he wouldnt push he mustnt he had her here he had time and then there was a whoop of absolute joy from above their heads weve found your bedroom come on up mama papa come on up mama papanicky had shouted the words as naturally as breathing mama papa it took their breath away shall we go take a look nikos said and put his hand out to her she took a deep breath she stared down at his hand and then deliberately she put her hands behind her back and walked up the stairs there was still so much between them how did you learn to trust again no matter how desperately you wanted tohow did you take that leap but then she reached the top of the stairs and the door to the third floor bedroom and she stopped thinking of anything else the third storey was part of the tower narrowing to the nest itself on the fourth floor the top of the tower was a circular fortification on top of the building where one looked over the parapets to see the entire island or that was what shed imagined shed just never imagined what lay beneath all her childhood shed seen this part of the castlea stark white tower seemingly growing from the crags of the northern highlands the tower could be seen from all over the island from out at sea maybe even from the far islands of sappheiros and khryseis it was almost dusk the islands all white stone cliffs and bluegreen mountains glittered like jewels reflecting the tangerine rays of the setting sun the sea stretched out in every direction reflecting the sunset below them were fishing boats heading for harbour heading for home she could see everything because apart from the tiny vestibule allowing access there was nothing between them and a three hundred and sixty degree view of sea and sky she was on top of the world there were no lights she saw instead there were candles hundreds of candles set into wall embrasures but they werent lit yetthey didnt need to be the setting sun gave a tangerine glow to the whole world beneath her feet the carpet was lush and deep but apart from the view the focus of the room was the bed how had they ever got it up here it must have been built on site it was a full circle a great island in the centre of the room as big as two kingsized beds it was made up with vast antique quilts of deep crimson and lovely faded silver the silver and the crimson were caught up in cushions hundreds of cushions soft squishy nicky had already picked up an armload and was tossing them indiscriminately at christa and at oscar christa was giggling and tentatively tossing a cushion back but then nicky realised nikos and athena were at the door staring in with stunned amazement look at the sky he demanded and grabbed christas hand and they clambered onto the great bed lay on their backs and gazed upward thena gazed up as well and gasped the ceiling was a vast glass dome sweeping upward as part of the great central tower it was one enormous window built of hundreds and hundreds of lead framed glass panels forming one magnificent window to the sky the setting sun was glittering in from the windows so athenas attention had been distracted to the lower level but nowshe gazed up in awe at a vast expanse of sky the soft scudding clouds of sunset and the first hint of the evening star this is so cool nicky breathed it hasnt got a tent like our bedroom but its cool anyway its like flying she could see the simile in this room she was on top of the world she was almost floating will you and papa sleep in here nicky demanded and she came down to earth fast ino ill sleep next to your bedroom its okay mama nicky said magnanimously christa and oscar and i dont mind if you sleep up here i wont be scared if i have christa and you wont be scared if you have papa papa the word was part of his vocabulary already that was enough to choke her right up to make her world twist from its axis nicky had a papa she glanced at nikos and his eyes were hooded and enigmatic but she knew this man she knew this expression it meant he was struggling hard not to show emotion he wanted his son he was falling in love with her nicky her son had a father her son was telling her she had to sleep with nikos nikos and i dont share a bedroom she said too curtly why not both the children were gazing at them now theyd found this room for them for a moment athena thought theyd taken it personally if she didnt accept their find as a delight thena can sleep in here nikos said and his voice was as guarded as his expression she probably snores grown ups snore a lot if you guys dont mind ill sleep down in one of the downstairs bedrooms so her snores dont drive me crazy i dont think she snores nicky said doubtfully she has the look of a snorer hey she was torn between laughter and tears laughter was by far the preferred option but tears were certainly close what do snorers look like nicky asked they have fat noses nikos said and looked up to the windows and stroked his own nose as opposed to you and me nicky we have the andreadis nose thin straight and exceedingly handsome i do not have a fat nose athena exclaimed snub id say nikos said indulgently cute but definitely not aristocratic the conversation had suddenly veered away from snoringaway from bedroomswhich was definitely a relief i have your nose nicky was supremely unaware of the emotional undercurrents running between the adults he was concentrating on himself and on nikos and on this new relationship which hed hardly had a chance to explore and i have your cowlick and i dont get seasick so youre a true andreadis but im nicholas christou christous your mothers name nikos said if id married your mother youd be an andreadis i like being a christou i expect you do nikos said easily but athenas mind had taken off again christachristou she was athena christou something occurred to her which hadnt had time to surface until now but it hit her then how had marika felt about her daughter being named so closely after nikoss exgirlfriend maybe neither of them had ever thought of it maybe marika had never seen her as a threat it was so long ago why did it still have the capacity to sting now so what do we do now nicky said moving on supper and bed nikos suggested and nickys face fell so did christas shed been gamely following the conversation and she got this play she said very firmly and oscar wagged his tail in agreement athena almost groaned she was so tired she could hardly stand the emotional strain of the last twentyfour hours was added to sheer physical fatigue but of course nicky had slept this afternoon and he hadnt spent last night dancing he was raring to go tell you what nikos said and he glanced at athena with that careful assessing look she was starting to know and to fear the look that said he knew what she was thinking how about we have a light supper and then i take christa and nicky down to the beach for a swim before bed is it safe she demanded before she could stop herself and then could have kicked herself for nickys face registered alarm and he moved fast to stand beside her and nikos got that too you neednt worry he said gently but firmly nicky what happened this morning will not happen again we have lookouts now watching the islands waters and under this castle down a secret little path known only to us theres a tiny cove rimmed by reefs the water inside the reef is calm and clear and is only just deep enough for swimming its full to the brim with fishno ones ever been allowed to swim here and the fish show no fear no boat can get over the reef to reach here do you trust me enough to take you there without your mother and it wasnt up to her it was nicky himself who decided yes he said firmly and surely and he moved confidently away from her side we trust papa dont we mama iyes she faltered and was saved from having to say anything more by the whoop of delight as nicky took her yes to mean not only that she trusted in nikos but also that it was okay to swim after dinner without her it seemed nicky was now a part of nikoss family whether she belonged or not the kids went whooping out of the bedroom up the last remaining flight of stairs to the parapets that capped the tower nikos stayed back there werent words to express what either of them were feeling or maybe neither of them knew what they were feeling there were things to be said but neither of them knew where to start finally he stood aside to allow her to precede him from the room hes safe with me thene he said softly as she passed him and she thought yes i know he is her son was part of nikoss family and sheshe was jealous chapter ten they had supper informally in the ancient kitchen at the back of the castle it was big enough to feed a small army athena thought but it was stillgood the ancient flagstones the vast old range sending its gentle heat across the room the scrubbed copper pans hanging from hooks lavender hanging in bunches from the beams windows open to let the sounds of the sea drift in bird feeders hung in the windows this castle doesnt look as if its been deserted for years she said puzzled and mrs lavros nodded it hasnt though giorgos didnt come here weve loved it as weve loved the palace we always knew youd come home and now you have nikos said gently and raised his glass to hers heres to you our princess athena long may she reign over us im noti cant she caught her breath in panic what was he saying well be going back to the states not yet mama nicky said and he soundedscared as well he might thena thought frantically her little boy was frightened of leaving this island now the only safe place for him wasby nikoss side she glanced up and found nikoss gaze on her thoughtful maybe even stern you cant leave thena what was she supposed to say to that she couldnt think of a thing imim tired she managed ifif you dont mind thank you mrs lavros that was lovely but im really tired nicky when you come back from the swim come and tell me about it youll be asleep nikos said teasing i wont be asleep until ive made sure nicky is safe she said and suddenly she inexplicably felt like weeping it was so hard it was so so hard long may she reign over us that sounded awfully lonely from where she was sitting she didnt sleep lying on the huge bed looking up at the vast expanse of sky it was as if shed forgotten who she really was she was nothing insignificant and lost if she was confused before she was even more confused now that was bad enoughbut how could she sleep when nikoswhen the children were playing on the beach right underneath her windows she got up and walked over to the window floodlights set up on the cliff face meant the sheltered little cove was as safe as in daytime there were lights out on the water as well tiny buoys floating on the swell the bigger surf was caught and contained by the circular reef so the waves within were gentle the lightbuoys floating up and down in synchronisation with the gentle waves christa had a rubber surf mat she was holding on tight floating in the shallows giggling watching her papa teach nicky to surf nikos had produced his surfboard and was already teaching nicky to catch the waves when it comes you need to be paddling almost as fast as the wave nikos was saying and a trick of sound made his voice carry all the way up to where she stood okay here comes a good one paddle paddle go the wave caught him and nicky hung on for dear life as the wave carried him all the way to the sand he stood up exultant in the shallows big with excitement i caught it i caught it well have you kneeling on the board by tomorrow nikos said and standing by the end of the week but shed heard enough she turned away and walked back to the too big bed lay down and stared up at herself multiplied by plenty nicky needs his papa she told jupiteror was it venus he should stay here you need his papa right she was talking to a planet it was probably a star she told herself surely it was okay to discuss the meaning of life with a star to stay id have to trust him she toldwhat the heck venus i think i do trust him but sheor venuswas lying she might not trust himbut she loved him that was the only truth shed given her heart away when she was eight years old and shed never taken it back but that one dreadful betrayalit didnt mean she loved him less it was as if there was some part of her that had got it wrong shed trusted him so absolutely that his betrayal had destroyed a part of herself she hugged herself and venus tucked herself behind a cloud in sympathy there were still a thousand stars all wanting to talk to her she was never going to sleep in this room where then on the same floor as nikos and the children theyre together im on my own she whispered and then thought ooh whos feeling sorry for herself there was a shout of laughter from down in the cove she climbed out of bedit was almost a marathon to get to the sideand walked back out on the balcony they were playing falafel it was a game she and nikos had played as kids when annia made falafels she formed her little balls of chickpeas and parsley into balls and then rolled them in flour until they were thoroughly coated so athena and nikos would swim until they were wrinkly as prunes then race up the beach and roll and roll in the dry sand until every inch of them was coated then run round being falafels they were doing it nowtwo kids and nikos two kids and their papa completely coated in dry sand they stoodthen nikos spread his arms and moaned like a great sandy spectre and started chasing them the children squealed in delight the beach at duskshed always thought it was the most magical of times and here was her son learning about it for himself with his papa nicky ran and ran christa was far easier to catch but nikos made it seem as if it was just as hard to catch her finally he had them a child under each arm and was staggering back to the water to wash them off oscar brought up the rear barking his delight and suddenly she was crying damn she was crying nikos looked up from the beach and saw her he stilled at his feet the children whooped and splashed in the shallows but nikos simply stoodand watched and from nowhere into her heart came the words hed used so often dare you dare she take a chance dare she forget what had happened ten years ago dare she move forward it was too soon it was too fast she had to get rid of these stupid wussy tears she turned and started to go inside thena it was a call from the beach strong and demanding she should ignore it she should she turned he was still watching her dare you he called and she gave a gasp of fright what was it about this man how did he know what was inside her head did he know that she loved him she turned and headed back to her bed and her stars and her confusion if she talked to a thousand stars she might just get some answers or not shed left him for a career shed had a career shed succeeded on her terms surely enough was enough surely he could convince her to stay he stood in the shallows and watched her back away from the balcony head indoors and haul the french windows closed after her hed swear she was crying does your mama cry much he asked nicky conversationally as if this was a guy to guy discussion of the female sex only when she thinks im asleep nicky told him so she cries at night im not supposed to know nicky said but sometimes when i snuggle into bed with her in the morning her pillows soggy why do you think she gets sad at night i used to think it was cos she was lonely nicky said but shes got me and shes got oscar only now i know about here he stood and gazed around him a small boy taking in a small boys heaven now i think it must be cos she was lonely for you forfor this island you mean mama says things and places dont matter nicky said she says only people matter so i figure its you he brought the children up from the cove mrs lavros helped bath them and get them to bed athena didnt appear nikos half expected nicky to want his mother but they discussed it and decided if she hadnt wanted to swim she must be very tired indeed so nicky himself decided if he was sleeping with christa and with oscar there was no need to disturb her so nikos sat beside their tentcumbed and started to read them a storyonly nicky objected i have a book in my bag he told nikos its really good mama lets me read to her can i read it to you is that okay sure nikos said so he sat and watched as his son read his daughter a bedtime story and it was hard not to tear up himself it was thena who wept he told himself real men dont weep what was the concept of a real man his father had been a real man hed died of a heart attack when nikos was twelve and nikos had adored him his father had loved nikos and had been totally unconditionally proud of him even though hed been dead for many years that love lingered on as did the echoes of his care anything happens to me you care for your mother nikos shes the light of my life you and your motheryoure my whole heart a real man had a family and loved them unashamedly a real man would face any terror to keep that family safe his parents had had disagreementsloud disagreementsbut theyd never frightened him because theyd always ended in exasperated laughter in hugs in his father saying your mother is impossiblean impossible womanhow am i to live with such a womanand then cooking his biggest lobster and opening a bottle of wine and playing music his mother didnt like too loud and his parents dancing and him watching in sleepy contentment until they put him to bed and had the night for each other soso what what was between him and thenait was a disagreement so enormous that no lobster would be big enough but to let that betrayal eat away at them for ever maybe his father would say so what if thena left you ten years ago so what if she didnt tell you she had your son you know your actions must have distressed her unutterably too he couldnt defend his actions was it fair therefore to ask her to defend hers what if he could simply say that was past history move on move onto family to two children a dog to a wife ten years ago hed asked her to marry him and shed wept with joy but things had changed she no longer trusted him if he was to ask her to marry him nowshed assume it was because of the crown that he wanted control and maybe he did if he married her he could keep her safe it would stop demos in his tracks hed be royal himself how could he ask her to marry him christa was already fast asleep nicky read on but his voice was starting to stumble he lifted the book from nickys hands tucked him under the covers and then thought why not and he kissed his son goodnight such a little thingbut not small at all huge how could he ask thena to marry him dare you he left the bedroom and closed the door gently behind him he turned and thena was watching him from the shadows he stilled hi he said cautiously hi yourself i thought you were asleep she was ready for bed she was in a pale blue wrap floorlength bare toes though her curls were a tanglehad she been trying to sleep how can i sleep when i keep thinking of you she murmured thatd give anyone nightmares she tried to smile but her smile didnt reach her eyes nikos come up to the tower he said and put his hand out to take hers she looked down at his handappeared to think about itand then placed her hand in his a tiny stepwhy it made his heard thud it did his heart definitely thudded whoa he was in trouble here dare you he led her up the stairs on the landing that led to her bedroom he swiftly led her past it was a bit too soon to face that room the stairs grew narrower the higher they climbed the tower was just that an eyrie built for a birdseye view of the whole island the tower narrowed the higher they climbed so he was forced to fall behind hed read somewherewhere was itthat gentlemen always followed their ladies upstairs and preceded them down so they could catch them either way their hands were still loosely linkedshe didnt seem to want to pull away and hed have rather diedbut what he really wanted to do was pick her up and carry her she was climbing before him in her lovely soft robe her bare feet on the cold stonesif he carried her then her feet wouldnt get cold but he was aware he was holding his breath there were so many questions that needed answers and he thought many of those questions were to be resolved in the next few moments he mustnt push too fast picking her up and carrying her might panic her and that was the last thing he intended and then they were at the topa circular walk built as battlements around the central dome he didnt want to think about the dome the ceiling to thenas bedroom thenas all around them stretched the warm mediterranean night a great moon hung low on the eastern sky climbing ponderously upward to join the starfilled heavens the great galaxy of the milky way spread above them stars beyond and beyond and beyond we used to try and count them nikos said softly and her hand tightened in his it used to scare memade me feel so small and do you feel so small now smaller she whispered she was leaning back against him as she gazed out in wonder to the west was sappheiros the largest of the diamond isles north was khryseis the lights from the far isles glittered through the night mysterious and beckoning closer to home they could see the lights of boats riding at anchor the tiny lights from cottages spread among the mountains and in the distance the faroff lights of the royal palace her royal home this is yours thena he whispered softly into her hair its yours to rule as you will we always dreamed it would come to you and now it has you cant walk away from it now its your birthright your heritage my duty she whispered back and he thought he heard the first faint trace of acceptance nikos i cant do this alone you wont have to princess ill be beside you every step of the way if you can put your career on holdi know its so important to you my career is not important for a moment he thought he hadnt heard right she was leaning into him her spine curving against his chest her dark curls just brushing his chin she was the loveliest creature his thena but he had to think past her body he had to think past what her touch was doing to him you meanyour career isnt important any more he asked cautiously it never was and then reluctantly it seemed she pulled away from his grasp she turned and leaned on the parapet as if she needed to see him to make him understand what she wanted to say dont get me wrong i always wanted to be a writer she said and he knew she was struggling against the emotion of the moment to make her voice prosaic i always did and maybe i always will when i was twelve i wanted to be a cutting edge crime reporter then i wanted to be a poet by the time my mother died i wanted to write a history of this island an exposé of giorgoss corruption i wanted to use my writing to save the world but then but then you were offered a cadetship on a fashion magazine in new york no she said tightly now as if it was desperately important i was given the cadetship it was paid for i was told it had been arranged that i start work in manhattan in two weeks i was told my accommodation was paid for i was given a one way airline ticket and enough money to keep me for a year and i was told to get off the island and never come back he stared at her disbelieving all the breath seemed to have been sucked from his body by but he didnt need to ask by giorgos of course she said but you didnt have to take it you think you could have refused she shook her head she closed her eyes as if remembering a nightmare and opening her eyes on it would start the horror all over again you were just starting to succeed she whispered since your papa died youd worked so hard to make your boat support you and your mother and you were starting to make it prosper thats what giorgos was afraid of you were the son of his sistera royal from his own line you were starting to make serious money and youd just asked me to marry you if i married the kings sisters child thered be royalty on both sides two people the locals knew and trusted giorgos feared the islanders would rebel he said i had to follow his orders or hed dynamite every boat in the harbour and he didnt care much if anyone was on them and hed run you and your mother off the island he said the only way i could prevent that happening was by leaving soso i left thena he moved towards her but her hands were out as if to fend him off no theres no use being angry theres no use being anything if youd told me you would havedone something stupid she whispered my hero my nikos i knewor i thought i knewthat your fury on my behalf would know no bounds i was afraid of him i was afraid for you and i was afraid for your mother so i left ii hoped youd follow that was dumb obviously there werethings that prevented you leaving so i started work in new york a couple of months later i realised i was pregnant i was lucky enough to find a wonderful landlady i worked right up until nicky was born and when he was two months old i went back ive worked ever since so she took a deep breath so yes im proud of my career im proud i supported myself and nicky ive even enjoyed a lot of it but dont say i sacrificed everything for my career dont say it nikos because its just not true and tonighttonight i want the past to be over i want to put history behind us i want to move on thena it was a groan of pain he didnt know where to go from here he couldnt think what shed gone through and shed acted out of love for him for everyone dont she said and took his head in both her hands and tugged him forward whats done is done i cant bear to think of ten years ago i dont want to think of it and why should i all i know is that youve come back into my life again am i misreading the signs nikos as i misread so badly before is it you in there the nikos i thought i knew the nikos who dared to love me who dared who dared she whispered when all the rest of the island avoided me for fear of giorgos you dared to be my friend and then you dared to love me i dont know what happened after that i dont want to know all i know is that im home now exactly where i want to be and im with the man i want more than anything in the world she hesitated and im trying really hard not to be forward here but if you dont kiss me ill very likely explode or die of humiliation or or hed never know because enough was enough he had her in his arms and he was tugging her close with ruthless strength she was yielding her lips were meeting his her hands were tugging him close closer deepening the kiss so the night disappeared melting into the starfilled sky transforming with a wonder he thought hed lost and was now magically his again thena his thena trusting as shed trusted once before weighing up the sorrow the hurt he knew hed caused her with the birth of christa with his marriage to marika and moving on forgivingeven when she didnt know the truth he loved her so much he pulled back a little so he could read her face and what he saw there made his heart twist within him she was looking at him as if she loved him she loved him she must love him that one betrayal had been an aberrationnot her nikos the nikos shed known then could never have done such a thing and even if he had the nikos kissing her now could surely never repeat such a betrayal but right here right now she no longer cared nikos was right here right now his eyes dark and fathomless waiting for her to say what she needed to sayif she could ever figure out what that was okay say it she told herself just say it soso this is the most romantic place in the eagles nest she managed its not he said fast and sure its a place of stone and parapet and viewwhich is all very well if you want stone and parapet and view but if you want more if i want more his dark eyes flashed with something she wasnt sure of surprise laughter no something much much deeper id surely give it he said softly but ive hurt you so badly in the past you have years ago shed fallen in love with this man hed betrayed that love in the worst possible way but shed moved on shed grown up and shed got herself a life shed become independent of both nikos and his island but nowshe wanted to trust as shed trusted so long ago innocence regained stupid concept but you think we could maybe learn to trust each other nikos asked and it was as if he was following her thoughts after so long you bore my son he said steadily you had him alone and i cant begin to imagine how that must have been for you i cant bear to think that you couldnt contact methat you couldnt tell me of his existence but nowim finding there are more things i cant bear like the thought of you leaving once you dreamed of writing freelance is there any way you could do that here soso youll have more time with nicky he placed his hands on her shoulders and he looked at her as if he could read behind her eyes i do want my son he said softly but surely as if it was a vow nicky is my son and from now on i intend to be a father to him in any way i can i want himbut i want you too thena if id knownif id guessed it doesnt matter it did but not tonight tonight was hers tonight was her dream time history had never happened and she was surrendering herself to the here and now as was nikos i believe ten years ago is best forgotten he whispered tugging her close folding her against him and wrapping her in his arms for tonight at least and then he kissed her long and hard as shed ached to be kissed for ten long years as she longed to be kissed for ever ten years dissipated just like that he was her nikos hers and she was his with every fibre of her being when the kiss ended they both knew it was immutable truth will you come to my bed my love he asked in a voice that sounded shaken and then the loved laughter returned oryour bed arent there enough stars out here not for the serious gazer he told her and the wicked laughter was back gloriously back counting stars beats counting sheep that is if we cant think of anything else to do she had to be serious here laughter would not do last time we did what i understand youre suggesting i believe we made nicky she said in a voice that was none too steady so were older and wiserand a bit more prepared youre prepared i believe i am he was tugging her close again kissing her eyelids each in turn so am i she whispered the kissing stopped she was held at arms length again nikoss face showed blank astonishment did i just hear what i thought i heard i might be forgetting most of the last ten years she said beginning to laugh but there are a couple of things i need to remember like the lecture given to me by my doctor after nickys birth if you think id come within a hundred miles of you again without contraception youre not the man i think you are nikos andreadis my thena and the laughter was back the wonderful laughter that had blazed between them since the hour theyd first met dont you dare laugh she said but she couldnt help herself she was laughing as well at his laughter at his joy at the assurance of joy to come at the knowledge that for this night this man was hers he always had been she thought from the time shed met him to now shed borne his son shed carried him in her heart for ever im not laughing he told her and it was true the laughter had changed he was watching her now with eyes as dark as night with an expression on his face shed never seen beforeof tenderness of joy and of something more of hope for the future that was what it was she thought as she melted into him as he lifted her into his arms and carried her unprotesting down the winding staircase to a vast bedchamber with windows looking out in every direction to the sea beneath and to the islands beyond as he laid her tenderly on the beda bed big enough for a king or six piled high with feather pillows so soft she almost disappeared into them as he pulled the curtains one after another cutting out the view the islands the sea the outside world everything but the sky as he lit the candles one by one and as he came to her where she lay waiting for the man of her dreams he unfastened his shirt and she watched him awed fascinated so deeply in love she thought she could die right now and be happy she matched him button for button unfastening her robe his dark eyes flared with passion his shirt was gone long before she had her robe undonewhy werent her fingers workingbut it didnt matter for he was helping her and finally she was free his hands slipped in beneath her nightgown to cup her breasts and she wanted to cry out with sheer happiness sheer joy she was pushing her nightgown down desperate to be closer he helped her kissing as he went touching tasting loving until her body was flames nikos her first and last love nikos she was naked gloriously wonderfully naked and so was he he was sinking into the pillows beside her gathering her into his arms his body was against her body skin against skinthe most erotic sensation in the world the heartbreak of years faded to nothing the children the island responsibilitieseverything was gone there was only this man this love and this night there was only nikos she woke and the world shed lived in for ten long years had disappeared this was a fantasya fairy tale at some time in the future it would end but for now she was selfish enough needy enough to say thank you very much this is where i belong maybe when reality hits ill have a long time to remember this so i need to soak up every precious moment she was lying in the arms of the man she loved with all her heart and whether she believed it or notand yes her head was screaming at her to be warythe feeling seemed to be reciprocated nikos was loving her as hed loved her ten years ago but this was a grown man now a businessman a prince of the people a lover a man with strength and gentleness laughter and tenderness wonder and hope he was hers and she was his for now they were two lovers exulting in each others bodies drowning in each others eyes and the place where they were loving was overthetop fantastic im hoping this glass is one way nikos murmured in the aftermath of loving otherwise we could have some very shocked seagulls you think we should declare this place a fly free zone and enforce it how i cant he said morosely i believe its you whos in charge of royal decrees she giggled but thenher giggle was echoed from outside the door two giggles uhoh nikos said athena dived under the covers and nikos had his pants on and was fastening his shirt before three small faces appeared around the door two kids and a dog oscar took one look and leaped with joyous abandon onto the bed and nicky and christa landed straight after athena was overwhelmed by dog and kids nicky hugged her christa hugged her too on the basis of what was good for nicky was okay by her and oscar licked every face in reach her family she was buried in family she hugged and sniffed and she glanced up and saw her emotions reflected on nikoss face no not her family their family did you both sleep in here nicky demanded awed im happy to tell you your mother didnt snorevery much nikos said magnanimously i slept on this side of the bed she slept on the other and if i piled the pillows really high it was just a muted little snortle ooh athena said and emerged from kids and dog long enough to toss a pillow at him her aim wasnt bad considering the handicap she was underclutching bedclothes so the kids wouldnt discover she was naked but nikos hadnt defended himself and he was thumped right in the chest yay nicky said and took his lead from his mother and in seconds pillows were going everywhere her family their family betrayal was a thing of the past she thought mistily giggling and tossing the odd pillow herself now was just fornow they had three days and three nights of magic athena asked no questions she was simply living in the moment nikos watched her as the days wore on and thought she was holding the kids to her holding him to her as if she feared they could be snatched away at any moment somewhere outside the castle demos was still plotting nikos was sure of it but alexandros was working on his behalf nikoss job was to keep his little family here keep them safe until the threat could be defused it was no hardship at all it was pure magic he had his kids he had thena as far as he was concerned alexandros could take as long as he needed to defuse the threat this time out was theirs only of course reality finally had to intrude nikos had organised the lawyers to come on the third day we need to get things settled before we go back to the palace he told her umarent things settled the affairs of the island arent he said kissing her on the nose so tomorrow its lawyers then he hesitated thene its going to be a long boring day my mother is asking if she could take nicky and christa theyll be safedemos can gain nothing by hurting one of you alone and ill send joe with them to make sure do you think nicky would like to go well ask him she said and did and nicky thought the idea of a grandmother was too cool for words when annia came to fetch them in an ancient land rover with no roof he decided she was even cooler they piled into the back seat only to discover one of annias hens had decided this was a great nesting box so off they went with a handful of eggs each with oscar squished in the middle and with two grins a mile wide for athena and nikos the day promised to be far less exciting than the kids they needed to announce a coronation date but firstthere were so many papers to read and to sign that her head spun the contracts and deeds ensuring legal ascension were mindblowing but between the legal stuff it was great that the kids were happy she thought she had visions of her son and christa at annias kitchen table where shed spent the happiest part of her childhood they were safe and nikos was right here reading through the contracts with her trying to make it less boring her family was where it ought to be she could cope with a boring day or two and after she signedannia had offered to keep the children until dinner time that meant athena had a whole evening with nikos and no kids she was already thinking of the little cove under the castle shed have a secluded beach with only herself and nikos she glanced up from the document she was signing and saw nikos watching herand she blushed he grinned she blushed some more she was signing the last contract the lawyers were starting to pack up documents beaming congratulating and then nikoss phone rang he listened and his face lost colour she was at his side in an instant whatwhat mamas just rung he said the kidsdemos has the kids he had her hand he was running tugging her behind him down the castle steps to the limousine parked in front the lawyers were abandoned shocked to silence she drove while nikos barked orders into his phone then he told her what had happened mama used the time while she had the kids to cook dinner for a neighbour whos ill the kids were playingthey were happy and she thought itd only take five minutes to pop the food next door the children were in the garden and joe was in the house hed taken his eyes off the children only for a moment the first he knew of trouble was a scream from the cove below the house by the time he got down there they were gone gone is he sure its demos athena asked in a voice she scarcely recognised as hers he saw him he said his voice catching he had both the children in the boatthe same boat that tried to hit you ive just rung alexandros on sappheiros he has a helicopter i thought this was safe i never dreamed his voice broke she wanted to hold him she had to keep driving but it took every ounce of selfrestraint not to pull over take him in her arms and comfort him he was her man she knew it whatever had happened in the past nikos was her man and shed fight for him as shed fight for her child her children she corrected herself her family chapter eleven annia was standing in her kitchen whitefaced and tearful they walked in she stepped straight into nikoss arms and sobbed out her horror on his chest then she tugged back from nikos and hugged athena and then joe came lumbering in looking like a dog whod been kicked before thena knew it joe was a part of the hug family despite her terror here was a glimmer of comfort she let herself be hugged she let herself be wept on and if she wept too it didnt matter the hugs were fast there were too many imperatives to indulge in emotion but it steadied her for this moment shed take comfort where she could find it there were more men entering the kitchen now summoned by joebig men determined gravefaced not knowing what to do she held nikos and nikos held her who was holding who up it didnt matter they were facing this as one but there was nothing to do the consensus was that all their hope had to be in alexandros and his helicopter it was the only thing fast enough to locate a boat so powerful she was trying so hard to think how to think when you were enmeshed in panic she must whatwhat would demos do with them she managed speaking to the room in general and the unsayable had been said annia gave one heartrending sob and ended up held again by nikos but athena wasnt thinking like that she met nikoss gaze over his mothers head she saw his terror and inexplicably it steadied her she knew her cousin he was a weakwilled man greedy for riches desperate even but he wasnt completely stupid he wouldnt hurt them she said and the words themselves steadied her for she knew they were the truth not deliberately yes he tried to kill nicky and me but that was aimed at the two of us staged to be an accident think of all hed lose by hurting them now hes been seen he knows that if hes known to have hurt them he could never claim this crown plus this world doesnt hold a hiding place deep and dark enough if he touches my nicky she shook her head still puzzled and i dont understand how he got them both onto his boat was there only him yes joe said he had them in the boat by the time i saw them if hed grabbed christa nicky might have decided to stay with her nikos said doubtfully following her train of thought was it nicky who screamed it surely was joe said i heard him screaming from here and by the time i reached the beach i could still hear him if demos came up here and grabbed themwhy didnt he scream here youd surely have heard if he had joe had no answers it made less and less sense she knew her nicky for demos to creep in here and grab them without alerting youand to get him into the boatwas he holding him why didnt he jump out i dont know maybe demos tied him up i couldnt see hell be trying to blackmail you into giving up the throne nikos said he must be but shed steadied shed heard enough now to be less panicked and if he is then hell contact us she forced herself to say what they all knew they had to do we have to wait but nikoss face was still strained to breaking christa has a heart condition he said numbly to the room in general and she felt his wash of absolute fear her normally daredevil lover was jelly in the face of a threat to his daughter shes on medication she has to have it if we dont find her he cant have her annia said fiercely hed never love her oh its okay mama nikos said hauling himself together again in the face of his mothers terror demos doesnt want her and like thena said he cant afford to hurt them well find her oscar was at thenas feet she knelt and hugged him while nikos held his mother why didnt you bite him oscar she whispered there was no answer her terror had faded a little this had to be an attempt at blackmail she thought butin her confused mind she found room for more questions what had annia said he cant have her hed never love her why would demos want christa there were undercurrents here she didnt understand she straightened and nikoss arm came round her waist and held he was more afraid than she was she thought how serious was christas heart condition now wasnt the time to ask now it seemed all they could do was wait and to wait seemed the hardest thing in the world ill makeill make coffee annia said but subsided into her handkerchief instead and then nikoss phone rang he flipped it open and listened he had the absolute attention of everyone in the room even oscar was looking up though that probably had more to do with the time and the absence of dinner but oscars dinner was doomed to wait nikos flipped the phone closed again frowning alexandros himself is flying the chopper nikos told them speaking slowly thinking it through as he spoke that was alex now demos and the children are indeed in the boat and they seem fine but according to alexandros theyre going nowhere their boats stopped he thinks it must have run out of petrol its floating half a mile off the northern end of the island alexandros is holding position until we can reach them he took a deep breath moving on well take my runabout its faster than the bigger boats he snapped lets go ill radio as soon as we know can you guys bring one of the bigger boats after us he grabbed athenas hand and they were gone it took fifteen long minutes to get there fifteen minutes with the runabouts motor roaring at full throttle smashing through the swells with sickening thumps if demos had restarted the engineor if theyd tipped the boat she glanced at nikos and his face was grim as death hed do whatever it took shed never doubted it not for a minute hed do whatever he must to keep these children safe to keep the islanders safe to keep her and suddenly her thoughts were lurching with the boat taking her beyond her present fear this man had betrayed her or shed thought he had butas she watched him at the tiller as she saw the bleakness behind his eyes she felt the sense of betrayal finally leave her and all that remained was the knowledge of his honour hed lost his father when he was twelve hed been on the boat with himhis father had a heart attack and by the time twelveyearold nikos had managed to get their fishing boat back to harbour his father was dead from that day on hed taken on responsibilities too heavy for a boy hed been desperate to care for everyone to make sure nothing like his fathers death happened again and marikachristas mother nikoss shortterm wife shed never been able to think of marika without the pain of betrayal overwhelming her but given these moments of enforced thought the scene theyd just left came back to her and annias words speaking of christa he cant have her annia had said fiercely hed never love her marika had been older than she was and a bitreckless shed been infatuated by demos desperate to get away from her bully of a father and away from the island her mother was one of nikoss relationsalmost familybut her father was a thug if her father had found out marika was pregnantshe shuddered to think of his reaction the germ of an ideathe germ of truth shed discovered back in annias kitchenwas suddenly turned to full blown certainty but now wasnt the time to be talking of this with nikos nikos was sick with worry she should be sick with worry toobut still things didnt quite fit she knew her son he was very very like his father dare you nicky knew who demos was hed seen his portrait hed understood the threat from the boat and now the boat was stranded according to alexandros floundering just outside the reef theyll be okay she said steadily and strongly to nikos and nikos looked back at her with despair how can you know because my son is resourceful and clever and brave she told him because my son will do whatever it takes because my son is just like his father and there they were right where alexandros directed them his helicopter was still hovering overhead as alex had told them there were three people in the boat demos christa nicky demos was leaning over the side he might be armed nikos warned her as they approached but she looked ahead at her cousin and she shook her head hes seasick he still might be dangerous you mean he might shoot me not demos she shook her head scornfully with alexandros in the helicopter watching with the entire argyros fishing fleet bearing down behind us when hes totally occupied with his stomach and she was right demos was beyond caring they ran the runabout up beside the speedboat and he barely looked up at them nikos had the two boats fastened together in seconds he steadied and then he lifted christa over thena took her and hugged her close and nicky clambered over himself and sat down in the middle and grinned at his mother and grinned at nikos he didnt look the least bit worried he looked supremely pleased with himself hooray you came i knew my plan would work he said with smug satisfaction you knew nikos said faintly other boats were approaching now the bigger fishing boats were slower than nikoss runabout but the fishermen of argyros had gunned their motors as fast as they could to be in the action there wasnt a lot of action demos was bent over the side their villain didnt look the least bit menacing the fishing boats were forming a circle even if he got the motor going there was no longer anywhere to run he was all right until the motor stopped nicky said scornfully as they all looked at demos but as soon as it stopped the boat started rolling up and down and up and down and do you mind athena said faintly not so much with the ups and downs so can you take us back to dry land she asked hugging christa and looking a plea to nikos nikos hadnt heard he was still watching demos but demos was no longer a threat to anyone he was a bundle of abject misery tell us what happened he said to nicky and the little boys eyes gleamed he was mischief personified just like his father we saw him on the beach from yia yias kitchen window he said and the islanders word for grandmama resonated with pride here then was another association nicky was proud of i knew it was him cos of the boat and cos of the picture he pulled the boat up on the beach really fast into bushes and i knew he was trying to hide then he came up the cliff path i said to christa i know how to stop his boat going again so we snuck down the cove past the craypots and joe didnt even see us going and when we got to the boat it was just like the picture in the bookonly it said sometimes the fuel tanks lockedbut it wasnt so we opened it up and put a whole lot of sand in but it was hard getting the top back on cos it got sandy and i just got it on when demos came back he saw me and tried to grab me but i ran away but then he grabbed christa so i had to go with him oh nicky athena said torn between pride and horror you shouldnt have i couldnt let him just take christa could i he said stung by implied criticism of such a great plan shes my sister he pushed her into the boat and he said hed hurt her if i didnt come too and i knew the sand was in the engine so i hopped in anyway he said you had to agree to abto abdicate he said hed hurt me if you didnt so i did get a little bit scared i thought the boat would stop really fast or not go at all but it went for ages it sounded sicker and sicker though but then it stopped and he got sick and he had a gun but while he was sick i grabbed it from his belt and threw it into the water and he tried to hit me but he started being sick again and then the helicopter came and the man up there waved and i knew youd come so it was okay wasnt it mama yes she said and she found she was laughing through tears her son her men and she looked at nikos and on his face she saw a mixture of pride and love and hopeand awe awe pure and simple and in that moment she knew what she had to do these were her men this was her family she was the crown princess of argyros it was up to her to claim them as dusk settled over the island they returned to the palace the eagles nest was a hideaway for when there was a threat but there was no longer a threat and athena knewthey all knewthat now was the time to lay claim to the throne so it could never be disputed annia and mrs lavros took the children to be bathed and fed and put to bed when athena came downstairs it seemed half the men of argyros had come to tie the threads together nikos and alexandros were seated at the head of the long table in the ancient meeting room where decisions on the rule of this island had been made for generation upon generation nikos signalled that she sit between them but she couldnt not yet there were things she had to sort in her own mind first there were words she had to find for now shed leave the speaking to nikos we found the thugs who nearly killed the princess athena and prince nicholas nikos was talking to everyone in the room but he was watching her they were gunsforhire from athens alexandros traced the boat he found them and we had the link we needed to demos but demos obviously took fright hes had an informer on the island we know now who he isa man my mother thought of as a friend a man who forfeited that friendship for pay hes already fled to greece but before he left he told demos that today the children would be with my mother the men in the room were silent shocked as was nikos thena thought he still looked gauntthe terror of this afternoon would probably stay with him for everbut he had himself in hand her prince of the people we know it all now nikos said and managed a wry smile it seems that seasickness is better than torture for getting information the men who towed demos to shore told him hed stay in his boat until he told us everything and now he has he wrote it down alexandros added gravely we handed him pen and paper and he wrote and signed a confession jails looking pretty good to demos anywhere where the grounds solid he smiled but nikos didnt return the smile the events of the day had shaken him too deeply for humour he wasnt as unprepared as he seemed nikos said heavily he had a gun nicky described it to me and he broke off his voice cracking alexandros put his hand on his friends shoulder and athena thought blindly these two men cared deeply for each other her mind steadied focused knew what had to be done enough nikos said and forced himself to go on sodemos beached the boat he went up to the cottage and found no one he returned to the boatfuriousto find the children seemingly waiting for him he hesitated and thena could see him repress a shudder maybemaybe that was the best thing that could have happened for if joe had been in the garden and annia had been at homethere could well have been a bloodbath as he seized nicky and decided to eliminate witnesses he closed his eyes alexandros took over we know now that demos has a kingsized gambling problem he added hes been gambling on the assumption hed have access to all the argyros diamond mines he was desperate enough to do anything to get his hands on that stream of wealth athena shivered she was standing by the door leaning against the wall shed said she wanted to be able to leave easily if the kids needed her but in reality she just needed to watch listen and figure what had to be said and how she was going to say it so hes in jail alexandros said and glanced across at athena if its okay by you princess athena ill take care of him on sappheiros the men were all watching her now waiting for her to speak she took a deep breath she looked at nikoss haggard face she knew what had to be said thank you for your offer alexandros she said forcing her voice to be steady forcing her words to be clear enough to be heard the length of the great room but demos will be tried here wed be thankful if youd hold him for us until we have the facilities for a full and fair trial but prince nikos and i will build this islands court system as one of our earliest priorities prince nikos alexandros said blankly prince nikos she repeated if you abdicate nikos cant he began i have no intention of abdicating maybe she should have dressed in her royal gear again she thought shed dressed neatly this morning for the lawyers in smart casual trousers and a crisp white blouse but since then shed been hammered by the sea oscar had jumped up on her when theyd docked and she was covered in sand her hair was a wild tangle from the wind shed abandoned her soaked shoes and she was still barefootand she didnt care she was crown princess athena and it was time for her to claim what was hers ten years ago nikos andreadis asked me to marry him she said and she left the relative obscurity of her alcove near the door and walked deliberately around the table to its head she stood between the two menthe two princesand she looked out over the men of power from this island her people ten years ago there were misunderstandings and threats she said i left this island because i believed harm would come to its people if i stayed nikos let me go because he thought i was intent on a career for ten years theres been misunderstanding and grief but no more this day is a watershed for this island this day i say to you allto the entire islandthat im here to stay that ten years ago nikos asked me to marry me i accepted his offer and now if hell have me id like to hold him to that contract i would like nikos and i to rule this island as man and wife prince nikos and princess athena of argyros she turned and looked at nikos who was lookingstunned nikos youre a man of honour she said i knowwe all knowthat you would never ask me to marry you if there was a hint that your offer would be taken as a desire to rule this island yourself everyone in this room knows youre an honourable man everyone in this room knows the island is your home your heart is there any man in this room who would say prince nikos shouldnt take what i see as his rightful role as ruler beside me there wasnt a sound not a sound nikos was staring at her blindly as if he couldnt believe what shed just said the silence stretched on and on and then one lone person far up the back of the long hall started to clap and then another started beside him and then another and then the whole room was clapping they were on their feet cheering shouting clapping each other on the back and nikos was simply staring at athena saying nothing the applause died athena watched the men regain their seats still nikos said nothing i believe she said softly into the silence that youll have to excuse us nikos and i have a few things to discuss there was a delighted roar of laughter nikos was looking as thrown as a man could be and their audience was loving it so can we call this meeting closed she said i think weve achieved everything we wished for oh and when the council next meetsi want this room to hold at least as many women as it does men youll be under petticoat rule now someone called to nikos and hell love it someone else called our princess isnt one for petticoats as far as i can see someone else added im thinking climbing trees and saving kids and making us proud of her is where she is thats where they both are our royal couple but athena wasnt listening she was watching nikos well she said softly how about the beach is it private enough or should we go back to our sky dome thena your call but we have to talk she said and he stared at her for a long momentand then he smiled that wonderful hearttwisting smile she loved so much he rose and he took her hand and the men of the island council rose again and cheered as one as the peoples prince led his princess from the room chapter twelve they didnt need to go far just as far as the cliff path where they could look out on the rising moon the moonbeams glittering over the ocean where there was only silence and each other what have you done nikos asked gently and athena smiled because she knew that even now hed be honourable ive claimed my own you dont need to marry me to be a princess i never did she said but i do need to marry you because i love you and i need you by my side he took a deep breath he turned to face her and he took both her hands in his thena i hurt you so you did she said and i hurt you its in the past but you explained and you cant she hesitated but it had to be said once and then never again nikos when i left the islandyou know i went hoping youd follow i knew youd be hurt but i hopedi hoped so much that i could explain my reasons for leaving but then i found i was pregnant and while i was working up the courage to phone you i was told that marika was pregnant and that youd promised to marry her and that she was further gone in her pregnancy than i was he groaned all she wanted to do was hold himkiss himbut this had to be said she had to sort this in her head get it right so i thought youd betrayed me she said softly until today so whats happened today he demanded in a voice she hardly recognised to make you change your mind and somehow she found the strength and certainty to answer when annia said he cant have her hed never love her i knew then what had happened i knew how can you know no one no one will ever know from me she whispered you know and annia knowsor maybe shes just guessing as well but when i left the island i was heartbroken and i can only imagine how you must have felt maybe given time youd have contacted me seen how things really were but along came marika sure im guessing but i know im right im guessing marika came begging for your help pregnant by demos abandoned by demos terrified that her bully of a father might well kill her if he found out she couldnt bear to watch him she couldnt bear to see the pain nikos said nothing but the bleakness in his eyes told her all shed ever want to know she was speaking the truth so im guessing you thought why not you thought id betrayed you and abandoned the island so why not help marika so you went with marika to her parents and said yes marikas pregnant but the two of you wanted to marry instead of being appalled her father would have welcomed you with open arms so you married but then a baby was born she whispered a little girl with downs syndrome a child who demos would never have cared for marika herself obviously couldnt cope and she chose to run still he said nothing his silence was frightening her but shed come this farthere was no choice but to take it to its conclusion but you she said and she knew in her heart that she spoke the absolute truth you stood with christa in your arms and you declared to all the island that she was yours with the respect you and your mother are held on this island affection for christa is guaranteed she has annia as a grandmama she has you as her papa shes safe and at last he broke his silence youre just guessing he said explosively so tell me im wrong look at me straight nikos and tell me im wrong he didnt he couldnt the pain that had wrapped itself around her heart ten long years ago dissolved and faded to nothing hed dowhatever it took her prince her nikos ill never ask you to confirm it she said softly seeing raw pain but i know im right she forced a rueful smile christa is your daughter she stays your daughter no matter what else happens my only regret is that ive been so stupid a bit of terror and fifteen minutes in an open boat and ive guessed it all oh nikos i love what you did i love what you are she hesitated then but shed come so farwhy not go on soi know its not the woman whos supposed to say these things she whispered but your honour wont let you so here it is nikos im saying right here right now that i love you with all my heart that if you demand it of me then ill rule this island alone but only if you refuse what im asking because it seems to me that weve had ten years alone and why wait one minute longer you asked me to marry you ten years ago and i accepted only then giorgos destroyed it so today ive accepted again in front of the full island council and i accept again now his hands were tight on hers his face was expressionless again but she knew what that meant it meant he was hiding what he felt she knew this man as she knew herself i love you nikos she whispered ive loved you since i was eight years old and i love you still if you want me to be your wife it would be an honour and it would be my joy to accept if i want you he whispered so she said and tilted her chin and even managed a smile so nikos andreadis prince of my heart dare you dare to marry you ill make a very demanding wife she whispered venturing a smile plus i have it on the best authority that i snortle i love your snortle i dont snortle i believe you just said nikos i like to get my facts right he said mischief emerging the wicked grin that had her heart doing handsprings causing its normal damage againand more i need to let myself know what im getting into he said one wife only one she said no henry the eighth absurdity for this royal couple agreed he said promptly one son and one daughter she said serenely andand maybe even more and his answering smile was enough to make her heart turn over i guess youll expect me to adopt oscar as well he said struggling for a martyred tone of course i will so so she whispered and held her breath so he said and dropped to his knee before her she gasped nikos so lets get this right he said softly as my princess to whom i owe fidelity and all honour youve asked me to marry you yes she said suddenly doubtful but it doesnt mean you must no but there are connotations of duty to my crown princess he said and id hate you to think id just said yes to stop myself being thrown in a dungeon do we have dungeons well find out together he whispered meanwhile princess athena christou of argyros would you let me get a word in edgeways yes she saidand did will you do me the great honour of becoming my wife of course i will she said and tugged him up to stand before her if you really want me how can you ask ill never ask again she whispered ill never need to ask again oh nikos my one and only love my thena he whispered into her hair my princess and my life and then he put her away from him he held her at arms length and his face broke into a smile shed never seen before it was a look of exultation triumph and pride my thena it was a shout of pure joy and it echoed down into the cove below back into the palace behind them out onto the sea breezes blowing over the whole island he swung her round and round and round and then he set her down before him and he kissed her long and hard and true and then finally he set her back from him again he held her hands and he held her heart thena ive loved you for ever he said softly soyoull really be my wife yes princess to my prince absolutely mama to my papa that too my lover youre very demanding you have no idea how demanding he said his hands were tugging her into him his eyes were dark and fathomless and she was against his heart held tight his hand cupping her chin so her mouth was just under his were family he said fiercely and it was as if he was making a vow youll be my wife and ill not let you go again i love you athena ive loved you since i was eight years old and i dont intend stopping until im a hundred and eight or longer if im granted more years by your side stupid she said softly lovingly and as an echo to a vow it was pretty dumbbut it didnt matter she was kissing him he was kissing her back and on the steps of the royal palace of argyros half the island council and practically all the palace staff were craning their heads to see the island had its royal family and the prince and his princess didnt notice their audience at all the combined wedding and coronation of the crown prince and crown princess of argyros was a day to remember for ever the sun shone gently on the rugged cliffs and distant mountains the ocean glittered in its sapphire and diamond brilliance the warm breeze from the sea was almost a caress coronations and royal weddings should take place in a formal settingmost properly in the great hall of the royal palace that was a problem for the great hall only held five hundred and all the island wanted to see so they held the ceremony on the wide sweep of lawn between the palace and what had once been the most private of beaches no invitation was necessary whosoever loved this island and wished it well was welcome to see the beginning of its future and its future was assured in the best of monarchies the royal family was an embodiment of the hopes and dreams of the people and in nikos and athena the islanders of argyros had found that dream nikos in royal uniformjetblack jacket and trousers shining boots tassels braid dress swordwas eyecandy enough to have at least half their audience sighing with pure enchantment and athena in her clouds of swirling silk and lace was a bride to turn the most hardened islander mistyeyed she made her vows clearly and solemnly and she looked so happy there was hardly a dry eye on the island even father antoniothe old priest married them with love and with pride and there was definitely a tear or two rolling down his wrinkled cheek as he blessed the bride and groom his old voice became redolent with joy his blessing was supposed to be just for the bride and groomthe prince and princessbut he didnt stop there he blessed the ancient ring on athenas finger the ring of argyros ancient silver gnarled and twisted and lovely with three magnificent diamonds embedded in its depths he blessed the islanders looking on he blessed alexandros and lily from the isle of sappheiros and he blessed stefanos even now trying to sort the future of the third and last island and of course he blessed the children nicky was pageboy torn a little between embarrassment and pride pride was definitely winning christa was flower girl with so many pink and white flounces shed announced that any minute now she might float indulging her fancy the dressmaker had attached a tiny pair of gossamer wings to her back christas happiness was complete she had a mama and a papa a brother and a dog and wings she was tossing her rose petals with delight and she was making nicky toss them with her two royal childrenand even now the island grandmothers were dusting off their knitting needles in hope but knitting was for the future everything was for the future for now the royal couple knelt to receive the ancient crowns that had lain in storage for over two hundred years they rose to thunderous applause to a happy beginning crown princess athena and crown prince nikos stood hand in hand on the raised dais and looked out on the island of their birth and if there were tears shed in the crowd then the islanders tears found reflection in the face of the new crown princess of argyros the crown was secure the argyros diamonds were confirmed as belonging to the people and legal proceedings were already underway to ensure no royal held such terrifying powers again demos was stripped of his title and waiting for the courts to administer justice exile athena thought for there was room in her heart to almost feel sorry for the man so what was next it had been leaked by the media that prince nikos had decreed a months honeymoon was the minimum required to cement their union the islanders deliriously happy at their good fortune could only smile their agreement nikos had offered his wife any place in the world for their time out a deserted island in the maldives a tropical bure nights alone by candlelight shed chosenthe eagles nest theyd leave for there tonight with nicky and with christa and with oscar for i have a daughter now shed whispered proudly to nikos hed held her close hed kissed her eyelids and hed felt so much in love that surely his heart must burst theyd face the future together he thought and if the worst happenedthey were a family theyd face their future with love and with courage and with a dog called oscar and with a grandmother called annia and uncles and aunts and cousins and thousands of islanders who loved this place as they did their island home its perfect he whispered to athena as they stood side by side and waved to the assembled population of argyros i cant imagine anything more perfect than this i cant imagine anyone more perfect than you she whispered back then you need to look in the mirror he retorted and then this very serious ceremonial occasion was marred this ceremony had been timed to the last nanosecond there was no room for improvisation right now the crown prince was supposed to take the crown princesss hand and solemnly lead her to the pair of gold and crimson thrones at the middle of the crimsoncarpeted dais he didnt instead for three whole minutesfor one whole trumpet chorale that was supposed to see them taking the throne togetherthe crown prince of argyros took the crown princess of argyros into his arms and he kissed her as he intended to kiss
