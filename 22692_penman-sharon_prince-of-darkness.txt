sharon kay penman prince of darkness prologue december stmalo brittany they came together on a damp december evening in a pirates den that was how she would one day describe this night to her son constance decided the men of stmalo were legendary as sea wolves prideful and bold and so were the men gathered in this drafty unheated chapter house torches flared from wall sconces casting smoky shadows upon the cold stone walls upon their intent expectant faces several of them already knew what she would say the unholy trinity as she liked to call them three of the duchys most powerful lords knew so did their host an affable gambler with a corsairs nerve and a bishops miter as for the others theyd embraced the aim needed only to be apprised of the means turning toward the man hovering by the door constance beckoned him forward he came slowly as if reluctant to leave the shadows and it occurred to her that shed rarely seen him in the full light of day although a man of god he had the polished manners of a courtier and he bent over her hand murmuring my lady duchess as if offering a benediction constance did not like him very much this unctuous instrument of her enemys doom and she withdrew her fingers as soon as his lips grazed her skin she felt no gratitude hed been very well paid after all in truth she found herself scorning him for the very betrayal that would serve her son so well loyalty was the currency of kingship and hed already proven that he dealt in counterfeit this is robert a canon from st etiennes cathedral in toulouse she did not introduce the lords or bishop pierre when she nodded robert produced a parchment sheet all eyes were upon him as he unrolled it and carefully removed the silk sealbags revealing plaited cords and tags impressed with green wax coated with varnish savoring the suspense constance held the letter out to the closest of her barons andre de vitre andre was already familiar with the letter but he made a show of reading it as if for the first time rising from his seat in a gesture of respect for raoul de fougeress years and stature he passed the letter to the older man raoul read without comment offered it to alain de dinan one by one they read the letter studying those dangling wax seals with the exaggerated care due a holy relic only after the letter had made a circuit of the chapterhouse and was once more in constances hands did the questions begin to flow did her grace believe the seals were genuine who else knew of this letter and how had it come into the possession of canon robert does it truly matter she challenged this letter is evidence of a foul crime a mortal sin once its contents become known it will give the holy church a potent weapon to use against the ungodly heresies that have taken root in toulouse and it will be of great interest to the king of the french and to the lionheart richard coeur de lion englands charismatic crusaderking celebrated throughout christendom for his courage his bravura deeds on the bloody battlefields of the holy land his mastery of the arts of war but in constances mouth the admiring sobriquet became a sardonic epithet for her loathing of her angevin inlaws burned to the very bone this letter will draw as much blood as any dagger thrust she said and i will not pretend that does not give me pleasure but there is far more at stake than past wrongs and unhealed grievances she paused and for the first time that night they saw her smile with this we shall make my son englands king chapter december genets normandy apallid winter sun had broken through the clouds shrouding the harbor although the sea remained the color of slate brother andrevs mantle billowed behind him like a sail as he strode toward the waters edge but he was as indifferent to the winds bite as he was to the damp invasive cold no true breton was daunted by foul weather brother andrev liked to joke that storms were their birthright and squalls their meat and drink as always his gaze was drawn to the shimmering silhouette of mont st michel crowned by clouds and besieged by foamcrested waves the abbey isle seemed to be floating above the choppy surface of the bay more illusion than reality eden before the fall during low tide pilgrims would trudge out onto those wet sands intent upon saying prayers and making offerings to blessed st michael the prudent ones hired local men to guide them through the quicksand bogs men who would be able to get them safely to the rocky citadel before the tides came roaring back into the bay when warned of the fearsome speed of those surging waters people sometimes scoffed refusing to believe that even a horse at full gallop could not outrun that incoming tide the bodies that washed up on the beaches of the bay would be given decent christian burial by the monks of mont st michel for those swept out to sea and not recovered only prayers could be said in the three years since brother andrev had been assigned to the abbeys cell at genets not a day passed when hed not blessed his good fortune at being able to serve both god and st michael this december noon was no different and as he filled his eyes with the majesty of the motherhouse his soul rejoiced in a deep and profound sense of peace father andrev a towheaded youngster was running toward him skimming over the beach as nimbly as a sandpiper recognizing the son of eustace the shipwright brother andrev waved back he no longer corrected them when they called him father instead of brother for he understood their confusion brother andrev was that rarity both ordained priest and benedictine monk and thus more intimately involved with the daily lives of the villagers than his monastic brethren saying mass hearing their confessions baptizing their babies and burying their dead where are you off to in such a hurry eudo ive rarely seen you move so fast unless you were on your way to dinner of course the boy grinned i was fleeing from brother bernard he said cheekily he caught giles and me throwing dice in the churchyard and i bolted not wanting to hear another of his sermons about our slothful sinful ways brother andrev knew he ought to pick up the gauntlet flung down by brother bernard and lecture eudo about the evils of gambling especially on the lords day but he liked to play hasard and raffle himself and he did not count hypocrisy among his sins too often hed wanted to flee too when brother bernard launched into one of his interminable homilies before he could respond eudos head came up sharply oh crud i cannot believe hes tracked me this far with that he spun around and began to sprint up the beach leaving brother andrev to gape after him in puzzlementuntil he turned and saw the stout figure in benedictine black bearing down upon him was that eudo brother bernard was panting his normally florid complexion now beetred with annoyance and exertion but when brother andrev would have offered up a defense of the errant youngster the other monk waved it aside impatiently whatever had brought him onto the windswept beach it was not eudos tomfoolery i have been looking for you everywhere brother andre i should have known youd be here he said churlishly enough to give his words an accusatory edge at first brother andrev had done his best to master his dislike of brother bernard he was no saint though and his good intentions had frayed under constant exposure to the other monks surly disposition and sour outlook upon life ahndrayoh he said coolly not andre it is a breton name not a french one youd like it not if i called you bernez instead of bernard brother bernard ignored the rebuke for he shared the common belief of his french countrymen that bretons were uncivilized ignorant rustics i came to tell you that you are wanted back at the church that woman has come again he invested the words that woman with such scorn that brother andrev knew at once the identity of their guest lady arzhela de dinan his friendship with lady arzhela was one of the joys of his life but he knew that in brother bernards eyes her sins were manifold she was breton proudly so she was known to be bastardborn yet she was also highborn she was thrice wed thrice widowed and barren for shed never been with child she was no stranger to controversy her free and easy ways had often given rise to rumors and gossip and although she was the kindest woman brother andrev had ever met she was one for speaking her mind on her last visit to genets she had scolded brother bernard for chasing beggars away from the church and then earned his undying enmity by laughing at his attempt at offended dignity lady arzhela that is indeed welcome news and it was good of you to let me know straightaway he said blandly and started off across the sand to his vexation brother bernard fell into step beside him it seemed the sermon was not yet over she said that she wanted you to hear her confession brother bernard sounded out of breath for he was laboring to keep pace with brother andrevs longer strides do you not think it odd that she keeps coming to you for the sacrament of penance no i do not well i do genets is not her parish and you are not her priest brother andrev understood the insinuation that lady arzhela was parishshopping seeking a priest whod be more indulgent of her sins impose a lighter penance he stopped abruptly and swung around to confront the older man angrily if you must know lady arzhela has a fondness for our church abbot robert consecrated it in gods year the year of her birth she was baptized there had one of her weddings there and has always avowed that she wants to be buried in the choir near to the high altar brother bernard gasped that is outrageous he said indignantly a woman like that does not deserve to be buried inside the church i do not care if she is the widow of a breton lord she is also a wanton and she is the widow of three breton barons but were she not shed still have the right to be buried here in our church of notre dame and saintsebastien in the abbey of blessed st michael or even in bishop herberts great cathedral at rennes do you not know whatthat she is a counts bastard it had been years since brother andrev had lost his temper like this his fists clenched at his sides as he fought back an alarming urge to take aim at the other monks sneer yes she is the count of nantess natural daughter he said tautly which makes her the aunt of our late lord duke conan and the cousin of our duchess the lady constance she is of the royal house of brittany and not to be judged by the likes of you brother bernard was not as impressed by lady arzhelas illustrious pedigree as brother andrev had hoped his was an easy face to read and his disdain for the royal breton bloodlines was all too evident but if he did not respect lady arzhelas heritage he did understand the significance of her kinship to the duchess she might well be the whore of babylon but only a fool would make an enemy of a woman with such proximity to power swallowing his bile as best he could he turned on his heel and marched off brother andrev watched him go more bemused now than angry embarrassed by his own fervor he could only marvel at lady arzhelas ability to befuddle male minds and heat their blood she was no longer young was not even present and yet shed managed to bring two men of god almost to blows women were confessed in open church and a shriving stool had been set up for lady arzhela at the front of the chancel the three parts of confession had been satisfied arzhela had expressed contrition confessed her sins and accepted the fasting penance imposed by brother andrev now it was for him to offer absolution but he found himself hesitating what if brother bernard were right if arzhela deliberately chose him knowing hed give out light penances was she truly contrite brother andrev arzhela was looking up at him a quizzical smile parting her lips she had captivating eyes wideset and longlashed a vivid shade of turquoise like sunlight on seawater at first glance a man might not find her beautifulthe fairness of her skin was marred by a sprinkling of freckles and her hair was the color of fire thought to be unlucky since the time of judasbut then hed look into those amazing eyes and hed be lost brother andrev blinked came back to himself and hastily said i absolve you from your sins in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit arzhela lowered her lashes murmured a demure amen and then her grin broke free you had me worried that you were not going to give me absolution and if i did not brother andrev asked and she wrinkled her nose and then grinned again well if i eat a portion of cabbage and onions without complaint i want my honey wafers and hippocras afterward when he did not join in her laughter her eyebrows shot upward surely that deserves a smile even a small one you cannot expect me to believe that my petty sins are too terrible to be forgiven why ive done much worse and even told you so in shameful but provocative detail she stopped suddenly frowning oh no do not tell me that nasty little man talked to you too about my confessions what nasty little man my lady brother bertrand or barnabus or whatever his name is when i told him i wanted you to hear my confession he mumbled something about that being such a surprise his sarcasm was thick enough to choke on and when i challenged him he said it was not fitting for me to do penance to a priest who was besotted with me well i gave him a right sharp talkingto for that bit of impertinence but obviously not sharp enough i am right am i not he did mention this to you brother andrev nodded reluctantly he did plant one of his poison seeds and i was foolish enough to let it take root indeed you were she held out her hand let him help her to her feet of course he was not entirely wrong we both know you are besotted with me for what man is not she had a low laugh an infectious chuckle that had always been music to his ears until now he could feel the heat rising in his face and he lowered his head hoping shed not notice she did and her attitude changed dramatically oh andrev i am so sorry i ought not to have been teasing you but you know me ill be flirting with the devil on my deathbed you are very dear to me and there is nothing sinful or shameful about our friendship i come to you for confession because you can see into my heart because you know that my contrition is genuine that i truly mean it when i vow not to sin again even knowing that i will she kept up an easy flow of conversation as they walked down the nave and he blessed her social skills for by the time theyd reached the cloisters his discomfort had faded and when she called brother bernard a profane name that cast aspersions on his manhood he grinned appreciatively arzhela was pleased that shed gotten him into a better mood but she was not done with brother bernard not yet for she was as protective as a mother lion when it came to those she cared about that nasty little man would not be harassing andrev again if she had anything to say about it and she damned well did tell me she said favoring him with her most innocent smile does mont st michel have any alien priories or cells in other lands say ireland mayhap wales brother andrev was accustomed to arzhelas non sequiturs part of her charm was her unpredictability no he said thoughtfully not that i know of the abbey does have lands in england though several in devon and a grange up in yorkshire yorkshire arzhela said happily perfect making a mental note to have a little talk with abbot jourdain the next time she visited the abbey she gestured toward a bench in one of the carrels may we sit for a while i have a private matter to discuss with you more private than the confessional brother andrev joked gallantly using the corner of his mantle to wipe the bench clean for her what may i do for you my lady i have a dilemma she confided i have learned something id rather not have known for now i must make a choice if i do nothing great harm will come to one who well let us just say i have fond memories of him but if i warn him someone else i care for will be adversely affected what would you do brother andrev if you were faced with such a predicament well i think i would probably just toss a coin in the air lady arzhela i cannot possibly answer your question based upon the meager information you have given me arzhela did not know whether to scowl or smile in the end she did both and then sighed no i do not suppose you can she agreed but i cannot tell you what youd need to know to give me an honest answer this friend of mine will be in grave danger if this accusation is made against him i cannot be more specific though is the accusation true no i do not think it is but you cannot be sure of that she considered the question he is not a man overly burdened with scruples i do not believe though that he is guilty of this charge with a wry smile she said he is too clever to make a mistake of this magnitude can you tell me anything about the other person involved the one you said you care for he was not surprised when she shook her head for he felt reasonably certain that duchess constance was the other player in this mysterious drama what then of the consequences my lady what happens if you warn your friend of the danger and what happens if you do not arzhela was quiet for several moments you are right she said at last that does clarify matters for me for the scales do not balance on the one hand disappointment and on the other destruction rising she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek thank you dear friend youve helped more than you know now ive taken up enough of your time the provost has invited me to dine with him this evening i hope to see you there too but for the love of god everlasting please do not let him include your favorite monk and mine she did not wait for his response blew him a playful kiss and started up the walkway shed only taken a few steps before brother andrev jumped to his feet my lady wait there is something i must ask you something i should have asked at the first if you involve yourself in this would you be putting yourself at risk she looked at him for a moment her expression grave but amusement was shimmering in the depths of those beautiful bluegreen eyes and it was not long in spilling over into laughter i do hope so she said for life without risk would be like meat without salt chapter december stalbans england the two men were loitering by the roadside with such suspicious intent that they at once drew sarras attention turning in the saddle she was relieved to see that justin de quincy had noticed them too and was already taking protective measures nudging his stallion toward the lady claudines mare he carefully transferred the blanketwrapped bundle in his arms to her embrace and then opened his mantle to give himself quick access to the sword at his hip as sarra had hoped and justin had expected the mere sight of the weapon was enough to discourage any villainy the men had in mind tipping their caps with sardonic deference they backed away from the road prudently preferring to await easier prey justin did not let down his guard though not until theyd reached the outskirts of st albans only then did he dare to reclaim that precious cargo the infant settled back into the crook of his arm with a soft sigh and her contentment caught at his heart we are almost there sarra said quietly giving him a sympathetic sideways glance as she tightened her hold upon her own baby justin nodded never taking his eyes from his daughters flowerpetal little face he said nothing for what was there to say as soon as he heard the footsteps outside baldwin leaped to his feet he flung the door open wide his welcoming smile faltering at the sight of his sister rohese attempting to disguise his disappointment he made a great fuss out of ushering her inside seating her close to the hearth and fetching her a cup of his best ale this is indeed a pleasant surprise he said heartily but where is brian surely he did not let you make this trip on your own of course not her eyes no longer met his though as she explained that brian had stopped by the local alehouse upon their arrival in town he had a great thirst after so many hours on the road it was a weak excuse feebly offered but baldwin bit back any comments knowing from experience that an attack upon her husband would only spur her to his defense a pity it was but there was naught to be done about it baldwin liked his brotherbymarriage in truth he did brian was a charmer quick with a joke always willing to offer a helping hand he was never a nasty drunk but a drunk he was and rohese alone refused to admit it where is sarra she asked abruptly eager to turn the conversation away from her missing husband and the bairnsnever have i heard your house so quiet the children are with sarras mother sarra sarra has been away for the past fortnight she said shed be back by the last week of advent so i hope shell get home today or tomorrow he was not keen to explain his wifes absence but he knew hed have to satisfy roheses curiosity no respectable wife and mother left her home and hearth unless her need was a strong one and indeed his sister blinked in surprise at once wanting to know where sarra had gone he supposed he could lie and claim she was visiting an ailing aunt but for what purpose sooner or later the rest of the family would have to know sarra has agreed to be the wet nurse for a ladys newborn roheses eyes widened truly baldwin she knew that sarras mother had been the wet nurse to king richard in his infancy and her entire family had benefited greatly from it sarras brother alexander not only enjoyed bragging rights as the kings milkbrother he had received an excellent education at st albans and paris so she understood why baldwin and sarra might be tempted by such an opportunity yet there were drawbacks too in accepting so serious a trust are you sure you want to do this baldwin i know sarra would never agree to live in as her mother was required to do but youll be taking a strangers child into your home into your lives for at least a year mayhap two until the babe is weaned she did not mention the greatest deterrent to breastnursingthat sexual intercourse was forbidden as long as the baby suckled since it was widely believed that breastfeeding prevented pregnancy and a highborn womans first duty was to provide her husband with heirs women of the nobility hired wet nurses for their children for those of lesser status or affluence this was not possible and their choices were unpalatable a woman could sleep chastely in the marriage bed while she nursed her baby or her husband could refrain from spilling his seed within her body thresh within and winnow without as roheses brian cheerfully put it but this practice was a mortal sin in the eyes of the holy church most couples chose the lesser sin and yielded to the temptations of the flesh if a nursing mother then became pregnant it was just gods will a wet nurse did not dare take such a risk though all knew that mothers milk was purified blood this made conception during nursing dangerous to the nursing baby for a pregnant womans good blood would be needed to nurture the child within her womb leaving only her impure blood to feed the child at her breast moreover pregnancy would soon dry up her milk impure or not and she would no longer be of use to her highborn employer rohese did not think she had the right to lecture though for baldwin was her elder brother she contented herself with repeating you are sure yes he said not sounding all that convinced he was quiet for some moments watching as flames licked the hearth log we could hardly say no not when the queen was the one doing the asking she sent for sarras mother told hodierna that she needed a wet nurse she could trust a woman who was healthy between twentyfive and thirtyfive willing to forswear spicy and sour foods whilst nursing and above all discreet rohese had straightened on her stool at the first mention of the queen it all made sense now understandably eager to please eleanor hodierna must have mentioned that her youngest daughter was nursing her own babe no she agreed you could hardly turn down the queen of england her eyes shining she leaned forward patting baldwins knee this is so exciting baldwin for the queen to take a hand surely the babe must be of high birth you think could it be her son johns sarra would never have answered roheses question but sarra was not there baldwin already had misgivings and the baby had not even arrived yet i wondered that too he admitted but i met the father or the lad claiming to be the father he came a fortnight ago to escort sarra to godstow priory that is where the mother had her lyingin and i gathered that justinthe only name he gave mehas been staying nearby since the babes birth the baby was not due till december but she was born early they had to find a local girl to nurse the child until arrangements could be made to get her to st albans rohese had not yet abandoned her theory that the baby could be lord johns and she felt a small dart of disappointment for she imagined a father would be more involved in a sons life than a daughters the child is a girl then baldwin nodded she is called aline justin said it was his mothers name anticipating her curious questions he raised a hand in playful protest i can tell you very little about him rohese other than the fact that he has excellent manners and wears a sword with the comfort of a man who knows how to use it what is his connection to the queen could he could he be a natural son of the old king baldwin shook his head chuckling he has grey eyes like the old king but he is dark as a saracen moreover i do not think the queen would have warm fond feelings for one of king henrys bastards this justin cannot be much more than twenty or twentyone and by then the queen was being held prisoner by her husband oh rohese said deflated at least two of king henrys bastards had been raised at his court with the queens consent but if justin were born after the queen had rebelled against king henry hed not have known her during his childhood and it was unlikely that shed be bestirring herself on his behalf well then it must be the babys mother who has the queens favor what do you know about her even less than i know about justin weve been told her name is clarice but it is most likely false this time baldwin was certain of the step outside the door with a grin he hurried over to open it for his wife baldwin was struck by the beauty of the woman introduced to him as the lady clarice he was struck too by her unease her smile was perfunctory her demeanor distracted and her eyes darted around the room as if measuring the confines of a cage conversation was stilted sporadic for justin was no more talkative than clarice unlike her though he did not seem nervous just sad he was holding baby aline as if she were as delicate as a snowflake and would melt if breathed upon baldwin remembered how hed felt when hed cradled his firstbornawed and thankful and so protective of that fragile little life that it was actually painfuland he thawed toward the younger man but his newfound empathy for justin did nothing to ease the awkwardness and he was relieved when sarra reached again for her mantle declaring that she could not wait another moment to see her children once out in the street rohese was obviously eager to interrogate sarra about alines parents but she won baldwins gratitude by curbing her curiosity and declaring she was off to fetch brian from the alehouse sarra and baldwin stood for several moments in a wordless embrace cuddling their young daughter between them until she started to squirm giving her to baldwin sarra linked her arm in his and they started walking up the street toward her mothers residence well ella he joked how do you feel about having a new milksister the little girl gurgled and cooed and his anxiety began to ebb away in his joy at having his family together again so what do you think sarra it will be well she said and he was comforted by her certainty for shed never been one for sweetening the truth our greatest fear was that theyd be haughty and demanding we need not worry about that the girl is highborn as we suspected but i saw no malice in her no spite and i did not see her at her best for she is still recovering from the birthing she had a hard time of it baldwin bled enough to scare the midwife half to death ella let out a sudden squeal and aline and her mysterious parents were forgotten sarra wanted reassurance that their other children had behaved themselves during her absence and baldwin was happy to spin some tall tales about their mischiefmaking it was not until theyd almost reached her mothers house that he thought to thank her for bringing that awkward cottage encounter to a merciful end actually she said i wanted to give them some time alone with their little one ah so it will be a painful parting i think so she said and then amended that to certainly for him claudine had followed justin to the door and was watching as he untied the cradle from their packhorse but after a moment she realized that the chill was not good for the baby and she hurriedly retreated toward the hearth aline hiccupped and she patted the infant gingerly on the back as shed seen sarra do to her surprise it worked and aline burped justin came in then with the cradle once it was set up claudine relinquished the baby and went to pour a cup of ale justin was leaning over the cradle murmuring to aline returning with the ale claudine smiled when she was close enough to catch his words what did you call her butterfly the swaddling looks like a cocoon to me when claudine studied the linen bands binding the babys body she saw what he meant only alines head and hands were visible sarra assured me that it is necessary to keep her warm and make sure her limbs develop properly she says an infants body is so soft and pliable that it needs special support and i daresay she is right but it does not look comfortable does it this is the way it is always done justin reaching over to straighten the pannus the cloth covering alines loins claudine wrinkled her nose not again she does leak a lot justin agreed grinning and went rooting for a dry cloth in alines coffer neither one had fully mastered the skill of diapering a baby yet but between the two of them they managed to get aline into a clean one claudine retrieved her ale cup while he continued to play with their daughter she watched him for a few moments before saying justin i have a favor to ask of you he glanced up and although he smiled she thought he looked faintly wary too it may be months before the queen and king richard return from germany since i need not be in attendance upon the queen i have decided to pay a visit to my family first to my cousin petronillla in paris and then home to poitou will you escort me to southampton of course i will justin said doing his best to conceal his relief that she had not asked him to accompany her to france if she had hed have felt honorbound to accept his own mother had died giving him birth and the midwife had told him that claudine had come fearfully close to trading her life for alines had he ever loved claudine he remembered how much it had hurt to discover that she was johns spy and how troubling it had been to discover too that he could still desire a woman he could not trust when shed told him that she was pregnant a very ugly suspicion had surfaced had she been johns concubine as well as his spy claudine was a distant kinswoman of queen eleanor and ostensibly this was why the queen had been so willing to help with claudines pregnancy or was it that shed wondered if claudine could be carrying her grandchild justin had never discussed this with the queen hed had difficulty even admitting the suspicion to himself he had no proof after all that claudine had ever lain with john much less that shed been sharing his bed when aline was conceived the doubts had remained thoughuntil the first time hed held aline in his arms but if hed given his heart utterly and willingly to his baby daughter it was far more complicated with claudine justin she was watching him intently what is it your words do not match your face surely it is not too much to ask not at all ill gladly take you to southampton claudine id ask you to come with me to france but i dare notyou understand he did she could hardly invite him to meet her family how would she introduce him as her lowerclass lover she was the daughter of one highborn baron widow of another and he was the bastard son of a bishop her father was not likely to be impressed that he was also the queens man they were the queens kindred claudine had wandered to the door opening it a crack she turned to face justin with a radiant relieved smile sarra and her husband are coming back with a flock of children trailing after them we ought to leave whilst there is still daylight justin i suppose as he reached over to make sure alines blankets were securely tucked around her she opened her eyes theyd been blue at birth but theyd been darkening daily and sarra had told him that they might eventually become as brown as claudines when he touched her hand her tiny fingers clamped on to his thumb i have to go butterfly he said softly but ill be back winchester was on the southampton road and justin suggested that they stop there for the night in order to visit with his friend luke de marston the shires undersheriff claudine had met luke during one of his london trips and theyd gotten along very well so she was amenable to the idea reaching the city at dusk they were made welcome by luke and the woman he loved aldith but within an hour of their arrival claudine sensed that they were sharing their cottage with trouble it lurked in the corners flitted about in the shadows hovered in the air and she was worldly enough to recognize that this was the ageold war that men and women had been fighting since god breathed life into adams rib justin was not oblivious to the tension either he caught the oblique glances that aldith cast in lukes direction when he wasnt looking he felt the heaviness of the silences between them he noticed how often luke reached for the wine flagon he noticed too how uncomfortable aldith seemed in claudines presence aldith usually made other women feel uncomfortable but she knew claudine was a ladyinwaiting to the queen of england while she was a poor potters daughter of dubious reputation her unease told justin that shed learned luke was under pressure to end their liaison and he was sorry for aldith was his friend the most seductive shapely of friends but a friend nonetheless the only one who was enjoying the stay in winchester was justins dog shadow for he was utterly and enthusiastically smitten with jezebel aldiths mastiff rescued by justin from drowning in the river fleet shadow had finally grown into his long rangy frame but he was still dwarfed by the enormous mastiff who was not receptive to his wooing he continued his highrisk courtship though until a snarl and yelp told them that jezebels latest rebuff had drawn blood poor sap luke said unsympathetically i have to make one last sweep of the town tonight come with me de quincy and wed best bring your besotted hound with us ere jezebel bites him where it will hurt the most claudine and aldith shared a common expression for a moment one of dismay at the prospect of being left alone together justin snatched up his mantle hoping he did not appear too eager to escape the stifling atmosphere of the cottage and he and shadow followed the undersheriff out into the night they ended up in a tavern on calpe street as usual luke insisted upon being the one to order a flagon of heavily spiced red wine an undersheriff could run up charges indefinitely for no alehouse or tavern owner would be foolish enough to push for payment justin coaxed shadow under the table where hed be in no danger of being stepped on and then apologized for showing up at lukes door with no warning what you really mean luke said is that youre sorry you did not want to pay for a nights stay at a winchester inn the worst of our flearidden hovels is looking better and better when compared to the harmony and joy at castle de marston you know me anything to save a few pence so aldith knows luke nodded morosely and they drank in silence for several moments theyd met when justin had been investigating the death of a winchester goldsmith the previous year aldith had been the mans longtime mistress but luke had been willing to offer her what the goldsmith could notmarriage when word of his intentions got out though hed encountered opposition from the sheriff and the bishop of winchester marriage would elevate aldith into the gentry and winchester society had far more stringent standards for an undersheriffs wife than for his bedmate unwilling to lose his office and equally unwilling to lose aldith luke had been concocting excuses for delaying the wedding while he tried to find a way out of the trap justin had advised him to tell aldith the truth apparently that had not worked too well she blames you for not defying them he asked in surprise for that did not mesh with what he knew of aldith no she says not she said she understood and she chided me for not telling her sooner but nothing has been right between us since then we fight more and we watch what we say and luke doused the rest of his words in his wine cup when he set it down again he signaled that he was done discussing his family woes by saying hastily well enough of that what is the latest news about the queen and king richard the english king had been seized by his enemies on his way home from the crusade and after much negotiation and scheming he was to be freed upon payment of a vast ransom to his royal captor heinrich the holy roman emperor queen eleanor had sailed for germany that past november to deliver the ransom but richards release was not a foregone conclusion the french king philippe and richards younger brother john count of mortain had been doing all in their power to prolong richards confinement and they were not known for being gracious losers rumor had it that theyd offered heinrich an even larger sum to keep richard prisoner and luke hoped that justin one of the queens men might be a better source than local alehouse gossip he was to be disappointed though all justin could tell him was that the queen had safely arrived in germany and that john was still in france reported to be at the french kings court peering into the wine flagon luke motioned to the serving maid for another he was about to recount a story about a local vintner whod evaded the tax imposed to pay king richards ransom but remembered in time that justin would probably not see the humor in it the crown had demanded that all of richards subjects contribute fully a fourth of their annual income to the exchequer a huge burden that had eroded some of the kings popularity at least in winchester but justins loyalty to his queen was absolute and luke thought it was unlikely hed question the exorbitant price the english were paying for the return of their king i had to make a trip to london he said the week of michaelmas i stopped by to see you de quincy but your friends at the alehouse said youd been gone since the summer i assume you were off skulking and lurking on the queens behalf i was in wales justin said reaching over to pour them more wine some of king richards ransom had gone missing and the queen sent me to recover it just another ordinary summer then luke said with a grin did you get it back eventually justin said and he grinned too then imagining lukes reaction if hed been able to give the deputy a candid account of his time in wales the welsh prince davydd ab owain was fighting a civil war with his nephew llewelyn ab iorwerth he staged a false robbery of the ransom to put the blame on llewelyn but he was outwitted by his notsoloving wife emma the bastard sister of the old king emma arranged to have the ransom really stolen with the help of a partner in crime and a dangerous spy called the breton i followed emma to an abbey grange and discovered that her confederate was none other than the queens son john who decided that the best way to protect his aunt emma was to shut my mouth by filling it with gravesoil since a prince never dirties his own hands he left it for durand to do you remember durand luke johns henchman from hell who secretly serves the queen when he is not doing the devils work durand had the grace to apologize to me first wanting me to know there was nothing personal in his actions as he was about to spill my guts all over the chapel floor obviously it did not go as he expected thanks to llewelyn did i mention that llewelyn and i had become allies of a sort anyway i got the ransom back for the queen too many men died and john decided that paris was healthier than wales of course justin could never say that of all he owed the queen not the least was his silence she wanted johns misdeeds covered up not exposed to the light of day nor was he being completely honest not even in his own mental musings his mocking tone softened the harsh edges of memorytrapped in that torchlit chapel disarmed and defenseless hearing john say dispassionately kill him i was somewhat surprised to have you turn up with the lady claudine luke admitted for i thought you ended it once you found out that she was spying for john in her spare time i did but justin shrugged for he could hardly explain about aline it got confusing at times remembering who knew which secrets claudine knew that the bishop of chester was his father but she did not know that her spying had been discovered by justin and the queen luke knew about justins connection to claudine but not about his blood ties to the bishop molly a childhood friend and recent bedmate had guessed the truth about his father she did not know though that he served the queen the irony was not lost upon justin that he whod never cared much for secrets should now have so many misreading his shrug luke laughed i know when it comes to a choice between common sense and a beautiful woman guess which one wins every time just be sure you sleep with one eye open de quincy especially once you reach paris that is where john is amusing himself these days is it not i am not accompanying claudine to paris i go no farther than the docks at southampton luke blinked you do remember that the queen is away why pass up a chance to see paris take advantage of this free time de quincy trust me on thisof all the cities in christendom none offers a man as many opportunities to sin as paris does i daresay youre right but there is a town that i find even more tempting than paris justin confided and laughed outright at the baffled expression on lukes face when he said st albans chapter january london england a brisk wind had chased most londoners indoors the man shambling along gracechurch street encountered no other passersby only two cats snarling and spitting at each other on the roof of an apothecarys shop the shop was closed for customers were scarce once the winter dark had descended farther down the street though he saw light leaking from the cracked shutters of the local alehouse and he quickened his pace but the door did not budge when he shoved it and as he pounded for entry a voice from within shouted we are closed so be off with you he was not easily discouraged and continued to beat upon the door for several moments to no avail he was finally stumbling away cursing under his breath when he almost collided with a younger man just turning the corner he reeled backward would have fallen if the other man had not caught his arm and hauled him upright saying have a care ned the face smiling down at him looked blearily familiar but his brain had been marinating in wine since midafternoon and his memory refused to summon up a name his new friend had a grip on his elbow and was steering him back toward the alehouse he submitted willingly to the change of direction although he thought it only fair to warn mournfully theyll not let us in i think they will justin assured him turning his head to avoid the wine fumes gusting from neds mouth nell closed the alehouse tonight for cicilys churching you know cicilythe chandlers wife remember she had a baby last month ned was looking up at him with such little comprehension that justin abandoned any further explanations rapping sharply upon the alehouse door he said its justin and when it opened he pulled ned in with him nell was a tiny little thing barely five feet tall but when she frowned grown men cringed for her tempers were feared the length and breadth of gracechurch street she was scowling now at ned who instinctively shrank back behind justin passing strange but i do not remember inviting this swillpot to the churching have a heart nell all theyll find is a frozen lump in the morning if he does not get somewhere to sober up nell grumbled as he expected but she also waved ned on in as hed expected too justin snatched an ale from odo the barber and guided ned over to an empty seat where he settled down happily with the ale utterly oblivious of the celebration going on all around him justin shed his mantle exchanged greetings with those closest to the door and went to get odo another ale coming back he acknowledged his dogs enthusiastic if belated welcome and wandered over to eavesdrop as odos wife agnes tried to explain to nells young daughter lucy what a churching was and after giving birth she is welcomed back into the church lass where she is purified with holy water and blessed by the priest afterward there is a gathering of her friends and family and cicily has so many of them that your mama insisted it be held at the alehouse mama said she was the babys lucy frowned trying to remember her expression a mirror in miniature of her mothers the babys godmother agnes a wise woman detected the unspoken admission of jealousy and did her best to reassure lucy that her mothers new goddaughter was not a rival for her affections it is not like having a child of your own blood not like you lucy nonetheless it is a great honor to be a godparent you ought to be pleased that your mama was chosen lucy did not seem overly impressed with the honor but justin felt a sudden stab of guilt agness words reminded him that a godmother was only one of the benefits other children enjoyed and aline would be denied how could he and claudine seek out godparents for a child whose very existence must be kept secret at that moment he happened to see aldred leaning against the far wall the young kentishman worked for jonas the oneeyed serjeant who was justins sometime partner and the fulltime scourge of the london underworld justin began to weave his way across the common room aldred was hoarding a pile of nells savory wafers and they staged a mock struggle over possession which ended with several wafers sliding off the platter into the floor rushes justin and aldred reacted as one hastily looking around to make sure nell hadnt noticed the mishap justin whistled for shadow who eagerly volunteered for wafer cleanup and then followed aldred toward a vacant space on the closest bench watching the revelries justin felt a quiet contentment a sense of belonging that hed rarely experienced he knew that he did not truly belong on gracechurch street but thanks to his friendship with nell and aldred and gunter the blacksmith hed been accepted as if he did and that was an unusual occurrence in his life even before hed learned the truth about his paternity hed always felt like an outsider the foundling without family in a world in which family was paramount but on gracechurch street he knew these people knew their secrets and their hopes he knew that the cartwrights brother was smitten with the weavers daughter knew that avice the tanners widow fed her children by taking in laundry and an occasional male customer when her pantry ran bare knew that aldred was besotted with nell and gunter still mourned his dead wife and that his neighbors no longer looked upon him with suspicion that theyd learned to trust him enough to take pride in knowing that one of the queens men was living in their midst the new mother cicily was basking in the attention and shed just dramatically declared that her next child would be a boy since the first sight to fill her eyes upon leaving the church was a little lad at that moment there was a sudden loud pounding at the door nell hastened over and slid back the latch it was soon apparent to the others that she was arguing with the watch for snatches of conversation came wafting in with each blast of cold air curfew rung at st marylebow but we are closed to the public nell protested my friends and i are celebrating cicilys churching heard that one before hauled into the wardmoot huge fine oh splendor of god nell threw up her hands in frustration justin will you please come tell these fools that we are not open for business ignoring his obvious reluctance she swung back toward the watch arms akimbo eyes snapping hear it from the queens man if you doubt my word knowing nell was not to be denied justin got to his feet and crossed to the door with a reproachful glance toward nell that was utterly wasted he stepped outside to talk to the watch returning soon thereafter he muttered that the watch was satisfied and grabbed nell in time to stop her from opening the door and shouting a triumphant i told you so conversation resumed and once it had reached a festive level again aldred elbowed justin in the ribs and murmured so how did you satisfy the watch for he knew justin well enough to feel confident that hed not clubbed them over the heads with the queens name how do you think i bribed them justin confessed quietly and they exchanged grins for theyd both learned by now that the less authority men had the more likely they were to defend it jealously but it was then that the banging began again even louder this time ill get it aldred offered quickly for nells outraged expression did not bode well for a peaceful resolution before she could object he darted to the door it is not the watch come back he announced with palpable relief and opened the door wide someone is asking after you justin the man was a stranger he was clad in a costly wool mantle that told justin he was no ordinary courier so did his selfassurance which bordered on arrogance id been told that if you were not to be found at the cottage by the smithy i should seek you at the alehouse he said drawing out a tightly rolled parchment this was to be delivered into your hands and yours alone justin had received urgent communications in the past but the queen would not be sending him messages from germany for a brief moment he wondered if it could be from his father almost at once he dismissed that idea the bishop had never bothered to learn how to reach him in london a wax seal dangled from the scroll its imprint unfamiliar to him claiming the letter he headed into the kitchen in search of light and privacy he broke the seal and unrolled the letter as soon as he reached the hearth the handwriting was not known to him and his eyes flicked to the last line seeking the identity of the sender he caught his breath at the sight of claudines name elegantly inscribed across the bottom of the page he read rapidly by the flickering light of the kitchen fireplace then went back and read it a second time justin his head coming up sharply he saw nell standing in the doorway i do not mean to pry she said not even nell could carry that off with a straight face and her lips were twitching all right i do but it is my experience that mysterious messages arriving in the middle of the night rarely bear good news does this one no most likely not nell i shall have to leave at first light id be grateful if you could care for shadow whilst i am gone nell grimaced and sighed and looked putupon but eventually agreed as they both knew shed do at least tell me where youll be going justin glanced down at the letter again dover he said where ill be taking ship for france in his twentyone years justin had never set foot on shipboard and hed have been content to go to his grave without ever having that experience hed done his best to make the trip tolerable seeking out a priest to be shriven even before booking passage and then searching for the dockside alehouse frequented by the crew of his ship the holy ghost it was easy enough to befriend the sailors taking no more than an offer to buy them an ale and by the time he was ferried out to their ship he had earned an exemption from the casual contempt that sailors worldwide bestowed upon their landloving passengers his alehouse companions found him a sheltered spot on deck pointed out the steering oar that acted as a rudder and showed him how the compass workeda needle magnetized by a lodestone then placed on a pivot in a shallow pan of water one even shared a pinch of ground ginger swearing it would settle his stomach and keep him from feeding the fish justin was grateful for their goodwill it did not make the voyage any less unpleasant for him though he shuddered every time the ship sank into a slough holding his breath until it battled its way back the ship was so low in the water that he was doused with sea spray chilled to the very marrow of his bones but the sailors insisted that his queasiness would worsen within the crowded rank confines of the canvas tent set up to shelter the passengers where men were puking their guts up and there was not room enough to swing a dead cat so justin stayed out on the deck bracing himself against the gunwale of the holy ghost and clinging to the infinite mercy of almighty god justin had chosen the port of dover over southampton because of its closer proximity to london claudines letter had been sparing with details but her urgency had been unmistakable trouble was brewing shed written and she entreated him to make haste to paris if ever hed loved her had her family learned about aline had she confided in her cousin petronilla only to be betrayed if she had indeed been disowned by her father and brothers he did not know what he could do to heal so grievous a wound he had to try though to ease her fears of childbirth and disgrace hed promised her that he would always be there when she and aline had need of him if that meant paris and a hellish sea voyage so be it the holy ghost took more than twelve hours to cross the channel entering boulogne harbor that night with the incoming tide justin had seen few sights as beautiful to him as the beacon fire lit in the old roman lighthouse on the hill overlooking the estuary the customs fee demanded of disembarking passengers was outrageously high but justin paid it without complaint so eager was he to get back upon ground that did not tremble and quake like one of nells egg custards the next morning he purchased a horse too impatient to bargain the price down by much and took the road south toward paris four days later justin saw the walls of saintdenis in the distance and his spirits rose for hed been told the abbey was only seven miles from paris regretting that he could not spare the time to visit the magnificent abbey church he resolutely pushed on the road wound its way through open fields and vineyards deserted and barren under an overcast sky he had chosen a welltraveled road though one paved by longdead roman engineers and he did not lack for company heavily laden carts messengers on lathered horses pilgrims with sturdy ashwood staffs beggars merchants soldiers an occasional barefoot penitent dogs several elderly monks on mules peddlers a raucous band of students and a wellmounted lord and his retinueall converging upon paris paying scant heed to the body dangling from a roadside gallows for the end of their journey was at hand several years earlier the french king had begun replacing the wooden stockade that sheltered the right bank of the seine with a wall of stone it was soon within view and the weary travelers surged forward eager to reach the city before darkness descended after paying the toll justin was allowed to pass through the gate of saintmerri although claudines letter had been vexingly terse she had at least provided directions to her cousin petronillas town house located there on the right bank he had no difficulty finding it for it overlooked a large open area called the greve the citys wine market all hed known about petronilla was that she was wed to a much older french lord and divided her time between their estates in vermandois and their residence in paris now he knew too that her husband was wealthy most urban dwellings were constructed at right angles to the street for it was cheaper to build that way this house was different its great hall was parallel to the street set back in its own courtyard flanked by stables and a kitchen and other wooden buildings dismounting justin found himself hesitating to enter for claudines lavish lodgings were yet further proof of the great gulf between her world and his he was admitted at once and within moments claudine was hastening into the great hall to bid him welcome how it gladdens my eyes to see you justin her time in paris seemed to have suited claudine for she looked rested and relaxed not at all like a woman in peril but his questions would have to wait for her cousin had followed her into the hall petronilla had none of claudines dark sultry beauty but she was elegant and graceful and vivacious obviously an old mans pampered darling who had the wit to recognize her good fortune she greeted justin with surprising warmth hed not expected her to approve of claudines liaison with a man who was not even a knight claudine must have taken her cousin into her confidence though for she was making no attempt to hide their intimacy linking her arm in his as she led him toward the stairwell insisting that he must be hungry and boneweary and in need of tender care he was ushered into a comfortable bedchamber abovestairs lit by thick wax candles and heated by a charcoalfilled iron brazier a servant was pouring warm water into a washing laver and a platter had already been set out on a table piled with bread and thick slices of beef when he tried to speak claudine gently placed her finger to his lips well talk later rest for a while first youve had a long journey she beckoned to the servant and slipped away before justin could respond as the door closed quietly behind her he removed his mantle slowly unbuckled his scabbard there was a wine cup on the table picking it up he took a swallow as he expected it was an expensive vintage a pair of soft leather shoes lay neatly aligned by the side of the bed they were very stylish fastened at the ankle with a decorative brooch and familiar to him it was only then that he realized claudine had taken him to her own bedchamber justin hadnt meant to sleep but the bed was invitingly close at hand and hed been in the saddle since dawn when he awoke one glance at the marked candle told him that hed been asleep for several hours he swung off the bed hastily groping for his boots he was still groggy but splashing his face with water from the laver helped after cleaning away the dust and road grime of the past few days he collected his scabbard and mantle and stepped out into the stairwell claudine was awaiting him in the great hall i was beginning to fear youd sleep till the weeks end she teased no matter though youre awake now so we can talk lets go up to petronillas solar where we can have privacy justin was more than willing for none of this made sense so far if she were in some sort of danger why did she seem so nonchalant and if she were not why had she summoned him with such urgency he was done with waiting and as soon as they entered the solar he said with poorly concealed impatience claudine what is going on why did you send for me his answer did not come from claudine as the door closed behind them a figure stepped from the shadows into the flickering circle of light cast by a smoking oil lamp well actually de quincy john said affably i was the one who sent for you chapter january paris france i hope you are not angry with me for my little deception justin claudine was giving him her most irresistible smile the one that set her dimples to flashing like shooting stars lord john said that he had an urgent matter to discuss with you and he doubted that you would have agreed to come if he had asked you ill not blame you for being irked but he convinced me that this was the best way to do it his utter silence was beginning to erode some of her selfconfidence justin she reached out to stroke his arm and gasped when he jerked away from her touch by then john was at her side gently cupping her elbow and turning her toward the door as he expressed his gratitude before she could protest she found herself out in the stairwell listening to the latch slide into place shell probably hover by the door john predicted cheerfully theres not a woman born who could resist the chance to eavesdrop there is wine over there and ale too as claudine says youve a liking for it he started toward the table stopping when justin recoiled dropping his hand to the hilt of his sword whatyou think i got you here to do you harm good god man use your common sense if i wanted you dead you did want me dead john paused well yes i suppose so he conceded ill not deny that i did tell durand to kill you but that was not personal de quincy i was simply trying to protect my aunt very gallant of you my lord justin snarled and johns eyebrows rose i like to think so moving toward the table he observed i am not about to lunge at you am merely pouring myself a drink id offer you one too but i fear you might fling it in my face taking a swallow of wine he regarded justin thoughtfully over the rim of his cup time for some blunt speaking i see yes i did give durand that command you know it i know it and by now i expect my lady mother knows it too she didnt but justin was not about to tell him that he was still badly shaken not only by johns ambush and claudines betrayal but by the surge of hot raw rage that had flooded his brain and submerged his selfcontrol hed learned at an early age to keep his emotions under a tight rein for a runaway temper was an indulgence few orphans could afford life could be cruel to the weak and the innocent nor was it kind to the unwary or the careless in the world hed grown up in men paid dearly for their mistakesunless they were fortunate enough to have the royal blood of england coursing through their veins put yourself in my place de quincy what was i to dolet you go free to tell my mother that my aunt emma had been plotting with me against her beloved richard if youd been a more reasonable sort i could have bought your silence an argument might even be made that you brought some of your troubles upon yourself by being so incorruptible so damnably honest it was one of johns saving graces that he found humor in the unlikeliest places pools of water in the driest deserts and justin had long suspected that this was one reason hed so often been able to beguile his way back into eleanors favor even claudines playful nickname for him the prince of darkness hinted at the seductive nature of his sins but his sardonic charm was wasted upon justin out of morbid curiosity he said coldly how did durand explain his failure to murder me as durand told it he was overpowered by a score of welshmen masquerading as monks why is there more to the tale than that no justin said grudgingly leave it to durand to tell just enough of the truth to save his worthless skin justins loathing for queen eleanors spy made his distrust of john seem positively benign in comparison yet he could deny neither the other mans iceblooded courage nor his unholy quickness of wit strangely enough he did believe johns claim that hed been seeking to shield emma from exposure but he could find no excuses at all for durands willingness to obey that lethal order john made another casual offer of wine shrugging at justins terse refusal so where was i ah yes complaining about your unwillingness to take bribes it is not as if i bore you some bitter vengeful grudge de quincy since the risk of death is a natural hazard of your precarious profession i do not see why you are taking this so much to heart hellfire man you won did you not you thwarted durand outwitted davydd and emma recovered the ransom and probably even earned a few words of my lady mothers sparing praise now that i think about it i am more the injured party than you are justin was not amused why did you lure me here my lord john must you make it sound so underhanded and sly john protested the corner of his mouth twitching i need your help de quincy it is urgent that i speak with emma as soon as possible i want you to deliver a letter from me convince her if she has qualms and escort her safely to paris justin shook his head in disbelief you cannot be serious i am the last man in christendom whom the lady emma would heed i agree that she has no fondness for you but you are the also the queens man as she well knows shell not dare refuse you in spite of himself justin felt a flicker of interest stirring so john wanted the cover of the crown what was he up to and what part did emma play in his scheme why would i ever agree i can make it well worth your while john did not elaborate nor did he need to they both knew he was offering more than a pouch full of coins he was offering too the favor of a future king richard had no heirs of his body if he died before he sired a son a distinct possibility for a man who flirted with death on a daily basis there were two claimants for his crownhis brother john and his nephew arthur the sixyearold son of his dead brother geoffrey and geoffreys highborn widow constance duchess of brittany the smart money was on john i serve the queens grace and i somehow doubt that her interests and yours are likely to coincide actually john said in this case they do justin did not reply his incredulous expression spoke for him john frowned for hed hoped to avoid trusting justin with the specifics of his plight i have learned that i am about to be accused of a crime i did not commit compliments of that breton bitch my sisterinlaw constance a crime you did not commit justin echoed with enough skepticism to deepen johns scowl is that so hard to believe constance would accuse me of murdering babies and drinking their blood if she thought she could discredit me in richards eyes or she could let you do that all by yourself damnation de quincy will you listen to me i am in trouble and for once none of it is my doing and that would grieve me because because it would grieve my mother you fool would it justin did not know if that was true or not and at the moment he did not care hed had enough that is not for me to say he said and started toward the door john moved swiftly to intercept him we are not done yet at the least you can hear me out justin discovered now that their difference in height gave him the advantage for the queens son had to look up to him no my lord we are done he said and pushed past john to the door as john had predicted claudine was waiting out in the stairwell justin we have to talk no we do not he said and continued on down the stairs she followed hastily behind him justin wait i know you are wroth with me but you do not understand if youd let me explain there is nothing you can say as justin shoved the door open she caught at his arm crying out his name emerging from the stairwell they came to an abrupt halt for all in the hall were staring at them justin please claudine entreated softly she was still clutching his arm and when she would not release her grip he pried her fingers loose one by one until he was free he turned then and stalked away ignoring her plea that he wait that he listen hed almost reached the door when his gaze fell on durand de curzon lounging against the wall arms folded across his chest as their eyes met durand raised his hand in a sarcastic salute temperatures had dropped sharply with the setting sun and justin shivered as he strode across the courtyard toward the stables within moments he heard the door slam and quick footsteps sounded behind him he spun around to see claudine hurrying toward him go back to the hall not until we talk he continued on into the stables with claudine almost running in order to keep pace go back inside he snapped noticing for the first time that shed neglected to take her mantle he added impatiently youll freeze out here i do not care if i do her defiance might have sounded more convincing if her teeth hadnt been chattering she half expected him to offer her his own mantle was taken aback when he did not justin why are you being so stubborn why will you not listen to me justin ignored her and went to look for his saddle she trailed after him wrapping her arms around herself in a futile attempt at warmth you are going to hear me out if i have to follow you across half of paris i met lord john at the french court and he asked for my help i could hardly refuse him justin you may have forgotten that he is the queens son but i do not have that luxury moreover i saw no harm in doing what he asked he said he needed to talk to you why is that so dreadful why are you acting as if id lured you into a vipers den justin whirled angry words of accusation hovering on his lips only to be silenced by the look of honest bewilderment on her face remembering just in time that she did not know what had happened in wales she did not know that john had passed a sentence of death upon him nor was she aware that her spying for john had been discovered and the queen did not want her to know justin talk to me please tell me what ive done that is so unforgivable she pleaded and he stared at her mutely overwhelmed by the burden of so many secrets not knowing what else to do not trusting himself to hold his tongue he turned away from her and fled out into the night the greve was deserted and still swallowed up in shadows the only signs of life came from the river where several boats were moored justin headed in that direction tightening his hold upon his mantle as he faced into the wind as hed hoped he soon caught a glimmer of light and followed it to a small dockside tavern it was half empty the only customers a sleeping sailor and several men lingering over their drinks to delay going out into the cold justin found a table out of range of the doors drafts and ordered a flagon the wine was wretched so impure that he had to spit out sediment into the floor rushes shoving it aside he made a resolute attempt to banish john and claudine from his thoughts and focus upon where he was to spend the night it made sense to leave his horse in petronillas stable he could claim it in the morning curfew must be nigh so he had no time to roam the streets in search of an inn after some thought he beckoned to the tavern owner and negotiated a bed for the night the man agreed to provide a pallet in his kitchen but he looked as shifty as any london cutpurse and justin decided hed best sleep with one eye open overhearing this negotiation one of the other customers suggested he look for lodgings at stgervais by the baudoyer gate and justin was getting directions when the door was thrust open and durand de curzon entered he was wearing an elegant wool mantle trimmed with fox fur a garment that looked utterly out of place in the seedy little tavern and he attracted a few covetous conjectural glances when he swaggered toward justin though men moved out of his way theirs the instinctive unease of a flock sensing a predator in their midst this day keeps getting better and better justin said as durand claimed a stool and a place at his table you were too easy to track down the knight announced reaching over for the wine flagon had i been a hired killer youd have been a lamb to the slaughter lacking a cup he drank directly from the flagon gagged and spat into the floor rushes christ on the cross de quincy id sooner drink horse piss what do you want durand i want you to fetch the lady emma for john and bring her back to paris and i want you to repent your multitude of mortal sins and take the cross pledging to walk barefoot to jerusalem what are the chances of that happening if you are expecting me to offer an apology for what i did in wales youll still be waiting on the day of judgment as i told you then i had to choose which mattered more to the queen that i continued to protect her son or that you continued to breathe the hard truth de quincy is that the queen needs me more than she needs you so does the devil justin said pushing his stool away from the table once he was on his feet though with a clear path to the door he paused he did not doubt that durands first loyalty was to durand not the queen but he also knew that the queen would have expected him to hear the other man out durand correctly interpreted his hesitation sit down ere you attract attention and ill tell you what i know and why i think you ought to do as john bids you as soon as justin reclaimed his seat the knight leaned forward saying quietly john got a letter from brittany that rattled him good and proper he balked at showing it to me saying only that constance was contriving his destruction but i knew his favorite hiding places so i just bided my time until i got a chance to read it for myself it was a message from a woman named arzhela de dinan warning him that constance had written proof that he and the count of toulouses son were plotting to lure richard to toulouse once he is ransomed and there have him slain justin caught his breath for john was right such a charge could indeed be his ruin richard had never seemed threatened by johns attempts to steal his crown even in german confinement hed dismissed johns intrigues with laughter and a mocking comment that john was not the man to conquer a kingdom if there was anyone to offer the feeblest resistance justin had often marveled at how often john eluded the consequences of his treachery concluding that fortune had thrice favored him he benefited from his brothers amiable contempt and his mothers protection but above all from his position as heirapparent most people were willing to turn a blind eye to the misdeeds of a man who might one day be englands king but what if proof existed that he had connived at richards murder to kill a crowned king gods anointed was regicide richard would not overlook that nor would eleanor forgive justin suspected that john would have more to fear from the mother than from the queen for richard claimed her heart and john could only claim her blood two questions he said his eyes searching durands impassive unreadable face is there any chance this is true and what have you been able to find out about this arzhela de dinan how reliable is she those are three questions durand pointed out but no i do not see how it can be true it is a charge that could eventually be disprovedassuming john was given the chance to disprove it on the surface though it has enough plausibility to hearten his enemies and fire richards angevin temper for he has long been at odds with the lords of toulouse it is easy to believe that raymond would concoct a murder plot given the oceans of bad blood there he is already suspect because of the heresies he and his father tolerate in their lands justin knew that the church was increasingly alarmed by the spread of a heretical doctrine that denied some of the basic tenets of the true faith but his knowledge went no further than that he had more pressing concerns now than outlaw sects and he interrupted before durand could continue tell me about the woman arzhela de dinans warning has to be taken seriously for she is well placed to know the secrets of the breton court she is a first cousin to duchess constance and to judge by the tone of her letter she was once johns bedmate she told john that she has not yet seen the letter for herself but she is sure it exists she believes it to be a forgery or at least pretends to believe that id say john has good reason for concern he has enough penance due for past sins without adding regicide to the list but what does emma have to do with a breton plot i do not know durand admitted reluctantly all ive been able to get out of john is that he has sent an urgent message to his favorite spy the breton but emmas part in this remains murky with luck ill have been able to find out more by the time you get back to paris with emma opening his mouth to protest justin realized that there was nothing he could say as little as he liked the idea of being drawn into johns web he had no choice he knew what his queen would want what she always wantedto save john from himself durand had told justin that lady petronilla had invited john to spend the night for his lodgings with the templars were outside the city gate now shut until daybreak returning to the house he felt like daniel going into the lions den and wondered grimly if hed emerge alive like daniel or if the lions would have the mastery of him claudine was not in the great hall to his relief but john was still there with the lady petronilla fluttering about him flirtatiously his attention was distracted though his thoughts obviously elsewhere and when he noticed justin he jumped to his feet with betraying alacrity extricating himself from petronillas orbit he strode toward justin saying follow me he led justin across the hall into the small oratory the most private place he could find as soon as he closed the door he demanded why did you come back eagerly enough to reveal how dismayed hed been by justins abrupt departure justin shrugged after traveling all this way i decided i wanted to hear the end of the story then you agree to escort emma to paris only if i know why you have such an urgent need to see her my lord that is not your concern john said curtly and justin shrugged again as you will my lord he said and turned toward the door john impatiently waved him back if you must know i need to contact the breton i daresay you remember him from your foray into wales he has never been an easy man to find and the messages ive left for him have gone unanswered emma has more of a history with him than i do and she is likely to know other ways to reach him justin suspected there was more to it than that for now though it would do i will leave on the morrow but if the lady is not willing to come i can hardly stuff her into my saddlebag she may not come for me john admitted surprising justin with his candor but shell come for the queens man emma is a clever woman and she well knows how urgently she needs to regain my mothers favor now what will your cooperation cost me de quincy the queen pays me two shillings a day for you my lord i would charge three plus my expenses no more than that john tilted his head to the side regarding justin quizzically why am i getting off so cheaply because justin said i am not doing this for money after this you will owe me a debt my lord a debt i may collect at my pleasure i see johns eyes caught the torchlight above his head giving off a golden glitter after a moment he laughed abruptly since when did you become so crafty de quincy i think youve been passing too much time with me justin was given blankets and he joined the other men bedding down for the night in the great hall he was folding his mantle to use as a pillow when he heard a light step behind him a step he well knew justin claudine was standing only a few feet away acutely aware of the men within earshot she said very low i have too much on my mind to sleep and will be awake very late tonight i expect to be asleep very soon myself good night lady claudine stretching out under the blankets he turned his back on her lying very still until he finally heard the soft rustle in the floor rushes as she withdrew her perfume lingered after shed gone a fragrant ghostly reminder of all hed rather forget his body was treacherously tempted to accept her invitation but he would not yield to the weakness of the flesh not tonight the bedchamber was her battlefield he had no intention of giving her such a tactical advantage he believed her avowal that shed never meant him harm but she was too susceptible to johns inducements nor had she asked the question that would have been foremost in his mind if their positions had been reversed and she had been the one coming from england to join him in paris not once had she asked him about aline chapter january stalbans england justin was sprawled in baldwin and sarras best chair long legs stretched toward the hearth his the boneless easy abandon of youth and baldwin felt a twinge of envy remembering when he too had been able to spend hours in the saddle without suffering cramps and blisters and spasms of the spine the baby cradled in the crook of justins arm was sleeping peacefully and justins own lashes were flickering drowsily with an indulgent smile baldwin watched him fight his sleepiness when hed first realized how often justin would be visiting aline baldwin had been dubious not eager to have a stranger so often under his roof but justin did his best to make his calls as unobtrusive as possible and it could always have been worse it could have been the lady clarice hovering underfoot what happened to that handsome chestnut stallion of yours did you sell him jesu forfend justin said with a smile id sooner give up a body part than i would copper the horse im riding is one i bought in dover ill sell him in southampton ere i take ship for france you do get about baldwin marveled just back from paris and now off to wales and then france again i feel boneweary merely listening to your plans lad me too justin admitted he was dreading this trip into wales so much so that he found himself tempted to confide his fears to baldwin he didnt of course for reticence was a lifetimes habit bred into his bones even before hed become the queens man and the bearer of too many secrets i almost forgot he said i bought a rattle for aline in boulogne it is over there in my saddlebag sit still baldwin instructed lest you awake the little lass ill fetch it rising with a creaking of what he ruefully called his old bones he soon found the rattle straightening up he smiled at the sight that met his eyes for justin had dozed off joining his infant daughter in sleep sarra had also noticed and gently freed the baby from justins grasp returning aline to her cradle picking up a blanket baldwin tucked it around the young mans shoulders and smiled again this time at his wife i think he said this might work out dusk was blurring the last light of day as justin rode across the dee bridge and into the city of chester he stopped first at the castle for he was hoping that the earl would provide him with an armed escort for his foray into wales hed given prince davydd good reason to wish him ill and davydd was not a man to listen to his better instinctsassuming he had any the earls steward remembered justin from past visits and he was made welcome but when justin asked to see the earl the steward had disquieting disappointing news for him the earl of chester was gone from the city gone from the country having crossed over to his estates in normandy and brittany more than a month ago thinking this was not an auspicious beginning to his mission justin sought solace at mollys cottage the shutters were drawn no smoke smudged the sky over the roof and his knocking went unanswered hoping that molly was not off with piers fitz turold the wealthy vintner who was her protector and the suspected source for much of chesters criminal activity justin headed for the dockside tavern owned by fitz turold and run by mollys brother bennet bennet was not there nor was berta the sullen buxom serving maid the man pouring drinks was a stranger to justin a burly scarred redhead with unfriendly eyes and a mouth like a padlock justins questions about bennets whereabouts were met with shrugs suspicion and silence justin was not surprised by the lack of cooperation fitz turold was not known for hiring good samaritans he was brooding over a flagon of wine keeping an eye peeled for bennet when a voice bellowed in his ear by god its bens friend the youth beaming at him was vaguely familiar but it was the salutation justin remembered more than the face algar was one of the tavern regulars a goodnatured lad with a crush on berta and an annoying habit of addressing justin as bens friend for once though justin was glad to see him and he gestured for algar to pull up a stool you always know what is going on around here algar where is bennet and for that matter where is berta berta is home drunker than a peddlers bitch algar said grinning she has been ailing for days with a bad tooth we finally coaxed her into letting the barber pull it but she refused to do it sober and damned near drained one of bens kegs dry all by herself and bennet is that where he is with berta no ben has been away all week molly went off to dunhamonthehill to tend to a friend whose time was nigh and ben went along to keep her safe do you know when theyll be back i suppose algar said it depends upon how fast her friend has the baby justin took advantage of his connection to the earl to get a bed for the night at the castle sleep wouldnt come though hed faced danger before greater danger than he was likely to encounter at davydds court but if he died in wales what would happen to aline she would continue to be cared for the queen and claudine would see to that but who would tell her about her bloodkin her true identity hed lived twenty years before finding out that the bishop of chester was his father all he knew about his mother was her name and hed only learned that a few months ago he did not want aline to travel down that same lonely road the next morning he asked the castle steward for parchment pen and ink he did not have much to bequeath hed drawn up a will that spring leaving his stallion to gunter the blacksmith whod once saved his life and his dog to nells lucy his legacy to aline must be the truth she had the right to know her own history her own heritage and for several hours he labored over a testament trying to anticipate any questions she might have about the father shed never known he then wrote a brief letter to the queen and carefully sealed both documents with borrowed wax for the first time within memory sorry that he did not have a seal of his own no seal no land not even a name that truly belonged to him it had not mattered that much until he had a baby daughter and nothing to leave her but regrets after departing the castle justin rode straight for the bishop of chesters palace on the outskirts of the city he was nervous for encounters with his father were invariably tense waiting for the bishop in the entrance hall he could not help stealing sidelong glances at the chapel for it was there that hed confronted aubrey de quincy and there that his father had denied his paternity until challenged to swear upon his own crucifix he turned at the sound of footsteps saw his father emerging from the stairwell well justin this is a surprise the bishops smile was tentative wary come with me ive given orders to have wine fetched as he followed his father into the great hall it occurred to justin that this was the first time that the bishop had not whisked him out of sight and hearing of any witnesses he must be feeling confident that thered be no scenes justin supposed that in an ironic sort of way this was aubreys declaration of faith as close as he was ever likely to come to acceptance after taking seats near the central hearth they drank their wine in an awkward silence that was broken at last by aubrey the earl of chester told me that youd recovered the ransom i imagine the queen was very pleased with your performance are you are you here on her behalf yes justin said watching closely enough to catch the subtle signs of aubreys relief that this was an official visit i have to go back into wales drawing the sealed letters from his mantle he held them out to his father if you would make sure that these are dispatched to the queens grace i would be very grateful i need you to wait though until you hear that she has returned to england i am sorry i cannot explain why aubrey waved aside his apologies as he accepted the letters there is no need you have information meant for the queens eyes alone i understand the confidential nature of your work he said and there was an approving tone to his voice that justin had rarely heard before apparently the queens favor carried weight even with a bishop thank you my lord justin hesitated taken aback by a sudden mad urge to tell his father the truth to tell him about aline the granddaughter hed likely never see he raised his cup hastily drowning the impulse in a swallow of aubreys spiced hippocras the bishop had reached for his own wine cup but he was not drinking there is something you need to know he said speaking so softly that justin had to lean forward to hear his words i was sorely troubled when you told me lord fitz alan had learned that you were now using the de quincy name yes justin said quietly i remember aubrey was staring down into his wine cup fair brows furrowed i told him that you were a bastard son of my younger brother reynald that would explain not only why youd dared to lay claim to the name but also why id gone to the trouble of placing you in his service i thought it best that you know this since it is likely youll be encountering him at court i see justin did not know what else to say hed not thought much about his fathers kindred for what was the point his father would never acknowledge him never admit him into the de quincy family circle but those ghostly faceless strangers had suddenly become real made flesh and blood by the most simple of spellsthe unexpected use of a given name he had an uncle reynald cousins hed never get to know he started to rise then for their business was done aubrey rose too but he lingered for a moment longer god keep you safe in wales justin thank you justin said surprised lets hope that davydd agrees with the almighty the bishop frowned the queen is sending you back to davydds court is that wise so his father knew of davydds animosity the earl of chester must have been more forthcoming than hed thought i am not eager myself to see davydd again justin conceded but i have no choice as i have an urgent message for the lady emma aubrey blinked and then his face cleared if it is emma you seek then you need not venture into wales at all he said with a smile you can find her in shropshire at her ellesmere manor justin could scarcely credit his great good luck being spared a trip into davydds domains was like getting a reprieve on the very steps of the gallows and ellesmere lay less than twenty miles to the south hed broken his nights fast with only a cup of ale and a piece of bread and he decided that he could treat himself to a full meal before heading into shropshire he reentered the city and had just turned onto fleshmongers lane in search of a cookshop when he heard his name being shouted swinging about in the saddle he saw two familiar figures hurrying toward himthe fishmongers brats whod banded together with a bishops foundling to navigate the shoals of a precarious chester childhood bennet was as tall and thin and supple as a mountain ash he had the gaunt lean look of a man whod often gone to bed hungry that had indeed been true in his hardscrabble youth for he and his older sister molly had been accursed with a downtrodden drudge of a mother whod sadly vanished from their lives and a mean drunkard of a father whod sadly stayed molly was a flower grown amongst weeds as graceful and natural and selfwilled as the grey cat she so doted upon as quick to purr or show her claws shed easily captured justins fourteenyearold heart and five months ago their unexpected reunion had ended up in her bed now as soon as justin dismounted she flung herself into his arms and kissed him with enough enthusiasm to earn a round of cheers from male passersby we got back last night she explained as soon as she had breath for speech and found out this morning that youd been at the tavern well drogo did not remember your name bennet chimed in but he described you as tall and dark and shiftylooking and i said to moll damn me if that does not sound like justins evil twin pay him no mind molly directed linking her arm in justins and drawing him away from the noisome stench coming from the streets center gutter algar was at my cottage ere cockcrow bursting to tell his news and weve been scouring the city for you ever since you gave us such a scare justin for i was sure youd be long gone you almost did miss me molly i ought to have been on the road into shropshire by now but i decided to find a cookshop first molly wrapped her arms around his neck and rose on tiptoe until her mouth was tantalizingly close to his own are you hungry lover she murmured laughing up at him with such overdone innocence that justin rapidly revised his travel plans what difference could one more day make to john like as not the devil had been holding a space for him in hell since he drew his first breath chapter january ellesmere england justins first view of ellesmere was an impressive onea castle perched on a high ridge overlooking a placid lake the scene was peaceful and pastoral deceptively so for this had been a marcher lords stronghold often caught up in the border wars with the welsh and the skirmishes of that unhappy time known as the anarchy when the country had been convulsed by a power struggle so bloody that people had whispered that christ and his saints must surely sleep it was a crown property by the reign of henry ii who had given ellesmere to davydd ab owain as part of emmas marriage portion pleasing davydd nothing would have pleased emma whod been a most unwilling wife to the prince of gwynedd justin prudently chose to scout out the lay of the land before riding into the castle bailey and putting himself in emmas power and he halted in the village even the smallest hamlets usually had an alewife and ellesmeres was a stout fairhaired widow with a booming laugh and shrewd blue eyes upon spying the telltale alestake justin had drawn rein in front of her cottage and purchased a tankard of wellbrewed ale a chunk of newly baked bread and some casual gossip about the lady of the manor lady emma was indeed in residence at the castle the alewife affirmed not surprising justin with the slight emphasis she placed on emmas title it had been his experience that other women did not like emma much if he wanted to see her ladyship though she continued hed best push on toward shrewsbury for that was where she was to be found enriching the town merchants at her lord husbands expense even though it meant another fifteenmile ride justin was pleased to learn that emma was in shrewsbury hed spent the first eight years of his life in that river town and knew it almost as well as he did chester he did not really think emma posed the same danger as her impulsive vengeful husbandshe was much more clever than davyddbut it would not hurt to approach her on more neutral ground than her ellesmere manor reaching shrewsbury at dusk he entered through the north gate this was the only access by land for shrewsbury was situated in a horseshoe bend of the muddy river severn and it was securely guarded by a more formidable castle than ellesmere manned by justins former lord and shropshires sheriff william fitz alan justin was not surprised to learn that emma was not staying at the castle for its accommodations were oldfashioned and emma was particular about her comforts justin guessed that shed be accepting the hospitality of hugh de lacy the abbot of the prosperous benedictine abbey of st peter and st paul located on the outskirts of the town before he continued on to the abbey he used his allpurpose letter from the queendeclaring him to be in her serviceto secure lodgings at shrewsbury castle for himself and his gelding since he had no objection to spending johns money he bought a sturdy horn lantern and then headed out onto the altus vicus shrewsburys high street and major thoroughfare by the time hed reached the bottom of gombestole street the savory aromas wafting from cookshops reminded him that the supper hour was nigh he resisted the temptation to stop though wanting to get his interview with emma done as soon as possible as he hastened down the steep hill of the street called the wyle he found his path blocked by people milling about in the road weaving among them he soon saw the cause of the delay a cart was stuck in the middle of the thoroughfare its wheels mired in mud the carter was in a fury cursing and lashing at his horse a scrawny animal not much larger than a pony this was such a common occurrence that few of the spectators had pity to spare for the beast but justin had always had a fondness for horses and underdogs and the sight of that heaving wheezing animal lathered and bloodied stirred his anger he was shoving his way toward the cart when another man darted from the crowd and grabbed the carters whip as he lifted it to strike again do that and by god ill make you eat it he threatened wrenching the whip from the carters grasp and flinging it aside the carter was sputtering in outrage and the spectators elbowed closer anticipating a fight the newcomer was of only average height several inches shorter than the carter but he was broadchested and wellmuscled and the coiled tension in his stance communicated a willingness to see this through to the bloody end the carter hesitated glancing around for allies not finding any he began fumbling with the knife at his belt it was obvious that he did not really want to unsheathe it but justin knew that pride and the jostling bystanders could prod him into it if the confrontation were allowed to ferment swaggering forward he said loudly in his best luke de marston manner who is the fool blocking the road carts are stacking up like firewood what are you all waiting foreaster you you and you pointing at random to the closest men he directed them to help him free the mired cart and so convincing was his assumption of authority that no one thought to question it the carthorses champion had taken hold of the animals reins coaxing it on as men put their shoulders to the wheels the cart was soon free and he reluctantly turned the reins over to the carter but his grey eyes blazed when the carter started to clamber up into the cart and justin swiftly intervened again pointing out that the hill was a high one and the horse would do better if it did not have to lug the carters weight too the carter scowled and swore under his breath he dared not challenge justins undersheriff imitation though and walked alongside the laboring horse as they started up the wyle you did what you could justin said to the carthorses defender as they stood in the street watching the cart lumber up the hill i suppose the other man shook his head keeping his gaze fixed upon the slowmoving carthorse but you know damned well that lout will waste no time finding another switch true but the last i heard they still hang horse thieves justin said and got a stare in return followed by a quick smile aye so they do the man said conceding that the carthorses fate was beyond his control and then i am morgan bloet justin de quincy falling in step they began walking down the wyle justin judged morgan to be in his early twenties he interested justin because he seemed such a mix of contradictions his given name was welsh but his french was colloquial with no hint of a welsh accent his hair was dark but his skin was fair enough to sport a few freckles his garb was plain but finely woven not homespun he had no sword but when the carter had been groping for his knife justin had seen morgans hand drop instinctively to his left hip where a scabbard would have been worn he looked like a man whod be handy in a brawl but the carthorses plight had moved him almost to tears and most intriguing of all he seemed vaguely familiar to justin even though he felt sure theyd never met before they talked amiably as they passed through the town gate and onto the bridge that linked shrewsbury with the abbey community of st peter and st paul after paying the toll they continued on toward the abbeys gatehouse if you are in need of lodgings morgan cautioned once theyd been waved into the monastery precincts youre out of luck the guest hall is full to bursting mostly with my ladys men mayhap if you tell the monks that youre queasy theyll let you have a bed in the infirmary no not a stomach ailment he corrected himself with a grin for then youd get naught but broth for supper tell them youre feverish morgans jesting was wasted on justin for hed stopped listening at the words my ladys men i heard the lady emma was staying here are you in her service morgan aye i am not for long just since christmas but she says i am the best of her grooms and of course she is quite right that explained morgans empathy for the abused carthorse i am seeking an audience with the lady emma justin said and morgan gave him another quick smile well mayhap youre in luck after all come ill try to get you in he offered so obviously proud of his standing in emmas household that justin was touched in spite of all he knew about the lady emma he followed morgan into the guest hall and watched as the groom approached one of emmas handmaidens on his behalf he was back so soon that justin knew his news could not be good lady mabella says lady emma is dining with abbot hugh so youll have to wait till the morrow lets see if we can talk the hosteller into squeezing you in with the other grooms you there was so much fury in that one word that justin and morgan both spun around in alarm at the sight of the wrathful figure limping toward them justin suppressed a sigh for oliver was no stranger to him the aging norman knight was emmas faithful retainer bodyguard and coconspirator perhaps the one man whom she truly trusted i cannot believe my own eyes that you would dare to show your face after all the grief you caused my lady i know it was very unchivalrous of me to thwart her plans to steal the kings ransom the sarcastic retort hovered on justins lips and he had to bite the words back for emma and johns scheme had not been publicized johns crimes rarely were at the risk of being rude i do not answer to you sir oliver olivers mouth thinned ah yes i know you answer only to the queen but you also answer to the almighty and that day of reckoning may be sooner than you think by now theyd become the center of attention several monks were rapidly approaching and justin decided that a strategic retreat was in order morgan was staring at him but he did not acknowledge their acquaintanceship in front of the furious oliver and justin gave him credit for good sense while avoiding the appearance of haste he exited the hall before the monks could descend upon him outside he paused to consider his options concluding that he had no choice but to return the next day before leaving the monastery he slipped into the great abbey church and offered a prayer at the altar of st winifred or gwenfrewi for hed become fond of the little welsh saint whod died in defense of her honor and then been reborn so long long ago afterward he decided to go back to shrewsbury castle for it was now fully dark and he did not want to be shut out of the town when the gates closed there were still people about all hurrying home before the curfew horn sounded and justin joined the flowing tide of humanity by the time hed retraced his steps to gombestole street the crowd had thinned considerably making his way past a cookshop he remembered he hadnt yet eaten but it was tightly shuttered his steps slowed as he approached the entrance to grope lane for the narrow footpath was a favorite shortcut into the fleshambles chepyn street and the town marketplace he was tempted to take it for the wind was picking up but it was more than a popular haunt for street harlots so many cutthroats lurked there after dark that locals called it ambush alley wisely bypassing this dangerous detour justin continued on wet snowflakes were falling and the street was empty as justin turned onto altus vicus he quickened his pace grateful that he had a meal and bed awaiting him at the castle he knew several of the castle garrison from his years in lord fitz alans service and if memory served there were likely to be a few dice games going after supper a highpitched scream suddenly ripped through the nights quiet justin whirled toward the sound for it seemed to have come from the fleshambles the cry came again and then a womans slight figure stumbled from the darkness she took only a few steps though before collapsing onto the ground justin broke into a run even before he reached the prostrate woman hed flipped back his mantle to give himself swift access to his sword setting his lantern down on the ground he knelt by her side her face was hidden by the hood of her mantle but she moaned as he touched her shoulder youre safe now he assured her are you hurt were you attacked she gasped and clutched at his arm fearfully then began to sob justin was never to know precisely what activated his sixth sense his survival sense had he heard a muffled step an indrawn breath the sudden rush of air as the club swung downward his body reacting before his brain realized his danger he was already moving as his attacker rushed him he flung himself sideways and the blow aimed at his head glanced off his upraised arm there was a sharp spurt of pain but he kept rolling a hulking form loomed over him his lantern light caught a glimpse of bared teeth an unkempt beard and a thick wooden club he kicked out his boot connecting with flesh and bone and the club missed him by inches run he yelled to the woman lurching to his feet and reaching for his sword but his injured arm made him clumsy and his assailant was upon him before the blade could clear its scabbard the mans lips were drawn back in a fierce grin he actually seemed to be enjoying himself justins weapons training came to his rescue though for hed been taught to counter a cut from above with a halfsword thrust as the club was raised to strike he dove under it and rammed his head into his foes belly they both went down the club flying from the mans grip justin managed to get to it first kicking it into the shadows as he succeeded in freeing his sword but he had no time to enjoy his triumph for he was about to get a rude shock the woman had shed her mantle and gown revealing herself to be a man albeit one as thin and puny as a beardless boy he was gripping a fullsized dagger though and justin did not fancy the odds he now faced two to one end this ere someone dies he panted pivoting to keep both men in view you made a bad choice for i have no money weve already been paid the youth jeered and looked offended when his companion cursed his babbling big mouth by now they were deeper in the fleshambles justin could see a black slit off to his right knew it gave entry to grope lane he was close enough to reach it before his adversaries but it was so narrow that hed have no room to use his sword the first knave had reclaimed his club and they were circling wary of his blade but persisting in their attack it was then that a man emerged from the shadows of the alley glanced their way and then ambled over for all the world as if he were taking a midafternoon market stroll the felons gaped at his approach the one with the club recovered first get out of here whilst you still can you stupid son of a whore comments like that are uncalled for the new arrival objected mildly reaching down to pick up justins lantern especially when your own mother rutted with half the swine in shropshire the words were not yet out of his mouth before the lantern was flying through the air pitched with utter accuracy toward his antagonists face the knave threw up his arm to deflect it losing the club as the lantern struck his shoulder and justin lunged forward bringing him down with a slashing cut to the back of his leg the boy abandoned his partner without a qualm spinning around and taking off at a dead run justins new ally had already reached the dropped club and as the outlaw struggled to rise the newcomer struck him with his own weapon the outlaw crumpled twitched and then lay still merciful god justin said softly and got a heartfelt amen in return the lanterns light had been extinguished when it took flight but they were close enough now for recognition stepping back justin regarded morgan bloet in openmouthed amazement i never thought i had a guardian angel of my own but how else can i explain your turning up like this i do not suppose youd believe that i was just passing by no i thought not you are entitled to an explanation and i am willing to offer one but first we ought to decide what we want to do with cain here morgan said nudging the body at his feet with the tip of his boot cain you are not going to tell me that this is a friend of yours not exactly we do work together if that interests you aye i thought it might are you telling me this snake slithered out of emmas den morgan grinned well i doubt i would have put it quite that way but yes you had the dubious pleasure tonight of meeting olivers favorite henchman two of them in fact for cains little helper works as a stable lad at ellesmere it must sound as if we have half the felons in the shire under our roof but i am reasonably certain that these are the only two well i do have my suspicions about one of the cooks for the man cannot even boil water morgan sensed rather than saw justins impatience for the street was too dark for much scrutiny sorry my mama always said id be joking as they put the noose around my neck as i told you ill answer any questions you want provided that you answer one of mine but i do think we ought to get out of here ere the watch blunders by justin knelt and felt for the pulse in cains neck he is still alive mores the pity for i cannot turn him over to the law and i hate to turn him loose on the good people of shrewsbury the hellspawn came very close to killing me actually i do not think that was his intent at least it was not his orders i saw cain trailing after you when you left the abbey and knowing the nasty work he does knowing the nasty piece of goods he is i decided to tag along too thank god you did but why do you think he did not have murder in mind first things first morgan said looking down thoughtfully at cain you are right it does not seem fair to let him off with just a bump on the head and a gashed leg before justin could anticipate what he was about to do he brought his boot down hard upon cains open hand grinding until they heard the crunch of bones breaking there morgan said in satisfaction that ought to slow him up for a while even cain wont be able to wreak his usual havoc onehanded justin was startled by the other mans action but on reflection he could find no fault with it lets go he said and they set off across the empty market square leaving cain for the watch to find justin was intent upon confronting emma as soon as possible and he was moving so rapidly that the shorterlegged morgan was hardpressed to keep up when he complained justin slowed his pace but not by much i want to get to the abbey bridge ere they shut it for the night he explained we can talk as we go what question did you want to ask of me are you really one of the queens men justin confirmed he was wishing he still had his lantern for hed like to have seen morgans reaction to that go on with your story he prompted you followed cain from the abbey what then tinythat is what we call the lad for obvious reasonstiny ran to catch up with him carrying a bundle under his arm i ducked into one of the shuts in time to avoid him seeing me shuts are what they call byways between buildings in shrewsbury i know justin cut in marveling at how morgan seemed able to talk without ever pausing for breath go on they were easy to follow never once looked back when they disappeared into grope lane i waited and then went in after them they were lurking at the mouth of the alley whilst tiny was pulling something over his head i dared not get close enough to see thought he might be putting on a monks habit a womans gown morgan laughed softly clever ill have to remember that if i ever take to crime anyway as they left the alley i heard cain say remember now were not to kill him just to make him wish we had of course that does not mean they could not have gotten carried away with zeal for their work you see cain enjoys painother peoples pain remembering cains wolfish grin justin found that easy to believe what if he finds out you were the one who came to my aid he never got a good look at my face and it was so dark out there he probably could not have recognized his own father assuming he knew who he was needless to say id rather that sir oliver never hears about my part in tonights adventures hell not hear it from me justin promised the sound hed been dreading now reached his earsthe blaring of the horns that signaled the coming of curfew to shrewsbury he came to a halt then for it was too late the town gates were closing his reckoning with emma would have to wait till the morrow youd best come back with me to the castle morgan ill see that you get a bed there for the night but i do have one more question cursing the darkness that cloaked them both so utterly he said why did you go to so much trouble for me mind you i am right glad you did but i do wonder for not many men are so willing to risk their lives for strangers heroes always do morgan protested playfully after theyd walked a few moments in silence he said more seriously it is true i do not know much about you but what i do know i like you did not just look away like the others when you saw that poor nag being beaten on the wyle you laughed at most of my jokes and for certes you are a damned better man than that whoreson cain and his little weasel thank you justin said matching the other mans light tone but one question still lingered in the back of his mind had morgan helped him because hed heard oliver call him the queens man and if so why justin knew he should be grateful that hed escaped the nights attack with so few injuries it was difficult to remember that the next morning though when he awakened stiff sore and scraped he told himself he was lucky that his arm was only badly bruised from wrist to elbow but his rage still smoldered he was boneweary of being a target for godless men and women he was one of the first out of the town gate and bypassed the abbey gatehouse preferring to slip unobtrusively onto the monastery grounds via a wicket that opened into the monks cemetery as he expected oliver was pacing up and down before the main entrance obviously keeping vigil for his missing henchmen and just as obviously alarmed by their continued absence staying out of olivers view justin found a vantage point that overlooked the guest hall and settled down to wait soon after the abbey church bells began to peal for morrow mass emma emerged from the guest hall justin intercepted her as she neared the chapterhouse she stopped abruptly looking genuinely startled but he knew how finely honed her acting skills were we need to talk he said adding my lady with such lethal courtesy that her eyes narrowed dismissing her ladiesinwaiting and other attendants she followed silently as justin led the way onto the small bridge over the millrace and on into the abbey gardens it was a blustery morning the sky clotted with clouds and the gardens looked bleak and forbidding emma tucked her hands inside her mantle to warm them she voiced no complaints and the profile she turned to justin was as delicate and translucent as the finest alabaster and as cold she was in her forties now well past her youth but she was stubbornly fighting a rearguard action against the advancing years and so far she seemed to be holding her own despite the two decades between them justin was not blind to her beauty though he gave her no credit for it thinking uncharitably that any woman blessed with good bones fair skin and enough servants to indulge her every whim could resist the ravages of aging as successfully as emma emma was the first to speak halting before the iceglazed abbey fishponds she said coolly do you know what nemesis means master de quincy as a matter of fact i do lady emma i am also familiar with the term dies irae her lashes lifted unsheathing eyes bluer than sapphires sharper than daggers day of judgment if that is meant as a threat it is rather heavyhanded you seem to have lost your sense of subtlety since we last met master de quincy most likely i mislaid it in the fleshambles when you set your dogs loose on me my lady her fashionably plucked eyebrows rose in perfect arches what in heavens name are you talking about a savage mastiff named cain and his boastful whelp tiny when emma continued to look politely puzzled he said impatiently they are your hirelings eating your bread and taking your orders and it would be easy enough to prove it i am not denying it she protested you may well be right you can hardly expect me to remember the names of all my servants after all but even if these men are mine what of it what are you accusing me of now justin caught a blurred movement and turned to see oliver hovering by the bridge do not be shy sir oliver justin called out loudly come and join us were discussing how dangerous the streets of shrewsbury are becoming and i daresay you have some thoughts on the matter the expression on olivers face would have been amusing under other circumstances for he looked as if hed swallowed his own tongue one glance at the horrified knight was enough for emma stay right there she commanded as he began to back away when justin would have accompanied her she flung up a hand in the imperious manner of one who was a sister and an aunt to kings i do not need your assistance master de quincy justin could have made an issue of it but he didnt emma and oliver conferred together for several moments their heads almost touching and even from a distance he could see the blood rushing up into olivers face and throat emma soon strode back to him and he was struck at once by the difference in her demeanor for her antagonism had been replaced by wariness well she said briskly at least now i understand your lapse in manners i did not tell sir oliver to set those men on you i did not even know you were in shrewsbury sir oliver has been with me for many years since my first marriage in normandy and he is very loyal very protective he ought not to have acted so rashly but fortunately there was no great harm done fortunately justin echoed with as much sarcasm as he could muster and emma gestured toward a bench by the waters edge when she indicated that he could sit beside her he knew that she was more disturbed than shed have him believe queen eleanor often allowed him to sit in her presence but in her veins flowed the princely blood of aquitaine and she felt no need to remind others of her lofty heritage emma the outofwedlock issue of an angevin count and one of his many light o loves clung to her royal prerogatives like a barnacle to a ships hull with a flicker of black humor he wondered how shed respond if he told her he understood her selfdoubts one bastard to another i trust i hope you do not intend to pursue this matter further with oliver she said betraying her discomfort by the rising color in her cheeks for shed had little practice in requesting favors from inferiors he made a mistake but it was done from the best of motives taking justins incredulous silence for assent she allowed a small sigh of relief to escape her lips why are you here i would have thought your royal mistress would be too busy securing richards release to have any time to spare for me what does she want now once justin would have marveled that a shewolf could see herself as the one wronged by the sheep his dealings with john had cured him of that particular naivete i have a letter for you he said and reached for the leather pouch clipped to his belt emmas eyes widened at the sight of the wax seal obviously recognizing it as johns she read in silence her head bent over the parchment when she looked up at justin he thought he could detect curiosity and possibly even relief in her eyes i assume that the queen has an interest in this outcome since you are the bearer of lord johns letter justin regarded her impassively you could assume that emma looked down at the message again you truly do stand high in the queens favor master de quincy if she trusts you with matters of this nature she said and when she glanced up at him it was with a grudging respect the acknowledgment that he was a more significant piece on the chessboard than shed first thought what is your answer my lady will you be returning with me to paris yes she said i will and justin did not know whether to be glad of that rising in a swirl of skirts emma began to pace there is so much to do i suppose if i send to ellesmere straightaway i might be able to leave on the morrow i may be able to buy some of what i need in shrewsbury if i take oliver and lionel and several menatarms she was obviously thinking aloud justins presence forgotten but the mention of olivers name pricked him in a place still sore from the nights attack oliver i do not fancy going on the road with the man responsible for ambushing me she turned in surprise do not be silly it is not as if oliver wielded the club himself she pointed out giving justin an unexpected and unsettling insight into the thought processes of those with power enough to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions emma had promised shed be ready to leave on the morrow and taking her at her word justin showed up as soon as the abbey gate was unbarred the first person he saw was morgan who came hurrying toward him guess what he said barely containing himself until justin had swung from the saddle i am to go with you and my lady to paris she said shed need a man who is good with horses his grin was contagious impossible to resist and justin grinned back ah but are you good with ships morgan dismissed that drawback with an airy wave of his hand if i can drink the swill that passes for wine at the doggepol street tavern i can survive a sea voyage speaking of queasy stomachs sir oliver will not be accompanying us after all it seems he ate something putrid and the poor soul has been sick as a dog all night groaning and moaning and clutching his belly in a truly pitiful manner justin studied morgan thoughtfully did he indeed the groom met his eyes innocently the ghost of his grin still tugging at the corners of his mouth is that all you have to say you are not going to tell me that youll miss old olivers company are you no i am thinking that youd make a bad enemy morgan the other nodded as if hed been given a great compliment aye that i would but i also make a good friend justin nodded too yes you do he agreed readily wishing he could be sure which one morgan was chapter january paris france justins third channel crossing was no less unpleasant than his first two had been by the time their cog had entered barfleur harbor hed decided that sailors were either the bravest men in christendom or the most demented but twelve queasy shipboard hours was only one toll on the costly dangerous and discomforting road to paris never before had he traveled with someone who was the wife of a prince and the aunt of a king and he earnestly hoped that hed never have to do so again emma had insisted upon an entourage her handmaiden mabella her tiny feathery lapdog the young knight lionel who was substituting for the ailing oliver her groom morgan and three menatarms rufus jaspaer and crispin shed insisted too upon transporting their horses across the channel for she was accustomed to riding the wellbred belle her favorite palfrey and was disdainful of the caliber of mounts offered for sale in french ports horses were even less enthusiastic about sea travel than justin was and had to be blindfolded before they could be coaxed onto the gangway once on board they would have to be separated by hurdles and fitted with canvas belly slings to keep them on their feet consequently not all ships masters were willing to accept live cargo and it had taken additional time to find a suitable vessel justin had once been told an amazing story about hannibal an enemy of ancient rome whod somehow gotten elephants over the alps hed never understood what had possessed hannibal to attempt such a mad undertaking until now hannibal and the lady emma were kindred spirits so singleminded in the pursuit of their own interests that nothing else mattered to them and like hannibals unfortunate elephants and emmas hapless horses he was being dragged along against his will feeling as powerless as those poor beasts of burden darkness had descended by the time they reached paris and the city gates were closed for the night fortunately for them john was staying at the temple the sprawling compound of the templars in the barres just east of the baudoyer gate and they had no need to enter the city itself justin was glad for he had no desire to pass the house on the greve where claudine was living with her cousin it was with a vast sense of relief that he escorted emma into the guest hall to be warmly welcomed by john as they disappeared into the stairwell in search of privacy justin sprawled in the closest window seat and too tired even to eat promptly fell asleep he was awakened when john sent a servant down into the hall in search of durand the knight smirked at justin as he headed for the stairs obviously seeing the summons as some sort of victory and as justin slid back into sleep he decided that durand was as deranged as any sailor the next thing he knew durand was looming over him scowling get up de quincy the knight said curtly he wants to see you now john was perched on the edge of a table wine cup in hand emma was seated in a highbacked chair as close as she could get to a charcoal brazier durand was in his favorite position leaning against a wall in a deceptively languid pose utterly motionless except for his eyes justin sat stiffly upon a wooden bench making no attempt to disguise either his wariness or his reluctance to be there john had been more forthcoming than in their earlier meeting telling justin much of what hed already learned from durand he freely acknowledged that arzhela de dinan was his source admitted that constance and the breton court planned to accuse him of plotting richards murder insisted that he was innocent and ignored justins involuntary muttered for once he had yet to hear from the breton he revealed although emma had kindly shared several other ways to contact the celebrated spy justin had never met the breton facetofacefew men hadbut hed learned more about the man since discovering his role as the gobetween in john and emmas scheme to steal richards ransom the breton was a legend at royal courts throughout christendom known for his expertise at surveillance and espionage although it was rumored he had other darker skills for hire the mystery swirling about himnot even his name was known for surewas part of his mystique justin understood why john would seek the bretons aid but he did not understand why hed been summoned to johns presence or why the queens son was suddenly being so candid why did he have to know all this lady arzhela has sent me a second letter john continued in which she confides she means to find out more about this plot i advised her against this warning her that it might be dangerous but she is not likely to listen to me lord knows she never did john allowed with a faint nostalgic smile that made justin wonder about the nature of his past involvement with arzhela expressing concern for her safety john actually sounded sincere lady arzhela is a remarkable woman john said still in that mellow reminiscing tone she has many admirable qualities but caution is not one of them she makes a habit of jumping from the fry pan into the fire and never even notices the heat she needs looking after in other words fortunately he added with a mocking glance at durand i have someone in mind sir durand is going to escort lady emma to laval and then continue on into brittany to confer with lady arzhela to find out what she has been able to discover and keep her out of harms way i wish him well justin said starting to rise if that is all my lord he did not really expect to make his escape so easily and was not surprised when john waved him back onto the bench he still did not know what was coming only that hed not like it do you not want to know why lady emma is going to laval my real reason for needing to talk to her justin had rarely heard a question so fraught with peril and he slowly shook his head john grinned you need not feign indifference with me de quincy i know youre afire with curiosity lady arzhela gave me the names of the men involved in constances scheme one of them happens to be emmas son guy it occurred to me that the lad could use some maternal counsel and lady emma is in agreement with me about that emma narrowed her eyes murmuring something under her breath too softly for justin to hear her expression did not bode well for guy though justin knew that emma had been wed to a norman lord guy de laval and that after she was widowed her brother king henry had compelled her to marry the welsh prince davydd ab owain twenty years later that was still a festering grievance with her and since henry was beyond earthly retribution shed passed on her rancor to the next generation to his son richard justin cast her a speculative glance wondering about the source of her discontent was she angry with guy for involving himself in such highstakes intrigue or for doing it without consulting her beforehand so john said now you know it all get a good nights sleep de quincy for youll be leaving on the morrow he saw justins sharp look and said smoothly i forgot to mention that did i lady emma wants you to accompany her justin suffered a sudden crick in his neck so hastily did he swing around to stare at emma good god why i ought to be the last man whose company you crave very amusing master de quincy emma said not sounding amused at all i may not like you but youve proven yourself to be quickwitted intrepid and in your own infuriating way honorable i prefer to put my trust in a man i know the queens man she concluded coolly with a dismissive glance toward the man she did not know her nephews man durand said nothing but even his vaunted selfcontrol could not prevent the surge of angry color that rose in his face and throat justin took a moment to enjoy the other mans discomfiture and then did something hed never expected to dooffer up praise for durand de curzon i know sir durand does not always make a favorable first impression i can vouch for him though my lady he wields a sword with deadly skill and few men are as comfortable dealing with the lawless and the ungodly john chuckled into his wine cup and durand glowered at justin but emma merely shrugged i did not mean to disparage sir durand she said with an indifference more wounding than simple contempt but i will feel more comfortable if master de quincy escorts us the tone of her voice made it obvious that she considered the matter closed rising to her feet she said i assume quarters have been prepared for us john i will leave you then and retire for the night waiting until john summoned a candlebearing servant she swept from the chamber in a departure as queenly as any eleanor herself could have made there was a long and heavy silence after emma had gone well aware that justins eyes were boring into his back john turned reluctantly to face him i know he said before justin could speak i know i owe you de quincy so too justin thought unhappily did the queens grace justin awoke the next morning in a grim mood he was not sure which he minded more being sucked deeper into johns quagmire or facing another fortnight of catering to the lady emmas aristocratic whims the only consolation he could take from his plight was the realization that durand was in an equally dark frame of mind even the cheerful irrepressible morgan was downhearted disappointed that theyd be leaving paris so soon but the atmosphere in the guest hall changed although not for the better with emmas entrance the lady mabella was ailing she announced burning with fever and as feeble as any newborn her handmaiden had been feeling poorly since they landed at barfleur justin had gotten the impression from morgan and the menatarms that mabella was always complaining about one malady or another that her illness was genuine now none could doubt emma was not one for coddling those in her service their journey would have to be delayed until mabella was well enough to travel emma declared for she could not do without a handmaiden nor could she leave mabella to languish in the templars care for they were knights not nursemaids no she insisted overriding johns objections with an impatient wave of her hand they would just have to wait that pleased no one except morgan who brightened at the prospect of getting to explore paris after all durand was in favor of setting out anyway arguing that mabella could recuperate at the hoteldieu which was said to be the finest hospital in paris and adding snidely that he had every confidence that the lady emma would be able to brush and braid her own hair and buckle her own shoes emma retorted scornfully that she would never consider leaving a gently born lady in a public hospital nor did she care to debate the matter with one of lord johns hirelings listening morosely from a window seat justin fantasized about slipping away while they were squabbling and riding for the coast as if the devil were on his tail it was john who put an end to the quarreling and came up with a feasible solution to their dilemma he would send to the lady petronilla he stated in a voice that brooked no further arguments and ask her if she could spare one of her maids to attend lady emma at the same time requesting her hospitality for the stricken mabella as he was shrewd enough to mention both emmas rank as a princess and her bloodties to the english royal house in his message none doubted that petronilla would be more than happy to comply and indeed she responded with alacrity arriving at the temple in less than an hours time creating quite a stir with an escort that the french king would not have spurned a richly accoutred horse litter for mabella a pretty darkeyed young girl named ivetta for emma and her beautiful cousin claudine petronilla was flirting with john durand was sulking mabella had been taken away in the horse litter to convalesce as petronillas houseguest claudine and emma were making polite desultory conversation and justin was doing his best to keep the length of the hall between claudine and himself but then john joined emma and claudine and beckoned both durand and justin to his side compelled by courtesy to acknowledge claudines presence justin greeted her with the averted eyes and rigid demeanor of a monk finding himself in close proximity to eve durand however played the courtiers role with his usual panache snatching up claudines hand and kissing it with a lovers intimacy she murmured sir durand with what passed for a smile but as soon as shed freed her hand from his grasp she wiped it against the skirt of her gown her insult could only have been more overt had she spat in his face and durand drew a breath as sharp as any sword justin looked away to hide a smile remembering that claudines loathing of durand was one of her more endearing attributes emma had noticed this byplay but ignored it since neither claudine nor durand were of any interest to her i am beholden to you and your cousin lady claudine your kindness will not be forgotten her expression of gratitude was gracefully rendered if somewhat formulaic in tone and she inclined her head graciously obviously expecting equally polished banalities in return but claudine had grown tired of trading polite platitudes and she chose that moment to reveal her real reason for accompanying petronilla to the temple it was our pleasure lady emma i think you will be pleased with ivetta my cousin says she is very skillful at styling hair i regret to say that she is not as wellborn as your lady mabella though not truly suitable as a companion for a lady of your stature emma accepted the compliment with a bored smile well since i must make do with your ivetta did lord john tell you that i am one of the gentlewomen in attendance upon queen eleanor since you are my lady queens sister by marriage i cannot in good conscience allow you to be treated with less than your just due i am suggesting therefore that i accompany you as i have so often accompanied my queen there was an abrupt silence emma looked dubious john amused and durand and justin appalled no they both cried out in unison in what was the first and probably the only moment in which they were in such utter and perfect accord emmas finely arched brows rose even higher i do believe that sir durand and master de quincy would rather you do not come with us lady claudine her gaze moved from claudine to the men back to the girl again and then she smiled a smile that was almost feline in its detachment its charm and its silky malice my dear i am delighted to accept your kind offer justin and durand were speechless but john was no longer able to stifle his mirth when i draw my last breath he said his voice husky with laughter i daresay i will have many regrets and one of them is sure to be that i had to miss this pilgrimage to hell and back chapter january laval maine as laval came into view emma drew rein her face was impassive as she gazed upon her late husbands lands but claudine noticed the shadow of a smile in the corners of her mouth it must feel good to be home she said softly emma gave her a look of surprise and then nodded justin observed their quiet exchange with a sense of unease for hed not expected this to happen women did not like emma and she did not seem to like them again and again hed seen evidence of that he never imagined that this odd alliance would develop between emma and claudine he was not even sure if alliance was the right word but by the time theyd reached laval the two women had obviously reached some sort of understanding and he was not at all comfortable with their unlikely rapport he was not happy either with what they found at laval emmas son guy was absent and no one seemed to know where he had gone his steward thought he might be in rennes and justin and durand wanted to forge ahead into brittany arguing that they could look for guy at the same time that they sought arzhela but emma wanted to wait at laval for her son to return after much acrimonious bickering she agreed to continue on to rennes although she flatly refused to depart on the morrow and so the next day found them still at laval glumly watching emma entertain a steady stream of neighbors as word spread of her return justin was bored and restless until a chance conversation with the abbot of clermont set his temper ablaze stalking away in anger he went to look for durand he found the knight in a window seat with emmas borrowed maid ivetta murmuring in the girls ear and making her blush prettily and giggle behind her hand meet me in the village tavern justin said tersely turning on his heel before durand could object the castle at laval had loomed over the river mayenne for almost two hundred years a village nesting in its shelter justin knew there would be at least one tavern and located it in an alley off the market square it was crowded for laval was on the main road from paris to brittany and locals vied with merchants pilgrims and roughhewn mercenaries for the attention of the harried serving maids and a bevy of perfumed and rouged prostitutes justin got himself a drink and eventually laid claim to a newly vacant table where he settled down to await durand he soon spied a familiar face morgan smiled in recognition and meandered over to join him who are you hiding from justin lady emma or lady claudine both of them justin admitted with a wry smile for when hed not been dealing with emmas complaints and demands on their journey hed been avoiding claudines overtures nothing explicit claudine was too worldly for that a sidelong smile that liberated her dimples a flutter of long silky lashes a sudden smoky glance from dark doe eyes justin had not been sleeping well at night she is a beautiful woman the lady claudine morgan observed blandly when justin merely shrugged he took the hint and began enthusing about the fine quality of the horses hed found in lord guy de lavals stables he was telling justin about a jewel of a roan mare when one of the prostitutes sauntered over i am called honorine she announced without preamble and if you seek value for your money you need look no further justin was amused both by her bluntness and her name whores usually chose fancy names like christelle or mirabelle or the everpopular eve this girl had a sense of humor for honorine was a form of honoria a derivative of the latin word for honor instead of giving a flat refusal therefore he offered her a friendly smile and a diplomatic mayhap later morgan looked offended when honorine drifted away without propositioning him too well damnation did i become invisible of a sudden what do you have that i lack de quincy a sword justin suggested recognizing a golden opportunity when he saw one a chance to tease morgan while at the same time engaging him in a discreet interrogation morgan shot him a look of such exaggerated indignation that he had to laugh no you dolt not that sword this one he said slapping the scabbard at his hip a girl in her trade looks for evidence that a man can afford her services and a sword is usually a good indication that he can he paused before adding casually it would not hurt to have another armed man along can you wield a sword morgan me morgan sounded surprised now how would a stable groom learn a skill like that how indeed justin thought remembering morgans instinctive movement during his confrontation with the carter in shrewsburys wyle he liked morgan he also owed morgan a huge debt he was just not sure he could trust morgan but before he could continue with his indirect inquiry the door swung open and durand strode into the tavern i want to talk to you he said brusquely to justin and then looked pointedly at morgan who got to his feet although without any haste making a comic grimace behind durands back the groom strolled off and durand claimed his seat do not summon me like that again de quincy i do not like it his anger notwithstanding he still remembered to keep his voice pitched low so did justin and of course i live to please you stop your posturing durand and hear me out i had an interesting conversation this eve with the abbot of clermont abbey hed been in paris recently and was well versed in the doings at the french court it seems that whilst i was chasing around shropshire like a fool the french king and lord john were making one last attempt to foil king richards release they dispatched messengers to the roman emperors court offering him a variety of bribes to delay richards release if richard were held until this coming michaelmas theyd pay heinrich eighty thousand marks or theyd pay him a thousand pounds a month for as long as he kept richard in captivity or theyd give him one hundred fifty thousand marks if hed either hold richard for another full year or turn richard over to them durand showed no reaction what of it you are not going to tell me that you were disappointed by this i hope if you are still harboring illusions about johns conscience or his i am not justin said through gritted teeth what i want to know is when you planned to tell me about this id have gotten around to it eventually i sent word to those who matter justin started to push back from the table but durand moved faster intercepting a passing serving maid and ordering a flagon and two cups if it will stop your complaining ill buy the drinks he declared magnanimously and justin reluctantly retook his seat for a time they actually managed to conduct a civil conversation discussing guy de lavals likely whereabouts and how much trust they ought to place in emma not much they agreed it occurred to justin that the most trustworthy of his traveling companions was probably emmas pampered little lapdog but he refrained from sharing this thought with durand durand reached for the flagon and poured the last of the wine into his cup justins was still half full i do not suppose well be getting an early start on the morrow her ladyship will be lying abed till noon if left to her own devices im beginning to have some sympathy for you de quincy how did you ever survive a summer in wales with the lady emma justin was taken aback for durand had sounded almost friendly but when the other man smiled he went on the alert for hed seen that smile in the pastjust before durand pounced to prove my goodwill de quincy i am going to offer some advice of the heart ill not deny it has been amusing watching claudine stalk you like a vixen closing in on an unwary rabbit but for christs sake man enough is enough if you do not bed her soon shes likely to start casting her pearls before swine he drawled aiming a significant look across the tavern where morgan was flirting with one of the serving maids justin knew he was being goaded durand had used claudine as bait before he also knew that what he was about to do was childish he did not care as he got to his feet he reached for his cup as if to finish it and overturned it in durands lap durand was catquick though and twisted sideways to avoid most of the liquid but enough of the wine splashed onto his mantle to satisfy justin sorry he said cheerfully how could i have been so clumsy durand had the palesky eyes of a viking like most normans he had his share of norse blood as justin gazed into their glittering bluewhite depths he was reminded that ice could burn heads were turning in their direction theyd attracted the attention of the burly tavern owner who started to lumber over a woman with flaxen hair was quicker though moving to justins side she said with the aplomb of one accustomed to diverting tavern brawlers you said later sweet well later is now if you come abovestairs with me ill make it worth your while before justin could respond durands hand shot out catching honorines wrist make it worth my while love she gave durand a practiced appraisal liked what she saw and let him pull her down onto his lap giving justin a you missed your chance smile durand too was smiling now his a victors smile but justin did not begrudge him the prize leaning over he murmured in honorines ear he is rich lass make him pay dear for it they headed west on the morrow expecting to find arzhela with the lady constance at rennes their first stop was the castle of vitre where emma insisted upon accepting the hospitality of its lord andre de vitre much to the annoyance of both justin and durand for theyd covered only twelve miles but they were in for a pleasant surprise they were not lord andres only guests he was proudly playing host to his duchess too lord andre escorted emma and claudine across the great hall to present them to duchess constance justin and durand were trailing behind not being of sufficient importance to warrant an introduction justin was curious to see the duchess for if anyone could block johns march to the throne it would be constance hed cast her in the same mold as queen eleanor a woman about whom legends were spun and his first glimpse was disappointing unlike the english queen constance was no great beauty she was a smallboned almost painfully slender woman in her thirties petite and surprisingly fragile in appearance her hair was covered by a veil and wimple but it was not likely that her coloring was fashionably fair for her eyes were dark if she were not so richly dressed in brocaded silk and an erminelined pelisse justin thought strangers might have guessed emma or even claudine to be the breton duchess as he got closer though justin changed his opinion constance radiated energy and authority there was an intensity about her that put him in mind of a highstrung and highborn mare but he frowned when durand murmured that she was a filly to give a man a wild ride for he did not like finding out that his thoughts and durands could overlap like that lord andre had ushered emma and claudine toward the duchess and they were making graceful curtsies but no one was expecting what happened next constance gave the women a cold scornful stare and turned away without saying a word claudine looked stunned emma outraged and lord andre flustered the snub had not gone unnoticed and a buzz swept the hall did you see durand jabbed justin with his elbow ive seen street beggars get warmer receptions than that justin was equally baffled emma had been living in wales for nigh on twenty years so how likely was it that shed offended a thirteenyearold constance so grievously that she was nursing a grudge two decades later it makes no sense i know that claudine has never met constance and i doubt that emma has either use your eyes man durand said impatiently if you were born a duck would you have any liking for swans that seemed too simple a solution to justin before he could express his doubts however a low throaty chuckle sounded behind them ive never understood how men can know so much about war and statecraft and the natural laws of almighty god but be so damnably stupid about women they spun around to confront a stranger tall enough to laugh up at them without having to tilt her head stylishly flatchested lithe and limber glowing with good health and good humor she had a determined chin pale skin gilded with golden freckles a wide mobile mouth shaped for smiles and eyes the sultry caressing color of a summer sea the duchess is too clever to be so petty too ambitious to be so vain you think there was a man ever born whod trade power for white teeth and muscles the lot of you would gladly look like misbegotten dwarves if only you could be crowned dwarves whatever makes you think that women do not have the same hungers justin and durand exchanged quizzical glances suppose you tell us then durand challenged why the duchess was so rude to the lady emma if it has naught to do with mirrors and vainglory it had nothing to do with lady emmas pretty face and everything to do with the blood that flows in her veins the duchess would sooner embrace the devils daughter than a kinswoman of eleanor richard and john the last i heard durand objected duchess constance is their kinswoman too by marriage not by choice she has good reason to resent the angevins king henry dethroned her father and married her off to his son geoffrey then after geoffreys death richard forced her to wed the earl of chester who was all of fifteen at the time and thus more than ten years her junior and i doubt that the happy couple have exchanged a civil word since justin was startled into laughter taken aback by such brash candor are you always so fiercely outspoken lady arzhela she grinned alas i have been cursed since childhood with a runaway tongue master de quincy her gaze flicked from justin to durand but the knights face was inscrutable she could not tell if hed guessed her identity as justin had i had the advantage of you she acknowledged for i needed only to pick you out amongst the lady emmas men whereas you could not even be certain that i was in attendance upon the duchess it helped too that our mutual friend sent me such a good description of you both you sir durand he said looked like a pirate in search of a wench to ravish and you master de quincy like a young man accursed with a conscience she grinned again as gleefully as a little girl and justin could not help responding to her warmth her utter lack of pretense she was not at all as he had imagined her to be when he glanced around the hall to make sure they were attracting no attention she smiled reassuringly none will think it strange that we are together im known to have an eye for a wellformed male and people will assume were flirting clearly we cannot talk seriously here id wanted to point out my likeliest suspect but he has suddenly disappeared justin and durand traded looks again and who would this suspect be meet me in the gardens on the morrow she said and i might tell you she winked and glided away before they could stop her durand was scowling the fool woman thinks this is a game he said justin said nothing he was troubled too by arzhelas insouciance but he saw no reason to admit that to durand if they were choosing sides he was on arzhelas they found arzhela in the gardens the next day holding out her fists to an urchin the boy was very young with a round face streaked with dirt an untidy cap of curly hair and muchmended clothes which identified him as a servants child he hesitated and then chose a hand arzhela opened it to reveal an empty palm he swiftly pointed to her other hand and his eyes opened wide when it too was empty he burst into giggles though when arzhela found the missing coin behind his ear she flipped the coin to the boy and he caught it deftly running off as justin and durand approached with fingers that nimble youd have made a fine cutpurse lady arzhela justin observed as they drew near and she glanced over her shoulder smiling a conjurers trick but it never fails to amaze the little ones johnny taught me he always did have a gift for sleight of hand it was a moment before the men realized that her johnny and their lord john were one and the same they digested this startling fact in silence following as she beckoned them farther into the gardens in summer it would be a small eden but now it was barren and desolate the ground frozen trees naked to the wind arzhela led the way to an arbor that would be lushly canopied in honeysuckle vines in another six months till then though the latticework was skeletal open to the pale winter sky feeling equally exposed the men joined her upon a narrow wooden bench noticing their unease she gave an exaggerated sigh the two of you are as jumpy as treed cats as i told you last night no one will think twice about seeing me with a couple of handsome men you seem to think this is one great joke lady arzhela durand said sternly you need to remember how much is at stake arzhela refrained from rolling her eyes but made her attitude quite clear by batting her lashes and simpering yes sir durand with mock docility although he did not look happy he showed he knew when to push and when to back off by saying nothing once she was sure shed made her point arzhela leaned over and picked up a stick smoothing the ground in front of the bench with her foot she drew a circle in the dirt think of this circle as the conspiracy against johnny i made it so large because we have to fit quite a few people into it my cousin constance andre de vitre the bishops of stmalo and rennes raoul de fougeres alain and pierre de dinan geoffroi de chateaubriant canon robert of st etiennes at toulouse guy de laval and hugh de gournay and most likely others whose names i have not yet learned arzhela paused looking pleased with herself you were right master de quincy justin i could have been a good cutpurse but id have made an even better spy gesturing toward her scrawled circle she continued id not call it a conspiracy though in the strictest sense of the word for some of the men i named seem to believe that the letter is genuine that johnny was truly plotting to murder his brother and your cousin constance justin asked carefully does she believe that arzhela hesitated i am not sure she admitted i think constance and most of the men were more than willing to ignore any doubts they wanted to believe in the validity of the letter you see her smile was rueful and johnnys history made that so easy for them but we know the letter was forged durand was regarding arzhela reflectively so if constance did not forge it who did where did she get it from the aforementioned canon of toulouse he is too clever by half that one he gives the impression of being forthcoming and affable yet when you try to pin him down he slithers away as slick as you please i have always read men as easily as a monk reads his psalter arzhela boasted with what she felt was pardonable pride and my reading of canon robert tells me that he has the answers we seek justin felt a twinge of disappointment he agreed that canon robert was a natural suspect but hed hoped that arzhela would have more to offer than intuition durand seemed to share his disappointment for he asked if that was all she had well i did coax a confession from him did i forget to mention that arzhelas sarcasm was goodnatured when canon robert is revealed to be as guilty as cain i shall expect apologies from the pair of you is he the one who vanished from the great hall last night my lady she nodded he fled the hall like a man pursued by demons slipping out a servants entrance and if that is not cause for suspicion what is when i looked for him today he was nowhere to be found i eventually learned that hed taken to his bed claiming to be ailing neither justin nor durand thought that sounded particularly damning but justin was tactful enough to keep his doubts to himself durand was not before he could further irritate arzhela by expressing his skepticism though they were interrupted by the arrival of a newcomer to the garden he was tall and blond and stylishly dressed in the newest fashionan unbelted sleeveless tabard visible because hed draped his mantle casually around his shoulders in defiance of the winter weather durand stared at the tabard like a man mentally making notes for his tailor but justin took more notice of the milkyopaque toadstone that the stranger wore prominently on his mantle for toadstones were used as a protection against poisons there was something about his demeanorthe jut of his chin the swagger in his stepthat made it easy for justin to believe this man did not lack for enemies there you are lady arzhela he sounded aggrieved as if shed deliberately disappeared and when he bent over her hand he put justin more in mind of a man marking a brand than bestowing a kiss arzhela had already shown them that she did not suffer fools gladly but she was regarding the youth with an indulgent smile introducing him fondly as simon de lusignan a name that resonated harshly with both justin and durand the de lusignans were a powerful clan ensconced in the hills of queen eleanors poitou blessed with high birth and cursed with hungers beyond satisfying their family tree had produced more than its share of adventurers rebels and brigands if several had managed to lay claims to distant crowns far more had cheated the hangman and it was a common belief that if there was trouble to be found a de lusignan was likely to be in the very midst of it this de lusignan acknowledged the introductions with a terseness that bordered upon outright rudeness and insisted upon escorting arzhela indoors durand and justin stood watching them go she does like them young durand commented after a long silence from sheer force of habit justin started to object but he could not really fault the other mans cynical observation arzhela was in her late thirties and simon looked to be barely beyond his majority moreover now that he thought about it he realized that she was at least ten years older than john too john and one of the de lusignans passing strange that a woman with so much mother wit should have such bad taste in men ive heard the gossip about the de lusignans justin said thoughtfully those tales told over a wine flagon that grow worse with each telling how they feud with their neighbors and prey upon travelers and dare to defy both church and crown you think it is coincidence that one of their lot has shown up at the duchess constances court that same thought crossed my mind durand admitted god smite them de lusignans take to conspiracies like pigs to mud but why would constance and her breton barons confide in a stripling like simon no id say he is arzhelas stud no more than that justin was inclined to agree he still had a suspicion though that arzhela was not being completely honest with them ite missa est with those words the mass was ended and the castle chapel began to empty justin was one of the last to leave as he stepped out into the wan sunlight he heard his name hissed and turned to see arzhela beckoning imperiously to him hurry she insisted pulling him in the direction of the stables as soon as theyd passed into the gloomy shadows of the barn she thrust a bundle at him here she said put this on i have had an inspired idea know how to get you in to see our reclusive canon justin unwrapped a mans tunic of coarse kersey wool the undyed murky shade known as hodden grey of such shabby quality that most servants would have balked at wearing it ignoring his questions arzhela was already tugging at his mantle make haste she urged better we do this whilst father herve is still busy in the chapel she was not to be denied and justin pulled the garment over his head hoping it was not as fleainfested as it looked as soon as he unbuckled his scabbard arzhela placed it on top of his folded mantle and instructed a wideeyed young groom to guard it well the youth vowed that he would and justin did not doubt it he was learning that arzhela was one for getting her own way returning to the castle bailey he followed her toward the kitchens where a platter with soup bread and wine was waiting for them trying to keep the soup from slopping out of the bowl he hastened to keep pace with her as they headed toward a corner tower as they walked she finally deigned to offer an explanation for the masquerade canon robert is still keeping to his bed but ive come up with a clever way for you to get a look at him father herve offered to share his own chamber as a courtesy and i am about to pay a sickbed visit to our ailing canon whilst i ply him with flattery and onion soup you can study him to your hearts content she concluded triumphantly a pity i could not think how to get durand in with you but hed not have made a convincing servant but i would justin said dryly arzhelas grin showed she was not as oblivious as her words might indicate dear heart you are a spy after all so it is to the good that you can blend into the background when needed by now theyd climbed the narrow stairs to the chaplains topfloor chamber arzhela rapped sharply on the door and then without waiting for a response barged in the lone occupant whirled away from the window in surprise he was fully dressed wearing the white rochet common to clerics justin was not surprised that he was garbed in such fine linen for unlike their monastic brethren canons took no vows of poverty he was tonsured and cleanshaven with features that were attractive but not memorable he looked exactly like what he claimed to bea man of god who was also at home in the secular world but he did not look like a man too ill to rise from his sickbed canon robert arzhela purred how wonderful to see you up and about if i may say so you seem in the very bloom of health dare i hope that youll honor us with your presence at dinner this day alas my lady i fear not lord andres physician advised me to walk for brief periods lest i become too weak lying abed the canon seated himself upon the bed relieved by his illness of the demands of courtesy and regarded them calmly what may i do for you lady arzhela nay canon robert she said sweetly what may i do for you with a flourish she gestured toward justin standing inconspicuously behind her as any welltrained servant would ive brought you some soup very good for catarrh or a queasy stomach and wine good for almost any ailment as the canon thanked her profusely for her kindness justin set his burden upon a coffer by the bed while he welcomed this opportunity to scrutinize canon robert he was not sure how much could be learned in such a brief encounter the man was as urbane and polished as would be expected of one who served a bishop not the sort to blurt out indiscretions if caught off guard it seemed most likely that he was what he appeared to bea conduit a messenger he might even believe that the letter was genuine arzhelas attempts to engage the canon in conversation had been unsuccessful his responses were polite but so increasingly wan that she at last conceded defeat and bade him farewell once she and justin were out in the stairwell she said sarcastically i feared that if i stayed any longer he was going to swoon dead away did you notice how halting his speech became as if the poor soul did not even have the strength to finish a sentence how does he explain his possession of the letter he claims it was entrusted to him by the archdeacon of toulouse whilst hinting that the archdeacon was acting upon bishop fulcrands behalf emerging again into the bailey they headed back to the stables to retrieve justins belongings arzhela speculating all the while about canon roberts reasons for keeping out of sight all i can think is that he recognized you or durand you are the queens man after all and durand serves johnny trust me my lady i am not so wellknown that a canon from toulouse would have heard of me justin could see that arzhela was not convinced loath to surrender her suspicions and he did not argue further instead he told her that lady emma had gotten word that morn of her sons return to laval she insists that we leave for laval on the morrow for she is eager to speak to her son as soon as possible arzhela was not pleased by that but admitted that they had no choice shed met the lady emma well you must return to vitre straightaway once youve questioned her son whilst you are gone i will see what else i can discover who knows i might have solved the mystery by the time you get back she teased but justin did not share her amusement lady arzhela i urge you to keep your distance until we return at first i saw nothing suspect about canon robert but as we made ready to leave i caught something odd he was staring intently at me my lady or to be more precise at my boots arzhela followed his eyes gazing down at the cowhide boots protruding from the hem of his threadbare woolen garment she was quickwitted understanding the significance at once of course no servant would have boots of such good leather so he knows you are not who you pretended to be justin nodded more than that my lady canons are rarely if ever men of humble birth he ought not to have even glanced at me for men of rank do not pay heed to those who serve them but he did pay heed to me and i wonder why is that not obvious the man has something to hide be that as it may will you promise me that youll do nothing rash until we return arzhela frowned and sighed and argued justin persevered though until she reluctantly agreed to take no further action but his relief was tempered by a few lingering misgivings for he understood now why john had been alarmed on her behalf chapter february laval maine guy de lavals years were twenty and four but he looked younger than that he was pleasing enough to the eye with flaxen hair and the easy smile of one whod never gone hungry or questioned the good fortune that had been his from birth from his father hed inherited the barony of laval from his mother the blood of the royal house of england and a taste for intrigue but he had none of emmas steely resolve her coolness under fire or her gamblers nerves i i know naught of this letter he stammered truly i do not gaining confidence when no one contradicted him he mustered up the sunlit smile that had long been the coin of his realm able to buy whatever favors his lordship did not but his genial shallow charm was wasted upon this particular audience durand and justin eyed him skeptically with none of the deference hed come to expect as his just due nor did his lady mother appear impressed by his declaration of innocence shed not been a physical presence in his life for theyd been parted when he was only four and hed seen her but rarely since her marriage to a welsh prince he remembered a woman of heartbreaking beauty as ethereal as one of gods own angels memories of gossamer and magic nurtured by his imagination and her absence he was both awed and intimidated by the fleshandblood emma now standing before him a handsome woman in her forties who was regarding him with very little maternal solicitude we know that youre in this muck up to your neck durand said brusquely and guy started to bridle his pride demanded as much although in truth he was even more intimidated by durand than he was by this stranger his mother i told you to let me handle this emma said aiming her rebuke at durand but keeping her eyes upon her son all the while guy do not waste your breath and my time in false denials use the meager common sense that god gave you would i be here if your youthful folly had not been exposed her scorn stung i do not see it as folly to oblige great lords to be a kingmaker as soon as the words were out of his mouth guy realized how easily hed fallen into his mothers trap and his fair skin mottled with hot color his confession hung in the air like wood smoke impossible to ignore well i for one am impressed durand drawled you held out for four whole heartbeats mayhap even five at least he dared to gamble for the highest stakes justin objected picking up his cue as if the gambit had been rehearsed between them how many men have the courage to risk offending a king guys flush had darkened at durands gibe but now he swung around to stare at justin john is not my king he said indignantly i am not disloyal to my liege lord justin shook his head regretfully the french king might well think otherwise guy frowned an expression of defiance undercut by his darting anxious eyes all know he is no true friend to john theirs is an alliance of expediency one held together by cobwebs and spit why should he care what befalls john you do not know about their latest pact justin feigned surprise beginning to enjoy the playacting lord john and king philippe struck a devils bargain soon after christmas in return for philippes continued support against richard john agreed to cede to philippe all of normandy northeast of the river seine save only rouen and to yield to the french a number of strategic border castles it is now very much in philippes interest that john become englands next king how do you think hell react once he learns that his liege man the lord of laval is conniving to put a breton child on the english throne i i did not know about this guy was stammering again i was told that john and philippe were at odds each blaming the other for his failure to keep richard imprisoned they were emma interrupted but their mutual fear of richard is far stronger than their petty vanities you ought to have known that guy and you would have if youd given this scheme some serious thought why in heavens name did you not consult with me first for a moment justin thought emma was making an oddly timed jest but when he glanced toward her he saw that she was in deadly earnest the expression upon durands face mirrored his own astonishment guy looked no less nonplussed madame mother i do not need your permission to enter into a conspiracy he said and as ludicrous as his words were he managed to invest them with a doleful sort of dignity well you should emma snapped confirming all justins suspicions about her utter lack of humor id have made sure that this foolishness ended then and there why was it so foolish realizing how feeble his protest sounded guy cleared his throat and said with more conviction if constances little lad becomes king shell not forget the men who stood by her side neither will john how can i make you understand how badly youve blundered emma glared at her son constance and arthur versus eleanor and john do you truly see those scales as balanced you might as well wager that a rabbit will devour a wolf guy had never learned how to hold his own against a stronger more forceful personality his surrender was abrupt total and abject slumping down upon the nearest seat a rickety wooden bench he muttered oh god john knows about me doesnt he what can i do emma sat beside him on the bench you can tell us all you know about this plot guy did haltingly keeping his gaze locked upon the floor rushes at his feet his the mournful demeanor of a sinner seeking absolution he described the december meeting in the pirate citadel of stmalo the dramatic revelation of the letters existence and the gleeful reaction of the breton lords they questioned him closely about canon robert of toulouse but he claimed to know little about the man nor did he know who was the master puppeteer in this political puppet show he did not think duchess constance was the instigator since he was not one of her confidants though that was merely an opinion not actual evidence so far what hed told them was not particularly helpful but then he said almost as an afterthought i think some of the breton lords truly believed that the letter was genuine emmas head came up sharply and she signaled to justin for wine how were you so sure that it was not guy guy gratefully accepted the brimming cup simon told me unlike emma justin and durand understood the enormous significance of those three simple words before emma could reveal her ignorance justin said casually to guy you and simon de lusignan are mates are you guy nodded innocently we were squires together in the viscount of thouarss household simon is a good lad a good friend he is one for borrowing money and not one for repaying it but that is not his fault what with him being a younger son he only gets crumbs from his fathers table so he must make do however he can a reliable man to have beside you in a tavern brawl though justin and durands eyes caught and held briefly and in that moment justin knew exactly what the other man was thinking for he was thinking it toothat guy had probably never been in a tavern brawl in his life emma was occupied trying to place simon in the de lusignan hierarchy hes one of the sons of william who holds the lordship of lezay she said at last in a dismissive tone that told justin volumes about the lower social status of this branch of the de lusignan clan guy nodded again and at his mothers prodding admitted that simon de lusignan had been the one to ensnare him in the breton conspiracy no he did not know how simon had gotten involved in it hed been surprised though to see how much respect simon seemed to command amongst the breton lords who treated him like a man of some importance rather than a stripling of two and twenty a fourth son with little hope of advancement by now emma had realized that guy had just given them a valuable clue her eyes went questioningly to justin and he nodded imperceptibly conveying the message that he would enlighten her at the first opportunity once again his gaze crossed that of durand and once again the same thought was in both their minds it was time to have a long talk with the lady arzhela emma chose to remain at laval with her son since claudines rationale for accompanying them was to act as emmas companion she could muster no convincing argument when justin and durand insisted that she remain at laval too emma refused to spare the young knight lionel although she grudgingly agreed to let them take morgan and her menatarms guy would have liked to ride with them for he was eager to escape his mothers chastisement but he was not given that option the day was cold yet clear the road in decent shape for midwinter and they covered the twelve miles to vitre in two hours upon their arrival at the castle however they discovered that their journey was not over the duchess constance had decided to accept the hospitality of raoul de fougeres and the lady arzhela de dinan had accompanied her fougeres was less than twenty miles to the northeast of vitre and by pushing their horses they reached it just before dusk at first glimpse the castle appeared to be one of the most formidable strongholds justin had ever seen a rockhewn fortress surrounded by miles of marshland and moated by the serpentine winding of the river nancon but as they approached something struck him as odd about those massive defenses durand with a more experienced eye needed but one look what sort of dolt would build a castle down in the valley instead of up on the heights he said incredulously and justin realized he was right hed never before seen a castle located on low ground drawing rein they were marveling at the incongruity of it when morgan pulled up beside them and burst out laughing they must have been blinddrunk when they laid out these plans he chortled youd think theyd have learned their lesson when king henry may god assoil him took the castle in one days time but no damned if they did not rebuild it in the exact same spot youre uncommonly knowledgeable about castles and royal military campaigns durand said before adding snidely for a stable groom a man need not be a baker to enjoy eating bread morgan pointed out amiably by your logic sir durand only a nun would know about virtue and only a whore would know about sin we have a saying back home that if spare me your countrymens homilies durand said and spurred his stallion ahead until he attracted the attention of the castle guards allowed to advance within shouting range he demanded entry with an arrogance that caused justin and morgan to wince both expecting the gates to be slammed in durands face but after a brief delay they heard the creaking of a windlass and the drawbridge slowly began to lower fougeres may have been poorly situated but it boasted a highly sophisticated water defense system when raoul de fougeres rebuilt the castle after the english king henry burned it to the ground nigh on thirty years ago hed replaced the wooden structures with stone and constructed an ingenious tower that was equipped with a mechanism for flooding the entrance area in the event of attack even durand was impressed a removable footbridge spanned the waterfilled inner ditch and the men led their mounts across it into the bailey glancing up at the ironbarred double portcullis looming over their heads as they passed through by the time theyd penetrated the heart of the castle theyd all revised their initial view that fougeres could be easily taken and were thankful that none of them would be asked to lay siege to this breton border stronghold justin made sure that he not durand was the one to request a nights lodging from the castellan for the village huddled outside the castle battlements had not looked promising once permission was granted they sent their horses off to the stable and followed the castellans servant into the great hall nestled along the south wall there the duchess constance lord raoul and other breton lords were seated at the high table enjoying a prelenten feast of beef stew marrow tarts and stuffed capon places were found for durand and justin at one of the lower tables morgan and the menatarms would be fed too but theyd have to wait until their betters were served in their haste to reach fougeres before dark they had eaten nothing on the road and the enticing aromas of freshly baked bread and roasted meat reminded them of how empty their stomachs were they pitched into their food with enthusiasm and only afterward did they roam the smoky dimly lit hall in search of lady arzhela and failed to find her the person most likely to know of her whereabouts was the duchess constance but they knew better than to approach her unbidden she was holding court upon the dais surrounded by her barons and household knights and the abbot of trinity abbey justin and durand lurked inconspicuously at the outer edges of the royal circle watching in growing frustration as constance demonstrated how much she liked center stage accepting the attention deference and flattery as naturally as she did the air she breathed justin was not as sure as emma that this woman would be no match for john and neither was durand who murmured a rude jest in justins ear declaring it must be devilishly difficult to lay with a woman who had her own set of ballocks as more time passed justins anxieties about arzhela multiplied and he seized the first opportunity to intercept raoul de fougeres as he descended the dais steps my lord may i have a word with you he asked politely enough to please the highborn lord who paused and allowed that he could spare a moment or two raoul was stocky and well fed with a surprisingly thick thatch of hair for a man his age which justin guessed to be midsixties he had been doting noticeably upon a youngster of fourteen or so his grandson and heir but beneath the affable avuncular air was a will of iron a shrewd intelligence and the chilling confidence of one who never doubted his own judgments or his right to enforce them my lord i was asked by lord guy de laval to deliver a letter to lady arzhela de dinan but i have been unable to locate her and those ive asked disavow any knowledge of her whereabouts i was hoping that you might be better informed raouls brow puckered as he jogged his memory what did i hear about lady arzhela ah yes now i remember the duchess told me that lady arzhela asked her for permission to make a pilgrimage to mont st michel he turned away then as someone else sought his attention leaving justin standing there trying to make sense of what hed just been told a moment later durand was at his side well he demanded in a low voice did you find out where that fool woman has gone from the look on your face i dont think i am going to like the answer much no justin said slowly you are not going to like it at all chapter february mont st michel normandy despite the raw winter weather pilgrims continued to come to mont st michel from her vantage point at a window in the abbey guesthouse arzhela watched as they trudged across the wet sands from genets following single file in the footsteps of a local guide for even at low tide there was still the danger of quicksand bogs from the abbey heights they seemed as small and insignificant as carved toy figures playthings to be scattered at a childs whim or at gods will wind rattled the shutters causing arzhela to shiver but she did not close the window mesmerized by the sight of those struggling pilgrims what had driven them to make such a difficult journey to bear so heavy a burden she had made pilgrimages herself of course to chartres and to the shrine of our lady at rocamadour proudly bringing back an oval pilgrim badge inscribed with the words sigillum beatae mariae de rocamadour but her pilgrimages had always been made in the glory of high summer and had entailed no danger and little discomfort more like pleasure excursions than true testings of the soul she had visited the mont on numerous occasions but always as an honored guest never as one of christs faithful and as she leaned from the window of the abbeys guesthouse a hostel for the highborn looking down at those distant men and women wading through the icy waters of the bay she was shamed by the contrast between their barefoot heartfelt piety and her sinful luxuryloving past arzhela dined with abbot jourdain in his private chambers in latemorning along with several other guests deemed worthy of gracing the abbots table two merchants from rouen who were bountiful patrons of st michael their generosity compensating for any defects of lineage a distant cousin of arzhelas first husband the archdeacon of rennes a boastful norman baron and his subdued longsuffering wife arzhela found neither the company nor the conversation to be especially entertaining and was thankful when the meal was over as she emerged from the abbots lodging she encountered a flock of pilgrims being shepherded by monks up the great gallery stairs and instead of returning to the guesthouse she joined them the pilgrims and arzhela reverently crossed the central nave of the church where they were given time to pray at the altar of saintmichelenlanef arzhela knelt when it was her turn and as she offered up her prayers and her heart to blessed st michael she was filled with a sudden sense of peace how glad she was to be here it had been an impulse not fully thought out when shed realized she was in danger realized her need to find a refuge the abbey had been the first place to come to mind she could wait there in safety for justin and durand she wasnt sure what would happen after that but she felt confident that all would be resolved to her satisfaction if need be she could go to paris go to johnny he would protect her he would also take a swift and terrible vengeance a pity she could not simply tell justin and durand all that shed discovered leave the sorting out to them why must life be so damnably complicated usually the monks were strict taskmasters quickly ushering the pilgrims out so the next group could be given admittance but these february wayfarers were but a trickle in the flood of the faithful that inundated the abbey every year and the hosteller was willing to indulge such hardy souls allowing them to tarry in the nave breathing in the sanctity of st michael basking in gods grace arzhela lingered too wondering whether she could charm brother gervaise into taking her down into the crypt of notre dame des trente cierges where holy relics of the virgin mary were kept since the crypt was within the abbey enclosurethe area prohibited to all but the monksshe knew her chances were not promising still shed never know unless she tried she was strolling about the nave looking for the hosteller when she saw him she froze not fully trusting her senses and when she mustered up the courage to look again he was gone had she truly seen him hed been clad in the black habit of a benedictine the abbey had more monks than johnny had concubines nigh on sixty and then there were visiting monks from the monts norman priories even monks on pilgrimage how did she know her nerves were not playing her false but her heart had begun pounding against her ribs and she was finding it difficult to catch her breath once she was back in the guest quarters she did her best to convince herself that her imagination had conjured up a ghost but when she asked herself the only questions that truly matteredif he would dare to come after her and if his need to silence her was so great as thatshe knew the only answers could be yes and yes again once she admitted that she realized she dared not dismiss this sighting as fanciful not when the stakes truly were life or death fool that she was shed been sure she would be safe here far safer than at her cousins court she paced the confines of the chamber as if it were a cage her thoughts darting to and fro as rapidly as the gulls swooping outside the window could she feign illness keep to this chamber until durand and justin found her but if hed dared to follow her onto the blessed soil of st michael into gods house itself how long would a mere wooden door keep him out no she must find a hiding place where though she strode to a window and thrust open the shutters below a blackclad monk was staring up at the guesthouse his face hidden by his cowled hood her first instinct was to recoil but instead she stood her ground staring down defiantly at the spectral figure who might or might not be her executioner her fear was giving way to a surging anger like the tides of the bay it was allengulfing sparing no one not even herself shed handled this poorly making misjudgments and mistakes but no more loyalty to a lover might be admirable stupidity was not she knew her enemy now knew how ruthless and cunning he could be but he did not know his enemy he did not truly know her she stayed at the window long after the monk had gone gazing across the bay pilgrims still straggled toward shore their russet cloaks splotches of muted color against the endless grey of the sand and sky a cormorant flew by heading for the distant sea the stark islet of tombelaine rose out of the muddy flats that stretched between the mont and genets a bleak slab of rock that housed a small forlornlooking priory it was a desolate scene but to arzhela it was beautiful for it gave her the answer she sought what better way to hide than in plain sight brother andrev was staring at arzhela in horror my lady you cannot do this it is sheer madness i know that is why it cannot fail when brother andrev did not return her smile arzhela sighed wishing he could share her excitement her sense of triumph she was deeply fond of this man but why must monks be so besotted with propriety with doing what was right she had to stifle a giggle then at her own foolishness that was why monks became monks after all to serve god and to do good well not all monks that little weasel bernard cared only about making mischief shed forgotten her plan to ask abbot jourdain to banish him to one of their yorkshire priories until shed seen him skulking around the church like a cutpurse on the prowl for unwary victims lady arzhela are you even listening to me caught out she flashed a quick smile i am sorry i did let my thoughts wander for a moment brother andrev it warms my heart that you worry so on my behalf but my plan is well it is downright brilliant at first i thought about disguising myself as a nun she confided and grinned at his dumbstruck expression i realized that would not do though for nuns cannot wander freely about the countryside all by themselves even for worthy purposes like pilgrimages then i thought why not a monk why not indeed brother andrev echoed weakly i soon saw that would not work either even muffled in a monks habit i doubt that id be a very convincing man if i do say so myself but as i watched those poor pilgrims plodding across the sand it came to me who notices one sheep in an entire flock surely there must be another way i understand why you cannot turn to the duchess constance for help well truthfully i do not but you must take my word for that brother andrev the less you know the better for you i can tell you that the duchess would not be happy to learn of my recent activities it would be awkward to say the least well then why not appeal to the authorities in normandy there is a royal provost right here in genets i wish i could she admitted with such obvious sincerity that he was at a loss for words but you see dearest friend that provost answers to the wrong man she could not turn for help to king richards provost not without exposing the plot against johnny nor could she explain this to brother andrev for ignorance was his only protection i will tell you this much she said with a smile that managed to be both arch and wistful ive learned that the worst thing about dealing with untrustworthy people is that they cannot be trusted he didnt understand of course which was for the best i want you to go to the stables and check on my mare after that alar you can go to the tavern for ill have no further need of you till the morrow ive decided to pass the night at the priory therell be a bed there for you yes my lady as delighted as alar was to be given a free evening he was positively euphoric when she gave him a coin too arzhela watched as he trotted off toward the stables pleased that she could make him so happy with so little effort in her present mellow mood even a servants pleasure was cause for contentment she could not remember the last time shed felt so sure of the right path at one with the almighty and her world this marvelous feeling lasted as long as it took to reach the church of notre dame and saintsebastien where she was intercepted by brother bernard my lady he said eyeing her coldly what may i do for you you may go away she said rudely eager to get rid of him for he could thwart her plan if he were to follow her into the church as you wish he bit the words off flinging them at her like weapons but she had dealt with far more imposing men than this disgruntled benedictine monk brushing past him as if he did not exist she entered the church he continued to stand there staring after her but she never looked back the church was empty at this time of day for it was between the canonical hours of none and vespers arzhela crossed the nave heading for the tower shed stored her disguise in the sacristy before seeking out brother andrev for she could think of no safer hiding place she was relieved nonetheless to find it lying undisturbed in the coffer of vestments closing the sacristy door she undressed with some difficulty for she was accustomed to having help from her maids she decided to retain her own linen shift after feeling the scratchy coarse cloth against her soft skin stripping off her gown silk stockings pelisson and riding boots she hid them at the bottom of the vestment coffer hastily pulling on a russet robe of such poor quality that shed not have used it for a dogs bed her hair hidden under a veil and broadbrimmed hat she thrust her feet into shabby sandals wishing that there were a mirror in the sacristy so she could admire her astonishing transformation she was not concerned about the authenticity of her costume for shed purchased it right off the back of a departing pilgrim the man had been eager to accept her odd offer the coins shed given him in exchange for his tattered garb had assuaged any qualms and while he seemed convinced she was demented he was willing to profit from her lunacy shed even thought to take clothes for him from the abbeys almonry so he need not attract attention in genets by buying new garments in the morning hed be gone long before shed be missed it was foolproof cracking open the church door she peered cautiously around the churchyard seeing no one in the immediate vicinity she stepped outside selfconscious in her new identity as a poor but godly pilgrim no one even glanced at her though and she soon regained confidence making her way hastily down to the shore a small cluster of pilgrims were milling about the last group to go that day an iceedged wind had chased all others from the beach and arzhela found it easy to escape notice shed rolled her mantle up and tucked it under her arm unfolding it now she looked around cautiously and then dropped the mantle at her feet kicking until it was half buried in the sand a pity it was one of her favorites johnny would owe her a new parisian cloak for this but it had to be done no pilgrim would be wearing a mantle lined with fox fur and if it was found and identified as hers that would be one more red herring dragged across her trail leading the hounds astray the last pilgrims were getting ready to cross two balked abruptly deciding that theyd wait until the morrow their unease proved contagious and several of their companions began to reconsider too seeing his fees slipping away the guide hastily assured them that the crossing was safe that it was nigh on five hours until the next high tide and theyd be able to reach the mont ere dark descended on the bay insisting that the monks believed blessed st michael looked with especial favor upon those who made a dusk crossing he collected his flock before any others could stray and passed out candles clutching a candle in one hand and her sandals in the other arzhela joined the others the mud was cold against the bare soles of her feet the water even colder but as she raised her eyes to the distant mont she forgot about her physical discomfort the church spires seemed to be scraping the clouds and the last rays of the dying sun bathed the abbey in a golden glow it was like gazing upon the glory of god and arzhela stared up at it in wonder as if seeing it for the first time the sense of peace that shed experienced at st michaels shrine came flooding back some of the other pilgrims had begun to weep and arzhela wept too for sheer joy why had she been so slow to understand what the almighty wanted of her upon the beach at genets a lone figure stood at the waters edge the wind whipped brother bernards cowl back blew sand into his face and chilled his body and soul he did not move though never taking his eyes from the pilgrims wading toward the mont chapter february antrain brittany the flat tombstones were overgrown with moss and white with hoarfrost as cold as ice offering little comfort to aching bodies and weary bones but morgan and the menatarms sprawled upon them as if they were cushions glad for a respite however brief from too many hours in the saddle the churchyard was empty save for them and the dead the church itself was not welcoming small shuttered and precariously perched on the heights above a wooded valley where two rivers merged there was no castle just the church and a scattering of dilapidated unsightly cottages poverty stalked this breton village where suspicion of strangers was a lesson learned in the cradle and hope always rode on by never even dismounting the men were not fanciful with the exception of morgan their imaginations were not so much underused as undiscovered still they dimly sensed the isolation and the melancholy of these unseen reclusive villagers and they kept their hands upon their weapons kept casting glances over their shoulders they did not like this bretagne this land of fog and legends and sunless tangled woods where demons and bandits lurked this was not a good place to be not a good place to die how much longer you think jaspaers english was serviceable although the echoes of his native flanders were never far from the surface he was more comfortable speaking flemish or french but his companions were english and he used their tongue as a courtesy unlike jaspaer whose sword was for hire to any lord with money to pay be he french danish or swabian rufus and crispin were english lads born and bred in shropshire and not happy to be so far from home so morgan responded in english too although french was his first language soon id expect he said reassuringly how long does it take to replace a shoe after all in this godforsaken land who knows rufus muttered darkly his thoughts bleak enough to warrant making a quick sign of the cross we could wager whilst we wait morgan suggested and succeeded in stirring a flicker of interest on what crispin asked patting the scrip that dangled from his belt i lost the dice at laval see those two birds in that yew tree yonder we could wager which one will fly away first or when our good lords will get back from the farriers or if theyll make it to mont st michel ere they kill each other they all grinned at that even the morose rufus for durand and justin had been quarreling like tomcats ever since theyd left fougeresclashing over which road to take how fast a pace to set whose fault it was that theyd not been able to ride out as early as theyd hoped who was to blame for this latest delay id best go see if the farrier has gotten bonesick of their yammering and tossed them both into his horse trough morgan said and they all grinned again for the breton blacksmith was the biggest man any of them had ever seen with legs like tree trunks and hands like hams rising stiffly morgan stretched and winced and then halted gazing toward the north riders he said and the other men scrambled to their feet too wary and watchful at the farriers shed durand had made such a pest of himself hovering close at hand and peering over the blacksmiths shoulder that the breton at last rose to his full formidable height pointed to the door and told him to get out durand spoke no breton but the mans gesture did not need translation outside justin was pacing back and forth unable to stand still for more than a heartbeat he turned swiftly as durand emerged from the shed how much longer you speak this accursed tongue of theirs durand snapped ask him yourself ive already told you that i do not speak breton justin snapped back i understand a bit because i know some welsh well you still get more than i do durand glowered at justin as if his language lack were the younger mans fault go ask him not me justin silently counted to ten it did not help if youd checked your horses hooves ere we left fougeres you might have noticed that a shoe was loose but of course you could not be bothered justin stopped for durand was no longer listening staring over justins shoulder with such intensity that he spun about morgan and their menatarms were hastening toward them and now he and durand could see it toothe rising dust of approaching riders coming from the north from mont st michel i know him durand exclaimed as the newcomers rode into the village stepping quickly into the road he called out my lord abbot a moment if you please the abbot reined in gazing down impassively at durand his guards urged their mounts closer but durand did not appear threatening at his most courtly he bowed gracefully we met in paris last year at the court of the king of the french i am sir durand de curzon the name meant nothing to abbot jourdain but the man before him was welldressed wellspoken and wellarmed clearly a member of the gentry ah yes he said politely sir durand gods blessings upon you and your traveling companions he added glancing toward justin morgan and the menatarms they are my servants durand said dismissively a man would be foolish to ride alone in these dangerous times it is indeed fortuitous that weve met on the road like this my lord abbot for i am heading to mont st michel i would not have wanted to miss the opportunity to pay my respects to you the abbot responded with a courtesy of his own hed had much practice at extricating himself from tiresome social situations and he said kindly but firmly alas i cannot tarry much as i would enjoy renewing acquaintance with you sir durand we must reach fougeres by dark durand did not move from the center of the road indeed i have just come from fougeres myself where i had the honor of performing a service for the duchess constance and lord raoul her liege man influenced perhaps by the names durand was dropping with such abandon the abbot curbed his impatience and mustered up a polite smile before he could make another attempt to end the conversation durand stepped closer i believe that a lady dear to my heart is currently enjoying the hospitality of your abbey my lord not that i would imply there is anything improper between us he said with a smile that suggested just that for she is of the blood royal of brittany lady arzhela de dinan i trust she is well the abbot bit his lip hesitated and then said i assume so with such obvious discomfort that justin felt a chill of foreboding shouldering his way forward he demanded has evil befallen her the abbot looked annoyed now as well as uneasy your servant could do with a lesson in manners sir durand he is not my servant durand said grudgingly glaring at justin i could be his baseborn son for all it matters my lord what of lady arzhela i do not know you the abbot responded icily and i am not in the habit of being accosted by strangers he included durand in that rebuke glancing from one to the other suspiciously and justin hastily knelt in the road forgive me my lord abbot he said humbly i did indeed misspeak myself but we have reason to fear for lady arzhelas safety can you at least assure us that she has come to no harm mollified somewhat by justins penitent demeanor the abbot was silent for a moment considering i need to know your identity he said at last justins brain was racing weighing his options they dare not mention lord johns name not in brittany but the abbey lay within king richards domains within normandy why though would king richards men be seeking the lady arzhela if that got back to constance thered be hell to pay i am sir luke de marston he said going with the first name to pop into his head i am foster brother to simon de lusignan he was gambling now that arzhelas liaison with de lusignan was an open secret and gambling too that shed much rather be called to account for her sexual sins than for her political ones simon and lady arzhela they quarreled a fortnight ago she has refused to see simon since then and he hoped that if we told her how very sorry he was her heart might soften toward him that is the truth my lord abbot durand chimed in shooting justin a glance of surprised approval we are on a mission of mercy if you will we promised simon that wed put in a good word for him with his lady the poor sod has been so lovesick that we could endure his lamenting and moaning for not another day the abbot was regarding them with an odd expression not easy to decipher justin was trying to come up with a plausible answer for the question he was dreading why is the lady arzhela in danger to his astonishment it was not asked instead abbot jourdain said choosing his words with conspicuous care is it possible that simon could not wait that he acted on his own to mend this breach between them i suppose so durand acknowledged cautiously and both he and justin were taken aback by the abbots emotional reaction he closed his eyes for a moment embracing hope like a drowning man might grab for a lifeline that would explain it he cried thanks be to the almighty and blessed st michael she must have gone off with de lusignan are you saying she is missing the abbot was so relieved that he did not even notice the terseness of the question so we thought she rode over to genets yesterday and told her servant that shed be staying the night but when he went to the priory guesthouse this morn she was not there her mare was still in the stable and a search turned up a mantle that her man claimed as hers none had seen her though since yesterday none knew where she might have gone i felt i had no choice but to inform the duchess for the lady arzhela is her cousin but now there is no need for if it was a lovers quarrel we all know how foolish women can be at such times he got no further his words trailing off and his smile fading for simon de lusignans friends had whirled and were running for their horses as the blacksmith led a grey stallion out the man who called himself durand de curzon vaulted up onto the animals back and spurred after the others the blacksmith was shouting that they owed him money village dogs had begun to bark and the abbots escort milled about in confusion uncertain what was expected of them my lord abbot shall we go after them abbot jourdains shoulders slumped and he rubbed his fingers gingerly against his temples like a man stricken with a sudden sharp headache by now the riders were already out of sight the dust beginning to settle no he said slowly i shall have to continue on to fougeres after all they reached mont st michel as the lateafternoon shadows were lengthening in spite of his fear for arzhela justin was awestruck at sight of the abbey at first glance it looked to be a castle carved from the very rocks of the isle its towering spires reaching halfway to heaven the last bastion of christian faith in a world of denial and disbelief a fragment of religious lore came back to him that st michael was known as the guardian of the threshold between life and eternity and that seemed the perfect description for his abbey too a bridge between the land of the living and the sea of the dead durand had reined in beside him revealing by a muttered exclamation that was both involuntary and irreverent that this was his first sight of mont st michel too holy lucifer by now their men had caught up with them justin turned in the saddle as a local breton approached and offered to guide them across the mudflats durand did not wait though and spurred his stallion out onto the wet sand justin called durand an uncomplimentary name and then plunged after him much more reluctantly so did the others while justin and durand climbed up the cliff to the abbey morgan went about finding lodgings for them in the village on the slope below it was an easy task for virtually every house offered bed and food fishing was the primary occupation of the montois and more fished for pilgrims than for mullet or shrimp they were soon settled in an ancient hostel called la sirene flirting with a sarcastic serving maid who claimed the unlikely name of salome yearning for their daily ration of english ale crispin and rufus had been thirsty enough in paris to try cervoise a french beer but they hadnt been able to get even that once theyd left the ile de france now they stared dubiously at the cups of hard cider brought by salome but she brooked no refusals pausing only long enough to slap crispins hand away from her hip they were dunking bread in steaming bowls of soup when justin and durand returned looking so somber that morgan pushed back from the table and moved to meet them unlike the menatarms who were surprisingly incurious about their mission morgan had done some judicious eavesdropping and he knew at once that theyd not found the lady they sought weve ordered food he said and a norman cider strong enough to peel paint off a wall would you eat justin shook his head it is a madhouse up there no rumor is too ridiculous to be believed the monks are like dogs chasing their tails all going in different directions they could tell us little more than we learned from abbot jourdain but since she was last seen in genets that is where we go next now morgan blinked unable to conceal his dismay the menatarms had heard enough to alarm them too and they were staring at justin and durand as if they had suddenly revealed themselves to have horns and forked tails yes now durand said curtly reaching down to help himself to one of the ciders while justin beckoned to salome after a brief exchange justin turned toward a customer at a nearby table a sparse shriveled man of indeterminate years with the deeply creased wrinkles and pale eyes of one whod spent most of his life exposed to nature at its worst morgan seized the opportunity to argue even though he suspected that durand was about as flexible as the granite stones of st michel sir durand weve been talking to some of the villagers and they say the tides are as treacherous here as anywhere in christendom salome told us that theyve lost count of the unwary souls drowned as they tried to cross the bay and the genets crossing is much longer than the one we made nigh on three miles that is why we are hiring a guide durand cut in justin was coming back to their table and durand raised his eyebrows in a wordless question when justin nodded he jerked his thumb toward their menatarms saying we may have a rebellion on our hands these stouthearted cocks are loath to get their feet wet that did not endear him to either morgan or the menatarms but his gibe was wasted upon justin who had thoughts only for the missing arzhela let them await us here then he said impatiently ive found us a guide but he does not come cheap not for a crossing at this time of day durand shrugged they were spending johns money after all draining the last of the cider he started toward the door when justin would have followed morgan stepped forward godspeed justin i hope you find her so do i morgan as their eyes met though justin could see that they both feared it was too late there were no pilgrims crossing to the mont that late in the day and those already at the abbey were spending the night there so justin durand and their guide had the bay to themselves encountering only a large seal napping on a flat rock dusk was dimming the sky and blurring the horizon as they reached the beach at genets they knew at once that something was very wrong people were gathered in clots before the priory walls strangely subdued and silent the priory gate was shut and there was no response when they banged on the door vespers was being rung from somewhere in the town but oddly enough the bells of notre dame and saintsebastien were not pealing out the hour an unnatural stillness overhung the priory and they knew instinctively that it had nothing to do with the disappearance of a breton noblewoman they continued to pound upon the gate until footsteps sounded on the other side and the door slowly creaked open they glimpsed hollow eyes and blanched skin before a tremulous voice instructed them to come back later durand lunged forward to wedge his boot in the door but it was already swinging shut wait justin cried out wait we come from the abbey the door opened so fast that durand was caught off balance and stumbled against the post with a choked cry of deo gratias the gatekeeper grabbed their arms and pulled them inside he was tonsured and clad in a monks habit but they decided he was most likely a novice for he looked barely old enough to shave much less take final vows i am brother briag his french was flavored with a strong breton accent his eyes darted from one to the other but you are not brethren who are you why did you lie we did not lie we never said we were monks we are friends of lady arzhela de dinan and we need to speak with brother andrev for we were told he was the last one to see her justin stopped for the young monks eyes were filling with tears what is it what has happened here there has been brother briag swallowed and then continued his voice so low that they could hardly hear him murder done the priory cell at genets was a very small one with only four monks now one was dead one lay near death and the only two left were overwhelmed the elderly brother martin was ostensibly in charge but he was half blind and so dazed by the tragedy that all responsibility had fallen upon the novice brother briag moving like one in a trance brother briag pointed toward the infirmary master laurence is in there now doing what he can swiping the back of his hand across his cheek he explained that master laurence was the town physician hed already revealed the identity of the victimthe man theyd come to genets to find brother andrev we summoned the provosts deputy but by the time he came whoever did this evil was long gone brother briags steps lagged as they approached the church porch are you sure you want to see you need not come in justin said and the young monk slowly shook his head ill be seeing it in my sleep for the rest of my life he said softly one more time will not matter they followed him into the nave of the church almost at once they were assailed by the smell of blood there brother briag gasped pointing toward one of the transepts it happened there it was easy to see where the murder had been committed for the floor was pooled in congealed blood they stood staring down at the splattered tiles the lantern light had begun to sway wildly so badly was the monks hand shaking taking the lantern from him justin urged quietly tell us all that you can remember the monk came in the afternoon we know now that he was not truly a monk for no man of god could commit such sacrilege to kill in gods house brother briag shuddered he claimed to be here on duchess constances behalf and he asked many questions about lady arzhela we knew of course that shed gone missing but we had naught to tell him after he spoke with brother andrev i thought he went away he did not though for later i saw him with brother bernard they talked together for a few moments and entered the church it was then that i went to find brother andrev why durands question was so abrupt so pointed that the young monk flinched i id rather not say he whispered because you do not want to speak ill of the dead justins voice was soothing nonjudgmental and after a moment brother briag gave a ragged sigh almost like a sob how did you guess i did not like brother bernard no one did he took pleasure in causing trouble i knew hed sneaked off to see the provosts deputy once lady arzhela was reported missing i knew too that he was no friend to her and so i went to alert brother andrev that he was likely up to no good if only i had kept my mouth shut hed not have been hurt brother andrev went into the church after them the novice monk nodded miserably i was on the porch when i heard him cry out i rushed inside and he shuddered again brother andrev was fighting with the monk clinging to his arm as i got closer i saw the knife i did not see him stab brother andrev though he was that fast brother andrev staggered back and collapsed and the killer ran out i tried to stop him i swear i did but he just shoved me aside he glanced down at the bandage swathed around his forearm it was only later that i even realized id been cut when did you find brother bernards body justin asked for durand seemed willing to concede the interrogation to him afterward he swallowed convulsively i was yelling for help once i discovered that brother andrev had been stabbed i remember kneeling beside him trying to staunch the blood and then i sawi saw brother bernard he was crumpled in that corner and there was blood so much blood master laurence later told me that his throat had been cut after that there was no more to be said no one spoke until they emerged into the fading light brother briag was cradling his injured arm in obvious discomfort he looked from justin to durand back to justin again do you know why this happened they both answered him in the same breath justin admitting no we do not and durand saying grimly not yet justin and durand had no trouble finding the house of the provosts deputy brother briag had given them clear directions off the marketplace on the same street as the bakery genets was a prosperous market town with several thousand inhabitants a hospital a salt works and a shipyard the fact that the town was located on a major pilgrim route made their task all the more difficult it would have been much harder for the killer to escape notice in a small inbred village where every strangers arrival was fodder for gossip thanks to brother briag justin and durand were well armed with useful information about the provosts deputy master benoit a mildmannered diffident widower who had the good luck to be a cousin of the provosts wife the positions of provost and deputy provost were political plums unusual in that those who held them were the abbots men first and only secondly the kings for the abbey had been given the privilege of appointing its own candidates the provost had ridden out in search of the lady arzhela brother briag had confided his absence a misfortune for all concerned including master benoit who was no more qualified to handle a murder investigation than he was to lead a crusade to the holy land justin and durand already harbored suspicions about master benoits capabilities for why had he not been to investigate the murder scene yet when their incessant knocking finally got him to open his door one glance was enough to tell them what hed been doing in the hours since the killing his eyes were glazed and bloodshot his clothing rumpled and stained and he stank of wine urine and vomit benoit seemed reluctant to admit them but mustered up only a weak protest when they pushed their way inside stumbling after them like a guest in his own house he asked what they wanted his faltering hesitant words sounding more like a plaintive lament than a forceful demand sit down ere you fall down durand ordered shoving a chair toward him he did blinking up at them blearily as they circled him like large hungry cats shrinking the circle until he had to tilt his head to look into their faces he sensed that they had him at a disadvantage but when he tried to rise durands hand closed on his upper arm fingers digging into his flesh like iron hooks and he decided to stay put who who are you if youve come to rob me youve youve made a great mistake he licked his lips sought to keep his voice steady as he told them he was the deputy provost of the barony of genets but neither man seemed impressed we know that master benoit justin had to resist the urge to grab the man by those quaking shoulders and shake the truth out of him so sure was he that benoit had the answers they needed that is why we are here i i do not understand the murder durand snapped angrier than even he could have explained for weakness and cowardice brought out the worst in his own nature he was cruelest to those he scorned you do remember the murder sousepot benoit shrank back in the chair are you are you the killers durand swore and would have dragged the man to his feet if justin had not stopped him youre scaring him out of his wits that is not the way no given your vast experience suppose you show me how it is done justin grabbed the knight by the arm and pulled him aside look at him durand he insisted lowvoiced he is terrified ask yourself why i grant you that was no pretty scene in the church but there has to be more to this than squeamishness what is he drinking to forget i could use a drink myself durand growled i know i am way too sober when you start to make sense de quincy with a mocking gesture he indicated that justin had the field benoit justin said sharply and the deputy sat upright flinching as durand snatched up a candle and brought it close to his face we are seeking the lady arzhela de dinan and i think you can help us find her benoits gaze slid toward the table and the wine flagon how he mumbled and then i am right thirsty justin picked up the flagon holding it just out of reach you can drink yourself sodden if that is your wish but first you must tell us what brother bernard told you about lady arzhela benoit bowed his head i cannot justin flipped the lid on the flagon letting benoit see the sloshing liquid inside his own stomach tightened at the sight for it was dark red in the subdued light the color of drying blood yes you can and you must you know that benoit it was not my fault the deputy looked up suddenly briefly his eyes desperately seeking justins it was not my fault no one said it was your fault what did he say it was a daft tale made no sense benoits words were slurred with wine and selfpity he was no longer meeting justins gaze no one would have believed it no one justin thrust the flagon into the mans hands keeping his own hand clamped upon benoits wrist tell us he he claimed that lady arzhela had sneaked into the church and then come back out dressed like a needy pilgrim naturally i did not credit it for who would she is a lady of high rank and royal blood one who likes her comforts why would she put on stinking coarse sackcloth and mingle with the lowborn and poor with beggars and rabble and all know brother bernard was odd i thanked him and promptly forgot about it as any sensible man would and then then he was slain in the church his voice thickened but he was so thoroughly cowed that he dared not drink until these fearsome strangers said he could he was no longer being held and he glanced up imploringly seeking their understanding their mercy but he was alone the door stood ajar and the men were gone chapter february mont st michel normandy while pilgrims and travelers of the upper classes would find a welcome in the abbeys guesthouse and the abbots own lodgings christs poor were admitted to the almonry it provided protection from the rain but it lacked fireplaces and because it was exposed to the aquilon the name locals gave to those merciless winter winds that swept in from the north it was a stark frigid refuge to people unfamiliar with luxury or comfort though it was enough it was different for arzhela her first night at the almonry had been the longest of her life shed been sure theyd find her body come morning frozen so solid that theyd have to thaw her out before burying her the blankets provided by the monks were as thin as wafers and the icy tiled floor was a martyrs bed of pain she didnt doubt that shed have slept better and been warmer for certes burrowing into the straw in the abbey stables but her shivering and chattering teeth finally awakened her nearest neighbors i am juvette a woman whispered and this is my daughter mikaela come huddle with us three bodies are warmer than one arzhela hesitated but she could no longer feel her feet and she edged closer discovering that the woman was right when she awakened in the morning she was snug against juvettes back and mikaelas head was pillowed in her lap stirring as soon as arzhela did juvette sat up sleepily we are stacked like pancakes she laughed and arzhelas stomach rumbled reminding her how long it had been since shed eaten do the monks feed us she ventured of course and right well therell be ample helpings of bread and cheese juvette easily recognized the notes of hunger in arzhelas voice that was a song she knew well we saved a bit of bread from yesterdays meal she said here take some arzhela looked at the stale pieces of bread wrapped in a scrap of cloth and quickly shook her head i could not for you have so little we have enough to share juvette insisted giving arzhela no choice but to accept a small crust as the day advanced arzhela was astonished by the goodwill of these impoverished pilgrims shed expected that they would be pious for a pilgrimage in winter especially one as dangerous as this was proof of serious intent shed not expected though that they would be so generous so willing to share their meager belongings their stories and their laughter there was a communal atmosphere in the almonry unlike anything shed ever experienced on her own pilgrimages and again and again she saw small examples of kindness and good humor most were breton or french although there was one dour englishman while pilgrimages were lauded as acts of spiritual renewal most pilgrims had more pragmatic mundane reasons for making them people sought out saints to beg for healing to pray for forgiveness and sometimes to die in a state of grace other pilgrimages were penitential in nature for the church often ordered caughtout or repentant sinners to atone for their transgressions at distant holy shrines one of their company had already confessed cheerfully that he was there for habitual fornication although he did not put it as delicately as that another admitted that his offense had been poaching on his bishops lands if any were expiating the sin of adultery they prudently kept that to themselves most of these february pilgrims were at mont st michel for obvious reasons there was a man who coughed blood into stained rags mikaela had been born at michaelmas named in honor of the archangel and now that she was ailing her mother had brought her to the mont to plead for his intercession one woman was there to pray that her hearing be restored a man crippled by the joint evil was tended lovingly by his wife but arzhela could not imagine howeven with her helphed managed to climb the hill and the steep steps to the almonry a young couple seemed in the bloom of health but theyd wept together in the night miquelots they were called those who dared to brave the tides for the sake of blessed st michael with a dart of pride arzhela realized that she was one of them she was a miquelot too she was amazed by the feelings that her fellow pilgrims had stirred in her they were strangers after all lowborn most of them the sort of people shed seen but never truly noticed before but after just one night and one day theyd begun to matter to her when theyd been allowed to visit the shrine in the nave shed spent almost as much time praying for them as for herself she winced every time she heard that strangled death rattle of a cough shed gotten two of the ablebodied men to assist the cripple and his wife up the great staircase into the church shed surreptitiously hidden a pouchful of coins in juvettes bundle confident that when she eventually discovered it juvette would joyfully conclude that this was the archangels bounty and shed taken charge of yann she still wasnt sure what she was going to do with him she guessed his age to be between eleven and thirteen he claimed to remember eleven winters but truth telling was not one of his virtues and she thought him quite capable of making himself younger than he truly was to appear more sympathetic he said he was an orphan and she had no reason to doubt him he was cunning in the way of children and young animals left to fend for themselves at an early age he was also cheeky and quick to take advantage of an opportunity qualities that she should deplore but found amusing instead while shed lain wakeful and miserable late into the night shed seen him creeping catlike among the sleeping pilgrims deftly removing some of the coins from the selfconfessed poachers scrip clever lad shed thought not to take it all for the theft was less likely to be discovered that way and the next morning she cornered him out in the northsouth stairwell you need a new trade my boy for you are a pitiful cutpurse she announced and waited until hed run through his litany of impassioned denials it was then that she pried his name out of him as well as a grudging confession that hed followed the pilgrims like a seagull followed fishing sloops she made him promise that hed do no more thieving whilst he was at the abbey but she knew hunger would always win out over promises especially those given under duress and she insisted upon keeping him close for the remainder of the day he protested at length but she did not think he truly minded once he was sure shed not turn him in for attention was as rare as hens teeth in an orphans world he was as sharp as a flemings blade though the only one to notice that she did not talk like the others as he put it she sounded like youve just eaten a marrow tart she explained away the telltale echoes of education and privilege in her voice by telling him shed been taught by nuns and he seemed to accept that she found it sad though that food was his tally stick his only means of measurement arzhela was thoroughly enjoying her incursion into this alien world so much so that she wondered idly if she ought to consider giving over her life to god a pity nuns had to live such cloistered lives if only she could do good on a wider stage than a secluded convent though if she were to be honest vows of poverty and obedience might begin to chafe after a while and then there was that irksome vow of chastity by now arzhela was laughing at herself realizing how ludicrous it was for her to even contemplate a religious vocation she liked her comfort too much liked feather beds and good food and saint pourcain wine from the auvergne she liked getting her own way and for certes she liked men that had proven to be an expensive vice she acknowledged ironically the priests preached that wanton fallen women risked ruination scandal and mortal sin but none had ever warned her she could end up in an unheated almonry sleeping on a bare floor sharing her bed with goodhearted companions who were nonetheless much in need of baths keeping an eye peeled for a killer actually shed given him surprisingly little thought since arriving at the almonry in part she was distracted by the novelty of her surroundings in part she was fascinated by the drama provided by the other pilgrims but she also felt secure confident that she had outwitted her enemy this was one fox who had eluded the hounds and she meant to make the most of it she would prove to the almighty and his archangel that she deserved to be a miquelot she would convince constance to help her found a nunnery where the nuns would pray for her immortal soul and the souls of her dead husbands and even her lovers well at least most of them and she would begin her good deeds by saving yann from the gallows and eternal damnation whether he wanted to be saved or not because their numbers were small the february miquelots were allowed to visit the archangels shrine again that afternoon they were also permitted into the nave for the vespers service that evening and after being fed supper they settled down in the almonry for the night it was early by arzhelas reckoning but as the candles provided by the monks began to burn down the drone of conversation gave way to drowsy murmuring and eventually to silence an hour later arzhela was wide awake and very bored beside her juvette was snoring softly on her other side yann had begun to squirm and she leaned over to whisper do not even think about it lad shed finally figured out what do to with the boy she wouldnt be in a position to aid him herself until shed gotten out of this snare which god willing would be soon johnnys men ought to be arriving any day now once the trouble was over shed find a place for him on one of her manors until then shed send him to brother andrev for safekeeping she couldnt tell yann about her longrange plans for him but she had confided her intent to entrust him to brother andrev hed objected vehemently of course she was confident though that brother andrev would be able to keep the sly imp under control until she could reclaim him mayhap by then shed have thought of a suitable trade for him with those nimble fingers of his he might make a weaver one day or even a silversmith well no that might not be the best apprenticeship for a lad with larceny in his heart she laughed soundlessly imagining yann stealing spoons right under his masters nose and warned him to stay put when he started wriggling again the silence of the night was not really silent the aquilon wind was howling at the shutters pilgrims were snoring and muttering in their sleep one of the remaining candles was sputtering and over all like the distant sound of the sea was the coughing of the pilgrim with consumption arzhela was so accustomed to that throttled hacking that it had become background noise it was a while before she realized that it had changed timbre rising she groped her way over to him as soon as she touched his face she jerked her hand back for his skin was burning it took her only a moment to decide what to do get that candle yann she murmured as she stooped and maneuvered the man to his feet he was so pitifully light and frail that it was not difficult at all he gave her a feverish bewildered look but did not resist when she began to guide him toward the door yann had picked up the candle although hed yet to move come on she prompted you do not think im going to let you loose on these poor sleeping sheep do you it was too dark to see for certain but she thought she caught the glimmer of a grin as he followed where are we going he asked as soon as they were out in the portico the monks will have our hides for roaming around like this he sounded more excited than alarmed at the prospect and did not protest when she instructed him to help her support the mans weight we have to get him down those steps she said jerking her head toward the great gallery stairs that will not be too hard but then we have to get up a second flight of stairs yanns expression clearly said that he thought shed lost all her wits how the last i looked none of us have archangels wings are you saying you cannot keep pace with an ailing man and a woman past her prime arzhela gibed we are going up to the abbey guesthouse as if theyd let the likes of us in there oh ye of little faith above the guest hall is the abbey infirmary oh yann said somewhat deflated but what makes you think theyll treat him there because the almighty and i would have it so yann shook his head you are daft woman he stopped complaining though and did his part as they began their laborious climb it seemed to take forever for they had to stop and rest repeatedly the stricken pilgrim asked no questions obediently shuffling forward in response to arzhelas coaxing his coughing had eased but he seemed in a daze only dimly aware of his companions and his surroundings arzhela knew there was little to be done for him not unless the archangel chose to bestow one of his miracles but at least hed get to die in a bed she vowed every man deserved that much when they finally reached the infirmary she did not bother seeking admittance simply shoved the door open within a flickering lamp cast eerie shadows but it gave off enough light for her to make out several beds simple structures little better than pallets in two of them ailing monks snatched at broken sleep turning and tossing restively upon the third the infirmarian was napping still fully dressed for in a few hours hed have to rise for matins attuned to his patients needs he awakened at once what is it he whispered as his eyes fell upon the man sagging between arzhela and yann he came swiftly to his feet he was only of middling height and the sparse hair crowning his tonsure was as white as newly skimmed milk but his appearance was deceptive for he lifted the pilgrim without apparent effort and deposited the man upon his own bed he asked no questions for the patients condition was selfevident and hastened over to a table holding vials and powders arzhela and yann watched with interest as he blended several herbs in a small mortar he seemed quite competent but arzhela could not resist offering her help suggesting softly that lungwort was good for consumption as was wood betony her assistance was unappreciated and within moments she and yann found themselves banished from the infirmary they stood there in the gloomy south stairwell momentarily at a loss for this seemed to be an anticlimactic end to their rescue mission will he die do you think yann asked at last and arzhela shook her head emphatically indeed not she lied with such assurance that yanns face brightened reminding her that for all his worldly cynical posturing he was still a child id go so far as to say your good deed tonight cancels out your theft last night at least in the almightys account book mind you another such lapse and youll find yourself in abbot jourdains dungeon alone with the rats his eyes widened he summoned up his usual bravado though saying skeptically why would they need dungeons in an abbey how many evildoers go to church after all youd be surprised yann she said dryly moreover the abbot is a lord as well for he holds the barony of genets she regretted having to scare him into hewing to the straight and narrow but thieving was both crime and sin now are you sleepy yet no he admitted and added hopefully have you some mischief in mind in a manner of speaking she said and there in the dimly lit stairwell they grinned at each other in a moment of comfortable and cheerful complicity chapter february genets normandy genets had many small shabby taverns justin and durand had been making the rounds after their guide refused to escort them back across the bay seeking another local man to take the defectors place until the third tavern theyd had no luck again and again the tavern patrons heard them out with interest only to balk once they were told the crossing must be made now again and again justin and durand were warned about the treacherous tides and quicksand bogs again and again they were reminded that high tide that night would be soon after compline and compline was not that far off finally they offered a sum so large that the tavern fell silent one of the loudest naysayers a cocky youth with snapping dark eyes and a birthmark upon his cheek stood up abruptly i am baldric he said though some of these jesters call me cain for reasons anyone with eyes can see for what you are going to pay me you can call me by either name the other tavern regulars had chuckled at the mention of baldrics ironic nickname but by the time he finished speaking most of them were regarding him in dismay and one of baldrics companions seemed to speak for them all when he asked what will you use the money for cousin the fanciest funeral genets has ever seen baldric grinned no i mean to spend it in stmalo on cocks lane snatching up his cousins drink he drained it dry then swaggered over to durand and justin i want payment now in case you do not make it to shore payment when we reach the shore durand countered coolly that will give you incentive to see that we do make it they settled upon half now half when they reached mont st michel and before baldrics friends could seriously try to dissuade him he led his new employers out into the night the mont was still sharply etched against the darkening sky and seemed to have a halo of stars the horses were edgy sensing the mood of their riders and baldric had difficulty getting his mount under control i usually do this on foot during the day he admitted any advice about keeping on this nags good side just do not fall off durand said laconically and the young norman laughed mirthlessly passing strange that you should say that for i was about to warn you that we do not stop not for anything or anyone if one of you blunders off course into a bog a pity but well not be riding back to your rescue understood justin and durand traded smiles like unsheathed daggers understood baldric was studying the clouds scudding across the sky at least the wind is from the north the tide comes in faster if its driven by a westerly wind given a choice id rather be crossing at least two hours before the next high tide but we still ought to have enough time just follow after me and hope that the archangel is in a benevolent mood tonight justin was quite willing to put his fate in st michaels hands he was not as sure about baldric they dared not wait though if the murderous monk had crossed over after learning of arzhelas masquerade her chances of living to see the dawn were not good the killer had several hours head start on them and a knife still wet with the blood of brothers bernard and andrev the wind was cold and wet and carried the scent of seaweed and salt the muted roar of the unseen sea echoed in justins ears as rhythmic as a heartbeat seagulls screeched overhead their shrill cries eerily plaintive his stallion had an odd gait picking up its hooves so high that it was obviously not comfortable with the footing one of the tavern customers had told justin that walking on the sand was like treading upon a tightly stretched drum he very much hoped that hed not have the opportunity to test that observation for himself behind him he could hear durand cursing justin kept his eyes upon the glow of baldrics swaying lantern doing his best to convince himself that as st michael led christian souls into the holy light so would this norman youth lead them to safety upon the shore the sound of the surging sea was louder now along the horizon they could see the starlit froth of whitecaps despite all theyd been told about the tides of st michel they were amazed by the speed of those encroaching waters and it was with vast relief that they splashed onto the sands of the mont baldric did not slow his pace though urging them off the beach and on toward the steep rocks that sheltered the village they soon saw why hed been in such haste the water was rising at an incredibly rapid rate by the time the tide hit the isle of tombelaine it had merged into a single white wave it was soon swallowing up the beaches of the mont a wall of water slamming against the rocks with such force that spume was flung high into the air and for the first time justin and durand fully understood why it had been so difficult to find a guide morgan and jaspaer took the reins of the horses and led them off neither man seemed very sober to justin and he could only hope that thered be a stable groom on hand they could spare no more time though for baldric was already some distance away and beckoning to them come on he called and ill show you the fastest way to get up to the abbey if you go through the village and then up and around youll not get there for days this is much quicker baldrics shortcut was indeed that although it also required the agility of a mountain goat they scrambled up the slope after him were breathing heavily by the time they reached the narthex a vast arched porch that stretched along the west side of the abbey there you go baldric said with an expectant pause that lasted until justin added some extra coins to the pile already jangling in his money pouch you ought to have no trouble with old devi hes been the gatekeeper for the abbey since before the great flood and is well nigh as ancient as god nine out of ten nights he forgets to latch the door and since he sleeps like the dead you ought to be able to sneak right past him we outran the tides so you seem to be on a lucky streak durand grunted and headed for the porch justin paused long enough to throw a thank you over his shoulder our men have rented lodgings in the village you can sleep there if you like not needed i know a lass here wholl be happy to share her bed with me baldric had already started down the slope toward the village i do not know what youre up to and better that i do not good luck though he said before disappearing into the darkness it worked out as baldric had predicted the great wooden door was unlatched and they were able to creep past the elderly servant into the abbeys portico conferring in whispers they agreed that the door to their left was most likely the entrance to the almonry creaking the door open they slipped inside they found themselves in a vaulted stone chamber filled with slumbering pilgrims raising their lanterns they began to walk among the sleepers pausing before each muffled female form the search proved futile none of the faces revealed by the candle flames was arzhelas and the inevitable soon happened a woman sat up saw them and screamed the hall erupted into chaos people struggled to free themselves from their blankets most of them talking at once justin did his best to calm them down saying loudly that nothing was wrong that there was no cause for alarm his words went utterly unheeded it was durand who silenced them shouting quiet in a voice like thunder they subsided watching durand warily as he stalked among them mantle flaring hand on sword hilt a figure to intimidate anyone leery of authority once hed quelled the clamor he began to demand answers we are seeking a woman pilgrim garbed like most of you past her first youth tall for a female and slim with bright blue eyes prideful and a talker his words echoed into a void they regarded him blankly faces shuttered and eyes veiled hed bullied them into submission with no difficulty for the poor were always vulnerable to coercion of that kind justin could see though that these people would tell them nothing suspicion of the powerful selfprotection a sense of solidarity with one of their own fear they had any number of reasons to keep silent we mean this lady no harm justin said with all the conviction he could muster she is very dear to me and i fear for her safety as hed expected his sincerity was no more productive than durands belligerence it occurred to him that some of the bretons might not understand french and he tried again this time in his slow careful welsh and because he was watching their faces so intently he saw a young girl open her mouth then shut it quickly when the woman beside her clamped a hand on her arm crossing to her he knelt beside the child do you know this lady lass you can do her no greater kindness than to speak up the girl hesitated but then the woman rakethin and careworn hissed mikaela roit peoch putting her arm protectively around her daughters shoulders she looked defiantly up at justin and he knew hed get nothing from either of them getting to his feet he made one final attempt we will give twenty silver deniers to the person who can tell us of her whereabouts that was no small sum would buy a man four chickens but there were no takers and when durand swore and strode toward the door justin followed reluctantly out in the portico they communicated again in whispers keeping an eye upon the sleeping gatekeeper well have to start searching justin said softly but even as he spoke he realized that would be an impossible undertaking the abbey was the size of a small city honeycombed with crypts chapels narrow corridors and unlit stairwells durand was gazing back at the almonry wait he counseled refusing to say more justin fidgeted at his side for what seemed like an eternity he was about to leave durand and begin searching on his own when the almonry door hinges squeaked a moment later a shadowy form emerged and headed for the circle of light cast by their lanterns he looked surprisingly sleek and well fed for a pilgrim and wasted no time with preliminaries three sous he said for what i know about the woman that was nearly twice what justin had offered but he was not about to haggle reaching for his money pouch he said tell us and if youre lying durand warned ill come back and cut out your tongue the man smiled faintly ive been threatened by a bishop friend so your threats scare me not anyway i am not lying holding out his palm for the payment he said there are three people missing from the hall the woman you seek a poor doomed soul and a bothersome whelp your woman took the cub under her wing god knows why and she was hovering over the ailing man earlier in the day my guess is that youll find them all up in the infirmary after knocking lightly upon the infirmary door justin pushed it open the scent of herbs was heavy in the air mingling with the fetid odors of the sickroom the infirmarian was leaning over a bed tending to a man racked with convulsive coughing spasms at the sound of the opening door the monk glanced over his shoulder barking out a brusque what may i have a word with you brother the infirmarian took note of justins demeanor and clothing concluded that this was not one of the poor pilgrims from the almonry but a higherstatus guest and said more politely unless you are deathly sick it would be best if you come back later as you can see this patients needs cannot wait justins eyes were roaming the infirmary his hopes and heart plummeting when he failed to find arzhela i am not ill he assured the monk i am seeking a woman who came to you earlier this eve the infirmarian helped the dying man turn so that he could vomit into a small basin that one shes gone where did she go how would i know make yourself useful and hand me those clean towels justin did as he was bidden when did she leave was a youth with her a while ago the monk muttered so distractedly that justin saw further interrogation was useless the infirmarian wiped his patients face frowning at the streaks of blood in the basin almost as an afterthought he said why do you want this woman need i remind you where you are any man whod sin with a wench in gods house is courting eternal damnation when justin did not answer he glanced over his shoulder again just in time to see the door quietly closing where would she have gone if not back to the almonry surely shed not wander about with a killer on the loose durand snorted if youre offering a wager ill take it id not put anything past that fool woman fairness forced him to add grudgingly she did not know brother bernard had betrayed her so she may have thought the danger was past and she is not alone after all justin was doing his best to sound positive and optimistic it seems likely the lad is still with he checked himself catching a glimpse of durands expression what why do you look so sour it just seems very convenient for this stripling to turn up with arzhela at the almonry we know nothing about him do we how do we know the killer does not have a partner justin stared at him thank you for that comforting thought he said at last were accomplishing nothing standing here arguing since she did not go back down to the almonry she must have gone that way with durand on his heels he opened the door his lanterns flame illuminated a small chamber stark and simple with an exposed timber beam ceiling and sparse furnishings an altar a long trestle table several coffers and under an archway a large stone bath bloody hell durand muttered this is where they prepare their dead for burial justin agreed with him and since arzhela was clearly not there he continued on into the adjoining building a central nave flanked by smaller bays on each side bitterly cold and austere it looked sepulchral in the blanched moonlight filtering through the high windows of the nave the men knew at once what it wasthe abbey cemetery and charnel house here the monks would be buried until the cemetery was too full for any more graves and then their bones would be dug up and stored in the charnel house some ossuaries were constructed to display skulls and skeletons as a reminder to all of mans mortality the charnel house at mont st michel was partially walled up much to their relief they were not squeamish about death but the sight of bleached human bones would have been ominous under the circumstances justin spoke for them both when he said lets get out of here the corridor led them past the huge stone cistern on into another chapel by now theyd figured out where they were agreeing that this must be the crypt of st martin their guess was confirmed when they discovered they could go no farther for st martins chapel was not within the monks enclosure here wealthy benefactors of the abbey would have the honor of being buried under the protection and sanctity of the holy relics preserved above them in the south transept of the church this beautiful stone sanctuary did not have the same oppressive atmosphere as the funeral chapel and the charnel house but durand and justin did not linger hastily retracing their steps when theyd gotten back to the funeral chapel they paused to plan their next move damned if i know where shes gone durand confessed i do not see how she could have gotten entry into the abbey enclosure laypeople are not welcome in the cloistered areas and the mere sight of a woman in their sanctum would have sent the monks into a frenzy of horror i suppose this is neither the time nor the place to discuss the madness that drives a man to renounce the pleasures of the female flesh his shrug said it all as did the bemused shake of his head i admit i am confounded de quincy all i can think to do is go back to the almonry see if we can scare some of those good folk into being more forthright justin had no intention of letting durand terrorize the pilgrims but he was at a loss too mayhap we ought to start looking for he stopped seized with a superstitious belief that to say it would make it so durand read his thoughts easily enough for they were his too where was the best place to dispose of a body the cistern what of the charnel house there would be a diabolic brilliance in that hiding a murder victim under a mound of bones they descended into the stairwell in silence their spurs striking sparks on the steps how many thousands of pilgrims must have passed this way their feet gradually wearing deep grooves in the stones arzhela herself had climbed these stairs justin was sure of it so where had she gone he stopped so abruptly that durand bumped into him i think i know where she is he said cutting off durands complaint in midsentence we went down a great flight of stairs then up another to reach the infirmary i was there de quincy i remember what of it we were sure wed find her abovestairs in the infirmary so we passed it by the chapel of notredamesousterrethe holiest part of the abbey it makes sense does it not it made enough sense to durand that he was annoyed he had not thought of it himself women were partial to the blessed mary all knew that besides where else could she have gone they reached the bottom of the stairs at the same time elbowing each other for space in the narrow corridor but they halted at the foot of the great gallery steps their eyes drawn to the door on their right standing slightly ajar now that the moment of truth was upon them they hesitated the ancient chapel of notredamesousterre was the very heart of the abbey although it had long since been replaced by the church above it one of its two naves had been preserved their lantern light fell upon brick arches that had been old when norse raiders were still plundering the breton coast its original windows had been blocked up and shadows held sway filling every corner every cranny with the opaque darkness that knew neither sun nor stars justins disappointment was bitter beyond wormwood and gall too disheartened to speak he stopped in the doorway leaving it to durand to voice the obvious shed not venture into a cave like this not even arzhela is that crazed he turned away and justin slowly started to follow but hed taken only a step or two before a memory flickered he stood very still scarcely breathing until the image crystallized when theyd passed the chapel on their way to the infirmary there had been a glimmer of light coming from that open door raising his lantern he scanned the wall until he located an alcove it held an oil lamp the wick was unlit but when he reached out it was warm to the touch lady arzhela his words went unanswered echoes on the wind moving deeper into the chapel he felt an impending sense of dread with every step he took lady arzhela he found her in a small sanctuary in the eastern end of the chapel crumpled behind the stone altar a thick tallow candle lay on the ground near her feet he almost tripped over it she was lying on her side one arm outstretched her pilgrim hat had been knocked off and her veil was askew revealing several reddishblonde strands until then hed not known the color of her hair he was close enough now to see the darkening stain across her breast almost black against the russet of her robe christ on the cross the voice was durands justin himself said nothing for his throat had closed up too tight for speech he knew it made no sense to grieve so for a woman hed known this briefly but his sorrow was like a physical pain as sharpedged as the knife that had stabbed her hed not realized until now looking down at her body just how much hed liked arzhela de dinan kneeling beside her he said huskily by this holy water and by his most tender mercy may the lord forgive thee whatever thou hast sinned that was all he knew of the sacrament of extreme unction it was a meaningless gesture anyway for only a priest could absolve her of her sins and then he caught his breath for her lashes flickered and her eyes opened the blue of the sea was gone drowned in blackness for her pupils were dilated with the shadow of approaching death she seemed to recognize him though for her lips parted and she gasped out one word her voice was as weak as a dying candle and he leaned forward to be sure hed heard her correctly for a heartbeat he felt her breath against his ear as her lips moved again but when he looked into her face the light was already fading from her eyes does she live he swallowed then shook his head no the other man said nothing but after a moment he made the sign of the cross justin continued to hold arzhela in his arms reluctant to let her down onto the cold stone floor it was then that he saw ita wet smear upon the tiles he stared at the limp hand the fingers stained with red had she tried to write her murderers name in her own blood as her life bled away holy mother of god they whirled toward the sound the infirmarian flanked by two younger monks was standing in the doorway of the chapel staring at them in horror chapter february mont st michel normandy jesu durand said softly we knocked over the bleeding hive justin was in no position at the moment to appreciate the metaphor or he might have agreed it was unusually apt the infirmarian had rushed into the chapel a courageous act under the circumstances but the other two monks fled and within moments they heard the muffled clanging of a fire bell kneeling by arzhela the elderly monk searched in vain for signs of life shaking his head when justin asked if he could adminster extreme unction i am not a priest he said getting stiffly to his feet and beginning to edge away from them as if only then becoming aware of his own danger we did not do it justin said hastily we are not her killers it was then that the chapel began to resemble an overturned hive in one moment there were just the three of them standing over arzhelas body in the next monks beyond counting were there swarming into the crypt like angry bees making ready to defend their nest voices were raised accusations flung prayers mingled with expressions of dismay and revulsion and chaos reigned justin and durand found themselves backed against one of the granite pillars surrounded by shouting gesturing monks they seemed more upset by the desecration of the church than they did by the killing of a woman at least to judge by the epithets being hurled at the two menungodly profane and accursed outpacing the occasional cry of murderers justins declarations of their innocence went unheeded even unheard by this time the male servants of the abbey were streaming into the crypt too as were some of the pilgrims and durand said lowvoiced it is now or never de quincy justin stared at him incredulously for escape was the one option not open to them are you mad you cannot slaughter monks in gods church ive done worse the other man said grimly his hand tightening on the hilt of his sword they have no weapons but their tongues you want to wait till they get the whole town up here baying for our blood before justin could respond there was a sudden movement in the wall of bodies encircling them men moving back clearing a path the newcomer was a man no longer young tall and almost gaunt with silvered hair that had once been flaxen he was clad like the others in a simple black habit but upon him it had a certain stark elegance justin guessed at once that this was the prior abbot jourdains secondincommand everything about him proclaiming an authority sanctioned by god he was the veritable embodiment of dispassion and the cool rationality of the intellect but justin could take meager comfort in that for the prior bore an unsettling resemblance to aubrey de quincy bishop of chester his father the prior lifted his hand and the noise stilled i am clement de roches he declared investing that popular papal name with prideful echoes of grandeur i am prior of the blessed abbey of st michael who are you that have dared to defile the sacred altar of our lady justins grief and fear gave way then to rage that arzhelas death seemed of so little importance to these holy men of god a woman has also lost her life my lord prior a good woman why is that less offensive than bloodstains on a tiled floor good going man durand muttered justin ignored him meeting the priors piercing pale eyes without flinching because the monk said coldly murder is a crime befouling a church is sacrilege we are guilty of neither my lord prior we did not harm this woman spilled none of her blood i was told you were found kneeling beside her body yes and does that sound like the action of a killer the infirmarian can tell you that i was cradling her in my arms seeking to comfort her in her last moments when the infirmarian tersely confirmed this the prior turned his inscrutable gaze back upon justin men have been known to kill that which they love but not with an unbloodied sword the monks retreated a step when justin slid his sword from its scabbard only the prior standing his ground look at the blade my lord prior do you see even a droplet of blood the same holds true for my eating knife and for the weapons of my companion turning he demanded show them durand and the other man did you could have hidden the murder knife a voice from the back of the crypt called out and there were murmurings of agreement search the chapel justin challenged if it is not found that proves our innocence unless you are claiming that we stabbed her and fled to dispose of the weapon only then to return to the murder scene so we might be found with her body a number of the men had already begun to prowl the chapel hunting for a dagger when they failed to find one some of them seemed willing to reconsider their certainty about justin and durands guilt the prior continued to regard them impassively though and raising a hand for silence again he said the woman was one of gods poorwhich you are not brother nicolas told me that you came to the infirmary in search of her why what did you want with her justin did not know how to answer this question for neither the truth nor lies would serve them well if he revealed arzhelas true identity the prior was likely to send an urgent message to the duchess constance the last one in christendom whom he wanted involved in this but what lie could they devise that would seem plausible to the prior what reason could they give for seeking out a needy female pilgrim that would not sound suspicious or immoral to the prior she is my sister all heads swung toward durand including justins he stared at them defiantly daring them to doubt him i do not know what name she was using at the almonry but her real name is felicia de lacy her husband holds lands of king richard south of bayeux the prior looked down at the woman on the floortruly looked at her for the first time her coloring is similar to yours he conceded but i find it difficult to believe that a woman of gentle birth would be posing as an impoverished pilgrim look at her hands her nails do you see any calluses or blisters on her palms no i do not the prior straightened up and stepped away from the body she has the hands of a lady he admitted but why was she here in disguise she wanted to take holy vows shed been trying for a year to persuade her husband to give his consent to no avail she finally declared that the almighty did not want her to wait any longer and ran away her husband has been looking for her and i thought it best to find her first he has the devils own temper so when i discovered that shed gone on pilgrimage to the mont we came after her durand glanced at arzhelas body back at the prior we were not in time her husband must have found her first durands tale of a pious wife whod wanted only to serve the almighty found a receptive audience in this chapel filled with monks but justin kept his eyes upon the prior knowing that he and he alone would be the arbiter of their fate prior clement took his time in passing his judgment there is logic in what you say he said at last mayhap things are not as they first seemed but it is not for me to decide what ought to be done durand cocked a brow who then the provost in genets no a murder committed upon abbey lands falls within our jurisdiction and this matter must be heard in our lord abbots court well then well stay here at the abbey until the abbot returns and can question us justin offered cooperatively and the prior inclined his head but then he said alas we will require more than your word a woman has been cruelly murdered and a holy place polluted with blood this church must be purified ere a mass can be said here again i intend no insult when i say that you must be held until abbot jourdain returns held how durands eyes narrowed and where it is not necessary under the circumstances to confine you in the abbots dungeon if you agree to surrender your weapons you may await the lord abbot in more comfortable surroundings we will surrender our weapons durand said when we see these comfortable surroundings for ourselves the prior was not accustomed to being contradicted and did not take it well my lord prior justin said before he could respond can your monks see that lady felicia is treated with the honor she deserves again that proud head inclined she will be taken to the chapel of st etienne where our own brothers are prepared for their final journey thank you prior clement will your brethren pray for her too justin asked and the emotion in his voice earned him an approving glance from durand for the monks murmured sympathetically and even the prior seemed to thaw somewhat but justins grieving was raw and real and he could only hope that prayers for lady felicia de lacy would count toward the salvation of arzhelas immortal soul the priors comfortable surroundings turned out to be the porters lodge a small sparsely furnished hall underneath the abbots private chambers it was still vastly preferable to the dungeons that lay below the lodge accessible only through a trapdoor in the vaulting that trapdoor served as an unwelcome reminder to the men of how narrowly they had avoided those subterranean accommodations for now the hall was deep in shadows and filled with the damp bonechilling cold of the tides laying siege to the mont to justins astonishment durand rolled up in one of the blankets provided by the monks remarked that lying awake would do them no good and went to sleep justin did not have such icy control over his nerves and he tossed and turned for hours listening to the even rhythm of the other mans breathing and the sound of the surf beating against the rocks but hed been in the saddle for hours in a day of turmoil and trauma and finally he too fell into an uneasy doze when he awakened durand was standing over him holding out a cup the monks brought us a loaf of bread and a flagon of wine to break our fast he said i suppose it is a good sign that they are feeding us but when they opened the door i saw they are relying upon more than our honor or goodwill to keep us here there are armed guards outside justin took the cup sat up and winced for even the body of a twentyoneyearold was not immune to the physical abuses of the past day and night grimacing he sought to wash away the foul taste in his mouth with several swallows of wine durand was pacing looking as rumpled and edgy as justin felt when he stopped and glanced toward justin the younger man said sharply do not say it durand i do not want to hear that this is my fault for not agreeing to hack our way free even if wed somehow gotten out of the chapel and then the abbey where could we have gone wed still have been trapped on an island and wed no longer be able to claim we were innocent of murder innocence is a greatly overrated defense durand sat down on the floor beside justin and leaned back against the wall actually i was going to say you handled yourself well last night that was quick thinking about the unbloodied weapons it helps too that you can so convincingly act humble and servile with men like the prior a little arselicking can never hurt justin was too weary to summon up any anger you bought us some time with that sisterofyours story that was quick thinking too but then its truth telling you have a problem with not lying you realize though that we are going to have to tell abbot jourdain the truth or at least a good portion of it hed been half expecting durand to argue was surprised when he did not i know durand admitted the good abbot is not likely to have forgotten his encounter with us at antrain and it is only a matter of time ere arzhelas true identity becomes known luckily that monk over in genets is on his deathbed for hed have recognized her in a heartbeat i got the sense that there was something going on between them not so lucky for him justin pointed out but durand was oblivious to sarcasm when it served his purposes i assume you have one of those royal letters you like to flaunt identifying you as the queens man thank god they did not search us but they are not quite sure how to treat us are they not exactly guests not yet murder suspects yes i have a letter from the queen justin confirmed i can see we are in agreement about which fork in the road to take the abbot is king richards man so the less said about john the better i suppose i can always explain to the abbot that you are one of my hirelings or lackeys the corner of durands mouth twitched in acknowledgment of that payback jab if the abbot proves to be a skeptical sort we might end up in some kind of confinement until the queen returns from germany but as long as it is in normandy and not brittany ill not complain justin doubted that exceedingly hed met few men who complained as frequently or as vociferously as durand did it seemed foolish though to continue their usual squabbling when they were caught in the same trap he began to speak instead about the tale they must stitch together for the abbot and they spent the remainder of the morning deciding how much of the truth he should be told at least they were no longer bound by the need to shield arzhela it mattered naught to her now if her plotting came to light but that was a dubious comfort to justin hed had little time yet to mourn arzhela but mourn her he would she was a brave charming reckless woman whod deserved a far better end and he would regret to his last breath that he had not been able to save her he and durand both felt that simon de lusignan was the prime suspect in her murder shed tried to protect him not giving up his name to them a lovers folly that had cost her dearly the most likely scenario they agreed was that shed learned something else from simon something of such significance that shed no longer felt safe at constances court proof that constance knew the letter was a forgery or that de lusignan was much more deeply involved in the conspiracy than shed first realized guy de lavals testimony had put simon in that shadowy inner circle which was mysterious in and of itself how had a younger son of a minor poitevin lord gained such influence at the breton court and what secret was so dangerous that hed kill to keep it quiet they speculated too about the missing youngster the boy arzhela had taken under her wing had he been present when she was slain was fear keeping him quiet or something more sinister for all they knew durand reminded justin hed wielded the dagger himself arzhela had trusted the boy shed not have been on her guard with him youd suspect a babe in its cradle justin scoffed and then jumped to his feet so did durand but the footsteps theyd heard passed by the door they assumed that the provost would cross over from genets sooner or later hopefully later hed be occupied upon his return with the brutal attacks upon brothers andrev and bernard and then of course hed have to wait for low tide the provost could pose a problem if he wanted to interrogate them straightaway not waiting for abbot jourdain to return hed know about their visit to genets know about their confrontation with his drunken deputy and for certes hed want to know why theyd been so interested in the missing lady arzhela theyd just have to play for time if it came to that hint to the prior that the provost was infringing upon the abbeys jurisdiction a hint ought to be more than enough men of god were as territorial as wolves durand gibed and justin agreed with him thinking of that superb politician his lord bishop father but so were lords and queens and welsh princes and even cocky norman guides when their isolation was finally ended it did not happen in the way theyd expected the door opened and two men were ushered into the lodge then the door closed again justin and durand were on their feet staring in surprise at crispin and rufus they had been relieved of their weapons but they seemed to be in good shape showed no bruises or scratches as soon as they saw justin and durand they both began to talk at once and it took a few moments to settle them down we told the monks wed done nothing wrong crispin said plaintively but they said wed be set free once youd proved your innocence of a murder my lords you will be able to do that soon i hope from your mouth to gods ear durand said sourly how did morgan and jaspaer escape the net and how did they net you in the first place who told them that you were our men they exchanged sheepish looks before crispin confessed we told them the village was overrun with rumors and gossip something had happened up at the abbey in the night but no one seemed to know what so rufus and i we decided to go look for you when durand called him a blundering lackwit he flushed but protested with some spirit that is not fair sir durand we did not know you were murder suspects not until it was too late justin had an unpleasant thought you did not tell them the woman was not durands sister did you crispin shook his head emphatically when they began to ask us questions rufus whispered that we should be dumb and we were we kept saying we knew nothing about your business that youd not told us why we were going to the abbey and we spoke mostly english the usually taciturn rufus interrupted which seemed to vex them enormously i assume morgan and jaspaer had the common sense to keep their distance then durand said caustically and looked thoroughly disgusted when crispin admitted that theyd tried to talk them out of going up to the abbey and wished mournfully that hed listened the rest of the day passed without incident the porters lodge was lit with small narrow windows little bigger than arrow slits and as daylight faded away they were left in darkness lacking lamps or even candles at vespers an abbey servant was sent in to empty the chamber pot but he said nothing about the bloodshed over in genets and claimed none knew when abbot jourdain might return he was willing to be bribed though agreeing to bring them an extra flagon of wine with their meal and more blankets the bells of compline were still echoing on the wind when the men settled down for another endless uncomfortable night theyd been sleeping for several hours when the door was thrust open crispin slept on but the other three jerked upright blinking up blindly into a ring of blazing torches it was like looking straight into the sun and as they squinted trying to make out the dark faceless forms behind the torches a voice said well and a second voice answered yes they are the ones by now they were stumbling to their feet but the light was already retreating the door slammed shut and they were left alone pallid grey light was seeping into the hall when they were roused again men bearing torches advanced into the chamber followed by others the former were obviously abbey servants the latter just as obviously were not they were armed and on the alert putting justin in mind of welltrained sheepdogs confident of their ability to control the flock the prior entered next accompanied by two men in their middle years this is jocelin de curcy the provost of genets he said and this is sir reynaud boterel a third man had entered younger than the others wearing an expensive mantle fastened with a large gold brooch and the prior introduced him as the lord of chateaugontier yves de la jaille before either justin or durand could respond the prior raised his hand in an imperious demand for silence there is nothing you could say that i want to hear he said coolly the time for talking is past i am here to tell you that you are to be handed over to the lord of chateaugontier you are no longer the responsibility of our abbey and we waive any and all rights to prosecute you in our jurisdiction justin stared at the prior baffled during their stay at laval emma had made casual mention of the lordship of chateaugontier and so justin knew it was a barony in maine this made no sense to him why would an angevin lord take them into custody he glanced over at durand was not reassured to notice durand had lost color i do not follow this prior clement justin said cautiously it was my understanding that we were awaiting the return of abbot jourdain and it was my understanding the prior said scathingly that the dead woman was felicia de lacy whereas in truth she is lady arzhela de dinan the missing cousin of duchess constance neither justin nor durand spoke for what was there to say to that justin was getting a very bad feeling about this and that was before the door was shoved open again the man stalking into the hall was young fairhaired and all too familiar striding forward simon de lusignan regarded them in silence for a very long moment the last time a man had looked at justin with that much hostility hed been fighting for his life with a godless outlaw called gilbert the fleming simon had blue eyes almost as brilliantly blue as arzhelas narrowed to smoldering slits and his mouth was contorted his lips peeled back from his teeth in a feral ferocious grin you thought you would get away with it he said and you might have if not for me but i reached the abbey in time to identify that sweet lady you murdered in time to see justice done durand tensed deciding he had nothing left to lose and justin might well have followed his lead he was never to know for sure though de la jailles menatarms had been moving closer while simon de lusignan claimed center stage and at an unseen signal from yves de la jaille they sprang into action flinging themselves upon the prisoners outnumbered and unarmed they were quickly subdued crispin and rufus offered no resistance holding up their hands like innocent bystanders in the wrong place at the wrong time justin struggled briefly before his brain overrode his bodys panic and once he no longer fought them his attackers stopped hitting him durand continued to kick and curse even after hed been immobilized not yielding until simon de lusignan stepped toward him and kneed him brutally in the groin durand sank to his knees his teeth tearing into his lower lip to stifle any cry and simon would have kicked him again had the prior not protested yves de la jaille stepped between simon and the greyfaced durand saying back off simon and though his words were given as a censure his tone was casual almost nonchalant yves signaled again and his men dragged durand to his feet set about roping his hands behind his back justin was bound next but when they started toward crispin and rufus yves stopped them weve got the hawks need not bother with the fledglings leave them for the provost to deal with the provost did not look pleased by that offhand dismissal but he nodded to his own men who took crispin and rufus into custody they submitted meekly enough but when de la jailles menatarms began pushing justin and durand toward the door crispin blurted out an involuntary protest wait where are you taking them to their surprise they actually got an answer yves looked back over his shoulder to the court of the duchess of brittany so they may answer for the murder of her kinswoman chapter february road to fougeres brittany the sky was a pale silvery blue and the few clouds drifting by were white and fleecy the wind was erratic almost playful a sheathed dagger instead of a gusting february blade bare beech and chestnut trees stood sentinel along the road dappled by sunlight for winterweary bretons a day like this was a gift from god to justin it seemed especially cruel that he should be given a bittersweet beguiling glimpse of the spring he was not likely to see he was making a sincere effort not to surrender to despair after all he did not have a hangmans noose around his neck yet optimism did not come easily to a foundling though nor was it in his nature to lie to himself and he could envision nothing but trouble at the court of the breton duchess his mount suddenly veered to the right with his hands bound behind his back he could only guide the stallion with the pressure of his knees and he was unable to keep the horse from swerving to the end of its tether the rider leading it glanced over his shoulder and swore first at the animal and then at justin another stallion shied too and its unease proved contagious for several moments men and horses milled about in the road as the former sought to get the latter under control by the time order was restored it was decided they should take a break and lord yves ordered them to dismount this was the second time theyd halted since leaving mont st michel they seemed in no hurry to reach fougeres and that was fine with justin who would have been content to ride on into infinity he did not think that was true though for durand he could only imagine how painful this ride must be for a man whod been kicked in the ballocks a few hours ago durands face was a mask of silent suffering sweat trickling down into his beard his jaw so tightly clenched that not even a breath could escape that taut slash of a mouth the guards got them off their horses quite simply by pulling them from the saddle pushing them down upon the ground and warning them to move only if you want to lose a body part wineskins were passed around the lord yves and reynaud boterel walked a few feet away and began to talk quietly glancing occasionally toward their prisoners simon de lusignan was tightening his stallions saddle girth but he too watched the prisoners with an unblinking intensity that did not bode well for their future the horses were led down to the river to drink but justin and durand did without until one of the guards walked by and justin asked for water hed chosen this particular guard with carea cheerful garrulous redhead called thierry by the others whod been chattering like a magpie since they departed the abbey as hed hoped thierry could not resist any audience even if it consisted of doomed men and the guard paused considered and then shrugged why not walking over to one of the tethered horses he pulled a small metal cup from a saddlebag and filled it with river water leaning over he held the cup to justins mouth letting him drink his fill when he turned toward durand justin willed the other man not to do anything stupid and for once durand did not gulping the water as fast as thierry could pour it into his mouth are you one of the lord yvess men justin asked casually as thierry straightened up taking the bait the guard confirmed that he was adding that he was angevin like his lord not one of those stiffnecked bretons why is your lord serving the breton duchess justin queried trying to keep the man talking thierry stepped back and stretched but did not move away my lord is betrothed to lord andre de vitres daughter he was at the duchesss court when she got word that her cousin had gone missing and she selected him to investigate her disappearance also sir reynaud with a toss of his head toward yvess companion he is a former seneschal of rennes or mayhap it is nantes i cannot tell one breton town from another if truth be told how did simon de lusignan get picked him thierry glanced over at the glowering de lusignan and lowered his voice like someone about to share a ribald bit of gossip the duchess did not send that one he showed up at the abbey on his own was already there when we arrived dropping his voice even further he confided that simon and the lady arzhela were having at it if you know what i mean the way i heard it they had a hot quarrel and he went storming off whilst she headed for the abbey that is why the duchess was not too alarmed by abbot jourdains news everyone seemed to think she was off making peace with the lad he contorted his face waggishly as if implying there was no accounting for female tastes id think the lady arzhela could do better than de lusignan justin prompted and thierry grinned youll get no argument from me friend the lady arzhela was a good mistress he declared winking in case justin missed the double entendre and a sight to gladden the eye for all that she was no longer young as for her laddie over there he may have a ready cock but he also has a hot head and as many enemies as he has debts or so ive been told no the lady could have done much better for herself thierry seemed to remember then that he was speaking to the men accused of her murder for he scowled and snatched his cup back why did you kill her she was a good soul kindhearted for all that she was highborn never did harm to man or beast i did not justin said quietly as god almighty is my witness i did not thierry regarded him for a moment damned if i do not almost believe you a pity for no one else will friend throwing a glance over his shoulder toward simon de lusignan he said confidentially that one pitched a firking fit when he identified the body carried on something fierce took us by surprise he did who knew she was more to him than a fine piece of tail hes been ranting ever since that death is too good for the likes of you and if hed had his way youd have been hanged then and there the prior would have none of that but my lord yves and sir reynaud might be easier to convince our men think so for they are wagering that youll not reach fougeres alive the village of antrain looked no less desolate and forlorn at second sight than it had when theyd first passed through it seemed bereft of life the villagers knew enough to hide when menatarms rode by they continued on and the cottages soon vanished in the distance the countryside was deserted an occasional hawk soared overhead and once a brown flash that may have been a weasel ran across the road spooking the horses after they forded the river loisance they did not stop again until they reached the tiny hamlet of tremblay like antrain it seemed abandoned for the inhabitants had run off at the approach of armed men the elderly priest hovered anxiously in the doorway of his ancient church as they reined in he did not appear much relieved when they told him they were halting only to rest their horses gathering up a small dog that looked as old as he was he retreated into the church and bolted the door justin was as apprehensive as the priest when they began to dismount for thierrys warning had been echoing in his ears like a funeral dirge once theyd been dragged off their horses he and durand were herded toward the small cemetery and told to stay put against a crumbling stone wall as they watched wineskins were shared and men wandered off to find places to urinate the lord yves and reynaud boterel stretched their legs and laughed together laughter that stilled as they approached their prisoners they stood for a moment looking over at justin and durand with a detached animosity that was somehow more chilling than outright anger would have been i am not looking forward to telling the duchess about this killing of her cousin lord yves said soberly i was never sure how much fondness there was between them for they could not have been more unlike but they are bloodkin and the duchess takes that very seriously indeed at least we can deliver up her killers that may provide some small measure of comfort yes it was lucky that simon got to the abbey when he did if he had not been able to identify her body she might have been buried as this ones runaway sister yves glared at durand does it seem to you though that simon is somewhat evasive about their reasons for the killing i know he told us she had trouble with them at vitre but he really has not explained why theyd follow her all the way to mont st michel does it matter sometimes the less a man knows the better off he is justin had been eavesdropping intently but hed learned little from this conversation that could benefit them durand was leaning against the wall his eyes closed but justin knew hed been listening too on impulse justin raised his voice calling out my lords if you want to know more about the murder why not ask me they exchanged skeptical glances and lord yves jeered as if we could believe a word that came out of your mouth theyd moved closer though and justin dared to hope that he might get his first chance to defend himself but simon de lusignan was already striding toward them coming so fast that heads were turning in his direction men looking around to see what had alarmed him do not waste your time talking to these craven killers my lord yves these are men of the worst sort men who murdered a defenseless woman attacked monks and profaned two of gods houses how could you trust anything theyd say justin and durand stared at him in disbelief even lord yves looked startled what are you saying that they are the ones who did the killings in genets too i thought the provost and the prior said the attacks took place in the afternoon ere these two arrived at the mont they were fooled think about it my lord what are the chances of two different murderers striking on the same day nay they silenced the monks then came back to the abbey and made a show of crossing over to genets to deflect suspicion from themselves they never expected after all to be caught bloodyhanded over lady arzhelas body that is an arrant lie justin protested too outraged for caution we can prove that we were nowhere near genets when he got no further for simon lunged forward slammed him into the wall and backhanded him across the face justin stumbled and almost fell his head swam and he tasted blood in his mouth when his vision cleared the first thing he saw was the glint of sunlight upon the blade of simons sword he tensed fully expecting to feel that steel thrust into his belly for the expression on the other mans face was murderous easy simon yves was speaking soothingly like one talking to a drunk or a madman you do not need that lad hes not going anywhere is he not it looks to me like hes trying to escape simon took a backward step but as he swung reynaud boterel grabbed his arm and the blade sliced through air instead of justins flesh de lusignan spun around with a snarl balancing on the balls of his feet like a cat about to pounce they deserve death the bastards killed arzhela and theyll answer for it to the duchess yves pointed out still using that patient patronizing tone and simon shook his head vehemently i want them to answer to me he spat i want the pleasure of killing them myself he seemed about to renew his attack when a sudden shout echoed from the road my lords riders approach simon hesitated but the moment was past and he knew it sheathing his sword he turned away with a curse that would have caused a sailor to blink lord yves and reynaud boterel were moving toward the newcomers waving to attract their attention justin sagged back against the wall he could hear durands heavy breathing and he wondered if his own breath sounded that ragged jesu he whispered and spat blood onto the ground i did warn you the voice was thierrys sidling closer he murmured out of the side of his mouth i do not know whether you got a reprieve or not that lord riding up is alain de dinan he is seneschal of brittany which is in your favor but he is also the lady arzhelas nephew alain de dinan was a pale balding man approaching his fourth decade he was not particularly prepossessing in appearance looking more like a mildmannered church clerk than one of brittanys greatest barons but within moments of his arrival he took complete charge of the situation and the prisoners he was on his way to mont st michel having learned of arzhelas disappearance and it was obvious that he was not expecting such a tragic end to his mission when told of arzhelas murder he seemed staggered by the news waving the others away and turning his back until hed gotten his emotions under control those few moments of grace gave justin and durand time to brace themselves for he was soon stalking toward them flanked by simon and the other lords the lady arzhela was my uncle rolands widow he said in a voice like a rasp the wife of his winter years she was not my bloodkin but she made my uncle happy during their marriage and she became very dear to me she will be avenged i promise you that you will die for what you have done we are not guilty justin said wearily if that matters at all from what ive seen so far of breton justice it does not you have not yet begun to taste breton justice alain de dinan folded his arms across his chest regarding them disdainfully but if you have something to say say it then i warn you though that if you seek to besmirch a great ladys name my lord simon de lusignan interrupted hastily this was not a lovers crime it was far more foul alain de dinan frowned and it occurred to justin that he might be the only man in brittany who did not know of arzhelas liaison with simon de lusignan what do you mean he demanded stiffening indignantly when simon sought to draw him aside his distaste for simon was so evident that justin dared to indulge himself in a moment of hope durand older and wiser knew better reluctantly allowing simon to lead him away from the others alain conferred privately with the younger man for a few moments and when he turned back to the prisoners his demeanor had changed gone was the grieving kinsman seeking justice for his aunt his face was utterly impassive his eyes shuttered his guard up get these men onto their horses he said curtly we have a long ride to fougeres fougeres was thirty miles from mont st michel an easy onedays ride in summer a more problematic undertaking in winter favored by the mild weather and dry roads driven by alain de dinans implacable will they pushed on into the gathering dusk several hours later they were riding slowly along the street known as the bourg vieil heading for the castle night had long since fallen and the townspeople were abed the air had cooled rapidly after losing the sun and the wind carried to them the smoke of hearth fires and the sodden scent of the marshes and then the pungent sickening stink of the tanners quarter the fetid stench of dog dung tallow and fish oil urine slaked lime and fermenting barley a dog barked and then another followed by some sleepy cursing lanterns gleamed along the castle battlements and as they approached they were quickly challenged and as quickly given admittance justin and durand were trapped in a circle of fire surrounded by smoking torches theyd been shoved into the great hall which was emptying of drowsy servants and menatarms whod been rudely told to seek beds elsewhere there was a low buzz of noise it sounded as if the entire castle had been roused from sleep raoul de fougeres soon entered the hall hed obviously dressed in haste and looked thoroughly annoyed but after a brief colloquy with alain de dinan his anger dissipated and he stared at the prisoners with an odd expression one that seemed both suspicious and speculative the highborn guests had begun to stumble disheveled and yawning into the hall andre de vitre hair rumpled reeking of wine abbot jourdain eyes puffy and swollen with sleep the enigmatic canon from toulouse immaculately garbed even at that hour raouls young grandson who seemed as wide awake and alert as if it were midday others whom justin did not recognize word was already spreading of arzhelas murder shock and grief and rage intermingling until they were indistinguishable one from the other but it was some time before the duchess constance made her appearance her long dark hair spilled down her back inadequately covered by a carelessly pinned veil she wore a furtrimmed mantle that flared open as she walked giving her audience a glimpse of a laceedged chemise and soft bed slippers peeked out from under the hem her fingers were barren of rings her throat bare to the night air stripped of the elaborate accoutrements of power she still dominated by sheer force of will at once becoming the center of attention the focal point of all eyes what nonsense is this she demanded why was i awakened who has her head swiveled her eyes darting from one man to another it is not arthur it is not my son no madame no no evil has befallen the young lord that i swear to you upon the surety of my soul alain de dinan came forward from the crowd and made the formal obeisance of subject to sovereign it might have appeared incongruous or even comical coming from a man in such travelstained disarray to a woman in a state of undress but his gravity conferred a somber dignity upon his act and as she gazed down at his bowed head constance sensed that there was tragedy in the making as long as it spared her sunlight and joy her onlybegotten son she could cope with it whatever it may be and she said swiftly rise my lord what have you come to tell me your cousin the lady arzhela is dead madame cruelly slain in the holy shrine of st michael justins memories of the ensuing events were never clear blurred and random like a halfforgotten dream or an unfinished puzzle for bits and pieces were missing he remembered the heat of the torches upon the skin of his face the way the smoke spiraled upward toward the vaulted roof as if seeking escape the treacherous weakness of his body which yearned only for sleep the duchesss dark eyes filling with unshed tears the hall resonating with prayers for the murdered womans soul and then with the mindless cries of the mob calling for vengeance forced to his knees before the duchess he looked up into a face as pale and unyielding as chiseled marble this was a woman to demand every last portion of her just due be it in coins vassalage deference or blood scriptures say he shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy she said enunciating each word as if it were carved from ice justin swallowed with difficulty for his throat was clogged with the dust of the road but a bishops son could quote from scriptures too and he said as evenly as he could holy writ also says that vengeance belongeth to god raoul de fougeress hand closed on his shoulder fingers digging painfully into his flesh watch your tongue when you speak to the duchess constance did not need his intercession i spoke of judgment not vengeance justin raised his head and looked her full in the face there can be no justice my lady if we are not heard and weve been given no chance to speak to deny our guilt constance showed no emotion but after a moment she said speak then the words were no sooner out of her mouth than the abbot jourdain gave a sudden sharp cry i know these men i met them in the village of antrain two days past your grace they were seeking the lady arzhela and with great urgencynow i know why so do i simon de lusignan shoved his way forward saying loudly i know these men too madame they came to you at vitre escorting the lady emma aunt to the english king indeed constances voice was dangerously dispassionate so they are king richards men far worse your grace simon turned toward the prisoners his mouth curving into a twisted triumphant smile they are agents of the count of mortain they serve at the devils pleasure they serve john after that there was nothing more to be said simon de lusignan claimed that they had murdered the lady arzhela at johns behest weaving a tale with great gaping holes in it for he offered no reason why john should order her assassination no one seemed troubled by this though for no one tugged at the loose threads that would have unraveled his story the mere mention of john was enough to seal their fate as they were restrained none too gently by the guards a heavy trapdoor was raised dragged forward justin found himself staring down into a black abyss a sudden slash of a knife blade and his hands were freed he assumed that was to enable him to descend a rope ladder but then he was roughly shoved and went tumbling down into the dark it was not that great a fall about ten feet or so but the impact drove all the air from his lungs he lay still for several moments stunned until durand came plummeting after him there was a thud as he hit the ground then silence justin rolled over was starting to sit up when the trapdoor was slammed shut and they were left alone in the worst of fougeres castles underground dungeons the utter blackness disoriented at first justin could not even see his hand in front of his face that past summer his investigation in wales had led to an ancient roman mine he remembered peering down into its depths thankful he need not descend into that bottomless shaft that welsh mine seemed almost benign now that he found himself buried alive in this netherworld hellhole he fought a desperate silent struggle with panic a battle that left him limp and drained his eyes were slowly adjusting to the dark and he was becoming aware now of the overwhelming stench of death and decay breathing this air was like inhaling in a cesspit it was bitter cold and damp when he touched one of the stone walls he discovered that it was coated with some sort of slimy growth getting stiffly to his feet he explored the dimensions of their prison it did not take long his boot knocked into something solid one whiff told him hed found the slop bucket but as carefully as he searched he did not find a water bucket he was so intent upon the search that durands continuing silence did not at once register with him when it did he cautiously retraced his steps and squatted down beside the shadowy form durand he said and then with greater urgency durand who do you think they dumped in with you the other man said waspishly the holy roman emperor for once the sarcasm was not unwelcome justin could imagine no better proof that durand was not badly hurt thank god he said i feared i might be stuck down here with a dead man give it time durand muttered give it time sitting up with a groan he leaned back against the wall what in damnation is that noise it sounds like were trapped underneath a waterfall close enough justin had never thought hed be glad to hear the sound of durands voice but it was a great relief not to be entombed down here alone it must be the river nancon were hearing just our luck to have taken lodgings with a moat of running water one with a stagnant moat would have been much quieter it was a lame joke even to his own ears and he was not surprised when durand snorted youre probably not in the mood for more bad news justin said after a few moments of silence but they forgot to send down dinner weve got a slop bucket and mayhap a rat or two that is it though are you going to talk all night de quincy the one tolerable thing about you is that you usually keep your tiresome thoughts to yourself so now you start jabbering like a popinjay when theres no escaping your babbling it gladdens me to be sharing a dungeon with you too durand justin realized that durand was right he was talking more than usual but as long as he was talking he didnt have to think at least we flushed de lusignan out into the open he killed arzhela and now hes trying to put the blame on us trying de quincy look around you id say hes damned well done it it was obvious in the hall who was in on the plot and who was not yves de la jaille and reynaud boterel did not know about the forged letter but alain de dinan did for certes so did andre de vitre raoul de fougeres and the duchess of course constance seemed willing to hear us out until johns name dropped like a hot rock into the middle of the conversation de lusignan offered no plausible motive for why john would want arzhela dead he did not need to for his coconspirators thought they knew what it wasthat accursed letter if he can for the love of god enough you think youre telling me anything i do not already know what ails you man are you scared is that it justin exhaled a very uneven breath he was rubbing his arms to restore the flow of blood they were numb after being pinned behind his back for so many hours after another long silence he heard his own voice saying defiantly what if i am well that is the first sensible thing youve said tonight you ought to be scared half out of your wits and i suppose youre not durand silence again durand was little more than a disembodied voice they were both cloaked in a night darker than dark when justin could stand the stillness no longer he said morgan and jaspaer were not taken so they know what happened to us if they get word to john what good will it do in case you havent noticed john does not wield a great deal of influence on this side of the border justin could not argue with that but neither could he yield every last scrap of hope the queen and richard could get us freed yes they could but there are two fatal flaws in that plan de quincy first of all you are assuming we would still be alive by the time the queen returns from germany second you are depending upon john to do the right thing even at risk to himself and tell the queen of our plight you truly want your life to balance upon the head of a pin that passes for johns conscience justin tried to muster up anger durand deserved it and at least it might keep him warm but the ashes of his temper were as cold as durands practiced cynicism so what you are saying he said at last is that we can expect nothing but a quick trial and an even quicker execution trial durands laughter was brittle unsteady were not getting a trial you know what they call these dungeons oubliettes you know what that means oblivion de quincy oblivion they put us down here to rot chapter february fougeres castle brittany when the trapdoor opened justin and durand did not move instinctively keeping very still justin now knew how a rabbit felt frozen in fear as a predator approached the light spilling into their black hole was painfully bright forcing them to avert their eyes a bucket was being lowered down to them when it hit the ground they heard a wonderful sound the splash of liquid a moment later something else came through the opening landing with a small thump and then the trapdoor slammed shut again time was impossible to track in a void by justins best guess theyd been in the dungeon for at least twelve hours as thirsty as hed ever been in his life he dived for the bucket and he and durand took turns drinking their fill only then did he try to discover the reason for that other thud fumbling around in the dark until he found the prizea loaf of bread it was stale so hard it was difficult to break into halves the gritty rye that was contemptuously known as alms bread it was delicious at least they are feeding us justin ventured so they must want to keep us alive for now durand mumbled stuffing another chunk of bread into his mouth you might want to slow down justin cautioned we do not know when well get another loaf im not going to hoard my bread like a starveling mouse after another silence without beginning or end durand said ive been thinking about it and i realized im likely to outlive you de quincy youre younger but im tougher so the way i figure it if worst comes to worst i can always gain myself some time by gnawing on your dead body mother of god well im willing to be fair about it if perchance i do die first you have my permissionnay my blessingto feast on my flesh thank you durand for that remarkable generosity but i think id rather make do with one of the rats we hear scuttling around in the shadows justin gave a shaken incredulous laugh jesu listen to us how can we jest about something like that how can we not durand asked succinctly and after that they lapsed into silence again listening to the muffled roar of the rivermoat the occasional scraping of rodent feet and the loudest sound of all the pounding of their own heartbeats justin tried to count the days by keeping track of the number of times the trapdoor opened and they were given food and water but he soon realized the flaws in that system he had no way of knowing if this was done on a daily basis even more troubling he discovered that his alwaysreliable memory was suddenly fitful erratic had they been there for six days or was it five they passed the time by discussing arzhelas murder and the forged letter although their conclusions speculations and suspicions would remain immured with them justin confided what arzhela had whispered in his ear with her dying breath a single wordroparzh it might be a breton name he suggested but he did not know enough of the language to be sure of that and durand was quick to point out that it could as easily have been a breton prayer or even a curse unable to decipher the words meaning they moved on to those facts that were not in dispute they were in agreement that arzhela had died because shed learned too much they also agreed that it was unlikely her murder was part of the conspiracy constance might well wink at the authenticity of the letter implicating john neither man could see her agreeing to the killing of her own cousin it was logical then to assume they were dealing with two crimes forgery and murder since simon de lusignan was their favorite suspect in arzhelas slaying it seemed plausible that he was behind the forgery too lets suppose then justin said pensively that simon came to the duchess with the letter or that he offered to obtain it for a fee say that arzhela found out the letter was a forgery would he have killed her for that he might durand mused if hed convinced constance and her barons that the letter was genuine the more justin thought about that the more tenable it seemed the duchess might well have been furious to find shed been cheated tricked by a forgery that john could prove to be false arzhela let us think that she had learned of the letter from constance it seems more likely that she learned of it in bed simon de lusignans bed and then she tried to have it both ways god love her durand laughed harshly she warned her old lover whilst trying to shield her current lover if shed been honest with us from the first shed still be alive fool woman she made an error in judgment justin conceded but she does not deserve to be blamed for her own murder i forgotyou had a fondness for the lady you might have had a chance with her too after all youre even younger than de lusignan let it lie durand justin said almost absently for hed resolved early on to shrug off the other mans sarcasms it was either that or kill him and although he knew durand would never admit it hed not been as unaffected by arzhelas death as he claimed well we solved johns mystery durand helped himself to another piece of bread we discovered the identity of the mastermind behind the plot of course hell never know that but as we go to our graves well have the satisfaction of knowing we did not fail him will that give you much comfort de quincy about as much as it gives you justin broke off a small crust chewed it slowly god damn de lusignan how could we let him outwit us again and again what did you call himarzhelas stud blaming me are you what a surprise i am not blaming you durand i misjudged the man too he seemed to be such a hothead not capable of coldblooded calculation like this a truly cunning wolf would pretend to be a sheepdog at least until it was in the midst of the flock durand slumped back against the icy wet wall and from the bottom of this oubliette hes looking like a very cunning wolf indeed as justins view was from the bottom of the oubliette too he was not inclined to argue and so he let durand have the last word they stopped talking after that each man alone with thoughts as bleak and bitter as their underground prison justin moaned turning his head from side to side durand crouched over him his fingers knotting in the cloth of the younger mans tunic wake up he said sharply de quincy wake up justin jerked upright staring around him with glazed unfocused eyes and durand loosened his hold settled back on his haunches you were having a bad dream man no more than that i am living a bad dream justin muttered he did not remember the details of his dream but his pulse was racing his temples were damp with sweat and his chest felt constricted with the weight of his dread his waking hours were hurtful enough without dragging demons into his sleep too you were yelling like a man about to get gutted with a dull knife durand shared telling justin more than he cared to know about his nightmare by the way who is aline justins breath stopped as memory of the nightmare came flooding back he was trapped here in the dungeon only now he was manacled to the wall too the trapdoor opened slowly and he saw a faceless figure laughing down at him this unknown enemy was holding a small bundle when he dangled the object above the opening justin realized it was his daughter it was aline he lunged to the end of his chains shouting but it was too late the man dropped her and she came plummeting down into the abyss into the never ending dark christ almighty he whispered closing his eyes to blot out the terrifying vision well durand prodded who is aline some peasant girl you ploughed and cropped a fancy whore a southwark slut or did i mishear and you were really calling out for claudine rot in hell justin snarled with such fury that durand stared at him in surprise seeking in vain to penetrate those cloaking shadows i hit a sore spot did i i just thought youd like to talk about your women for a while ive already unburdened my conscience told you about barbe my first and cristina the mercers wife and adela the runaway nun do not forget jacquetta and richenda and rosamund clifford and maid marian and the queen of jerusalem justin said caustically once the initial shock of confinement had worn off their role reversal had ended justin had retreated into the sanctuary of his silences while durand launched sardonic monologues about johns multitude of vices old enemies whod met unfortunate ends and women hed lain with he either had a vivid imagination or more bedmates than any man since adam for to hear him tell it he could not even cross the street without being accosted by a lustful wanton he described some of these encounters in such loving detail that justin began to regret having refused claudines overtures and hed had a few feverish dreams about molly you sound downright jealous de quincy is it my fault that ive had more women in a fortnight than you have in your entire pitiful life and how many of them did you pay for durand justin stood up moving away until he reached the wall tell me this he said is there anyone wholl mourn you anyone at all durand was quiet for so long that justin began to think hed hit a sore spot too there might be one he said at last violette who is she it is a long story de quincy i am not going anywhere am i no i suppose youre not durand rose groped his way to the water bucket where he stooped and drank this is the tale of a younger son a father who loathed him and an older half brothera brother who did his utmost to make the lads life hell on earth justins curiosity was stirred in spite of himself why did they despise him the brother hated him because their father had put his first wife aside for the lads mother the father hated him because his alluring young wife died in childbirth leaving him with an unwanted spare son his mothers murderer so what happened to him what do you think happened the lad grew up nursing his bruises and blackened eyes and grudges of his own you might say he bided his time and then elder brother took a bride violette yes violette seventeen years old sweet as a ripe strawberry with skin like milk and three fat manors as her marriage portion justin waited and then prompted well well what ah you want to know about the lad and little violette he seduced her rather easily too or so ive been told so what are you saying durand that you were the younger brother not necessarily how do you know i was not the elder brother or an interested neighbor watching from afar or violettes kinsman nothing is as it seems de quincy nothing that will make a fine epitaph for our gravestones justin said darkly vexed with himself for walking right into one of durands webs and this time the last word was to be his in the days that followed durand offered up other versions of his past in one he was estranged from his family because hed balked at taking holy vows like a dutiful younger son in another he boasted of having lived as an outlaw once he even claimed to be a bastard son of the old king henry and thus a half brother to john and richard but he never spoke of how he had entered the service of the queen justin had given up trying to keep track of their days in confinement what was the point he had no way of even knowing when it was day and when it was night and for some reason that bothered him greatly sleep was becoming the enemy now too when it came at all it brought troubled dreams hed lie awake for hours listening to durands cough wondering how long they could survive under these conditions wondering how long ere they went mad have you heard of stmalo de quincy it still startled him the sudden sound of a human voice echoing from the surrounding dark yes it is a breton port and an infamous pirates den why did i ever tell you about a kinsman of mine a notorious sea wolf so now you are a pirates whelp you must think that the damp down here is rotting my brain durand you do not speak a word of breton do you ever look before you leap i did not say the pirate was my sire nor did i say we lived in stmalo as it happens he was my uncle and it was another wellknown pirates nestgranville in normandy sometimes justin welcomed durands flights of fancy they were usually more entertaining than the other pastimes available to them fending off the bolder of the dungeons rats cursing john and simon de lusignan and the bretons trying not to freeze to death but on this dayor nightjustins head was throbbing his stomach so hollow that it hurt and his gorge threatened to rise with every breath of this foul tainted air spare me another one of your fables durand he said morosely and the other man laughed mockingly an effect spoiled somewhat when it ended in a coughing fit fair enough de quincy lets hear from you then you are so closemouthed about your past that naturally i suspect the worst but since were both going to die why take your secrets and your sins with you to the grave think of this as the confessional with me as your priest id rather not aha durand exclaimed managing to sound both triumphant and accusing do you know why youre clinging to your wretched little secrets because you have not abandoned all hope admit it de quincy you still believe that the almighty is going to work a miracle on your behalf and free you with a celestial thunderbolt you poor fool justin actually felt a twinge of shame as if hope was one of the seven deadly sins mayhap for prisoners it was but he knew that he could never surrender unconditionally not until he drew his last mortal breath he owed that much to aline even if shed never know it durand heard it first the creaking of wood that was the most important sound in their world for it meant the trapdoor was opening but theyd already gotten their water and bread a few hours ago and it was only yesterday that a guard had descended into the dungeon to empty the slop bucket this break with routine was ominous alarming and they watched tensely as a sliver of light spread across the ceiling spilling into the dark the trapdoor opening was a blaze of brightness above them a man knelt peering over the edge justin durand are you down there justins first fear was that his wits were wandering but durands audible gasp indicated that hed heard it too yes were here with a loud thud a wooden ladder was dropped into the dungeon moments later a man was scrambling down nimbly using one hand for the rungs the other holding a swaying lantern landing with a solid thump he turned toward them with a grin as dazzling as an easter sunrise and that square freckled face was one of the most beautiful sights justin had ever seen morgan aye its me beaming he raised the lantern whistling softly at what its light revealed no offense lads but your own mothers would shrink from the likes of you can you climb the ladder without help we can haul you up if need be he got no further for durand was already halfway up the ladder with justin close behind morgan glanced around at the encroaching fetid blackness and hastily headed for the ladder too justin had no idea what to expect when he clambered up into the storeroom under the great hall he knew only that it could not be worse than where hed been a man was holding out his hand and justin grabbed for it as he regained his footing he was assailed by a fragrance that seemed intoxicatingly sweet after the stench of the oubliette and then a soft female body was in his arms her breath warm against his throat almost at once claudine recoiled clasping her hand to her mouth justin thank god she cried though she made no further attempts to embrace him edging away as unobtrusively as possible id despaired of ever seeing you again she confided but oh my love you do need a bath what are you doing here claudine durand sounded as baffled as justin felt what is happening morgan no tell us later lets just get out of here there is no hurry morgan said cheerfully our men hold the castle blinking like barn owls even in the subdued light of the storeroom justin and durand exchanged glances the only two rational souls in a world of lunatics what men justin demanded whose men ill let him tell you that morgan raised his lantern pointing toward the corner stairwell he is awaiting you abovestairs in the great hall as impatient as they were to get answers justin and durand mounted the stairs at a measured pace uneasy about what they might find they could think of only one man who might have ridden to their rescue and neither of them could imagine circumstances under which john had gotten control of fougeres castle even if hed been willing or able to raise an army on their behalf paris was almost two hundred miles away none of this made any sense the last time theyd been in the great hall it had been a scene of torchlit tragedy now it looked peaceful and welcoming menatarms were seated at trestle tables drinking and eating a fire burned in the hearth giving off bursts of blessed heat hot enough to banish even the harsh piercing cold of a subterranean dungeon two highbacked chairs had been positioned close to those dancing flames where a man and woman were making conversation between sips of wine master de quincy sir durand the lady emmas smile was coolly complacent she was almost purring but the men barely glanced at her their gaze riveted upon the man beside her he was quite young not much older than justin dark complexioned and of small stature well dressed but somewhat untidy in appearance wearing his clothes as he did his command with the nonchalance of one who wielded so much power he could afford to take it for granted there is no need for introductions emma said archly for you know his grace the earl of chester and husband to the duchess constance the duke of brittany both men sank to their knees looking so stunned that emma claudine and morgan burst out laughing and even chester smiled faintly i am sure you have questions he said amiably but they can wait the lady emma a woman of great practicality has ordered baths for you in the kitchen so you can eat whilst you soak off some of that grime afterward well talk they did as he bade as he expected they would following morgan from the hall justin halted in the doorway glancing back over his shoulder at his unlikely saviour my lord earl how long were we imprisoned chester conferred briefly with emma im told he said that it was twelve days two wooden tubs had been dragged close to the huge kitchen hearth and filled with hot water they were soon so dirty that they had to be refilled justin had never enjoyed a bath so much and when he glanced over at durand he saw the same blissful expression on his face it was hard to believe that less than an hour ago they had been entombed alive even harder to believe that their lifetime of imprisonment had numbered only twelve days on the church calendar you want more morgan was leaning over the bathing tub with a platter of roasted chicken he grinned as justin snatched another drumstick youve probably lost track of time so you do not realize how lucky you are if youd been freed one day later youd have had to make do with fish the morrow is the start of lent now that he was warm and clean and fed justin could concentrate upon his next urgent need his desire for answers unable to wait for the earl of chesters explanation he sat up with a splash and smiled at morgan take pity on us man and tell us how this came about morgan was happy to oblige we were watching as they rode off with you and it was easy enough to learn you were being taken to fougeres castle when we heard that rufus and crispin were under arrest too jaspaer decided that there was a time to fish and a time to cut bait as he put it he said hed have no trouble finding a lord wanting to hire his sword and we parted company at pontorson with him heading into normandy and me riding for laval i pushed my horse and got there by dusk on friday so you owe me for a fine crop of saddle blisters and sores i owe you for a lot more than that my friend justin declared overcome with gratitude as he realized what a narrow escape theyd had if morgan had not proved more loyal than jaspaer theyd never have been freed no one would even have known of their plight when i told the ladies claudine and emma what had happened lady claudine was sorely distressed and insisted upon seeking aid from lord john the lady emma agreed to let her son send a man to paris but she said it would do no good after thinking about it for another day she announced that there was only one man who might be able to help and she ordered me to ride for the earl of chesters castle at st james de beuvron she said all knew he and the duchess constance had no fondness for each other but he was still her lawful husband still duke of brittany and that had to count for something the fact that he was on this side of the channel and not back in cheshire well that most likely played a part in her thinking too st james de beuvron is a lot closer than paris emmas been accused of many things durand observed but no one has ever called her a fool therell be no living with her after this de quincy not only was it a clever idea but she actually coaxed chester into agreeing to it that amazed justin too he did not know the earl of chester that well theyd worked together that past summer to recover the portion of king richards ransom that had gone missing in wales and hed been favorably impressed by the man but hed never have expected chester to be the one to throw him a lifeline he was about to ask morgan to tell them more when the kitchen doors swung open and the earl himself strolled in the lady emma insisted that every stitch you were wearing be burned but she is sending in some garments for you to wear courtesy of the lord of the manor raoul is providing you with swords too even if he does not know it yet but he can well afford it justin was unable to restrain his curiosity any longer where is lord raoul my lord earl fortunately for you constance wanted to give her cousin a noble funeral she and raoul and the rest of her court are at mont st michel burying the lady arzhela that gave me the opportunity i needed i knew the garrison would not dare deny me entry in my wifes absence if any of them harbored suspicions the presence of the lady emma and the lady claudine assuaged them and we were made welcome once my men were admitted it was easy enough to overcome the garrison and take control well free them when we leave and if raoul de fougeres or my lady wife have any complaints they can take them up with me justin was regarding chester with something approaching awe you make it sound so simple my lord earl i shall never forget what you have done here this day i doubt that i can ever repay you but it will be an honor to try chester nodded graciously then glanced over at durand so pointedly that durand hastily expressed his own thanks de quincy is too polite to ask he continued audaciously but i am not why did you agree to help us my lord the earl could easily have taken offense but durands luck held for chester prided himself on his own forthrightness and was confident enough to appreciate it in others just as the ingredients in a rissole vary according to the tastes of the cook so did our little alliance contain its share of differing motives the lovely lady claudine seems to fancy justin the lady emma appears to be trying to curry favor with the queen as for your man morgan youll have to let him speak for himself i have no idea what is motivating him but for myself ive come to respect justin de quincy he proved his worth in wales last summer is too good a man to rot in a breton gaol thank you my lord justin said startled durands smile was more skeptical it could not hurt either he said cynically to do a good deed for the man who might be englands next king durand can you never control that loose tongue of yours justin growled but the earl of chester looked wryly amused he is right de quincy unless king richard sires a son it is inevitable that men will look to john as his heir i know you to be the queens man body and soul youd never act against her interests so if you are involved in this it can only be because the queen wants it soreason enough for me to offer my assistance chester helped himself to a portion of roast chicken are you two up to riding it would probably be wiser to return to my castle at st james rather than tarry the night here i doubt that lord raoul will be pleased by my abuse of his hospitality nor will my lady wife he added with a sudden malicious grin that revealed he had another motive for interceding he could not resist this godgiven chance to make mischief for constance chapter february st james de beuvron brittany watching a new life come into the world was the perfect restorative after living so intimately with death for twelve days the foals first steps were wobbly like those of a sailor stranded on dry land its legs seemed too long for its little body and justin marveled that this tottering baby would one day run a hole in the wind hes a handsome lad the earl of chester said sounding more like a proud father than a master i think hell be a good one justin thought so too a pity morgan was not here to see the birth he has a way with horses like no man ive ever known has he come back from the mont yet when justin shook his head chester gave him a contemplative look spying on lord raoul and my lady wife is he why do i think there is more involved in his mission than that most likely because there is justin conceded he should have known chesters sharp eye would not miss much he hadnt been trying to keep anything from the earl but reticence was a natural habit with him we were held in the porters lodge for two nights he explained and whilst i was there i hid a letter under a coffer morgan thought hed be able to retrieve it without arousing suspicion i can guess what this letter said lucky you thought of that youd not have wanted to be found with a letter proclaiming you to be queen eleanors mannot in my wifes courtand they would have been sure to search you right thoroughly ere they threw you into that breton dungeon they did that justin said grimacing at the memory they took all of your money too of course a shame for youll never see a sou of it again justin ducked his head to hide a smile amused that the earl offered only sympathy back in cheshire hed had a reputation for being frugal not an admired trait in a man of such high rank the lady emma has agreed to lend us what money we need or rather she says her son will contingent upon being paid back by lord john when we reach paris repayment from john that id truly like to see chester said with a chuckle justin grinned for he agreed with chester guy de laval had a better chance of sprouting wings than he did of collecting any money from john and emma of all women would know that but the more costly she made her sons foray into conspiracy the less likely he was to repeat it justin was relieved although not surprised when chester asked no further questions the earl had a finely developed sense of what he needed to know and what he did not when dealing with royal intrigues and seemed content knowing only that justin and emma had been attempting to expose a breton plot against john justin wasnt sure how much emma had confided in chester to gain his assistance but he felt confident that her sons involvement would not be among the secrets shed shared a shout from outside drew their attention away from the mare and her nursing newborn and they emerged from the stables in time to see morgan dismounting in the bailey at the sight of justin he broke into a wide grin ive got it he announced it was almost too easy not a challenge at all handing over the queens letter he said and i am bringing back some interesting news too yesterday lord raoul got an urgent message from his castle garrison and the whole lot of them went galloping off including your lady duchess my lord of chester ill be expecting company then in a few days chester predicted placidly i expect youll be gone by that time though where toback to paris justin nodded but first we must go to genets where two of our men are being held the bretons turned them over to the local provost and since he answers to king richard not duchess constance i hope that we can persuade him to free them even after a summer amongst the welsh you remain remarkably trusting justin chesters tone was dry but his black eyes held a gleam of amusement the queens letter would serve you better if the provost did not think you guilty of murder i think id best give you a letter of my own explaining that you and sir durand were unjustly accused by those rash reckless bretons and avowing your innocence upon my honor as a norman baron that would be most welcome my lord justin said gratefully hed planned to ask chester for just such a letter for the earl was the only man he knew who exercised power on both sides of the bretonnorman border he was pleased now that he did not have to ask though for he was already so deeply in chesters debt that it seemed greedy to seek any more favors ill send some of my men with you to genets chester said after that youll be on your own they waited for morgan in a grove of trees about half a mile from the town of genets he was not gone long and when he came into view his smile communicated the success of his mission before he said a word the provost is on his way to the abbey as soon as i told him abbot jourdain had need of him he was off by my reckoning hell be gone for hours first he has to cross the bay then seek out the abbot wholl doubtless make him wait by the time he discovers that the abbot sent no message hell not want to venture out into the bay at dusk and hell as usual morgan took the roundabout route he was never one to use ten words when he could use twice as many that was fine with justin who thought morgan had earned the right to talk from now till judgment day if it made him happy durand was not as indulgent and cut him off brusquely saying lets look for the gaol then are you still set upon coming lady emma of course she said no less brusquely they are my men are they not justin wasnt sure if emma had any genuine concern for rufus and crispin or if it was simply that her sense of possession was offended by their gaoling but he welcomed her presence for shed prove to be a formidable distraction and she did as soon as she flounced into the gaol lifting her skirts and curling her lip she had the provosts deputy off balance so flustered that justin could almost feel sorry for him identifying herself as the lady emma plantagenet consort of the prince of gwynedd sister of king henry of blessed memory aunt to king richard coeur de lion she demanded that he free her men at once and for a moment they thought she was going to prevail by the sheer audacity of her performance master benoit stammered and stumbled visibly wilting under that haughty stare but then his eyes moved past her to justin and durand widening in horrified recognition we are not escaped murderers justin said hastily we had nothing to do with the slaying of the lady arzhela de dinan but i do not expect you to take our word for that i have here a letter from the earl of chester attesting to our innocence master benoit reached for the letter as gingerly as if it might burst into flames at his touch after reading it he said hesitantly the earl argues most persuasively on your behalf but i do not have the authority to release your men madame the provost has been called away but i will discuss the matter with him straightaway upon his return justin and durand had been expecting this their brief experience with the deputy provost had shown them that he suffered from a malady detrimental to officers of the law a total absence of backbone have it your own way durand said nonchalantly so the provost has forgiven you then i must say youre a lucky man for an argument could be made that your blunder brought about the lady arzhelas death the deputys adams apple bobbed what what do you mean well if youd told him what brother bernard had confided in youthat the lady was disguised as a humble pilgrimhed have sought her out at the abbey and the killer would not have had his chance to corner her in the crypt you look very pale of a sudden justin did his best to sound solicitous are you ailing surely you told the provost about that conversation with brother bernard master benoit swallowed again inhaling air in a convulsive gulp of course i did he looked down at the earls letter i suppose it would do no harm if i release them now theyd be freed as soon as the provost returns after all it would be a pity to make a fine lady such as yourself delay your journey madame you are planning to depart genets today emma nodded coolly and as the deputy scurried off to fetch the prisoners she gave justin and durand an approving glance and a rare compliment well done thank you justin said dryly thinking that the lady emma was the only woman he knew who viewed extortion as a social skill durand leaned against the wall arms folded looking bored but justin knew how deceptive that familiar pose was durand could move as swiftly as a panther if the need aroseif the deputy decided to doublecross them master benoit kept faith though soon emerging with rufus and crispin in tow they were deliriously happy to be freed almost embarrassingly grateful and justin realized that menatarms were too often viewed as expendable by their masters emma waved aside their thankfulness wrinkling her nose at their ripe odor i suppose it is too much to hope there is a bathhouse in town she queried of course there is master benoit sounded offended as if shed insulted his civic pride it is close by the shipyard and a fine one it is too belatedly remembering that it was in his best interest to get them out of genets as soon as possible he added lamely but it might not be open today in fact i am sure it is not emma paid him no heed and instructed her menatarms to go off and scrub themselves clean doling out coins sparingly she warned them not to spend the money on wine on anything but the baths then meet us at the priory she said and if you tarry overlong youll be left behind when crispin reminded her that they were right famished she grudgingly agreed that they could also stop at a cookshop master benoit had snatched up the earls letter and was holding it close to his chest youre going to the priory too do you not want to leave whilst there is still light he blanched when durand said blandly that they might want to pass the night in genets looking so miserable that justin took pity on him well not be staying after we arrange to have masses said for lady arzhela and the two slain monks well be on our way master benoit blinked two but brother andrev is still alive the town physician had the gruff nononsense demeanor of a man overworked and underappreciated brother andrev was still grievously ill he warned and although he was expected to recover god willing he was very weak and tired easily only after theyd promised to keep their visit brief were justin and durand allowed to enter the sickroom the infirmary was much smaller than the one at the abbey and brother andrev was the sole patient he had a sallow sickbed pallor his eyes hollowed and sunken in giving him an almost cadaverlike appearance justin had been nervous about this meeting worried about agitating a man whod come so close to death and wondering how they were going to convince him that theyd played no part in arzhelas murder but as soon as justin said their names brother andrev became much more animated insisting that they come closer and with his first words it was obvious that he needed no persuasion to trust them justin and durand you are the men arzhela was awaiting but i thought youd been dragged off to fougeres castle how did you escape it is a long strange story you know we are innocent then of course arzhela would not tell me the name of the man she feared but she did tell me your names said shed be safe once you reached the abbey brother andrevs spurt of energy was already ebbing away he had no pillow for truly devout monks scorned such comforts he did not object though when justin rolled up a spare blanket and placed it under his head i tried to tell the provost once id regained my wits saying i was sure you were not the ones he did not seem to believe me he closed his eyes and justin wondered if the interview was over this mans spirit burned like a lone spark in a cold hearth all too easy to extinguish after a time brother andrev opened his eyes again she always wanted to be buried here he said sadly at our church but it must be reconsecrated and and the duchess would not wait what followed was a patchwork quilt of silences and sighs and laborious strained utterances brother andrev could tell them nothing that would be of use in solving arzhelas murder for all he remembered of his brief struggle with his wouldbe assassin was the terrifying image of an upraised bloodied blade but as he painstakingly recounted his last conversation with the lady arzhela it seemed to justin that there were four now in this room that had held only three a lively ghost with laughing eyes lingered for a moment in their midst an elusive caressing breath of summer on a day of grey skies and frigid sorrows there is something you can do for me for the lady arzhela brother andrev was obviously tiring but his will overrode his failing body she took a lad under her wing at the abbey yann he was with her that night he told me shed taken him into the chapel of notredamesousterre to offer up a prayer to the blessed lady mary for a dying pilgrim promising that theyd sneak into the monks enclosure afterward and raid the kitchen she took so long at her prayers though that he got bored and he crept away left her alone justin nodded grimly remembering the feel of that lamps stillwarm wick against his fingers shed entered a welllit chapel secure in gods grace and her pilgrims armor unaware that she was still being stalked by a killer if only shed stayed in the almonry if only the boyhe saw nothing then he says not and i believe him he says he returned to the almonry expecting her to return soon and scold him for running off i suspect he may have had some mischief in mind mayhap a bit of thieving when the fire bell sounded and word spread of her death he was terrified and guiltstricken too he will not talk of it but i think he blames himself for leaving her how did you find this out brother andrev yann was too fearful to stay at the abbey arzhela had told him about me and so he fled to genets having nowhere else to go hed become right fond of her i think she had a way about her his voice had thickened and he gestured toward a nearby table toward a clay cup filled with a greenish liquid propping his head up justin held the cup to his lips we will want to talk to the lad what can we do for you brother andrev it is a great favor but i hope youll do it for her for arzhela she told me she planned to settle yann on one of her manors see that he learned a trade ill do what i can for the lad but hes not one to be taking holy vows a faint smile twitched one corner of his mouth moreover i do not know how safe he is here what if the killer decides to make sure he saw nothing that night there was talk at the abbey about a boy being with her in the infirmary you cannot be asking that we take this tadpole with us durand interrupted incredulously turning to glower at justin when the latter agreed to consider it why is it de quincy that i can always rely upon you to make my life even more wretched than it already is what are we going to do with a lightfingered breton whelp justin didnt know but he agreed with brother andrev about the boys possible danger well talk to the lady emma he said mayhap her son can find a place for the lad at laval he tilted the cup so the monk could drink again brother andrev there may be something you can help us with too lady arzhela whispered something to me with her dying breath i thought it might be a name but i cannot be sure neither durand nor i speak breton brother andrevs eyes focused intently upon justins face what did she say one wordroparzh if hed hoped for a sudden illumination he was to be disappointed the monk frowned slowly shook his head it is indeed a name a mans name very common amongst the bretons but i know no one called roparzh i am sorry so was justin weve kept you too long rest now well return later once youve talked to the lad better he hear it from you for he has no reason to trust us at the sound of the opening door brother andrev raised himself feebly on his elbows that may be yann now he said he went out to get me some soup from the cookshop blood of christ that stunned bit of swearing spun both justin and durand toward the door simon de lusignan was standing there obviously as astonished to see them as they were to see him how did you escape he cried with such amazement that they knew hed not been at the mont when raoul de fougeres had gotten word of the earl of chesters tour de force he recovered quickly though for the next sound they heard was the metallic whisper of his sword clearing its scabbard youll not get away again he snarled not from me durands sword was unsheathed in the blink of an eye or so it seemed to justin and there was something chilling about his smile we need him alive durand justin said swiftly even as he drew his own weapon tell him to yield then with a shiver of steel the two blades came together setting off sparks simon parried durands next blow with such ease that the knights smile faded eyes narrowing as he realized he was facing a superior swordsman justin was surprised too by de lusignans skill for like many people he had a naive tendency to equate evil with inadequacy but there was nothing inept about the way simon handled a sword he looked to be more than a match for justin and possibly even as good as durand simons next maneuver was a classic move he feinted high and then struck low durand anticipated him and stepped in parrying the cut with the flat of his sword since neither man had chain mail or a shield they circled each other warily so intent upon their lethal duel that justin was for the moment forgotten seeking to take advantage of that he darted around the monks bed but simon caught the blur of justins movement and swung about in time to deflect the blow did she beg simon panted did she entreat you whoresons to spare her life spare us durand spat this is not the great hall at fougeres castle and youve got no audience we know what happened so do i simon lunged forward with a downward thrust that would have eviscerated durand had he not blocked it you killed her realization hit justin like a blow you believe that he gasped you truly believe we killed her simon backed up a step his chest heaving as he sought to catch his breath you did kill her you bastards no we did not justin overturned the table with a sweep of his arm forcing simon to take another backward step we thought you did youve got to do better than that simon jeered swinging his sword in a tight circle to keep them both at bay i would never harm arzhela i am beginning to believe you justin admitted you were so set upon accusing us that we could not see past that but arzhela whispered a name to me ere she died and i think mayhap it was her killers name how simple do you think i am only a halfwit would believe a fable like that hear me out it was a breton name a mans name and she said it twice you think shed waste her dying breath on a lie she said roparzh and if he is not her killer who is he then roparzh simon echoed the name blankly at first as if it meant nothing to him but then his sword wavered slightly she said roparzh as she died it is true this confirmation came from an unexpected source from the bed where brother andrev had been watching helplessly as they fought he confided in me not sure what it meant i was the one who told him it was a christian name a breton name simon expelled his breath in an audible hiss his pupils shrinking to pinpoints like the eyes of a man suddenly exposed to a blinding flash of light it was at that moment that the door opened and a youngster entered a dark imp of a lad who could only be yann he froze at the sight of the drawn swords and then whirled to flee but claudine was close behind him and she barred his escape the partially opened door blocking her view of the room easy lad she said in a goodnatured rebuke youll spill the soup for certes leaping around like a grasshopper she screamed then for as she advanced into the room simon de lusignan pounced pulling her roughly against him and crooking his free arm around her throat no he warned as justin and durand tensed i can snap her neck like a twig ere either of you can reach us you boy over there with them do as i say and ill not hurt her drop your swords on the ground and kick them into the corner do it when justin hesitated simon must have tightened his hold for claudine gave a soft involuntary cry almost like the squeak of a rabbit in a snare justin dropped the sword with a clatter and simon looked over at durand you too he ordered if you do not ill kill her durand didnt blink i can live with that he said but before he could act upon his words justin tackled him sending them both sprawling by the time theyd untangled themselves simon had backed out the door dragging claudine with him passersby stopped staring at the sudden drama spilling into the street by now justin and durand had recovered their swords trading curses as they tried to shoulder their way through the doorway they reached the street as simon snatched the reins from a rider whod just dismounted from a bigboned grey gelding the man cried out in astonished protest but when he tried to get the reins back simon shoved claudine into him with enough force to knock them both to the ground vaulting up into the saddle he spurred off down the street kicking up clouds of dirt as people scattered to get out of his way kneeling by claudine justin lifted her up and carried her into the infirmary she was pale and shaken wrapped her arms so tightly around his neck that he had trouble disengaging her hold once they were inside stay here he said youre safe now wait where are you going after him she called out his name but he did not heed her plunging back out into the street there all was chaos people were milling about dogs barking someone shouting for the provost justin ran for the priory stables durand was already there lugging a saddle toward his stallions stall while he tonguelashed a cowering groom for having unsaddled their horses stop berating the man justin snapped hastening toward his own mount this is not his fault no its yours durand shot back glaring over his shoulder as he fumbled with the cinches if you had not been such a fool hed not have gotten away at the cost of claudines life hed not have hurt her you do not know that they were shouting at each other so angrily that the stable groom shrank back into the shadows convinced that they were both lunatics other men were entering the stables drawn by the uproar but they dispersed hastily as durand spurred his stallion through the doorway the other men had just regained their footing when justins horse came shooting by sending them scrambling for safety again morgan was outside shouting something unintelligible at justin as he galloped past justin did not have time to explain but as he glanced over his shoulder he saw morgan running toward the stables wheeling his mount he raced after durand chapter february road to fougeres brittany justin knew from the first that their chase was likely to be futile simon had too much of a head start to be overtaken if he was willing to abuse his mount but his horse could always throw a shoe or pull up lame and so they pushed on in pursuit a man racing by at full speed attracted attention and they had no trouble following his trail he left numerous gaping bystanders in his wake once theyd left the norman town of avranches behind they slowed down pacing their horses for the hunt was no longer a mad dash it had become a grim endurance test simon was riding south the road ahead beckoned them on but neither man wanted to advance too deep into brittany they slowed down again eventually pulling up to rest their horses and plot their strategy how far do you think we are from chesters castle justin asked five miles or so durand grunted an assent swearing when he realized that hed left his wineskin back in genets i see some alder trees over there he said there ought to be a spring close by leading his lathered mount toward a pond of murky water he let the horse drink and then knelt and drank himself cupping the water in his hands and splashing it onto his hot dusty face whatyou think to ask chester for help justin was drinking too ignoring the brackish taste of the water i am not eager to ride on to fougeres alone he confessed i do not fancy the lodgings they offer there nor do i but i doubt that chester is going to give us men enough to launch an assault upon the castle durand sat down tiredly in the withered grass are you so sure that is where hes heading justin shrugged no less wearily your guess is as good as mine but this is the road to fougeres and hes likely to be looking for a safe burrow i suppose durand stretched out in the grass christ jesus but i hate brittany nothing about this accursed country makes sense if that poxy hellspawn de lusignan did not kill the woman who did we might be able to get that answer from simon de lusignan but we have to catch him first justin rose reluctantly to his feet and then cocked his head listening intently riders coming he said from the south durand was on his feet too now a goodly number by the sound of them i do not much like this de quincy neither did justin i think we ought to pay the earl of chester a visit he said and they both made haste to mount the riders were within sight now detouring off the road in their direction justin was about to spur his stallion into an urgent race for chesters castle when durand gave a startled profanity they are not bretons are you sure aye durands voice was flat and cold i know that whoreson in the lead they call him lupescarthe wolf even in england justin had heard of lupescar a notorious mercenary whose sword was always for hire to the highest bidder a man with such a foul reputation that his name was used to scare small children into going to sleep at night stay abed or lupescar will come for you how can you be so sure he is not in the pay of the bretons because durand said harshly hes been working of late for john lupescar had the dark hair and eyes of his native provence a surprisingly pleasant voice flavored with the soft accent of langue doc the language of the south he also had a raw jagged scar across his forehead and another around his throat that looked suspiciously like rope burns well durand he said in a mellow melodious tone that was utterly at variance with those cold empty eyes are you not gladdened to see me beyond words what are you doing here lupescar why coming to your rescue of course when john got word that youd been clumsy enough to get yourself caught bloodyhanded over some poor pilgrims body he sent me to pull your chestnuts from the fireassuming they were not burnt to a crisp of course we did a bit of spying around fougeres learned that youd managed to get free and we were on our way to mont st michel to see if we could pick up your trail those unsettling eyes drifted over toward justin you must be johns other lost lamb de quincy is it justin nodded tersely what would you have done if wed still been imprisoned at fougeres lupescar smiled well never know will we and then he and his men turned back toward the road where riders had appeared in the distance they were coming from the north and justin breathed a sigh of relief when he recognized morgan drawing rein morgan looked from one to the other aware of the tension but not understanding it my lords you were not easy to catch we left sir lionel and some of my lord chesters men at genets to protect lady emma and lady claudine but the rest of us decided to join the hunt his gaze kept flicking toward lupescar he was obviously curious about this scarred stranger but he asked no questions waiting to follow justin and durands lead lupescar returned morgans appraisal noted he wore no sword and decided he was not worthy of further attention so durand what are you hunting any quarry that might interest me durand took his time in replying if you came from the south you may have seen him young fairhaired on a grey gelding riding as if he were trying to outrun his sins we did see a man like that lupescar acknowledged he swerved off the road into the woods when he saw us but we saw no reason to follow a man with money would not have been riding a nag like that who is he and why are you chasing him justin could feel the hairs prickling on the back of his neck every time he glanced at lupescar and he was glad when durand balked at answering saying only that it was nothing lupescar need concern himself with i expect youll be going back to paris now durand continued his voice toneless utterly without inflection although justin was close enough to see that his hand had tightened upon the hilt of his sword if john sent you to find out what had befallen us you did since we freed ourselves we are not in need of your aid are we the two men stared at each other the silence stretching out until it threatened to become smothering lupescar was the first to blink i do not think we want to return to paris just yet well let you get on with your hunt though i promised my men theyd have a town to sleep in tonight with real beds wine and wenchesnot necessarily in that order if my memory serves that would be avranches look for us there mayhap we can ride back to paris together durand said nothing no one spoke until lupescar and his wolves were on their way disappearing into the gathering mist for one of those mysterious breton fogs had rolled in without warning cloaking the countryside in a damp grey cloud that smelled of the sea john never fails to surprise me durand said at last whod have thought hed take our plight seriously you think he did justin queried and durand laughed a sound like shattering glass he sent lupescar did he not they passed the night at chesters castle of st james for it was too far to return to genets the next afternoon they were fed in the great hall amidst menatarms several welltodo merchants household servants and a few pilgrims bound for the mont chester himself was not present hed made them welcome but his hospitality seemed perfunctory this time chester had not been pleased to learn that lupescar and his mercenaries were on the prowl so close to his own lands it was evident that the earl was tiring of being dragged into their neverending troubles and justin felt like a dinner guest whod overstayed his visit so we are in agreement then durand had propped his elbows on the trestle table staring down glumly at a trencher of lenten fare salted herring seasoned with mustard we head back to genets collect the women and return to paris justin nodded toying listlessly with his own fish only morgan seemed to have an appetite popping a lenten fritter into his mouth he looked at them in surprise we are not going to follow de lusignan to fougeres for what purpose durand shoved his trencher away with a grimace what would you have us do morganride up to the gatehouse and ask if simon can come out to play no id suggest you send me morgan reached over helping himself to durands discarded fish let me go in on a scouting expedition make sure that de lusignan is indeed there are you eager to put your neck in a noose justin scowled you were there with chester barely four days ago you truly want to wager that none of the garrison would remember you ive thought of that morgan said with a blithe wave of his hand the solution is simple i need only take a page from the lady arzhelas book spearing another chunk of fish on his knife he gestured with it toward a table of russetclad pilgrims a man becomes well nigh invisible once he dons a monks habit or a pilgrims robe id be in fed and out ere anyone even looked twice at me you know durand said slowly he might be right what do you say de quincy shall we go over and barter for one of those cloaks marked with a red cross justin nodded again and started to push back from the table this is the plan then morgan well await you with the horses in the woods east of the castle you put on the pilgrims garb and go try your luck just be sure you truly want to risk this why not it sounds like good sport morgan rose claiming one last fritter but as justin started after him durand grabbed his arm how about asking me if i want to risk that why cannot we wait for morgan here that had not even occurred to justin it is only fair that we share the risk durand durand looked at him balefully whenever i hear words like fair and honorable coming out of your mouth de quincy i start saying the paternoster im glad to hear youre keeping up with your prayers but if you are truly loath to take the risk wait for us here durand responded with an obscenity so profane that even john would have been impressed justin turned away biting back a smile as he expected durand followed the woods were thickly grown with beech trees spruce and pine with but one day to go february seemed intent upon inflicting its full measure of misery and the weather was wretched the cold so damp and penetrating that justin and durand were huddled in their mantles like turtles in their shells clutching their hoods with frozen fingers as the wind gusted sending dead leaves swirling into the sky like skeletal butterflies they dared not build a fire and their smoldering tempers provided the only source of heat both mens nerves were raw all the more so because they were not willing to admit it and they tensed every time they heard the slightest sound when it began to rain sometime after noon durand started calling justin every foul name he could think of and justin was too miserable to argue with him as the afternoon dragged on the great hall back at chesters castle was looking better and better it didnt help that theyd camped in such an eerie otherworldly setting ancient stones rose up around them arranged in strange patterns that could only have been done by man or demons their spectral shapes reminded justin of gravestones and he made the sign of the cross every time he glanced over at those mossy ageless rocks wondering what bloody pagan rites had taken place under those craggy silhouettes he very much wanted to move but he was not about to admit his unease to durand durand shared his edginess but as he also shared justins stubborn pride they remained where they were listening intently for approaching footsteps and watching for ghostly apparitions from the corners of their eyes despite their vigilance they still did not hear morgans quiet footfalls on the sodden ground were alerted only when their stallions began to nicker in welcome emerging through the trees he looked odiously cheerful for a man dripping wet and muddied wait till you hear what i have to tell you he exclaimed every man woman and child in the castle was talking about it about what happened yesterday afraid that morgan was about to go off on one of his digressions durand cut in hastily first things first man what of de lusignan was he there he was but no longer he arrived yesterday on a horse half dead with him looking little better when he was admitted to the castle he rode that horse right into the great hall ere anyone could stop him it was the dinner hour and the hall was filled with highborn guests simons entrance caused quite an uproar morgan paused for dramatic effect but that was nothing compared to what he did next he flung himself from the saddle leaped over one of the trestle tables and tried to throttle a man of god chapter march laval maine by the time lavals great stronghold came into view the men were tired hungry and still angry with the women they hoped to find behind those castle walls their anger could be measured in miles more than ninety of them after retrieving their men at the earl of chesters castle of st james justin and durand had ridden north to genets only to learn that the ladies emma and claudine were no longer there brother andrev could tell them only that he thought they were heading for laval the earl of chesters men had been instructed to escort them to genets no farther and so they were traveling with a meager escort especially in light of lupescars presence at avranches nor had the lady emma taken yann with them brother andrev recounted sorrowfully that shed dismissed the suggestion out of hand and hed had no luck in changing her mind he did have better luck with justin for when they rode out of genets yann was perched upon the back of morgans horse clinging tightly to the mans belt looking both fearful and excited three days later theyd reached laval having failed to overtake the women on the road they were admitted at once into the castle bailey and durand was soon stalking into the great hall with justin on his heels there they found the objects of their wrath seated at the high table enjoying a lenten supper made tolerable by the freeflowing wine guy de laval welcomed them nervously looking like a man in need of allies and claudines smile was dazzling but justin and durand had eyes for no one but the lady emma who greeted them with a nonchalance they found infuriating into the solar durand rasped now when emma stiffened in outrage at that peremptory tone he leaned across the table and jerked her to her feet looking over then at guy as if daring him to object guy did not emma was made of sterner stuff than her son and her hand closed upon the eating knife shed been using to fillet her pike but justin now echoed durands command with no less heat and she decided that submitting to their highhandedness was a lesser evil than making a scene in front of the servants flinging down her napkin as if it were a gauntlet she marched across the hall toward the stairwell claudine followed her and after a very conspicuous hesitation so did guy as soon as they reached the privacy of the solar emma turned on the men in fury how dare you put hands on me like that i am not one of your kitchen wenches to be ordered about at your pleasure durand de curzon youre fortunate i did not have my men flail you till your back was bloody first of all your queenship they are your sons men not yours and id have liked to see them try but if you think sir stoutheart there has the ballocks to give a command like that you must believe in unicorns and barnacle geese and winged griffins ii resent that guy said sounding more unhappy than indignant and his flush deepened when durand did not even deign to respond to his feeble protest emmas breath hissed through her teeth before she could lash out claudine stepped between them speaking with an authority that reminded justin of what hed too often forgottenthat she was queen eleanors kinswoman stop this it serves for naught to be hurling insults at each other like brawling alewives why are you so wroth no not you durand let justin speak he has a far cooler head than yours by all means durand said nastily with a mocking bow toward justin go to it de quincy how could we not be wroth justin demanded we reached genets on monday and found you gone emma blinked in surprise is that what this is all about we waited friday night and all of saturday with nary a word from you i might add for all i knew youd be gone for a fortnight how did i know how long it would take to catch de lusignan i made the sensible decision to await you in comfort back at laval and of course you did not think to send us word of this decision how was i supposed to reach you durand the way anyone with the sense god gave a sheep would have done by dispatching a man to chesters castle durand said scornfully provoking emma into using her royal brothers favorite oath by gods liver ive heard enough of your whinging what difference does it make now about sixty miles durand snapped that is how much farther we had to travel thanks to your foolish female whims not to mention justin said sardonically the pleasure of fearing that wed be finding your bloodied bodies by the side of the road claudine deflected emmas angry retort i would never fault a man for caring about my welfare or safety but we had an escort justin surely brother andrev told you that as if rufus and crispin would have been a match for lupescars cutthroats claudine lost color lupescar was nigh when justin nodded grimly she made the sign of the cross we did not know emma was not cowed the wolf is presently in johns hire so i rather doubt i had anything to fear from him hed not dare to molest his lords aunt there is a reason why shepherds use dogs and not tame wolves to guard their flocks durand sneered a wolf is a wild creature impossible to trust for it can slip its leash at any time moreover justin said grimly the men riding with lupescar are hells dregs if hed sent some of them out scouting and they ran across two beautiful rich poorly guarded women you truly think theyd humbly wish you good morrow and ride on by emma scowled for she sensed that she was being outmaneuvered you exaggerate the risk we had three good men with us if we were in such danger wed have been in danger too when we first left paris for we had only seven then four more men could not make that much of a difference they could as long as im one of them durand drawled and emma tartly called him an insufferable preening peacock but she tacitly conceded defeat by abruptly changing the subject demanding to know the whereabouts of simon de lusignan i did not see him being dragged in shackles into the great hall so i assume he got away from the both of you then neither justin nor durand cared for that implicit accusation that theyd been bested by de lusignan we tracked him to fougeres castle justin said coolly but ill let morgan be the one to tell you he half expected emma to object but shed obviously done some reassessment of her hired man who was constantly revealing talents above and beyond a grooms skills at mucking out stalls or soothing spooked horses and she said nothing as justin moved toward the door morgan responded so swiftly that justin wondered if hed been eavesdropping out in the stairwell he showed no nervousness at being summoned into his ladys solar acting as comfortable as if theyd been meeting in the stables and when emma sent for a servant to fetch wine morgan took it for granted that one of the cups was for him you want me to tell them about fougeres he asked justin and needed no further encouragement to launch into a vivid account that was quite polished by now after much repetition simon de lusignan rode his horse right into the great hall just like king henry used to do when he came to dine with thomas becket ere he became gods man instead of the kings but simon had murder in mind not feasting he leapt from his mount onto that canon from toulouse and was making good progress toward strangling him ere they dragged him off guy gasped why would simon try to kill canon robert he was about to make an illadvised defense of his friend but he caught his mothers eye and thought better of it from what i was told morgan resumed smoothly the people in the hall did not understand that either and concluded that simon was roaring drunk that was not unreasonable as simon had bloodshot eyes slurred speech and was stinking of wine but we know hed been awake for nigh on a day and a night most likely had nothing to eat and id guess he was drenched in wine from diving across that table they decided to put him where hed do no harm till he sobered up and so they confined him to a storeroom out in the bailey interesting that they did not toss him into the dungeon is it not emma regarded him thoughtfully you are saying then she said that simon de lusignan was accorded special treatment morgan beamed approvingly exactly my lady it was like a signed confession from the duchess and her barons that they were up to their necks in this plot with simon canon robert insisted he had no idea why simon had attacked him and adroitly played the role of injured innocent apparently the others honestly did not know what had provoked simons attack we do of course whatthat the canon killed the lady arzhela morgan nodded so vigorously that justin felt the need to interject a cautionary note well all we can say for certes is that simon thinks he did im with simon morgan insisted that canon was always too slick for a man of god and you told me yourself justin that the lady arzhela never trusted him a whit and we know both simon and arzhela had judgment as infallible as the holy fathers this acerbic comment came from durand and earned him no favor with morgan who showed a rare flash of irritation but emma was losing patience and she moved to take control of the conversation saying swiftly be that as it may we are still waiting to hear what happened after that the next morning they discovered the lock on the storeroom had been broken inside there were signs of a struggle and blood but simon was gone morgan found the reaction of his audience quite gratifying guy and claudine cried out and even emma looked startled there is more canon robert was missing too morgan was happy to provide additional details simon had stolen a horse in the village and when last seen was heading into the sunrise the duchess and breton lords seemed relieved to have him gone for none of them showed any enthusiasm for pursuing the fugitive there was some concern about the missing canon especially after the discovery of a bloodstained rochet on the outskirts of the village gossip had it that simon must have escaped and slain the cleric although no one could explain the lack of a body no one could explain either how simon got himself out of a room locked from the outside morgan observed the castle servants seemed to think hed called upon his master lucifer who cast a spell that allowed him to walk through the wall if i were wagering id put my money on one of the breton barons sneaking down in the night and setting him free but what of the missing canon emma said skeptically i never met the man he was taken ill upon our arrival at vitre so i am not the one to pass judgment upon him but simon did or at least he tried to when he attempted to throttle the man if he were so set upon murder would he have fled upon being freed by one of constances barons as meek as a lamb or would he seek to finish what hed begun that seemed more likely to me too justin admitted i can see simon being freed by one of constances conspirators and i can see simon then going in search of the canon determined to avenge arzhela what i cannot understand though is why he would hide the body afterward nor do i know where hed hide it fougeres is a vast place but he would not have had much time ere the castle servants would be up and about in other words durand said morosely what we have are even more questions and few answers jesu how i hate brittany what of the canons horse claudine asked hopefully was it gone too she looked deflated when morgan said it had been found in the stables well then i am at a loss she confessed none of this makes sense not to me either guy ventured but no one paid him any mind and he lapsed back into a sulky silence it seems to me emma commented that simon de lusignan has the answers you are seeking do you have any idea where hed go back to poitou to his familys manor in lezay justin and durand exchanged glances in agreement for once that morgan deserved to be the one to tell her morgan thought so too with an actors fine sense of timing he drew a deep breath as if to speak waiting until all eyes were upon him as a matter of fact we do know where hes heading he was seen riding away from the village toward the east emma nodded yes i remember your saying that but what of it half of christendom lies to the east of fougeres including laval we know that my lady morgan said patiently but he was not heading southeast toward laval he was heading due east toward mayenne and that is a toll road so we detoured on our way to laval asked the toll collectors if they remembered a man like him looking much the worse for wear and in a great hurry eventually we found one who did he remembered simon because he had bloodstains on his clothes and because hed asked a question morgan paused again theatrically he wanted to be sure this was the road to paris they set such a fast pace pushing themselves and their horses to the limits of exhaustion that they covered the miles to paris in just six days reaching the city after dark on the ninth of march it would have been difficult to say who was happiest as that forest of church spires came into view for emma and claudine were not accustomed to hardships and the men were thoroughly sick of hearing their complaints after six demanding days on the road the one most affected by the sight of the city walls was yann justin had told him that paris was home to more than forty thousand souls the boy could neither count nor even imagine numbers that high he would never have admitted it but his first view of the french capital was thoroughly intimidating a maze of narrow streets and crooked alleys most unpaved and muddy crowded with loud brash city folk hurrying home before curfew rang imposing overhanging whitewashed houses of wood and stone towering above his head blocking out all but the puniest slivers of moonlight and more noise than his countrybred ears could bear church bells chimed chains rattled as the bailiffs made ready to close the west end of the river seine boatmen offered cheap passage street vendors shouted out their wares and often exchanged taunts as they fought over the days last customers dogs barked and geese honked and beggars cried out for alms and from darkened doorways rouged and powdered women boldly accosted male passersby even the air filling his lungs seemed foreign to him he felt as if he were inhaling smoke sickening stenches rose from the streets the cesspits the river overwhelming the occasional appealing odor of baking bread or eel pie clinging to the back of morgans belt his thighs and buttocks blistered from endless hours on horseback yann blinked fiercely keeping tears at bay hed learned long ago that tears served for naught but in just a month his life had been turned topsyturvy the lady arzhela had been as close as hed ever expected to get to a miracle shed teased him with winks and hints whispering that all was not as it seemed and offering the promise of better tomorrows hed not understood half of what shed said nor had he fully believed it it had been enough for him that this odd fey woman had given him what hed never gotten before attention and even affection and then she was dead and his dreams were drenched in blood his peace slashed to shreds at night by a killers knife desperate to get away from genets for he did not believe that a sickly kindly monk could protect him against such evil hed agreed to accompany these strangers back to their world clutching his only thread of faiththat the monk had said they were the ladys friends at laval hed learned that none of them truly wanted him not like the lady did the woman the others called lady emma and he privately called the shewolf had made it quite clear that she would not be burdened with a breton cub and the weakling her son had only agreed because the ladys friends bullied him into it yann knew that as soon as theyd gone hed be cast out to beg his bread again and so hed stolen food from the kitchen making sure that he was caught in the act the weakling had been indignant and balked at taking him in backed by the shewolf it was then that the other woman intervened the lady claudine to yann she was the plum for he still remembered his one taste of that sweet fruit the plum had taken the one called justin aside and yann had crept closer to eavesdrop the lad could go with them to paris plum said where her cousin would find a place for him on her estates justin had seemed surprised and grateful and plum had laughed and said they could not leave the lad to starve after all yann could see no humor in that for his whole life had been a battle against starvation and so hed heeded his fear and his hunger thinking that he might be striking a deal with the devil but at least the devil was feeding him well hed tried to keep away from the shewolf and the knight for that was how hed christened durand staying close to the ones he instinctively recognized as his protectorsjustin and morgan the groom gradually the terror knotting his stomach had begun to ease and the death dreams no longer came each night without fail hed even relaxed enough to admit that he knew more of their french tongue than theyd first thought and because of the plums careless kindness he dared to hope that she really would keep to her word but now that they were in paris a hive from hell aswarm with alien bees he was afraid that hed made a great mistake they escorted the women to the town house of claudines cousin petronilla planning to spend the night there themselves for curfew had rung justin had been hoping to delay his meeting with john for one more night but it was not to be petronilla had invited john to be her guest ostensibly because his lodgings with the templars lay beyond the city walls and a residence within the city would be more convenient as well as more comfortable petronilla did not seem pleased with her coup though and claudine felt a flicker of relief for shed warned her cousin that a dalliance with the devil was a walk on the wild side this prince was best left to his own dark domains seeing petronillas discontent claudine was thankful that nothing had come of her cousins highrisk flirtation although she was very curious why that was so she was wondering how to find out what had gone wrong when she saw her answer framed in the doorway of the stairwell claudine recognized the other woman at once for johns continuing involvement with ursula had been a source of much court gossip ursula had lasted far longer than most of his bedmates and claudine did not understand why she was a spectacularly beautiful lush creature but claudine thought she was also a selfish slowwitted bitch and john could do better she was very glad though that it wouldnt be with her cousin amused in spite of herself by johns sheer audacity in bringing his mistress along when he accepted petronillas misguided invitation claudine greeted ursula with one of those brittle fake smiles that women use to convey a social snub much to her annoyance ursula did not even seem to notice john had entered the hall with ursula and he hastened in their direction how did lupescar get you out i did not really think hed be able to do it he did not durand said very emphatically we freed ourselves glancing sideways at justin he added grudgingly with some help from the earl of chester but justin had other matters in mind than giving credit where credit was due on the ride to paris hed remembered lupescars mocking words youd been clumsy enough to get yourself caught bloodyhanded over some poor pilgrims body it was possible that john for whatever reason had chosen to mislead lupescar about the identity of the murder victim it was also possible that the message sent by guy de laval had been mangled and that john himself did not know arzhela had been slain my lord john he said i think it best that we continue this conversation in a more private place john agreed but at that moment emma sauntered over aunt emma what a delightful surprise i thought you might have stayed in laval with my cousin guy john smiled and only those in the know would have recognized his pleasantry as a sarcastic reminder of her sons plight emma parried his thrust with a sharp smile of her own i was sorely tempted john but we still have so much to discuss do we not linking her arm in his she suggested that they retire to petronillas solar we have much to tell you there have been some unexpected developments since the lady arzhelas death john stopped so abruptly that she glanced at him in surprise john johns face was very still as rigid and impassive as a sculpted death mask only his eyes showed life the lady arzhela is dead emma nodded she was the pilgrim slain at the abbey did guys messenger not tell you that getting her answer when john turned away without a word justin had fallen asleep almost as soon as hed stretched out on his blankets when he was awakened a few hours later he fought his return to reality had to be shaken before he could clear the cobwebs from his head durand was leaning over him come on he said john wants you all around justin men were rolled up in blankets sleeping peacefully and he yearned to be one of them with a sigh he sat up and tugged on his boots he followed durand from the hall the two of them threading their way through the sleepers and up into the stairwell he had not even asked where they were going hed find out soon enough it was johns bedchamber so lavishly furnished that he decided petronilla must have given him her absent lord husbands room which john was now sharing with his concubine too tired to marvel at the morals of the highborn justin looked around then saw john sitting in the shadows beyond the light cast by the hearth he was still dressed a wine cup in his hand a flagon at his feet two other flagons had already been discarded in the floor rushes sit down but keep your voice low lest you awaken ursula john said gesturing toward the canopied bed i want you to tell me what you found out in brittany i thought we were to do this in the morning my lord i decided i did not want to wait john drained his cup refilled it with an unsteady hand there is wine over there help yourself justin made one final try to get back to his bed in the great hall durand is here my lord he must have already told you what we learned he did but now i want to hear it from you durand shoved a drink into justins hand saying in a low voice do what the man says or well be trapped here all night justin did dropping down onto the cushions scattered about the floor and taking a long swallow of what turned out to be a very good gascon wine we confronted the lady emmas son at laval he began the hearth flames had burned low and a distinct chill had crept into the chamber but the men were warding it off with wine durand was sprawled out in the floor rushes a wine cup balanced on his chest which rose and fell so evenly that justin suspected he slept john remained in the shadows hed killed two more flagons adding them to the other empties stacked one upon the other like a funeral bier for wine gone but not forgotten this was such a fanciful thought that it occurred to justin that he was not entirely sober hed been trying to limit his own wine intake for john was the last man in christendom with whom hed want to get drunk but he was bonetired and there was something oddly lulling about the dying fire if he stared into it long enough he could make out all sorts of strange shapes putting him in mind of summer days when hed lain out in cheshire meadows with bennet and molly finding castles and ships under full sail and swans in the clouds floating over their heads so you truly do not think that swine simon killed her justin started and glanced toward the sound of that voice john remained well camouflaged in shadows preferring the obscuring gloom to the warmth of the waning hearth what had claudine liked to call himprince of darkness to justin that seemed unusually profound although he was not exactly sure why he groped for this understanding but his thoughts were as elusive as minnows impossible to catch wake up man john tossed an empty flagon in his direction i asked you if you thought that hellspawn killed her i already told you my lord justin said testily that i do not we did at first but not now now i think it was that canon though god knows why god knows why john repeated solemnly and then laughed suddenly indeed he does there was a clatter in the darkness as he fumbled for another flagon the last one he announced in the grave tones of a man on a sinking ship watching the spare boat drift out of reach id send you to the buttery for more but i do not trust you to come back send durand justin suggested and john laughed again tell you what ill share it with you he offered but youll have to wait till the room stops moving i do not want to share with you my lord justin said slowly and distinctly while the image of claudines face formed behind his closed eyelids all the more for me then john swore as he spilled some of the wine onto his tunic i loved her you know he said softly and justin sat up straight for a moment thinking he meant claudine she was my first love john said i was sixteen when she took me to her bed it was a revelation justin thought that over it did not seem very likely to him you are not saying she was the first woman you bedded are you no of course not john sounded mildly offended but she was the first one who showed me what sinning is like if it is done right she taught me a lot did that lady she claimed that most men could pleasure a woman about as well as a dog could read justin laughed for he could hear arzhela saying exactly that she deserved better than simon de lusignan he said not drunk enough to say that shed deserved better than john too she always did say she had bad taste in men john sounded wryly amused but he sounded sad too and justin decided hed definitely had too much to drink if he was starting to feel sorry for the queens son to the lady arzhela he said raising his wine cup high to arzhela john echoed leaning out of the shadows to clink his cup against justins requiescat in pace but not the whoreson who killed her de quincy not in this lifetime nor the next the following day justin was suffering the aftereffects of their bizarre drunken wake for arzhela it was some consolation that john was too but he was irked that durand seemed to have been spared the knights trencher was piled with pasties stuffed with trout and he was eating with gusto whereas the mere sight of them was enough to chase away justins appetite john was faring no better with his meal and when a messenger arrived for him he pushed away from the table with no noticeable regret justin made do with almond milk and bread refusing to watch as durand devoured yet another fishfilled pasty even claudines good newsthat shed coaxed petronilla into taking yann into her householddid not raise his spirits all that much john soon returned beckoning abruptly to justin and durand as he strode toward the stairwell by the time they reached the solar abovestairs he was pacing back and forth impatiently a rolled parchment in his hand it seems he said that id have done better to keep you both here in paris for certes it would have saved me a fair sum of money it is early in the day for riddles my lord durand said i assume yours has something to do with that letter you hold indeed it does john brandished the parchment like a processional torch ive finally heard from the one man ive always been able to depend upon the breton got the last message i sent thanks to emmas assistance not surprisingly he took action straightaway learning more in a fortnight than the two of you could in a twelvemonth and john said triumphantly he has obtained what you two could notproof that it is a forgery chapter march paris france petronillas great hall was a scene of superficial domestic tranquility most of the trestle tables had been taken down after supper a fire burned in the central hearth john was absent having gone off soon after dusk to meet the breton at the cemetery of the holy innocents petronilla and claudine were listening to a harpist while chatting and doing the needlework that was the lot even of women of rank emma was reading her young knight lionel was playing chess with a knight of petronillas household rufus and crispin were hunched over a game of queek others occupied with merels but most of the men in the hall were wagering on a raucous dicing game of raffle ursula was reclining in a cushioned window seat idly petting the small lapdog that was a recent gift from john apparently oblivious to the admiring male glances being cast her way morgan had disappeared after supper but justin and durand were seated at a table gazing gloomily into halffilled wine cups looking as frustrated as they felt they were not in johns favor at the moment as hed made abundantly clear by not taking them as part of his escort that evening now that he no longer needed their services in proving his innocence hed felt free to berate them for their failure to prove the letter was a forgery complaining that hed paid lupescar enough to ransom the pope and had gotten little to show for it while hed exercised enough restraint not to blame them for arzhelas death they knew he did anger was an easier emotion to deal with than grief and the hunt for scapegoats was a favorite pastime of the highborn justin should have been pleased with the turn of events for if john could produce proof of the conspiracy he ought to be free then to return to england but as much as he yearned to see aline as much as he detested being yoked to durand and as much as hed disliked taking orders from john he felt oddly unsettled and dissatisfied with this outcome he knew john would do all in his power to find and punish arzhelas killer hed hoped though to play a part in that reckoning he owed it to arzhela pushing his chair back from the table he encountered resistance hed befriended one of petronillas pampered greyhounds and as he glanced down he expected to see its sleek brindle body stretched out behind him but it was yann curled up in a ball like a cat sound asleep justin looked pensively at the boy whod been trailing after him all day as faithfully as his absent dog shadow shadow was motivated by affection though yann by fear the breton orphan was the proverbial fish out of water stranded on unforgiving parisian shores after making sure that yann was sleeping justin said quietly i would to god id thought to leave the lad with the earl of chester at st james the welsh do not do well when they are uprooted from their native soil i fear that the same may be true for the bretons well you can always wed the lady claudine and adopt the boy but durands mockery was habitual not heartfelt he had too much on his mind to enjoy tormenting justin no man could be as good as the breton claims to be i know the stories told about himthat he comes and goes like a phantom in the night that few men have even seen his face that he is as elusive as a fox and twice as sly mayhap he did find proof positive that the letter is forged but ill need to see it with my own eyes ere ill believe it it sounds as if your nose is out of joint durand justin said mildly amused for all we know he has bloodkin at the breton court spying on his behalf if he were able to tunnel under the walls whilst we had to assault the outer bailey that would give him a huge advantage durand grunted no one knows for sure if he is even a breton if hes not that would play havoc with my theory justin conceded he might well be the bastard spawn of a granville pirate for all we know the corner of durands mouth twitched in what was almost a smile ive never laid eyes upon the whoreson that is a select brotherhood john has met him so has the queen i am not sure if richard has emma did years ago with her brother the old king who knew him well mayhap the only one who did we can probably add the french king to the list and the counts of toulouse and champagne and flanders our master spy travels in rarefied circles does not care to deal with underlings underlings like us justin took a swallow and made a face wondering how long it would take his taste for wine to return we are still confronted with two crimes the plot against john and lady arzhelas murder the breton may have found out who is behind the forgery but what of her killing i thought simon settled that with his grand dive over the table at fougeres damn i wish id seen that something about this still does not fit justin insisted we assumed that canon robert is the killer because of simons action but why then did she say roparzh with her dying breath durand shrugged mayhap she was no longer lucid mayhap she was back in time and roparzh was the name of the squire whod taken her maidenhead twentysome years ago or a fond name for her second husband or her favorite dog no i saw her eyes you did not she knew she was dying and she was trying very hard to tell me her killers identity i am as sure of that as ive ever been of anything durand shrugged again so who is roparzh weve been over this again and again de quincy we met no one at the breton court with that name before justin could respond a small voice piped up behind his chair yes you did they both swung about to stare down at yann what do you mean lad yann sat up yawning i was half asleep heard you talking his words trailed off for he was becoming aware of their tension i was not eavesdropping on purpose that does not matter yann you said we knew someone named roparzh who that canon you were talking about yann said warily still not sure he wasnt in trouble robert and roparzh they are the same name durand let out his breath you are saying that roparzh is breton for robert yann grinned gaining enough confidence to add impishly no robert is french for roparzh there was a long silence as they took this in this still does not make sense justin said slowly she was trying to tell me who her killer was why did she not say robert then why the breton form of his name if shed called him robert wed have thought of the canon straightaway why roparzh she was dying de quincy she was bretonborn so why would she not be thinking in breton at the last i suppose it is possible justin said not convinced she was so intent upon telling mewhat if she used the name roparzh it must mean something let me know if you figure it out durand picked up his cup saw that it was empty and reached over to claim justins i think ill stop torturing myself with riddles and go win some money at raffle but although he glanced across the hall toward the dice game he did not move no more able than justin to let go yann looked from one to the other yearning to help if only hed not left the lady alone shed paid with her life for his greed for those few coins hed filched from the sleeping poacher if the lady called him roparzh he ventured mayhap he was breton no lad justin said as kindly as he could he was from toulouse though that was likely a lie too but even if he were bretonborn why would it matter why would lady arzhela have wanted me to know that he had no answer and neither did durand rising justin coaxed yann to his feet and started to lead him toward a corner where he could sleep without fear of being stepped upon he stopped almost at once struck as if by lightning by an improbable idea durand this is going to sound crazed hear me out though what if arzhela were trying to tell us that robert was the breton you said yourself it would not matter if he were breton not a breton the breton that is preposterous is it think about it if constance and her barons wanted to entrap john in a web not of his making who better to do it than a legendary spy ill grant you that much but we need more to go on than your sixth sense de quincy why else would arzhela have called him roparzh she was telling us his true identity she was suspicious of him from the first was convinced he was feigning illness at vitre to avoid us and she was right durand but it was not you or me he was evading it was emmaemma who could recognize him they looked at each other and then turned as one a perfectly coordinated movement in emmas direction she glanced up startled as they bore down upon her but once she understood what they wanted of her she could not give them the certainty they craved i did meet him she confirmed but i do not remember anything that distinctive about him nothing like a scar or red hair or even freckles he was attractive in a subdued sort of way and well spoken his hair was brown i think he was neither uncommonly tall nor unusually short in other words he was a man whod not call undue attention to himself a useful attribute for a spy you truly think this canon robert is the breton they could not blame her for sounding dubious we are exploring the possibility durand said dryly let us assume that you are right de quincy arzhela learns through pillow talk with her lover who canon robert really is he then learns of simons slip of the tongue he knows that arzhela has a past with john so he kills her to keep her from telling john of his doubledealing but then he has a new problem simon de lusignan and not one hed anticipated justin said he did not realize that simon truly cared about arzhela so now he has simon set upon collecting a blood debt awkward at best dangerous at worst weve been approaching this from the wrong end everyone assumed that simon had broken out and then gone in search of canon robert what if it were the other way around if canon robert had come in the night to silence simon durand nodded thoughtfully accepting that premise so he enters the storeroom intending to make sure simon does not blurt out any inconvenient accusations on the morrow but he finds that simon is not as easy to kill as arzhela we can testify to that they fight and what then the toll collector said simon had blood on his clothes lets assume he was the one wounded but he got away stole a horse and fled i can understand that if he had the breton on his tail once he had escaped though why did he not return and seek out the duchess for help why ride for paris durand saw where justin was going for his thoughts were heading along that same sinister path john is here he said flatly and emma turned to stare at him in astonishment you think he came to paris to tell john how and why arzhela died if i were the breton justin said id be wondering that too emma was shaking her head how could he betray the breton without betraying his own involvement in the plot what man would willingly put himself at johns mercy a desperate man a man wanting vengeance and seeing no other way to get it justin said without hesitation for he was becoming increasingly convinced of the bretons guilt but even if de lusignan was not coming to paris to seek john out the breton would fear he was he could not take that chance would have to follow simon and stop him whatever the cost that would not be easy emma pointed out not in a city the size of paris no it would not durand agreed it would be easy enough though to find john it took a moment for emma to realize the full implication of his words no he would not dare then why justin said did he send john that message a message we know to be untrue but all of this is based upon supposition she objected you are assuming that canon robert and the breton are one and the same what if they are not if we are wrong durand said grimly it does not matter much but if we are right john has been lured into a trap the cemetery of the holy innocents was the primary burial ground for paris situated on the right bank of the seine in the area known as champeaux it was close to les halles the large indoor market of the weavers and drapers until a few years ago the cemetery had been an open marshy field but the french king had gotten so many complaints about the unsanitary conditions and the brazen behavior of the prostitutes thieves and beggars who congregated in the graveyard that he had ordered it to be surrounded by walls and closed at night as john and his escort rode along the rue de la ferronnerie several of the men grinned when they passed a narrow adjoining alley for one of the citys more notorious brothels was to be found in that dark winding lane listening to their ribald bantering john grinned too thinking he might let them stop there or at the equally infamous bawdy house in rue puteymuce whoreinhiding street on their way back if the bretons information proved accurate hed have good reason to celebrate when they reached the first of the cemetery gates he called a halt and ordered the men to dismount you will await me here he instructed garnier the household knight hed chosen to command his men ill not be long garnier was young and eager and not happy at being excluded from his lords mysterious graveyard meeting are you sure you do not want some of us to accompany you my lord would it not be better to have us there in case some mishap should befall you what sort of mishap garnier you think i might fall into an open grave or be snatched away by a demon on the prowl garnier did not think it was wise to jest about evil spirits especially so close to a burial ground unable to remonstrate with his lord he contented himself with a dutiful as you will and john relented enough to offer an explanation you need not fret on my behalf garnier i agree that a graveyard is an odd place for a meeting but the man i am meeting is rather odd himself he shuns the daylight more than a bat does prefers to skulk about in the shadows where none will notice his passing this is not the first time ive met him at holy innocents nor will it be the last approaching the gate john smiled at the sight of the broken lock i see he got here first reaching for garniers lantern he shoved the gate back and stepped inside holy innocents like most urban cemeteries was laid out like a monastery cloister with the church and charnel houses enclosing an inner expanse of open ground there the poor were buried in common grave pits the affluent sought their final resting places under the charnel house galleries or within the church itself by daylight the cemetery would offer an ironic affirmation of life for many activities besides funerals were conducted here people came to gossip to flirt to strike bargains with peddlers to rejoice that they were not yet one with the bones piled in the spaces above the charnel house arches but by night holy innocents was the realm of the dead the sky was splattered with clouds and very little moonlight was trickling through into the cemetery light did glow from the lanterne des morts the lantern of death that was a common feature of french graveyards a stone column shaped like a little lighthouse its lamp had been lit at dusk but its feeble illumination was no match for the encroaching dark john was not sure of its purpose whether it was intended to protect the dead from the devil or the living from ghosts but as he cautiously made his way across the marshy uneven ground he hoped it was the latter for all his bravado john was not happy to be meeting the breton in a burial ground he was willing to indulge the spys whim because so much was at stake but he was not as indifferent to his spectral surroundings as hed have garnier believe one of the more unpleasant experiences of his childhood had taken place in a cemetery hed been about four or five years old it had been one of those rare occasions when most of his family had gathered under the same roof probably a christmas court and hed been tagging after his older brothers richard and geoffrey much to their annoyance when theyd attempted to lose him by detouring into a graveyard hed doggedly followed and fallen into an open grave he wasnt sure how long hed been trapped but for months afterward he awakened screaming and he never believed his brothers avowals that theyd not heard him crying out for help he took care now to steer clear of the common graves for they were open too christs poor were interred in these deep ditches laid to rest on top of others whod gone to god and then covered with only a foot or two of dirt when the grave was filled to capacity their skeletons were dug up and carted off to the charnel house and it was not unusual to stumble over stray skulls or forgotten bones on a stroll through the cemetery but such grisly evidence of mans mortality was not as troubling in the full light of day after dark it was all too easy to conjure up phantom fears and to shy at shadows and whatever his other faults no one had ever accused john of lacking imagination raising his lantern john saw no corresponding gleam of light in the past hed met the breton by the oldest charnel house and he started in that direction it was slow going for not all the graves had markers or wooden crosses hed covered half the distance when he caught movement from the corner of his eye he spun around as figures began to emerge from the darkness there were three of them spreading out as they approached him cutting off his avenues of escape swearing under his breath john unfastened the money pouch from his belt and flung it onto the ground have it and be damned he said for he was not foolish enough to take on three opponents they were close enough now for him to see they were armed one with a sword the other two with knives and a nastylooking club john made an effort to convince himself that this was just foul luck but he knew better why would it profit outlaws to be lurking around holy innocents now that the cemetery was closed at night he felt no surprise when they ignored the money pouch continuing to advance that could be picked up afterward once theyd done what they had been paid to do with chilling certainty john realized he was facing men hired to kill him hed already drawn his sword now he unfastened his mantle dropped his lantern and shouted garnier to me the man in the lead smirked id not count on his help he said as a fourth shadow took shape this man coming from the direction of the rue de la ferronnerie at the same time there was a loud pounding curses and garnier yelled that the gate had been barred from the inside his heart thudding john began to back up slowly eventually his menatarms would either break through the gate or scale the wall but he was not sure theyd be in time hed seen knaves like these before scarred and battered by life with only one marketable skill at which they excelledkilling like wolves stalking a deer they were herding him toward the charnel house gallery where hed have little room to maneuver knowing he had to break free of this deadly circle john feinted at the man with the sword and then pivoted upon the one with the club such a highrisk gambit that it often worked it almost did his target yelped as his sword found flesh and recoiled but the wound was not lethal nor even incapacitating john may have drawn first blood but he was still outnumbered four to one it was then that another man materialized from the darkness swinging a cudgel he took the assassins by surprise had struck one down before they even knew he was there john took advantage of the confusion to impale the closest of his attackers the man screamed and when john jerked his blade free both of them were sprayed with blood his new ally was grappling with the clubwielder a sudden splintering sound followed by cries of jubilation signaled that the tide was turning in johns favor and the third killer whirled and fled the outlaw with the club broke free and brought his weapon down upon the head of the good samaritan who staggered and fell to the ground leaping over his body the man disappeared into the darkness just as garnier and johns men came panting upon the scene when his lantern illuminated the blood smearing johns face and hair garnier gasped my lord where are you hurt go after them at that moment john wanted nothing so much as to see his assailants suffer preferably through all eternity each one of those whoresons is worth twenty silver sous his men found that to be powerful motivation and gave chase yelling as if they were on the hunting field raising his lantern garnier gasped again at what its light revealed three crumpled bodies and a veritable sea of blood ignoring two of them john crossed to the third this one saved my life he told garnier if not for him youd have stumbled over my body who is he my lord i have no earthly idea john said although when the lanterns glow fell upon the mans face he did look familiar feeling for a pulse he said at least he still breathes well need a litter to get him back to the house lord john the wind carried the cries to them before the ground began to quiver under the impact of horses being ridden at full gallop torches flared in the dark as riders burst through the shattered gate and into the cemetery durand and justin slid from their saddles even as they reined in hastily drawing their swords at the sight of the bodies and blood justin got his breath back first you were lured into a trap my lord the man you know as the breton wanted you dead you really think so johns sarcasm was all the more savage because he knew just how close hed come to dying here in the cemetery of the holy innocents good of you to warn me de quincy but youre just a bit late some of justin and durands men had dismounted the others were spurring their horses toward the sounds of pursuit john stalked over to the man hed run through grasped his hair and jerked him into a sitting position he groaned eyelids fluttering and then cried out when john shook him roughly hurts does it you tell me what i want to know and youll die quick if you do not i swear by every saint that youll be begging to die who hired you never knew name a bubble of blood had formed in the corner of his mouth paid us goodly sum to kill to kill who some rich fop whod be alone in graveyard easy money he he gave a muted scream as john slammed him back onto the ground then began to choke john got to his feet stood staring down at the convulsing man murder is one thing he said coolly but calling me a fop is quite unmerited thats an insult ill not be forgiving neither justin nor durand was fooled by the flippancy they could see hed been badly shaken by this attempt on his life so were they for they could imagine nothing worse than having to face their queen and tell her that her son had died in their care they did not blame themselves though for being slow to suspect the bretons treachery it still seemed incredible that hed have dared to kill a wouldbe king but the evidence of his demented audacity was all around them my lord their men were coming back triumphantly dragging a bedraggled prisoner one got away but we caught this gutter rat going over the wall shoving the man to his knees before john they crowded around expectantly now that the hunt was over they wanted to be in on the kill the mans face resembled a slab of raw meat both eyes swollen to slits bloodied gaps where teeth had been all the fight had been beaten out of him he answered their questions numbly confirming what theyd gotten from his dying partner theyd been offered a vast sum of money to murder a man in the cemetery they neither knew nor cared who theyd be killing it was enough that theyd be well paid for their deed and had been promised too that they could keep whatever valuables their victim had on him lord john garnier pushed his way through to johns side the man who came to your aidhe needs a doctor straightaway his eyes are rolling back in his head john nodded suddenly realizing how much he wanted to get out of the cemetery himself looking toward the cowering outlaw he said tersely take care of him durand and turned away to retrieve his money pouch as your lordship commands durand said and with almost casual violence drove his sword up under the mans ribs deftly stepping back in time to avoid being splashed with blood justin was the only one startled by such summary justice he stood for a moment gazing down at the body but he could not summon up any pity for the dead man hoping that he was not learning to value life as cheaply as the queens son did he hastened after john are you sure you were not hurt my lord he asked his eyes flicking to those profuse bloodstains thank god you had a man with you in the cemetery we feared youd go in alone i did john paused in the act of mounting he is not one of mine is one of yours i do not know his name but i recognized him after assumed youd sent him to follow me no justin said we did not his eyes met durands but the knight seemed just as baffled looking no less perplexed now john led them over to the wounded man as the torch flames fell upon that ashen familiar face justin caught his breath my god it is morgan chapter march paris france morgan had probably never gotten so much attention and coddling in his life unfortunately he was in no condition to enjoy it petronilla provided a private bedchamber for the injured man and she and claudine hovered around his bed like benevolent butterflies as they waited for the doctor to arrive women were expected to have some knowledge of the healing arts but justin was touched by their solicitude for it seemed genuine he was not surprised when emma showed no inclination to visit the sickroom for it took more imagination than he possessed to envision her nursing the poor the maimed the halt and the blind nor was he surprised by ursulas indifference she did not even appear all that troubled by johns close brush with death justin was very surprised though by johns obvious concern for gratitude had never been one of his more conspicuous virtues but hed sent at once for the french kings own physician and insisted upon seeing for himself that morgan was comfortably settled only then had he gone to clean off a dead mans blood as soon as hed bathed and changed john had summoned durand and justin and banished a pouting ursula from his bedchamber servants had brought wine and a fire burned in the hearth but that richly furnished room was still as cold and forbidding as a crypt tell me john had commanded and they did taking turns as they laid out their reasons for believing the breton was arzhelas killer john listened without interruption but they were not expecting his response no he said i think not so by purest chance those hired killers just happened to be lurking in the graveyard instead of the man you were to meet no durand i do not believe that i am not a fool as youd do well to remember what then are you saying justin interposed why would the breton have tried to murder you if hed not slain the lady arzhela i am saying i do not think he killed arzhela to keep her quiet you do not cut off your toe to treat a blister seeing that they did not understand john said impatiently the breton was not guilty of a personal betrayal all know his services are available to the highest bidder would i have been wroth to find out hed offered his skills to constance of course would i have done whatever i could to make him regret it you could safely say that but i would not have declared a blood feud against the man and he was shrewd enough to know that i might even have made use of his talents again should the need arise killing arzhela would have changed all the rules of the game you do not believe he killed her then do not fret de quincy i am not finding fault with your logic or your conclusions i do think the breton killed arzhela for nothing else explains his mad attack upon me tonight but there is a piece missing from the puzzle his real motive for the murder at that moment there was a knock on the door and claudine popped her head inside my lord john the doctor wants to talk to you about morgan justin would have liked to accompany him but john offered no invitation and he sank back in his seat while john was gone he and durand speculated about his reasoning they still thought the need to silence arzhela was a sufficient motive for murder but they conceded that john knew the breton better than they did john returned before they could pursue this subject at length and the news he brought was not good the doctor cannot say if hell recover claiming it is too early to tell if you ask me physicians have found the perfect way to fleece their flock the patient will live or die no way they can be wrong is there rather like a soothsayer telling a woman with child that shell give birth to either a boy or a girl john flung himself down upon his bed wounds to the head are difficult to heal he mimicked fool doctors we do not need them for the injuries that are easy to heal what does he say we should do for morgan he promises to be back on the morrow with more potions and herbs but for all his fine talk id say morgans best chances rest with the almighty reaching for his wine cup john drank frowned and drank again so if neither of you sent morgan to the cemetery why was he there why would he have followed me justin shook his head my lord those are questions only morgan can answer john grimaced it seems to me that we have an abundance of questions and a dearth of answers and i am getting heartily sick of it as far as we know there are two men with the answers we need i doubt that either of you are capable of running the breton to ground but you ought to be a match for arzhelas hotheaded lover find simon de lusignan even if you have to search every hovel and tavern and bawdy house in paris find him security was increased at petronillas town house and while she did her best in her role as gracious hostess she had the bemused expression of a woman aware that shed utterly lost control of events john instructed garnier to take men and prowl the citys taverns in search of simon de lusignan a task they embraced with commendable enthusiasm claudine volunteered to sit by morgans bedside in case he regained consciousness and justin and durand left the house unnoticed and unheralded pursuing a hunch they walked along the rue de la draperie heading for the grand pont that linked the right bank to the ile de la cite this river island anchored in the middle of the seine was the beating heart of paris the left ventricle ruled by the crown the right ventricle by the church in a domain divided between the french king and the bishop of paris here were located both the royal palace and the cathedral of notredame only partially completed but already giving promise of the magnificence it would eventually obtain and here too was their destination the hoteldieu i hope you are right de quincy without some luck we do not have a prayer in hell of finding de lusignan whats one fish in a sea of forty thousand what made me think of this justin said was a similar hunt back in london you remember gilbert the fleming well we were trying to track down his mad dog of a partner and it finally occurred to me that a man like that was bound to run afoul of the law so we went to newgate gaol and there he was already facing the hangmans noose sometimes the most obvious answer is the one overlooked so youre guessing that simon might be in need of a doctors care all that blood was convincing evidence that someone had been hurt and we know simon had bloodstains on his clothing we also know he did not die on the way to paris so why has he not contacted john changed his mind not likely after riding nigh on two hundred miles by now theyd reached the grand pont justin was very impressed for unlike the old london bridge this one was of stone almost twenty feet wide and so well fortified that the moneychangers and even some goldsmiths chose to operate their businesses from the small stalls and booths lining both sides of the span it was so thronged with people and carts and horses that it took them a quarter hour to cross over to the island it was slow going there as well for the streets were barely as wide as a swords length in places justin was content to follow durands lead as hed boasted there was not one of pariss three hundred streets he couldnt find blindfolded the hoteldieu was the oldest hospital in paris under the supervision of the canons of nearby notredame when they were ushered into the great salle they halted in astonishment for it was enormous more than three hundred feet long and filled with beds not only was every bed occupied many held two patients and a few even held three to the men it looked as if half of paris was ailing splitting up they began walking along those crowded aisles but they searched in vain for a patient with blue eyes golden beard and hair and bloody hands they did not give up though primarily because they had no other viable leads and from the hoteldieu they returned to the right bank and visited the hopital des pauvres de sainte opportune and the hopital de la trinite justin even girded himself to check the leper hospital of saintlazare north of the city gates durand balked and waited outside the wattleanddaub fence after that they ran out of hospitals upon their return to petronillas they found john in a foul mood morgan still unconscious and garniers men in need of sobering up for paris seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of taverns to search the weather had turned on them too and a cold sleeting rain poured from leadcolored clouds a last gasp of winter that plunged their spirits even lower but as they shivered around the hearth in johns bedchamber they received aid from an utterly unexpected and unlikely source theyd been relating the days futile hunt to john doing their best to shrug off his sarcastic asides when his beautiful bedmate drifted over to complain of their presence neither justin nor durand was surprised for theyd been around ursula long enough to realize that nothing ever pierced her cocoon of selfabsorption she displayed so little interest in the rest of the world that theyd sometimes wondered why john put up with her they could only conclude that in bed she must set the sheets on fire john brushed off her objections with the unconcern born of long practice if you need a task to occupy yourself ursula you can fetch us wine from the table over there glancing back at the men he said i understand why you think de lusignan may have been wounded why are you so sure though that he did not sicken and die on the road to paris every time we stopped to water the horses to eat or to pass the night we asked about a flaxenhaired stranger riding through in a tearing hurry twice we found people who remembered simon but we found no one whod nursed him and no one whod buried him your wine my lord ursula said sulkily when she returned with wine for the other men she made no attempt to hide her resentment shoving the cups at them with such calculated carelessness that liquid slopped over the rims and would have splashed their clothes had they not anticipated her bad behavior thank you darling durand said smiling at ursula with poisonous politeness and she looked sorry shed not overturned the cup in his lap the men returned to their discussion of simon de lusignans whereabouts and john paid justin a barbed compliment saying his idea had been a good one if only it had worked it was then that ursula made her contribution to the conversation if i were hurting she said id not wait till i reached paris if i were sick enough to need a doctors care id find one as soon as my pain worsened even if it meant veering off the main road and if i thought i was being chased id be all the more likely to seek a safe burrow to lick my wounds they all turned to stare at her surprised both by the sense of her statement and the realization that she paid more heed to her surroundingsand their conversationsthan theyd thought after a moment to reflect though justin shook his head doubtfully we know he did not seek help on the paris road and how many hospitals would he be likely to find out in the countryside other than the lazar houses they are always located in towns john sat upright in his chair his eyes gleaming in the lamplight i can think of one he said for more than six centuries the benedictine abbey of saintgermaindespres had reigned over the open country south of paris within twenty years it would be absorbed by the encroaching city suburbs but on this march morning the abbey rose above the meadows in isolated fortified splendor a citadel of god keeping the world at bay with the walled moated defenses of a secular stronghold the church was surrounded by the abbey buildings two cloisters the refectory and dormitory the abbots lodgings the kitchen the barns and stables the gaol a chapel devoted to the virgin mary and a large wellequipped infirmary although not as spacious as the salle at hoteldieu it was still a goodsized hall with both an infirmarian and a physician in residence to treat ailing monks pilgrims and travelers after durand concocted a plausible story they were allowed to enter in search of a missing cousin in the middle of the hall people were clustered around a frail gaunt figure lying on the bare floor he was clothed in sackcloth and ashes had been sprinkled over his emaciated body at first justin thought he was looking at a corpse but then he saw the feeble rise and fall of the mans chest and realized they were witnessing the last hours of an aged brother of the benedictine order such dramatic deathbed abasement was seen as atonement for past sins of pride and arrogance although justin wondered how many opportunities an elderly monk could have had for prideful fits of temper about a dozen beds were occupied by patients several of them shielded by screens it was in one of the latter that they found simon de lusignan sleeping peacefully and so soundly that he had to be shaken awake they were tense anticipating resistance but he merely gazed up at them his face impassive his thoughts masked are you going to come with us quietly durand asked lowvoiced or will i have the pleasure of dragging you behind my horse still holding a grudge for that kick in the ballocks are you with an effort simon propped himself up on his elbows and as the blanket slipped they saw the bretons handiwork his ribs were tightly bandaged where are we going i think you can guess where are your clothes simon pointed to a nearby coffer and when justin tossed his clothes onto the bed he struggled to pull his shirt over his head wincing but offering no protests youre being very cooperative justin said suspiciously and he smiled tightly i hear that all the time by now hed gotten his tunic on although the exertion had obviously taken its toll ill need help with my boots he said and justin reached for them with a sigh knowing durand would let him walk barefoot back to paris before lending a hand once simon was on his feet he looked from one to the other i do not suppose youll believe this but i was planning to seek your lord out as soon as i was on the mend justin did not care to hear john described as his lord and he felt a sudden nostalgic pang for those bygone days when he could identify himself as the queens man and take pride in it he knew nothing was likely to be so simple or straightforward once king richard was free and back in england for better or for worse it would be a different world their arrival with simon de lusignan created a gratifying commotion and justin and durand were both amused when claudine strode over and slapped her abductor across the face justin was not so amused though when simon gallantly kissed the hand that had struck him vowing that hed never have harmed one so beautiful there was good news about morgan hed awakened briefly and seemed lucid before falling asleep again but john showed none of the jubilation theyd expected tersely instructing them to join him abovestairs in the solar simon was exhausted after the ride back to the city he knew better than to object however and did as he was bidden the sangfroid hed shown at the abbey infirmary was beginning to thaw and he was regarding john with the wariness of a small prey animal in the presence of a much larger predator emma accompanied them taking it as her just due and when john did not object so did claudine simon asked meekly if he could sit down hotheaded or not he had clearly taken johns measure the queens son gestured abruptly toward a stool but chose not to sit himself pacing back and forth with such smoldering restless energy that he unsettled them all ive seen corpses with better color john said studying simon with a noticeable lack of sympathy so de quincy was right then and you had a close encounter with the bretons everhandy dagger simon blinked you know about the breton his head swiveled toward justin and durand ah so you figured out what roparzh meant clever very clever he said softly and they were not sure if he meant arzhelas stratagem or their deduction simon swallowed glancing toward a nearby wine flagon but no one took the hint my lord count i am here for justice well youre a bold son of a bitch ill give you that not for me for the lady arzhela de dinan i tried to avenge her but i failed it is my hope that you can do better i have no interest whatsoever in your hopes de lusignan we know the breton killed lady arzhela what we do not know is how this pretty conspiracy of yours was hatched whose idea was it to hire the breton it was his he sought me out the first sunday in advent told me he knew of a way for us to make a large sum of money i was to go to raoul de fougeres and say that id learned that there was a canon in toulouse with evidence that would be your ruination and ask if he was interested in pursuing it naturally he was and in time i produced canon robert and his incendiary letter the bretons were only too happy to buy it john could hide neither his surprise nor his skepticism youre saying they never knew they were dealing with the breton i would think his credentials would have been an asset a means of validating the socalled proof he was adamant from the first that his identity not be disclosed i did not understand why myself simon acknowledged but i was not about to question my good fortune hed not have needed me as a gobetween if hed not been so set upon staying in the shadows he provided me with the letter and the finest set of forged seals a man could hope to see forgetting for the moment the audience he was addressing simon sounded almost admiring of his partners artistry he was never one to stint on quality and i daresay many at the breton court believed the letter was genuine forgive me if i do not share your enthusiasm for a forgery meant to be my ruination john said and the tone of his voice raised the hairs on the back of simons neck i know ive given you no reason to think kindly of me he said hastily but i was not motivated by malice it was just for the money no more than that his listeners could only marvel at the most inept awkward apology theyd ever heard that makes me feel so much better john said caustically knowing it was never personal if i go to the gallows for treason at least ill have the consolation of knowing you bear me no ill will simon swallowed again it was the bretons doing i came along for the ride but the hand on the reins was his john walked over to simon standing so close that the younger man shifted uneasily on the stool tell me about the breton and arzhela id had too much to drink and she got it out of me about the breton she was good at that i warned her to keep quiet which was a mistake she had a hellcats temper simon smiled ruefully glancing up at john as if they were allies in the eternal malefemale wars so we fought and i went off to brood about women and their vexing ways and to be honest with you to drown my troubles in a river of wine when i sobered up i rode back to fougeres but arzhela had already gone on to mont st michel so we never got to make our peace and the next time i saw her she was laid out on a bier in st etiennes crypt his voice thickened and he bowed his head justin watched the performance with apprehension he did not doubt simons grieving for arzhela was genuine but neither did he doubt that the other man was quite capable of using that grief to his own advantage just as hed attempted to forge a sense of male camaraderie with john he feared that simon would try to retreat into the shadow world of loss whenever he was cornered and he glanced over at john hoping that hed not allow it he need not have worried i think you are forgetting something simon john said the coolness of his voice belied by what they saw in his eyes when did you tell the breton that youd misspoken and arzhela knew his true identity simon expelled a longheld breath i did tell him he admitted almost inaudibly keeping his eyes fixed upon the floor rushes arzhela could be as strongwilled as any man as impulsive as a swallow on the wing i thought i ought to warn him that there might be trouble brewing but i never thought hed harm her he looked up then his eyes glistening with unshed tears i swear by all thats holy that i did not so why then justin asked did you go racing off to the abbey as you did i wanted to mend our quarrel i did not suspect him even after he disappeared from fougeres he was always going off on mysterious errands of his own simons shoulders twitched in a halfshrug that quickly brought a spasm of pain to his face placing a hand to his bandaged ribs he said earnestly i did not suspect he had killing in mind i did not of course you did not lad durand said his voice dripping icicles and disbelief after all this was the breton a man of known integrity and honor jesu forfend that hed ever resort to murder simon showed his temper was not truly tamed then by glaring at durand of course hes killed men he snapped but not a woman not one so highborn so dear to me i tell you it never occurred to me that he could be guilty not until that day at the genets priory when you told me shed whispered roparzh ere she died then i knew too late i knew what id done it was emma who gave voice to the query in all their minds so dear to me she echoed incredulously why should the breton give a flying fig for your passing fancies for that matter why should he have entrusted you with so much even if he needed a gobetween as you claim why you she did not need to finish the rest of that disdainful thought the tone of her voice said it all simons head jerked as his eyes cut sharply from emma to john you do not know then know what the breton and iwe are kinsmen if hed been hoping for a dramatic response to his revelation simon was to be disappointed there was a long silence although over his head their eyes met in mutual amazement do not stop now john said sardonically not when we are hanging upon your every word it is true simon insisted his mother and mine were sisters albeit born twenty years apart this was the first time id had any business dealings with him but ive known him all my life and his identity as the breton was an open family secret he chose me because of my involvement with arzhelaironic is it not he said i was already familiar with the lords of the breton court and he knew for certes that id jump at his offer like a starving trout hed been an impoverished younger son too once although none of them would give simon the satisfaction of acknowledging it hed just established his bona fides beyond doubt for the weak link in his story had been the one that forged a bond between him and the breton assuming for the moment that we believe you john said what happened at fougeres you know that already my lord the breton tried to kill me but he discovered that was not so easily done simon said with a hint of smugness in his voice he had the weapon and thought he had the element of surprise i was waiting for him though and i was younger and faster if not fast enough his hand slid unbidden to his side i knew hed try again so i stole a horse and rode for my life glancing toward justin simon added your men told me that the breton tried to make it seem as if id killed him leaving behind a bloodstained garment he then stole a horse too or bought one for all i know and came after me why did you not tell the duchess constance of your suspicions durand demanded but this time simon knew better than to shrug i thought about it but then it would have come out that the letter was a forgery and i was not sure if the duchess knew that i was afraid too that the breton would twist the truth for i had no actual proof that hed slain arzhela the duchess wanted to believe the letter was genuine i thought they might decide to cast the both of us into one of lord raouls oubliettes let god sort out our guilt so you were coming to me john said and simon flashed a sheepish smile that was not quite as artless as hed hoped that sounds mad i know but i was wagering that youd rather thwart the breton and avenge arzhelas murder than punish me for my lesser sins is this is this a wager ill win my lord count it is too early to tell where is the breton now i would to god i knew i am sure he is in paris though i am willing to be the bait my lord if that will draw him out of hiding how kind of you as it happens he has already made a move he paid to have me slain simons shock seemed genuine his jaw dropped he would dare that does not sound like him for hes never been one to panic it was a family joke that if he were cut hed bleed ice water i can see him trying to silence me now but to strike at you my lord his words trailed off dubiously this was the second time that the bretons motives had been questioned and justin was beginning to wonder if john and simon were right and there was more at stake here than they knew he looked from simon to john and then over at durand realizing that simons capture was not going to be the magic elixir after all dross would not turn into gold on the words of simon de lusignan simon had begun to sweat and his complexion was now the color of chalk observing his obvious distress john said dispassionately how did you ever get as far as paris it was not so bad at first but the day ere i reached the abbey at st germain the wound began to bleed again see that he gets medical care john said to the room at large brushing aside simons gratitude with a stark simple truth it is in my interest to keep you alive for now john halted at the door glancing back over his shoulder what is the bretons real name if it was a test simon passed saying without hesitation saer de st brieuc so he is a breton after all johns gaze lingered for a moment upon the master spys rash young cousin i should have known he said that the whoreson would turn out to be a de lusignan simon was long accustomed to hearing defamatory remarks about his more notorious kinsmen he objected only halfheartedly reminding john that the breton was kin on his mothers side of the family but john had already gone simons shoulders slumped with the easing of tension looking around at the others he confided well that was not so bad in truth i expected far worse justin had been surprised too by johns lack of rage hed seemed aloof and somewhat distracted as if part of his mind were mulling over matters far removed from this paris solar and simon de lusignan as he rose to follow durand and simon from the chamber claudine caught his sleeve that wretch was luckier than he deserves she said quietly john got news this noon that chased simon and even the breton from the forefront of his cares justin stopped what news richard she said he learned that richard has reached antwerp and is making ready to sail for england chapter march paris france morgan was drowning his lungs were laboring and he could not shake off the ghostly fingers clutching at him from the depths dragging him down he kept fighting though lunging toward the light and at last he broke the surface gulping in air sweeter than wine you are safe now a female voice murmured soothingly it was a bad dream no more than that the chamber was lit by oil lamps but they seemed to burn with unnatural brightness to morgan and he did his best to filter the glare through his lashes the woman smiling at him was very pretty but not familiar not at first she brought a cup to his lips held it steady as he drank and his memory unclouded identifying her as ivetta lady emmas borrowed maid about time you decided to rejoin the living this was a male voice belonging to a youth in a nearby bed propped up by pillows he was smiling at morgan affably ive been lonely with no one to talk to no one to talk to indeed ivetta said tartly my lady says no work is getting done because half the women in the household keep coming in to see if you are in need of drink or food or comfort master simon but youre the one i yearn to see mistress ivetta simon insisted and she tossed her head partially placated and said shed let the others know that morgan was awake as she departed morgan struggled to sit upright alarmed that he felt so weak he still was not sure where he was although he guessed it was the lady petronillas residence but he had no idea who his cheerful chambermate was nor did he know why he was bedridden what happened to me he asked and even his voice sounded odd to his ears hoarse and raspy you do not remember i can only tell you what ive heard from ivetta and the others lord love them but women do like to gossip they say youre the hero of the hour that you saved john from a hired killers dagger id think a skirmish in a cemetery would not be easy to forget morgans memories were still blurred and too slippery to handle i do remember a graveyard he said uncertainly at least i think i do in truth though the memory that was most vivid disturbingly so was his dream of drowning his head was aching and he lay back against his pillow do i know you well weve never been introduced but you know of me for certes i am simon de lusignan simon watched mischievously as morgan processed that information as his face registered first puzzlement and then realization and then horror ah he said complacently i see your memory has come back morgans bed was surrounded by wellwishers beaming at him with such heartfelt pleasure in his recovery that he was both touched and taken aback i was not going to die he protested not with money owed me from that last game of raffle that evoked laughter and crispin blushed mumbling that hed settle up as soon as he got paid a tray of hot soup had been placed on the table by the bed and claudine coaxed morgan into swallowing a few spoonfuls ignoring simons plaintive plea that he was hungry too morgan still did not understand why he was sharing a bedchamber with the chief suspect in the lady arzhelas murder hed been told that simon was on their side now but there was so much to absorb that not all of it had sunk in yet justin was teasing him about his graveyard gallantry wanting to know why he hadnt singlehandedly broken them out of that fougeres dungeon when the door opened and john strode in i am glad he said to have the chance to thank you at long last there is no need for thanks my lord morgan returned johns smile but he did not seem comfortable and justin noticed for he usually gave the impression of being utterly at home in his own skin yes john said there is consider it a matter of courtesy if nothing else but my lord father always said it was just good manners to thank a man for saving ones life i admit i am curious though about your presence in the cemetery what made you follow me that was the question they all wanted to ask and the room fell silent as they waited for morgans reply his lashes swept down veiling those smoky grey eyes the truth is he seemed to sigh and then said softly i do not know my lord that night is a muddle for me my memories drifting in and out i remember the cemetery i do not remember the fight or being hurt and and i do not remember why i was there i i suppose i feared you were walking into a trap but why he shrugged helplessly johns eyes narrowed well you might remember more later now youd best get some rest he smiled but as he moved toward the door his eyes caught justins leaving morgan to be coddled by the women justin followed the queens son from the chamber as he expected john was awaiting him in the stairwell i cannot interrogate a man on his sickbed but i do not believe a word of that blather about his failing memory neither did justin but loyalty to morgan kept him quiet john did not even notice i wish i could say his motive for coming to my aid did not matter but it does de quincy as we both well know find out what he is hiding justin opened his mouth to object but john was already turning away justin had ridden out to the pre aux clercs the open field west of the city walls where parisians gathered to play games of campball and bandyball to watch tourneys and impromptu horse races on this sunblest afternoon it was crowded with truant students for paris was becoming celebrated for its schools at notredame and saintegenevieve and stvictor and the mild weather had lured large numbers from their classes justin was playing truant too he had no intention of spying on morgan for john and he needed time to himself time to decide what he should do next now that king richard and the queen were back in england he felt he had a duty to return too but he was reluctant to leave until he was sure morgan was truly on the mend and his desire to catch the breton still burned with a whitehot flame hed failed to save arzhela he did not want to fail her again at the least she deserved justice the noisy crowd at pre aux clercs put him in mind of londons smithfield where hed entrapped gilbert the fleming and he could not help studying the faces of the men jostling around him hunting for the breton it was an exercise in futility of course theyd had no luck in their search of the city even though john had been lavish with his offers of bribes and bounties arzhelas killer seemed to have disappeared from the face of the earth after watching a rousing game of campball justin reluctantly remounted and headed his horse back into the city stopping to buy a whipping top for yann from a street vendor when he rode into the courtyard of the lady petronillas residence he found it crowded with men and horses some had dismounted and were lounging on the steps and mounting blocks the rest were still in the saddle passing around wineskins justin did not like the looks of them and he pushed past them into the house with a sense of foreboding the great hall was unnaturally still people were standing around awkwardly most of them watching durand who was stalking back and forth scattering floor rushes with every angry stride garnier was closest to the door and at the sight of justin he edged over what is amiss lupescar he is up in the solar with lord john justin immediately understood why there were no women in the hall not even scullery maids did he quarrel with durand he asked quietly and the young knight nodded there is bad blood between them and i thought it was about to flow in earnest im glad youre here to help me keep the peace we would ill repay lady petronillas hospitality by turning her hall into a battlefield by now justin was accustomed to being dragged into other peoples problems ill see if i can get durand out of here he agreed and crossed the hall garnier says lupescar is abovestairs was john expecting him how would i know durand said curtly and then no i think not he said nothing to me about he stopped abruptly and then justin heard it too the jangle of spurs in the stairwell when lupescar emerged justin moved swiftly to intercept him hoping to deflect another confrontation with durand lupescar paused recognition flickering across his face ah the lost lamb is it not the lamb and the wolf that sounds like an ancient roman fable i am surprised to see you back in paris id have thought life would be more to your liking out in the normanbreton borderlands less law you mean lupescar sounded faintly amused you may tell your friend durand that he has gotten a reprieve for well not be working together after all lord john has no need of me now you do not sound very disappointed by that i care not who hires me as long as his coin is good ill not be lacking for work no i do not suppose you will justin admitted grudgingly glancing over he saw garnier at durands side talking with considerable animation a restraining hand on the other knights arm justin took several steps toward the door attempting to shepherd lupescar in that direction a maneuver that did not escape the wolfs notice i am not going to mend durands bad manners tempting as that may be i am not one for burning bridges if it can be avoided and your lord is likely to need my services again lupescar said still sounding amused justin found his amusement more chilling than another mans enmity hed met few who took genuine pleasure in killing but he did not doubt that lupescar was one of them by now theyd almost reached the door and he looked over his shoulder reassured to see garnier still claiming durands attention i suppose youll be leaving paris then he said to lupescar godspeed lupescar paused in the doorway giving him a supercilious smile you truly do not see do you france is going to be for men like me what the holy land is for pilgrims war is coming as inevitable as spring and as full of promise what do you mean have you not heard that the english king has been set free the highborn are not noted for paying their debts but richard always pays his blood debts always and by his reckoning he owes the king of the french a blood debt it may be true that vengeance is a dish best eaten cold but richard has never been one for waiting ill wager that he will soon descend upon france like the wrath of god almighty he sounded so pleased by that prospect that justins fingers twitched with the urge to make the sign of the cross an instinctive impulse to ward off evil watching as lupescar sauntered down the steps toward his waiting men justin found himself thinking that this godless man could have ridden with the horsemen of the apocalypse and i saw and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death he murmured and this time he did sketch a cross in the mild march air after supper that night justin was playing a game of chess with claudine he usually sought to keep his distance but she had asked him in front of durand and petronilla to play and hed not wanted to shame her by a public refusal so far it had not been as awkward as hed feared she soon had him laughing with her stories of petronillas vexation over her unwanted houseguest simon de lusignan according to petronilla he was making a nuisance of himself from dawn to dusk flirting with the bedazzled serving maids who were fluttering around him like bees around the hive upsetting her cook by demanding his favorite foods and then complaining that they werent done to his liking luring the menatarms into his chamber to throw dice where they made enough noise to raise the dead justin was sure she was exaggerating simons sins although he had seen simons effect upon the female servants he supposed simon was easy enough on the eye but he no more understood their partiality for simon than he had arzhelas i grant you that simon is a pretty polecat he said but hes a polecat all the same why are women so drawn to the darkness as soon as the words had left his mouth he regretted them for his question could easily have applied to claudine and john she did not seem to take it that way though smiling and shrugging i could as easily ask you why men are so taken with simpering biddable poppets i hope you are not including me in that lot he protested laughing thinking that hed never known a biddable poppet in his entire life claudines reply took him by surprise actually i was thinking of the queen and her husband it never occurred to justin that claudine might be referring to richard and his neglected consort berengaria whenever anyone spoke of the queen it was eleanor of aquitaine they had in mind in the same way he assumed that the husband in question was the late king of the english henry and not eleanors first husband the french king louis for henry had been a living legend a fit mate for the most beautiful heiress in christendom the only woman to ever wear the crowns of both england and france what are they the exception that proves the rule he joked clearly all men do not fancy docile gentle females for none would ever call the queen biddable now would they jesu forfend she said just as lightly and he realized how long it had been since theyd been able to talk without constraints but you see justin the old king did want a woman like that why else would he have turned from the queen to a meek little mouse like rosamund clifford he found that to be an interesting question and gave it some serious thought i am just guessing but mayhap rosamund was well restful at times marriage to queen eleanor must have been like riding the whirlwind she considered that i daresay she could have said the same of king henry what of you justin do you want a rosamund clifford or an eleanor of aquitaine must i choose one or the other ive never been drawn to extremes am most comfortable riding in the middle of the road what of you claudine if you could spin the wheel of fortune what would you ask for i no longer know she admitted i was once so sure that id not want to marry again that surprises you does it yes i suppose it does from what youd told me i thought your husband had treated you well he did he was kind and indulgent in an almost paternal sort of way i was young enough to have been his daughter mayhap even his granddaughter after all i was contented enough as his wife but widowhood offered me something more precious than contentmentfreedom for the first time in my life i could do as i pleased that was a heady draught justin a brew few women get to drink not that many men get to taste it either lass the chess game forgotten he regarded her pensively seeing neither johns spy nor the tempting siren whod wrought such havoc in his life but you are no longer sure you said that youd not want to wed again what changed your mind she glanced around making sure none were within earshot aline she said softly id never conceived believed i was barren now i know better so it may be that one day ill want more children not yet though she smiled ruefully not until my memories of the birthing chamber have gotten much dimmer justins memories of alines birth were traumatic too even from the other side of the birthing chamber door weve never talked like this have we you think we can be friends claudine after being lovers why not her dimples flashed as she added impishly in the best of all worlds we could be both i had plenty of time during my pregnancy to learn which herbal potions are most effective in preventing conception he shared her laughter but he was wary of succumbing to her charms for there was no potion for the restoration of trust i do not think i am ready to get my heart broken again thank you he said mingling honesty with humor she pretended to pout coward who knew the queens man was so easily affrighted an odd expression crossed her face then as she heard her own words the queens man she repeated slowly jesu could it be what is it claudine he asked both puzzled and curious and she leaned toward him her dark eyes sparkling with excitement justin i had the most outlandish idea it makes perfect sense though i think i know why the breton killed arzhela john had retired early to bed though not to sleep he was dozing in the afterglow of his lovemaking with ursula when there was a commotion in his bedchamber recognizing the voices of justin durand and his squire he jerked the bed hangings aside i am sorry my lord the squire cried i told them you were abed but they paid me no heed johns gaze flicked from durand to justin he was irked by the intrusion but he remembered that the last time durand had burst into his bedchamber uninvited hed been bearing an urgent warning from the french king what is it what could not wait till the morrow we think we know why the breton murdered the lady arzhela and tried to have you slain john was wide awake now and knowing that hed not be able to get back to sleep decided he might as well be up and about meet me in the solar he directed the men and then instructed his squire to fetch his clothes ursula was sleeping peacefully and he felt a dart of envy for his nights were never as restful as hers even as a boy sleep had not come easily a fickle bitch that teased and tantalized and hovered just out of reach by the time john entered the solar a fire had been lit in the hearth and wine flagons set out dropping down into a highbacked chair he regarded them with open skepticism well enlighten me youve been telling us all along that the breton would not have silenced arzhela out of fear of your retribution i think you were right my lord the breton was acting out of fear but not of you the man he feared was his master the french king john blinked he opened his mouth to dismiss justins claim as ludicrous only to realize it wasnt go on he said tensely tell me more it was claudines idea she called me the queens man and a spark flared in the back of her brain what if the breton was the kings man it would explain everything john was already beginning to see flaws in that theory i grant you that the breton could well be working for philippe but you are forgetting the pact philippe and i made in january in return for french support i agreed to cede much of normandy that accord gave him a vested interest in my kingship philippe wants to see me on the english throne as much as i do hed not have forged that letter i agree my lord the forgery was not philippes doing it was the bretons and set in motion before your deal with the french king simon de lusignan said as much that the breton came to him with the scheme months ago when the breton cast out the bait for duchess constance you and philippe were at odds blaming each other for king richards impending release then you mended your rift and made that pact but it was too late for the breton to stop what hed started they already had the letter johns eyes cut from justin to durand you agree with this i do my lord the breton could only hope that his part would never come to light but then cousin simon blabbed to his bedmate and the breton found out about it he seems to have panicked which is interesting in and of itself showing us how much he thought was at stake he killed arzhela to keep her quiet fearing that shed confide in you and that you in your rage would confide in your ally the french king but it started to go wrong for him justin said for mayhap the first time ever suddenly he had a lunatic on his hands intent upon avenging the lady arzhela when he failed to kill simon he was driven to truly desperate straits if he could not find simon to silence him he could seek to make sure that you never heard simons confession john was quiet staring into the leaping hearth flames which had taken on the shade of molten gold that would explain something else he said at last if he is no longer offering his services to the highest bidder has pledged himself as the french kings man then his insistence upon concealing his identity from the bretons makes sense they hadnt thought of that would he agree to such an exclusive arrangement my lord justin asked and john smiled mirthlessly philippe would have demanded no less i do not find it easy to give my trust but compared to philippe i am as simple and naive as any country virgin he would have expected the breton to serve his interests and his alone so you agree with us then john nodded there has always been a piece missing from this puzzle i never expected though that claudine would be the one to find it rising john began to pace the solar moving from darkness to light and back to darkness again they watched him in silence for a time and then justin asked quietly what would you have us do my lord john turned to face them it is time he said to pay a visit to my dear friend the french king chapter march paris france the royal gardens of the french king jutted out into the river seine like the prow of a ship they would be magnificent in high summer with raised flower beds of peonies poppies and madonna lilies trellised bowers of roses and honeysuckle and wellpruned fruit trees now it was only midmarch the day was mild though and it had seemed like a good place to await johns return justin and durand were seated on the stone wall overlooking the river emma and claudine on a nearby turf bench a few other people sauntered along the pebbled paths several young women were gathered in a bower listening to one of them read from a leatherbound book a man in clerics garb was playing ball with a spaniel none of them were familiar to justin whod never been to the french court before he was disappointed that hed not get to see the french king for he was developing a healthy curiosity about philippe he knew philippes agetwentyeightand his pedigreeonly son of queen eleanors first husband louis capet he knew philippe had assumed power in his teens had already lost one wife in childbirth and had wed a danish princess that past summer and he knew philippe had clashed bitterly with richard in the holy land returning to france as an avowed enemy of the lionheart but the man himself remained a mystery after learning that claudine and durand had met the french king hed begun fishing for insights into philippes character durand had not been overly impressed by philippe but justin doubted that hed have been impressed if the holy martyr st thomas had risen up from his tomb at canterbury shrewd pious implacable and fretful was his concise verdict claudines observations were more detailed he does not ever curse she reported with the amazement of one coming from the profane court of the plantagenets he has a liking for wine he is not fond of horses and disapproves of tournaments he is quick to anger not as quick to forgive he does not have johns perverse sense of humor which is probably for the best for certes he does not possess richards fearlessness but then few men do i would say he likes women i agree with durand though he is not sentimental if i had to choose one word to describe him it would be capable i heard emma put in that he came back from the crusade a changed man he was very ill whilst there nigh unto death and it left its mark from what ive been told he is more suspicious now and his nerves are more ragged around the edges that is true enough durand confirmed he goes nowhere without bodyguards wherever he was meeting with the breton you may be sure it was not at night in the cemetery of the holy innocents john says he became convinced on crusade that richard was plotting against his life when his ally conrad of montferrat was slain by assassins sent by the old man of the mountain philippe suspected that richard was behind it supposedly he was warned that richard had connived with the old man whod dispatched four assassins to kill him too justin was shocked to hear of such vicious infighting among the crusaders hed imagined that men would put aside their rivalries in their joint quest to free jerusalem from the infidels durands story made it sound as if theyd taken all their enmities and grudges with them to the holy land who is the old man of the mountain the leader of a shiite sect who believe that murder is a legitimate tactic of war durands mouth curved in a cynical smile in other words they openly preach what other rulers merely practice now it was claudines turn to be shocked no true christian king would resort to murder durand i take it that means you do not believe richard had a hand in conrads killing durand asked sarcastically claudine and justin answered as one she crying of course not and he demanding surely you are not saying he did durand norichard is not one for planning that far ahead claudine seemed genuinely offended richard is a man of extraordinary courage courage is like charity emma said dryly it covers a multitude of sins when the emperor of cyprus surrendered to richard on condition he not be put in irons richard agreed and then had shackles made of silver justin did not like the tone of this conversation any more than claudine did richard was a celebrated crusader whose deeds in the holy land had become the stuff of legend hed taken it as a matter of faith that richard was a more honorable man than john worthy of the sacrifices the english people had made to gain his freedom he did not want to doubt his king and he hastily changed the subject calling their attention to the young woman just entering the garden fair of face and clothed in costly silks is that the french queen to his surprise they all laughed what he asked perplexed i do not see the humor in my question you truly do not know claudine marveled so great was the scandal that half of christendom was talking of nothing elseah but you were in wales last summer that explains why you did not hear hear what the day after their wedding philippe disavowed ingeborg and sent her off to a monastery where she has been held ever since less than three months later philippe convened a council at compiegne where french bishops and lords dutifully declared the marriage was invalid because ingeborg was related to philippes first wife within the prohibited fourth degree justin was astonished if the marriage was dissolved why is ingeborg still being kept at the monastery why has she not been allowed to go back to denmark philippe would like nothing better than to rid himself of her durand said grinning but she claims their marriage is valid in the eyes of god and man and is appealing to the pope what i find truly odd about the whole matter is that men say she is a beauty eighteen years of age tall and goldenhaired now if shed been a hag i could better understand his skittishness it is very sad for her claudine insisted frowning at durand she is a captive in a foreign country surrounded by people who speak no danish whilst she speaks no french she has been badly treated indeed but for the life of me i do not understand why she is being so stubborn about clinging to this hollow shell of a marriage because emma said coolly this hollow shell of a marriage has made her queen of france justin was too wellmannered to remind her that she did not value her own crown very highly and claudine shared emmas view that life in a remote alien land like wales was a form of penance but durand relished rushing in where angels feared to tread before he could pounce however garnier came into view obviously searching for them justin signaled to catch his eye and he veered in their direction lord john is ready to depart he announced they were leaving the gardens when they encountered john himself standing on the steps at the sight of them he waved his attendants aside and moved to meet them where the devil have you been not waiting for explanations he continued on past them into the gardens they looked at one another shrugged and followed after him hed stopped by the stone wall was gazing out upon the river silvered by sunlight he did not turn as they approached dropping pebbles down into the water well durand blurted out when they could stand the suspense no longer did he admit the breton is in his service no but he did not deny it either and for philippe that qualifies as a confession he acknowledged he has used the breton in the past and expressed dismay when i told him of the mans crimes is he willing to help us justin asked puzzled by johns demeanor it was obvious something was troubling him john nodded flinging a pebble out into the swirling current weve come up with a plan to lure him out into the open it seems the breton has made a practice of finding informers all over paris philippe says he has sources at the provosts at the hospitals the gaols even the templars it must have vexed him sorely when i moved out of the temple into petronillas dwelling there was a faint splash as another stone broke the surface the provost is going to put the word out that an unknown man sought to enter the palace grounds when he was stopped by the guards he insisted he had to see the king or the count of mortain babbling wildly about plots and murder in an abbey he was badly wounded though and died ere he could be questioned it ought not to take long for word to reach the breton he is going to assumeto hopeit was simon but hell need to be sure im wagering that he will come out of hiding to identify the body and when he does well be waiting they exchanged glances encouraged for the plan sounded promising eager to set it into motion they waited impatiently as john continued to watch the ripples stirred up by his pebbles it was claudine who ended the impasse saying softly and with more sympathy than justin liked my lord john what is amiss are you not pleased that this will soon be resolved delighted beyond measure john threw away the last of the stones just missing a lowflying bird philippe told me he said that richard was welcomed into london by huge enthusiastic crowds who were rejoicing as if it were the second coming of the lord christ the sky was a misty pearl color the sun cloaked in morning haze justin was standing on the porch of the parish church of the holy innocents gazing out across the cemetery it was early but the gravediggers had already been busy a body had been fished from the river the day before and it was being buried in the common grave reserved for the poor and the unknown justin had seen few sights as sorrowful as this hasty impromptu burial the body had been sewn into a shroud and lowered into the grave and the gravediggers were shoveling dirt over the remains while trying to keep upwind for the corpse was waterlogged and badly decomposed head bowed a priest was uttering a prayer for the soul of this nameless luckless stranger unmourned but by god at the sound of a step behind him justin turned to see a benedictine monk stifling a grin he shook his head i never thought to see you in monks garb durand no more than id look for a whore in a nunnery you do not exactly look like a lamb of god yourself de quincy lets face it neither of us make good monks but it will be dark enough to fool the breton assuming all goes as planned you think it will not the breton has the devils own luck and it is not heartening to have to rely upon that lunatic de lusignan that scatterbrain of his seems able to entertain only two thoughts at a timegetting laid and getting vengeance justin laughed and followed durand back into the church the parish priest scowled at them as they passed outraged at their intrusion into gods house but unable to disobey a royal command crossing the nave they entered the funerary chapel where the dead were made ready for burial rushlights in wall sconces illuminated two stone slabs crispin was stretched out on one clad in a monks habit hands folded across his chest snoring softly the other corpse was not so content simon de lusignan was squirming around on his bier unable to get comfortable i do not see why i cannot have a pillow the third player in the drama looked glad to see them about time garnier grumbled if i have to listen to any more of his complaints im going to fetch him that pillow and stuff it in his mouth garnier made a surprisingly convincing priest although hed sworn that without a sword he felt as naked as a plucked chicken justin and durand had the advantage of him there for they could hide their weapons under their monastic robes are you absolutely sure sir garnier that the breton has never laid eyes upon you i swear on my mothers soul garnier said patiently you and durand are the only two he knows by sight and the corpse of course durand said glancing over at simon so help me de lusignan if you sneeze or cough or fart and spoil this ill have your guts for dinner i prefer a good beef stew myself simon said flippantly and all three of the men glared at him you need not worry he insisted i know my part i even agreed to have my face powdered and painted so id look more like a dead body if id had my way durand warned thered have been no need for pretense and after that simon settled down lapsing into silence as their vigil began theyd not expected so many people to turn out to view simons corpse several were seeking missing family or friends but most were the curious coming to gawk at the man whod died in the palace grounds under such mysterious circumstances this complicated matters for them and made it more difficult for simon to be a convincing corpse finally garnier began to demand visitors make an offering to the church before looking at the body that thinned the crowd out by midafternoon the mens hopes had begun to flag they stiffened though at the sudden sound of garniers voice in the nave speaking loudly for their benefit alerting them that the newcomer might be the man they were seeking he was explaining that there were two norman monks in the chapel praying over the body of a comrade whod fallen sick soon after their arrival in paris so sad that hell not be buried with his brethren he said keeping up a distracting flow of chatter as he ushered the man into the chapel justin and durand made sure their cowls hid their faces crispins lashes fluttered and then he shut his eyes again he was taking his role seriously simon seemed to be lying very still too here is the body garnier announced adding a pious may god have mercy upon his soul the man stepped into the shadows of the chapel he no longer wore a clerics rochet but justin recognized him at once canon robert the breton arzhelas killer the breton stopped before simons bier stood staring down at the body his face showed none of the satisfaction and relief he must have been feeling alas he said feigning disappointment this is not my friend but i will pay for his funeral indeed god will bless you for that garnier assured him and he shrugged saying modestly that it was the duty of all christians to see to the burial of the less fortunate justin glanced toward durand both savoring the irony of the bretons offer it was a chilling glimpse of the warped way the breton viewed the world he could murder a cousin without qualms but balked at a paupers burial for him meeting durands eyes justin nodded and they began to move toward the door still maintaining a monks pose a monks sedate pace until they were within range it was then that simon struck quick as a snake he came off the bier a concealed dagger suddenly in his hand lunging at the breton with murderous intent only the bretons remarkable reflexes saved his life he flung up his arm and the blade meant for his throat slashed from wrist to elbow he reeled backward blood spurting like a fountain simons momentum carried him onward and he crashed into garnier who was coming to his aid justin and durand were already in motion but they were momentarily halted by the entangled bodies on the floor giving the breton a chance to dart out the door slamming it behind him simon was gasping for breath clutching his injured ribs garnier struggling to his feet justin reached the door first with durand but a step behind him the nave of the church was empty blood splattered on the floor and on the open door leading out to the porch almost at once they discovered a monks habit was not meant for pursuit and they lost precious time ripping the garments off if he gets away durand panted i swear ill skin simon alive with a dull knife justin shared the sentiment but he was saving his breath for the chase bolting out into the garth he came upon an amazing scene their men had emerged from their hiding places and were running after the breton bystanders were gaping a funeral interrupted by the uproar a woman screaming unintelligibly the breton had left a trail of blood in his wake but desperation had given wings to his heels and hed outdistanced his pursuers hed done the unexpected not heading for the closest exit the one opening out onto rue saintdenis once again proving he did have lucifers luck for theyd locked that gate as a precaution he risked a glance over his shoulder sprinting toward the open gateway the same one his hired killers had barred to entrap john within the cemetery but it was then that a band of horsemen galloped through the gates onto the open field to avoid being run down the breton dodged first one way and then another but he was like a fox trying to evade a pack of hounds wherever he turned he found his way blocked by a horse and rider he was being herded away from the gate back into the middle of the cemetery and suddenly the ground gave way under his feet and he went tumbling down into one of the open grave pits meant for christs poor an unrepentant simon had been sent back to petronillas town house newly in need of a doctors care durand had been in favor of shoving him into the open grave with the breton but john overruled him saying hed deal with simon later as soon as he saw john the breton must have known he was doomed he made a game try though claiming that hed never sent john a message to meet him in the cemetery he passionately denied that hed slain arzhela insisting that simon was the killer and the one responsible for the attack upon john too simon had murdered arzhela in a lovers quarrel and then sought to blame him for the crime simon had almost killed him at fougeres castle why had he tried again in the funerary chapel because a dead man could offer no defense could not prove his innocence justin found it disquieting that the breton sounded so convincing it was not long before the french king rode into the cemetery his arrival created chaos for by now a large crowd of spectators had gathered and they surged forward in excitement had to be pushed back by the royal bodyguards sliding from the saddle philippe strode over to john well he demanded where is he john pointed toward the open grave philippe looked startled then walked over to see for himself the breton had wrapped his mantle around his bleeding arm was leaning against the loose earthen bank as if he needed support at the sight of the french king his already ashen face went even paler my lord king for what must have seemed like infinity to the breton john and philippe stood there in silence staring down at him justin had edged closer to get a look at the french king and he was struck by the contrast between the two men philippe was ruddy whereas john was dark and more plainly dressed than the plantagenet who did not let betrayal and rebellion interfere with his pursuit of the newest fashions he was taller than john and although they were only about fifteen months apart in age the french king looked considerably older for hed lost his hair and nails during his nearfatal illness in the holy land his nails had grown back but his hair had not the one trait the two men had in common was that they both made bad enemies as the breton soon would be able to attest assuming he lived long enough to make a dying declaration the breton was attempting to persuade philippe of his innocence just as hed tried with john those listening had to give him credit for glibness he had a tongue that could charm birds out of the trees and virgins out of their maidenheads but his eloquence was wasted upon the only two members of the audience who mattered when he at last ran out of breathor hopethe french king turned to his provost arrest this man i wanted the pleasure of killing the whoreson myself simon glowered defiantly at his interrogators only the fact that he was in bed mothernaked and having his wounds rebandaged kept durand and justin from laying rough hands upon him simon did not seem to realize how narrow his margin of safety was for he continued to insist that hed been in the right if not for these sore ribs of mine id have done it too skewered him like a martinmas shoat you have no notion do you of how lucky you were justin shook his head in disgust lord john and the french king wanted the man taken alive you think theyd have thanked you for sending him to hell that gave simon pausebriefly i did not think about that he admitted when i saw him all i could think about was arzhela bleeding to death on that chapel floor good try lad durand jeered but if it was not planned why did you have that dagger simon considered the question for protection of course better than you i knew how dangerous the breton was morgan an interested observer could not help laughing give it up mates he advised justin and durand the lad is always going to have an answer for you no matter what you ask him it is john he has to answer to durand said sounding grimly gratified by the prospect i only hope he lets me watch on the following day parisians awakened to a chilly downpour the skies were a drab wintry grey a damp wind was gusting off the river and spring seemed to have absconded under cover of darkness john did not let the foul weather interrupt his plans riding off to philippes palace to discuss the bretons fate but most of those in petronillas household chose to stay indoors preferring boredom to getting soaked john did not return in time for dinner and justin noticed that the noonday meal was less lavish than in the past for the first time it occurred to him that entertaining a prince must be costing petronilla a goodly sum of money he hoped that shed remember this lesson the next time she was tempted to flirt with a highliving lord like john fortunately for petronilla her cousin had provided her with a plausible reason for putting an end to her expensive hospitality claudine still wanted to travel into poitou to visit her father and brothers and petronilla had jumped at the chance to accompany her emma too had accepted claudines invitation although in her case justin suspected she was trying to keep as many miles as possible between herself and queen eleanor justin had agreed to speak on her behalf feeling that he owed her after her intercession at fougeres castle but he did not know if the queen would heed him and neither did emma it was still raining several hours later and the infamous black mud of paris was turning the city into a quagmire only those city streets that were paved were passable when john entered the great hall his boots were caked his mantle so splattered that its original color was not easily determined he shrugged out of it let it puddle to the floor at his feet and crossed to the hearth to warm himself only then did he beckon to justin and durand come with me he said and headed toward the stairwell they obeyed followed a few moments later by emma and claudine expecting to be led to the solar to their surprise john continued to lead them on up the stairs until theyd reached the room up under the eaves of the roof where morgan and simon were lodged they were both up and dressed seated crosslegged on one of the beds as they played a game of draughts startled by the intrusion they jumped to their feet morgan looking interested simon nervous for hed not yet had a reckoning with john it was obvious to them all that john had something of significance to report and they fidgeted as they waited until he chose to share what hed learned the chamber was cramped dimly lit and had a musty sickbed odor john sat on simons bed and then lounged back his muddy boots doing some damage to the blanket justin was beginning to resent this strange game of cat and mouse john was playing with them but he had decided hed not be the one to blink first durand seemed to have made the same resolution for he was leaning against the door feigning indifference but emma had no patience for the games of men and she said sharply well john what did you find out when will the breton be brought to trial and more important what will he be charged with there will be no trial aunt emma johns face was in shadows and his voice was toneless difficult to read philippe told me that the breton is dead hed been taken under guard to the dungeons at the grand chatelet and was found this morning hanged by his bedsheet there was a startled silence but it didnt last long they all began to talk at once raising their voices to make themselves heard and it was soon apparent that they were of one mind no one believed the breton had killed himself who ever heard of a prisoner being given bed linens how convenient it was that the breton had taken so many mens secrets to his grave had he by chance left a confession behind admitting his guilt in other crimes the provost and bailiffs had been unable to solve simon finally cut through the sarcasm and skepticism by pointing out a salient fact whether the breton had died by his own hand or hed had help he was dead and on his way to hell justice had been done i feared that hed weasel out of the charges at a trial could we truly have proved he murdered the lady arzhela as much as id like to have seen that misbegotten hellspawn publicly shamed and pelted with mud and rotten eggs as he was dragged to the gallows at least he has paid for his crimes with his life i for one am going to celebrate who wants to join me in the great hall to drink to the lady arzhelas memory and the bretons eternal damnation they looked toward john and when he did not object morgan and simon started for the door glad to escape the rooms stale atmosphere claudine and emma followed justin and durand would have liked to follow too but john had yet to move are you disappointed that there will be no trial my lord justin asked that would have been the most effective way to prove the letter was a forgery but you are such an innocent de quincy durand scoffed do you truly think that letter would ever have been mentioned in court how would that benefit the french king as little as hed have liked that forgery to succeed he is not about to make any accusations against the duchess constance with war looming between france and england brittany may prove useful down the road as a possible heir to the english throne young arthur is worth his weight in gold justin had never thought of himself as an innocent certainly not after more than a year as the queens man but hed still clung to a few illusions about royal justice illusions he was loath to surrender as he glanced from durand to john he found himself hoping that hed never become as jaded and distrustful as they were the price of something and its value were not always one and the same do not mock de quincy durand john said this world of ours is one of sheep and wolves and god made him a sheep as simple as that a man cannot fight his fate justin was rankled enough to hit back and what was the lady arzhela my lord a lamb to the slaughter or a shewolf john looked at him his expression giving away nothing of his thoughts i do not blame you for not wanting to be a sheep de quincy but you are not ready to run with the wolves for example i daresay it never occurred to you that this forgery scheme of the bretons most likely originated with philippe it was too well conceived for the breton to have plucked it out of the air my guess is that this was one of philippes contingency plans to be used if and when needed the bretons great mistake was thinking that he was the puppeteer not the puppet my friend the french king does not like his hirelings to show so much enterprise and then he blundered even more badly by getting caught at it foundout sins are the only unforgivable kind justin was momentarily at a loss disquieted by a cynicism so corrosive so soulstifling if you are saying that the breton would never have faced a reckoning over the forgery my lord at least he has not escaped punishment for the lady arzhelas murder at least he has answered for that yes john said and then assuming that he is really dead sharon kay penman prince of darkness chapter march paris france master justin come quick yann tumbled out of the stair well into the great hall hurry he pleaded they are fighting easy lad justin grasped the boy by the shoulders who morgan and the other one for a confused moment yann could not recall the name of the man he privately called the cock for the way he strutted around simon he gasped simon justin plunged into the stairwell as did durand and garnier other men would have followed too for a fight was always a popular form of entertainment but emma halted their rush they can deal with it she said and after the others dispersed in disappointment she indulged her own curiosity and started up the stairs with claudine right behind her they heard the sounds of conflict before they reached morgan and simons small chamber under the roof eaves bursting into the room they halted in surprise theyd taken it for granted that simon was the instigator but it was obvious from the first glance that he was defending himself blood trickling from a torn lip he was trying to keep morgan at bay hell and furies he insisted i do not want to fight with you morgan paid him no heed and drove his fist into simons stomach he cried out in pain and fury and grabbed for the closest weapon at hand a wine flagon which he swung at morgans head morgan ducked under it and tackled simon who went crashing into one of the overturned pallets rolling around in the floor rushes they were cursing and pummeling each other as justin and durand intervened stop it you fools durand bellowed laboring to separate the two men morgan proved harder to convince than simon and continued to struggle until justin and garnier pinned him down shoving simon into a corner durand glowered at morgan if we let you up will you cease acting like a crazy man yes morgan was breathing as heavily as a foundering horse his face darkly flushed but his fury had yet to diminish i found that hellspawn going through my belongings leaning against the wall simon daubed at his bleeding mouth with the sleeve of his tunic clutching his bandaged ribs with his free hand you would not let me explain you idiot he complained i was not stealing the devil you werent i caught you right in the act i am no thief two bretons whore missing horses might dispute that durand said very dryly that was different and you know it any man would take a horse if his life were in danger even you durandespecially you suppose you tell us then justin suggested what you were doing if not stealing simon opened his mouth shut it again as he considered his plight ah shit he muttered i guess i have no choice now i was merely doing lord johns bidding morgan looked shocked lord john told you to steal from me no he told me to find out what you were hiding who you really were he said if i did he might take me into his service over my dead body durand sputtered garnier was no less horrified but emma standing in the doorway burst out laughing and so did claudine justin could not help grinning too at the sight of the other mens consternation never one to miss an opportunity simon moved swiftly to take advantage of this one that is all i was doing i swear he said earnestly and lord john was right to be suspicious i like you morgan wish you no misfortune but how do you explain those he pointed dramatically toward the floor rushes justin stooped and picked up the items morgan stiffened but he seemed to realize protest was useless and he said nothing as justin showed the others what hed recovered a handsome gold ring set with a glittering emerald and a small leatherbound psalter emma had a good eye for the value of jewels and her eyebrows rose as she studied the ring this is very costly morgan how would a groom come by it i did not steal it morgan said hotly it was a gift you need to do better than that morgan simon said with a smile that somehow managed to be both sympathetic and condescending and what about the book of prayers how do you explain that i do not owe you any explanations but simon saw that the others were swinging over to his side how many grooms know how to read there are surely some justin objected but even he sounded halfhearted and simon moved in for the kill grooms who read latin he asked incredulously and when justin flipped the psalter open he saw that the prayers were indeed inscribed in latin morgan scowled feeling the weight of their eyes upon him you win he said at last ill tell you what you want to know but i am only telling it once so ill not be saying a word until lord john gets back by the time john returned to the house darkness was obscuring the city skyline and curiosity was at fever pitch at first john dismayed them by insisting that morgans revelations could wait until after supper but he was joking and soon led them abovestairs to the solar morgan faced a small select audience john permitted only justin durand emma and claudine to join him much to the disappointment of simon and garnier once a fire had been lit in the hearth and wine fetched john regarded morgan with narrowed speculative eyes and then said bluntly who are you id prefer to sit morgan said for this will take a while with johns permission he seated himself on a wooden bench usually he was one for lounging or sprawling but now he sat bolt upright arms tightly folded across his chest a very defensive pose my name is morgan bloet i did not lie about that my father is sir ralph bloet lord of lackham he is liegeman to the earl of pembroke and holds lands in gloucestershire hampshire and wiltshire his brother is the lord of raglan there is no need to give us your family history since adam john cut in impatiently but morgan was not intimidated i must do this my way my lord he said stubbornly or ill not do it at all after a pause to make sure hed won this clash of wills he continued my mother is the lady nesta daughter of iorwerth ab owain the lord of caerleon in gwent i am their firstborn son but i was told as far back as i can remember that i was meant for the church his eyes flicked toward the others coming to rest upon emma so yes my lady i can read adding fronti nulla fides warning her in excellent latin that a book should not be judged by its cover a gibe that was wasted upon emma whose latin did not go beyond the responses to the mass john had leaned back in his seat his expression enigmatic i think i see where this road is going he said softly if so he had the advantage over the others who were listening in varying degrees of perplexity and amazement emma was gazing at morgan coldly for an insult that was too cerebral to be understood was especially offensive so why is the son of the earl of pembrokes vassal disguised as my groom morgan returned the look hed shed his humble servants demeanor when hed walked through the solar doorway if you listen my lady youll know last year i overheard something i was not meant to hear my father and uncle were quarreling and my uncle said he called me a it was the first time any of them had seen the loquacious morgan fumbling for words he said i was not of my fathers blood taking refuge again in latin he said his voice barely audible nullius filius justin drew in his breath for that cut too close to the bone nullius filius meant no mans son and that was how hed felt for his entire life did you believe that morgan oddly enough i did i had no reason to for id never lacked for love but somehow i knew that my uncle had spoken true so i went off and got drunk and when i sobered up i sought out my mother and asked for the truth she did not deny it saying that shed wed my father whilst pregnant with another mans child this was turning out to be more painful than morgan had anticipated reaching blindly for his wine cup he drank deeply she did not deceive sir ralph he knew from the first offering marriage to spare her shame justin glanced involuntarily toward claudine shed gone pale and one hand was clasping her throat durand and john were inscrutable but emma looked skeptical the welsh have queer ideas of morality she said to bear a child out of wedlock is not the shame it would be in a more christian country my mother had been a handmaiden to the lady gwenllian the wife of the prince of south wales the lord rhys she could not turn to her family for the man was her fathers sworn enemy she loved her father could not bear to hurt him so that explains her reason for wanting the marriage durand said and now he sounded no less skeptical than emma but what of sir ralph bloet was it why would he take on another mans whelp morgan bristled at the tone but he held his temper looking toward john he said succinctly my mother was highborn and very beautiful i do not doubt it john sipped his wine gestured for morgan to continue did your mother tell you the name of the man whod sired you yes my lord she did the same man who sired you henry fitz empress the english king emma choked on her wine seemed in danger of strangling for several moments claudine gasped and justins mouth dropped open even durand looked startled only john seemed to take this amazing revelation with equanimity indeed when did they have this tryst september of gods year lord rhys came to the english king at pembroke where he was planning to sail for ireland he brought his court and my mother was amongst them she was young and henry was the king morgan said with a slight shrug as if that explained it all and to his audience it did she was flattered bedazzled easily seduced but when she learned she was with child she was panicstricken the king had taken caerleon from her father that summer and hed declared war upon the english crown she feared her father would never have forgiven her had he known shed lain with henry she knew sir ralph and when he found her in tears she confided in him you know the rest of the story yes john agreed we do it is not that uncommon a tale is it i suppose not but this one ended better than most i daresay my mother and sir ralph have been very content in this marriage and he always treated me as if i were his own but you have brothers do you not john said with certainty that would explain why they steered you toward the church even though you were the firstborn it is only natural that hed want his demesnes to pass to his blood kindred morgan nodded his shoulders slumped as if the truth had been a burden hed carried too long so now you know why john asked did my father not provide for you say what you will about him he always took care of his own jesu he even brought a few of his bastards to his court for my mother to raise my mother never told him hed sailed for ireland by the time she realized her plight after she wed sir ralph they agreed that no one need know people would assume that sir ralph had sampled the cream ere he bought it and i daresay most did for i remember no whispers no sidelong looks from neighbors my mother named me morgan after her favorite uncle and sir ralph gave me his name his protection and his affection i have no complaints they did the best they could under the circumstances nor can i blame the english king he did not reject me never knew about me justin flinched wondering if morgan realized how lucky he was to be able to say that he started at the touch of a hand on his shoulder for hed not heard claudines soft footsteps in the rushes she said nothing merely squeezed his arm in silent understanding so why did you come to me under false pretenses emma was obviously having difficulty accepting that her stable groom might also be her nephew what did you want from you nothing after i learned the truth i was confused morgan said with a faint smile at such a vast understatement it took time for me to come to terms with it i was angry at first and i was no longer sure that i wanted a vocation in the church it is an unsettling thing learning that your identity is false your life a lie and then you sought us out john said yes i am not truly sure why morgan admitted i suppose i was curious to find i had another family a royal family emma said tartly making it clear that she had no intention of welcoming this newfound kinsman with open arms you saw a chance to enrich yourself at my brothers expense for harry was no longer alive to deny your claims how did i enrich myself by grooming your horses and mucking out your stalls morgan shot back i admit i was curious and i have a right to be the same blood that flows in your veins lady emma also flows in mine so you say but you have no proof of any of this do you no morgan said reluctantly i have the emerald ring that the king gave my mother and i have her word i need no more than that for she would not lie to me emma found an unexpected ally now in durand who laughed did i miss something it was my understanding lad that shed been lying to you since the day you were born morgan glared at durand she had no choice not whilst her father still lived they agreed that theyd not lie to me should i ever ask and they did not when durand did not respond he swung back toward emma that is why i came to you under false pretenses had i come to you with the truth youd have turned me away at once i knew i had no proof that would satisfy you i disagree all heads turned toward john you do have proof morgan you showed it to me in the cemetery of the holy innocents once again morgan seemed at a loss for words emma was not since when have you become as trusting and guileless as a cloistered nun i thought you had more sense john john shrugged a man he said can never have too many brothers morgan ate supper that evening at the high table a magnet for all eyes petronilla looked bewildered by his sudden elevation from groom to highranking guest emma was smoldering most of johns household avidly curious justin was astonished but very pleased by the outcome i wish morgan well he said quietly to claudine i never expected though that john would accept him so easily or so wholeheartedly it does not surprise me she confided what did john say that his father looked after his own well so does john he is very good about acknowledging his bastard children sees that they want for nothing and of all his brothers the only one he seems truly fond of is will longsword at the mention of johns baseborn half brother justin suddenly realized why morgan had seemed vaguely familiar from their first meeting that is who he reminds me ofwill they do not have the same coloring but there is a resemblance for certes claudine nodded you never met king henry did you well as soon as morgans secret was out i could see the father in the son the same grey eyes the same powerful build the freckles even the bowed legs and if i can see it you may be sure that john does too who would not welcome the ghost of a lost loved one emma justin countered moreover i thought john hated his father no richard did everything was always so much easier for richard but john was his fathers favorite but he betrayed henry abandoned him on his deathbed and went over to richard and the french king yes she said sadly he did on the following day justin began making preparations to depart hed hoped to leave at cockcrow but john had gone to see the french king taking morgan along to introduce him to philippe and justin did not want to go without bidding farewell to the newest plantagenet hed tried to coax morgan into returning to london with him offering to introduce him to the brother with whom he had the most in common will longsword but morgan had declined saying that john had asked him to stay so they could get to know each other justin was not happy about that convinced that john was a corrupting influence upon everyone he encountered but there was nothing to be done about it it was some small consolation that emma was so disgruntled by the turn of events are you still set upon leaving this afternoon claudine gave him a sidelong flirtatious glance half serious half in jest are you not tempted to spend the night good lord yes he said with enough emotion to take any sting out of his refusal but i vowed to forswear any and all temptations during lent now that he and claudine were back on friendly terms he thought it wise to put some distance between them for nothing had changed hed still be lusting after a woman he could not trust mayhap you ought to be the one considering a life in the church not morgan she said with mockery but no malice do you think hell ever take vows justin i know there can be no higher calling than to serve the almighty but it still seems a waste of a good man she giggled looking both pleased and shocked by her own irreverence and justin laughed too you ought to hear durand on that subject he said remembering the knights diatribe about the madness that drives a man to renounce the pleasures of the female flesh and if i needed more proof that it was time for me to leave starting to quote durand is surely it i think you showed great forbearance in not murdering the man and disposing of the body in some breton bog care to wager how long it takes for durand and simon to be at each others throats when he shook his head grinning she glanced around the hall before saying confidentially i hear that yann asked you to take him with you to england and you mustered up enough fortitude to refuse how did you know that ah claudine that was so hard to do but i had no choice i could not look after him not as long as i serve the queen well what about that tavern maid belle she could keep him when you were away though i suppose she is not the motherly sort justin was surprised by that sudden flash of claws you mean nell and i could not ask her to do that she has enough on her plate taking care of her daughter and running the alehouse why do you not like her claudine are you going to claim that she speaks well of me she demanded and he conceded defeat with a smile and a shrug it was then that yann appeared at his elbow startling them both i promise he said before justin could say anything that id be no trouble i do not eat much and i could take care of your dog and run errands yann weve been over this already i am rarely in london and that is not a city for a breton lad to be roaming about on the loose youd not have to go looking for trouble it would come looking for you yann ducked his head as if blinking back tears the lady arzhela would want you to take me he said so disingenuously that justin and claudine were both touched and amused in equal measure yann you scare me sometimes justin said wryly lad listen to me a city like paris or london is not where you belong if only i knew someone who could find a place for you on a country manor the way lady petronilla can justin you do claudine interrupted leaning over she whispered a name in his ear when he shook his head vehemently she looked at him challengingly why not who better to do a good deed than a man of god or are you too proud to ask him for a favor if you want to learn how to get people to do what you want yann you need only watch the lady claudine in action justin said more sharply than hed intended this is what i can do lad i will ask the bishop of chester if he can take you into his household or find a place for you on one of his manors it is likely he will agree but you must remain here until i get word that he does then i will come back for you agreed how do i know you are not just saying this that you will come back for me you have my sworn word if the bishop agrees i will return and take you to chester but you must promise to stay here in paris until you hear from me fair enough yann was not happy with the bargain theyd just struck but at least it offered a glimmer of hope and hed learned to settle for much less i promise he said fingers crossed behind his back within the hour though john and morgan returned and morgan would have none of it you do not want to live in england yann youd be happier in wales for welsh is much easier for a breton lad to learn than english stay here with me and when i go home you can come with me ive cousins about your age at raglan and my mothers brother hywel is the lord of caerleon now so youll have your pick of places do we have a deal deal yann said happily and justin blinking at how quickly the boy switched allegiance from him to morgan gave his approval not seeing what else he could do he trusted morgan after all could hardly blame the man for being johns brother sending yann off on an errand to the kitchen morgan looked intently from justin to claudine back to justin again john learned something from the french king that disquieted him greatly he would not tell me what and i did not feel free to press after all our relationship has lasted barely a day he went out into lady petronillas gardens and is still there i was hoping that you or durand or mayhap you lady claudine might be able to find out what is troubling him i suspect it concerns the bretons and that damned letter justin was not thrilled at the prospect the last place he wanted to venture was into the murky terrain of johns mind but claudine and morgan were looking expectantly at him getting to his feet he started across the hall to find durand john was seated on a wooden bench in the gardens playing with one of petronillas greyhounds seeing the men and claudine bearing down upon him he showed no surprise passing strange how quickly people are drawn to the site of a disaster we want to help morgan said so simply that not even john could doubt his sincerity why not let us i would that you could john conceded but there is naught to be done one of philippes spies at the breton court has sent him word that constance plans to make use of that accursed letter i was hoping that theyd decide it was too risky after simon and the breton both disappeared under such strange circumstances i ought to have known better my luck has always been rotten but you can prove the letter is false claudine said sounding puzzled the breton is dead but simon de lusignan is not and he can testify that it was a scheme to cheat the bretons at your expense and you think anyone in christendom would give credence to a de lusignan john looked at her in disbelief no one would believe anything he had to say his evidence would either be dismissed out of hand because no de lusignan has ever been on speaking terms with the truth or it would be assumed that id paid him to lie on my behalf the french king knows the truth morgan suggested and winced when john laughed harshly god spare me another innocent morgan you have much to learn about our family brother richard would sooner believe the devil than the french king moreover it is no longer in philippes interest to clear me of suspicion now is it only durand seemed to follow johns thinking the others looked so baffled that john sighed struggling to hold onto the scraps of his patience things have changed dramatically in the past fortnight or have you not noticed richard is free back in england and most likely besieging my castles even as we speak once he reduces them to rubble hell be heading for the closest port eager to wreak havoc and let loose the dogs of war upon philippe with richards fiery breath on the backs of our necks were going to be hard pressed to defend our own lands much less strike into his domains id say my chances of becoming englands king are about as good right now as yours are of becoming pope morgan and you may be sure that has not escaped philippes notice morgan still did not see but justin did and he felt a strange pang of pity for john and philippe and richard even for his queen for all those wielding power whilst treading on shifting sands that were no less treacherous than those in the bay of mont st michel he is saying morgan that philippe will fear he may be tempted to try to make his peace with richard so the more suspicion and rancor between the brothers the better it now is for the french king good for you de quincy john said with a sardonic smile you might one day make it to wolfdom after all that was incomprehensible to morgan and claudine whod not been present for johns little lecture about wolves and sheep morgan hesitated sensing that he was stepping out onto thin ice what of queen eleanor could you not tell her that this letter was a forgery she could convince richard then surely the others tensed knowing from painful experience that johns tangled tortured relationship with his mother was a bottomless swamp from which few emerged unscathed john surprised them though by not lashing out at morgan giving his newfound brother something he rarely gave to anyonethe benefit of the doubt that tactictruth tellingmight work with you and the lady nesta he said tersely but not in the bosom of our loving family my lady mother would not believe me with that justin heard the jaws of the trap slam shut mayhap she would not he said wearily but she might believe me chapter march london england justin awakened with a gasp fleeing the darkness of a fougeres dungeon it was not the first disquieting dream hed had of his entombment but this one had a happy ending a blazing surge of sunlight as the trapdoor was flung open and freedom beckoned in the guise of morgan bloet he lay back upon the bed heartened by his night escape hoping it meant that the dreams would come less and less often and eventually not at all he was drifting off to sleep again when there was a sharp knocking on the cottage door hed gotten to london just as curfew was sounding and was one of the last travelers allowed to pass through the city gates by the time hed reached gracechurch street the alehouse was shuttered and still and the houses were dark oil lamps and hearth fires doused for the night hed stabled his mount in a stall next to his stallion copper and stumbled off to his cottage behind gunters blacksmithy not even bothering to remove his boots hed fallen into bed asleep before hed taken half a dozen breaths the knocking continued swinging off the bed he was starting toward the door when it opened and a black whirlwind burst into the cottage to fling itself upon him he staggered backward under the assault and was fending off a hysterical canine as nell followed shadow in dogs she said briskly are more loyal than men and not as much trouble the mad beast has not forgotten you i see how did you know i was back justin asked going over to give her a hug whatyou think gunter would not notice another horse in his stable come with me she insisted steering him toward the door lord only knows the last time you ate so i made you a meal over at the alehouse justin would have liked to change his clothes but he knew better than to argue with nell and followed her outside where he was surprised to see a twilight dusk settling over the city nell confirmed that hed slept for more than eighteen hours we let you stay abed all day like a sluggard was how she put it as she hastened him across the street who are we he asked and had his answer as he pushed open the door of the alehouse it was crowded with his neighbors and friends gunter the blacksmith odo the barber his wife agnes and their nephew daniel ulric the chandler and his wife cicily marcus the cartwright avice the tanners widow nells helper ellis and nells young daughter lucy even aldred and jonas the oneeyed serjeant who was the bane of londons lawless and justins mentor with a shy grin justin stepped forward into the warmth of their welcome by now they knew the ruleshe never talked about what he did for the queenso no one asked about his sudden disappearance or his long absence from gracechurch street instead they caught him up on neighborhood gossip and local happenings telling him that the cobblers wife had run off with a peddler that humphrey the mercer had disgraced himself by turning up drunk as a sailors whore for candlemas mass that a woman over on aldgate street had given birth to twins that a fire had damaged the cookshop down by the river and that king richards entry into the city had been a spectacle to dazzle all eyes all the shops closed early nell explained even the taverns and alehouses shut down since they knew everyone would be out in the street watching for the kings coming and they were too so many people lined up that there was not space for a snake to slither by they hung out of windows and perched in trees and some fools had even clambered onto rooftops to see and the streets were clean aldred reported in awe the rakyers had actually worked for their wages and swept away all the dung and mud and straw and rubbish it was a sight to behold like a great fair day with banners strung across the streets and ribbons wrapped around alepoles and people waving scarves from windows and doves set free in white clouds when the king reached cheapside thank god no fires broke out he added for no one would ever have heard the fire bells over the clamor of the church bells im surprised you did not hear them as far away as france justin it was a fine welcome we gave the lionheart we did ourselves proud for certes and the king and queen seemed right pleased that wed turned out in such great numbers bearing in mind jonas said dryly that londoners will come out by the hundreds for a hanging justin smiled fondly at jonas for the serjeants habitual skepticism seemed like starryeyed optimism when compared to johns lethal cynicism it is good to be home he said you spoke of the queen aldred so richard had berengaria with him ive never laid eyes on her few have was she fair to look upon aldred blinked in confusion beren who i meant lady eleanor what other queen is there at the mention of his royal mistress justin lost some of his cheer he was not looking forward to pleading johns case with the queen but it had to be done on the morrow even before he rode to st albans to see aline where is king richard lodging he asked are they at the tower or at the palace at westminster king richard did not dally here in london hes long gone off to put down lord johns rebellion and the queen why she went with him lad odo volunteered and all the court too streaming out of westminster like a flock of peacocks those pampered lords will be earning their bread now just trying to keep up with the king it sounded to justin as if he would be earning his bread too chasing over half of england after the lionheart where has he gone by common consent they looked toward jonas for he was the sheriffs man would be likely to know and he did youve got a long ride ahead of you he told justin with more amusement than sympathy he went north to besiege lord johns castle at nottingham baby ella was awake in her cradle utterly intent upon getting her foot into her mouth in the other cradle her milksister slept peacefully oblivious to her audience you must be amazed by how big shes gotten rohese said pointing out the obvious with a coquettish smile and her brother baldwin rolled his eyes shed been visiting when justin de quincy arrived and shed been so charmed by his courtly manners that shed been hovering close by insisting upon playing a role in his reunion with his daughter now she was chattering nonstop as justin leaned over the cradle and baldwin and sarra exchanged the sort of amused exasperated glances that rohese so often provoked of course ella is much larger but then shes older so she would be bigger i mean rohese said giggling selfconsciously as she realized how silly she was sounding but your little lass is doing right well for her age when shes not swaddled she squirms about like a baby eel doesnt she sarra if you lie her down on her belly she can roll over onto her back now and when she wakes up in the morning and sees baldwin or sarra she greets them with the sweetest smile baldwin wished his sister would stop gushing over the poor lad and sarra thought it was not tactful of rohese to remind justin de quincy of all the milestones hed missed in his daughters life but in truth justin was not even listening to rohese aline was the only one in the cottage for him at that moment the only one in the world she had a surprisingly thick cap of dark hair and skin like flower petals when he touched her cheek with his finger it felt like the soft downy feathers of a baby bird do you want to hold her rohese murmured throatily and reaching for aline placed the sleeping infant in his arms before sarra could object justin cradled his daughter with such exaggerated care that it was both touching and comical to those watching i am back butterfly he said and those silky lashes fluttered revealing eyes the color of ground cinnamon claudines eyes for a heartbeat they looked at each other and then alines lower lip began to tremble before he could react her mouth contorted and she started to cry there was nothing gradual or tentative about it either she screamed loudly enough to set his ears ringing color flooding her little face tiny fists beating the air in distress sarra came swiftly to his side and reclaimed the frightened child for several moments there was no sound but the babys wailing and a soothing wordless murmur from sarra back in familiar arms aline soon quieted her sobs subsiding into broken hiccups and sarra sat down in a chair discreetly opened her bodice and offered aline the comfort of her breast after an awkward silence rohese said in some embarrassment she is usually such a calm goodnatured baby skittish only with she caught herself but not in time and justin finished the sentence for her only with strangers he said softly william the bastard had chosen nottinghams site for its strategic significance on a red sandstone ridge high above the river trent a new settlement had quickly sprung up in its protective shadow nestled between the castle and the old town and more than a hundred years later the partition persisted nottingham was separated into the normanfrench borough and the saxon borough each with its own sheriff and bailiff justin was both intrigued and unsettled by the dichotomytwo towns two ethnic identitiesfor he rarely thought about the social consequences of the conquest while french was his mother tongue he also spoke english and felt equally at home with the saxon aldred or the norman luke de marston the two halves of nottingham reminded him that england too was a country divided with a king who spoke not a word of english while the castle still held out the city had opened its gates to richard at once the streets were filled with menatarms vendors peddlers beggars the inevitable prostitutes drawn by an armys presence and local curiosityseekers eager to watch as christendoms most celebrated soldier lay siege to his brother johns stronghold the atmosphere was almost festiveuntil justin reached the castle justin had been told that the fortress had been under siege for weeks but it was obvious that there had been a recent assault the timber palisades enclosing the outer bailey were still smoldering and the acrid smell of smoke hung low over the site the tornup bloody ground testified to the cost of the onslaught as did the newly dug grave pits the kings men were now in control of the outer bailey and were in the process of making ready for an attack upon the upper and middle baileys even with his limited siege experience justin could see this would be a much greater challenge for richards soldiers would be charging uphill against men entrenched behind thick stone walls he was searching for will longsword johns half brother theyd established a good rapport and he could rely upon will for an accurate account of the events that had occurred since richards return to english soil he was sure too that will would know where the queen was lodging but finding will in this turbulent roiling sea of soldiers would not be easy he never did find will but much to his surprise he soon saw a familiar figure a small man astride a big bay stallion well armored in chain mail and the authority of command my lord earl he cried loudly enough to attract the earl of chesters attention at the sight of justin he looked equally surprised and urged his mount in the younger mans direction what are you doing here justin exclaimed and then grimaced for it was obvious what the earl was doinglaying siege to nottingham castle he amended his query to when did you get here my lord a few weeks ago last month the council authorized the seizure of lord johns castles at nottingham tickhill marlborough lancaster and st michaels mount in cornwall the earls of huntingdon and derby and i were chosen to reduce nottingham to a pile of rubble so i made haste to return from brittany marlborough and lancaster were quickly taken and the commander at st michaels mount died of fright upon hearing that king richard was free chesters smile was mordant a pity all of the kings foes could not be so obliging so that leaves only tickhill and nottingham only nottingham we got word this morn that tickhill has yielded to the bishop of durham unfortunately the stubborn sods behind these wallswith a wave of his hand toward the castle keephave balked at surrendering they are convinced that king richard is dead and this is a clever trick to deceive them into giving up the king did not take kindly to being dismissed as an impostor as you can well imagine justin looked over at the charred palisade walls so he ordered an assault upon the castle he led it himself de quincy and a bloody one it was with fierce fighting and many deaths but he did in one day what wed failed to do in nigh on a month he took the outer bailey set fire to the barbican guarding the second gate and only withdrew when night fell today he ordered his carpenters to build mangonels and whilst we wait for them to be done he has provided some entertainment for our men and for those huddling within the castle what do you mean my lord justin asked in perplexity and chester smiled grimly come with me he said and ill show you the siege engines were being constructed on the hill north of the castle within sight of the garrison but out of range of their crossbows and here too a gallows had been erected several bodies dangled slowly in the wind as justin and chester reined in to watch another prisoner was dragged up onto the gallows hands tied behind his back a noose was placed around his neck and then he was dispatched to god justin made the sign of the cross over the strangling man relieved when his legs finally stopped kicking some of johns men chester said taken in yesterdays assault the king wanted these rebels to see what awaits those who defy him glancing toward approaching horsemen he said here he comes now justin did not need to be told that richard lionheart wore the light armor hed become accustomed to in the heat of the holy land a chainmail hauberk and a helmet with nose guard he was as fair as john was dark the hair curling out of the back of his helmet was a burnished redgold and the eyes narrowed upon the castle walls were a blazing blue he was astride the most spectacular stallion justin had ever seen the shade of polished pearl with a gait that was poetry in motion and a streaming silver tail that trailed almost to the ground gilded by sunlight man and horse looked otherworldly as if theyd ridden right out of a minstrels tale of bygone glory and as he looked upon the english king justin found himself thinking unexpectedly poor john the queen had chosen to await the resolution of the siege of nottingham at a nearby royal manor the next morning justin set out for clipstone deep in the heart of sherwood forest hed been told it was a hunting lodge built by eleanors husband the late king henry and he half expected it to be a rustic simple structure for henry had never been overly concerned about comfort especially when he was pursuing his passion for the hunt he discovered though that clipstone was a residence of substance with a large stone hall a kings chamber chapel stables fishpond even a deer park and queen eleanor was holding court as if she were back at westminster admitted into the great hall justin was startled to see so many princes of the church at first glance it looked as if every bishop in england had come to do honor to the english king he recognized the archbishop of canterbury and the archbishop of york who waslike morgan bloet and will longsworda bastard son of king henry he recognized too the bishops of hereford and worcester and did not know whether to be relieved or disappointed when he did not find his fathers tall stately figure among the others the queen was the center of attention as shed been for almost all of her seventy years on gods earth her face framed by a fine linen barbette her hair covered by a delicate gauzy veil held in place by a gold circlet she was elegant and regal in damask silk the color of claret and from a distance she appeared to be defying time as boldly as shed defied two royal husbands and the conventions that defined and circumscribed female behavior in their world up close though she looked far more fragile a woman whod lost as many battles as shed won relying upon an indomitable will to spur on an aging body surrounded by prelates she was relating a story of her sons experiences in the holy land and as always justin was startled to see johns greenishgold eyes in her face it was my sons greatest sorrow that he was unable to recapture jerusalem from saladin on one of his scouting expeditions he rode to the top of the hill the crusaders called montjoie which offered a view of jerusalem from its heights but richard refused to join the others instead putting up his shield to block out the sight saying that if he was not able to deliver the holy city from the infidels he was not worthy to behold it that was a story sure to win approbation from an audience of churchmen and there were murmurings of admiration and approval eleanors smile was one justin would long remember for hed never seen her show such unguarded joy he settled himself on the fringes of the crowd content to wait until she took notice of him the sun was slanting toward the west as justin walked beside the fishpond with his queen others were trailing after themher ladiesinwaiting chaplain an earl and several bishopsbut they kept at a discreet distance allowing eleanor to converse in private with her agent the fishpond was located in a southeast corner of the estate some distance from the manor and justin was surprised by the queens stamina shed set a brisk pace that had yet to falter approaching the waters edge she halted listening to the silence breathing in the cool spring air and then said tell me more about this forged letter he did to the best of his ability it was a long story and he worried that shed tire but she brushed aside his concerns and listened intently without interruptions once he was done she gazed for a time at the mirrored surface of the pond her eyes following the drift of the reflected clouds richards release almost did not come to pass she said the emperor had gotten letters from john and philippe pledging to pay him even more money for every month that hed keep richard captive heinrich was sorely tempted to accept their offer and he even dared to show richard the letters her lip curled the man has no shame fortunately that was not true of his lords who were horrified that hed consider this eleventhhour betrayal richard defended himself with the eloquence of outrage and when heinrich realized that his barons were utterly on richards side he agreed to honor our pact but for two days my sons fate hung in the balance thanks to heinrichs greed and their treachery john is right to be fearful justin wisely kept silent for he admittedly did not understand the moral ambiguities that clouded the crimes of the highborn in his judgment johns treachery was reason enough to cast him out into darkness but he knew that was not true for the queen apparently there were sins that could be forgiven and sins that could not and those who wielded power seemed to know instinctively which were which he had done his duty giving his queen an honest account of her youngest sons troubles and he felt he owed john no more than that it would appear eleanor said with a hint of dry humor that you got more than you bargained for in france justin i do not imagine you enjoyed pulling in harness with durand no madame not much you have acquitted yourselves well i am very pleased with you both thank you my lady he said wishing he did not have to share her praise with durand and as if reading his mind she smiled at him durand is comfortable exploring the netherworld he would have to be in order to keep pace with john but it was harder for you i know i will not forget the service you have done me shed resumed walking and he fell in step as she continued to skirt the edge of the pond i daresay you never expected to be pleading emmas case with me or johns either he thought lord john called it my pilgrimage to hell and back he said ruefully yes that sounds like john she said and he thought he heard her sigh did you hear she asked after another silence the garrison at nottingham has agreed to surrender the men in commandralph murdac and william de wennevalsent out two knights under a flag of truce to ascertain for themselves if richard had truly returned once they were satisfied that was indeed so they lost all stomach for further resistance thinking of those gallows set up north of the castle justin was not surprised so it is over then at least on this side of the channel my son has summoned a great council to meet at nottingham in a few days amongst the matters to be dealt with will be johns treason he will be given forty days to appear before the council to answer these charges if he does not he will be judged to have forfeited any and all rights to the english crown his lands already having been confiscated again justin kept silent and they walked on after a time eleanor said richard means to have a reckoning with philippe as soon as possible i expect that well be in france ere the spring is done but i will need you justin to return sooner than that what would you have me do madame she smiled faintly for his matteroffact tone did not completely disguise his dismay you need not leave right away lad take some time to visit with your daughter and then i would have you go back to france where you must do your best to convince john that his only chance of survival is to throw himself on richards mercy it will be no easy task and not one youd choose of your own free will eleanor paused her eyes searching justins face may i rely upon you justin to do my bidding justins hesitation was barely noticeable i serve at the queens pleasure he said
