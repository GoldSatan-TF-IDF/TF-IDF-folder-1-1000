robin cook death benefit prologue krasnoyarsk russia march pm prek vllasi touched his right forefinger to the scar on his upper lip where the cleft had been crudely repaired when he was an infant it was something he did without thinking many times each day more often when he was under pressure right now standing in a filthy room on the tenth floor of a derelict sovietera tower block in the russian city of krasnoyarsk he was getting more nervous by the minute prek checked his watch again and looked over at genti hajdini genti was leaning against a foldout table periodically yawning as he worked on a fingernail with his pocketknife every time he saw genti prek was slightly taken aback by the straight lines of his lieutenants beaky nose from this angle it looked more like the sharp end of a hatchet yes he was sure the chechens were coming genti had just told him for the tenth time good people back home in albania had vouched for this outfit even though he could feel it prek checked the makarov pistol stuck in his belt at the small of his back the puma bag containing euros was on the floor genti had brought the guns and money hidden in a truckload of turkish fruit hed driven deep into russia no wonder he was tired there was nothing else to do but wait it was freezingthe temperature had topped out at twenty below and the sun would be gone in an hour and a half outside the sky was the same dirty color as the buildings and the ground prek started pacing around the large room what must once have been a communal area in the apartment block that sat just outside town prek was a meticulous man hed read up about krasnoyarsk forty miles or so down the yenisei river was the town of zheleznogorsk better known by its old soviet name krasnoyarsk this was a closed city home to factories handling godknowswhat exotic and dangerous materials to make godknowswhich agents of destruction weaponsgrade plutonium had been produced in three nuclear reactors there the last of which had just recently closed for years the soviets simply dumped the radioactive waste from the nuclear plants straight into the river until they thought better of it and drilled hundreds of wells to pump the deadly sludge underground prek knew there was as much radioactivity as a hundred chernobyls humming away in the caverns around here another reason hed be happy to get out of this place quietly two men walked in wiry and ruggedlooking they wore identical black overcoats genti looked up artur nikolai one of them stepped forward until he was ten feet from prek im artur he said and gestured back to his companion thats nikolai prek looked back and across to genti who nodded these were the names he had been given artur zakoyev and nikolai dudaev this is a lot of money youre asking for prek said in russian this stuff isnt easy to get said artur if its easy to get why do you need us what do you want this for anyway you making a big boom somewhere artur grinned he was referring to the fact that the substance could be used to make triggers for nuclear weapons prek winced hed seen better teeth on a mule what we do with it is our business said prek how do we even know its genuine it needs to be good not some old shit you had lying around in a warehouse you have to trust us thats why you pay us you have the money prek looked down at the bag and kicked it toward artur prek glanced at nikolai standing behind his boss and to his right thats the second time hes looked at his watch prek said to himself artur stepped forward and went down on his haunches his hands in front of him everyone knew the drill they kept their hands down and in plain sight by their sides artur unzipped the bag and pulled out a brick of hundredeuro notes and flicked through it with his thumb prek saw nikolai glance at his watch again hes waiting for someone thought prek he looked at genti who was watching artur counting money hes waiting for someone and theyre late now you have to trust me said prek he was in a hurry the moneys all there so ill take the merchandise artur stood up and held up his hands okay okay his right arm still aloft as if he were taking an oath artur reached into his right coat pocket with his left hand and pulled out a small object prek rocked forward and back on his heelshed had no time to react but he knew genti could shoot both chechens in the head in a second this wasnt a gunit was a small aluminum vial about three inches long and an inch around prek moved forward took the vial and put it in his pants pocket nikolai said something prek didnt understand and without another word the chechens turned and were gone artur clutching the bag with the money come on prek said in albanian when he reached the doorway he turned left the opposite direction to the way theyd come in and where the chechens were now headed the cars back there genti said but prek was running now heading to a stairway on the far side of the building they could hear loud voices echoing up from the other stairway and the sound of hobnail boots on cement this was who the chechens were expecting and it wasnt the chamber of commerce coming to thank the albanians for their business fortunately russian timekeeping hadnt gotten any better since the fall of communism guns drawn prek and genti raced down the stairs prek saw parked police cars and black vans ahead doors hanging open he turned and ran around the back of the building genti following close behind the chechens were in front of them running toward a solitary car parked in the corner of a walledin courtyard fucking amateurs prek saw the opportunity the chechens jumped in the car artur throwing it into reverse and backing up and around so the car faced forward before artur could get it into drive prek and genti were on the car firing into the windshield three times each artur was hit and thrown back into his seat his foot pushing onto the accelerator so the engine raced in neutral prek and genti pulled open the doors and dragged the chechens out artur was dead his head blown open nikolai had been shot twice in the neck blood bubbling out of his airway as his life ebbed away prek slammed the car into drive and took off looking for another road out of the complex preks heart was threatening to break out of his rib cage and he cursed loudly he was sitting on glass and he had to lean forward so his head didnt come into contact with whatever of arturs gray matter was splattered on the headrest behind him what happened he yelled they sold us out said genti there he pointed ahead to a track off the service road leading away from the apartment complex he knew they wouldnt last five minutes on a highway in a car with no windshield before being spotted hey genti said as prek slowed down on the unpaved road prek looked over and genti turned his head to look in the backseat though streaked with blood the puma bag sat perfectly safe prek banged on the steering wheel and turned to genti and both men laughed long and hard part i columbia university medical center new york city february am the girl twelve awakens with a start shes lying on a thin mattress on a low narrow bed and circling around her is a pack of girls theyre oldersixteen seventeenand as they shuffle along theyre staring down at her with obviously sinister intentions some are suppressing giggles others are smiling but these smiles arent signs of happiness theyre smiles of anticipation its still nighttime there are other cots in the long room and the girl knows the other occupants are awake but they wont move to help her because they know whats about to happen transfixed with terror the girl is unable to react as the mob falls upon her as shes being dragged off the bed she sees her chief tormentor the ringleaders face twisted in a manic grimace still she knows better than to scream for help somewhere in the dormitory theres suddenly a loud banging sound and again pia grazdani twentysix woke up in a panic and a cold sweat unsure for a second of where she was she breathed out with relief when she realized she was safe and in her dorm room at columbia university medical center someone was banging on the door taking another deep breath pia leaped out of bed in her flannel pajamas took three quick strides to the door flipped the dead bolt and pulled it open as she expected it was george her fellow fourthyear medical student pia do you know what time it is this isnt a day you want to be late his tone was not as strident as the syntax suggested at sixone george wilson had seven inches on pia but somehow he always felt smaller when he was in her presence as he explained it to himself she had what he called a tough plucky personality and could at times be rather volatile pia held the door open and george took a couple of steps into the small dorm room pia let the door close and turned and hurried past george pulling her pajama top over her head as she did so george looked at pias bare back at the cut of her shoulder blades framing her flawless olivebrown skin she stood in front of her low dresser and pulled out some clothes for the day as she did so she caught georges stare in the mirror sorry george i couldnt sleep and then when i could sleep i was dreaming you go ahead ill catch up with you later today with that said afrodita pia grazdani turned her full attention to getting ready when she pulled down her pajama pants george turned his head and looked out the window he would have preferred to watch her but was afraid to do so instead he concentrated on the dramatic view that he and the other medical students had learned to take for granted he could see the giant george washington bridge connecting manhattan with new jersey its usual morning rushhour traffic was at a standstill in both directions its okay pia said george ill wait then searching for something to say he added i guess you still havent figured out how to use that alarm clock i bought for you i cant get you up every dayyouve got to do something about being on time you could always use the alarm on your cell phone if youd prefer george stopped talking hed turned his attention back to the room and was immediately transfixed by the sight of pia brushing her jetblack hair he felt an immediate crushing sadness the few times pia and george had slept together four exactly pia had asked george to leave before he fell asleep and each time shed stood at that same dresser with her back to him brushing her hair just as she was doing now over the course of time george had become painfully aware they hadnt truly slept together at all those four precious times theyd just had sex wham bam thank you maam in reverse george was athletically inclined and goodlooking in a preppy stereotypical fashion with an unruly shock of blond hair and a ready smile during his ivy league college days it had drifted back to him that many preppy women found him to be a hunk there had never been a shortage of willing girlfriends but george had set his sights early in life on becoming a doctor and did not want to become involved as a consequence georges romantic life had been a string of onenight stands and short flings with little emotional commitment hed hurt people he knew especially now that the tables had been turned and he was the hurtee rather than the hurter with pia it was completely different she truly didnt seem to care and it drove him crazy numerous times he had told himself to forget her that she was damaged goods but he couldnt instead hed become obsessed to an extent george desperately wanted to have a romantic relationship with this woman but he had no idea what she wanted and why it hadnt happened hed been trying during three and a half years of medical school come on what are you waiting for pia barked when she popped out of her tiny bathroom still applying a pale lipstick that was more for lip protection than color she grabbed her medical student white coat pulled it on and draped her medical center id around her neck she held open the door behind her as if she were the one waiting emotionally flummoxed as per usual george awakened from what could have been considered a petit mal seizure and followed her out through the door he had to practically run to catch up to her as she hurried down the hall toward the elevators pia continued to walk quickly as they made their way out of the dorm and turned right toward the medical center complex columbia university medical center lies in washington heights on broadway as it runs north along upper manhattans spine even at this time of the morning the place was busy the more purposeful people in the varyinglength white coats making their way along th street were the doctors students and staff of the hospitals and research facilities the patients and their relatives who were arriving were more hesitant trying to figure out where they needed to be and clearly apprehensive of why they were there and what the day might bring george turned up the collar of his jacket against the sharp wind that came off the hudson river and was funneled into th street by the curve of haven avenue tomorrow it would be march the month in which any day the temperature might be in the sixties or it could snow at that moment it wasnt particularly cold but the wind was a reminder that winter still had some kick george and pia were heading for different buildings to start their fourthyear month of elective fourth year of medical school was a series of monthlong rotations in various specialties which included an elective period where the individual students could choose something of their particular interest that month pia was to do research as shed done during her month of elective in her third year george was to work in radiology as he too had done the previous year these choices were particularly apropos since three weeks earlier george pia and the rest of the class of had learned the results of the residency matching program both pia and george had been awarded positions there at columbia university medical center thanks to their superb academic records and strong faculty recommendations pia in internal medicine and george in radiology by special dispensation pia would also be starting a concurrent phd program in molecular genetics which would allow her to continue her lab work while fulfilling her requirements as a medical resident awaiting pia that morning at the william black medical research building was the noted molecular geneticist dr tobias rothman winner of both a nobel prize and a lasker award in addition to being known for his accomplishments dr rothman was even better known around the medical center for being a difficult person to work with thanks to his renowned total lack of social graces rothman did not suffer fools in fact rothman did not suffer anyone except his longterm research assistant dr junichi yamamoto originally rothmans reputation had made george nervous for pia when she started her thirdyear elective in the mans lab but his concern had been tempered by his personal knowledge that she herself was a handful from direct experience he knew that she could be counted on to hold her own in most any situation as it had turned out to everyones surprise even pias she had gotten along famously with the famed and feared researcher in fact it had been rothmans suggestion that pia do a phd program at columbia with her practical work taking place in his lab until pia had come along rothman had never mentored anyone for a while it had been a major point of gossip in the entire medical center as people wildly hypothesized what on earth was going on between the exotically attractive medical student and the universally disliked but respected curmudgeon who was the centers major research celebrity pia wait up george called out in her typically selfabsorbed fashion pia had gotten ahead of george in the crowd dodging the phalanxes of medical students in their white coats who were all converging on the black building george scuttled ahead to catch pia just before she entered the building he pulled her aside pia looked up at george with her big brown eyes wide open as if surprised to see george whom she was supposed to be walking with do you want to have lunch its the first day so they might go easy on us i know for me its probably going to get crazy after today i dont know george rothmans rothmans you know rothmans an asocial asshole thats what i know lets not argue i know what you and just about everyone else thinks but the mans been good to me i dont know what he has in mind for me today or for the month for that matter what i do know is that i cant make plans to meet for lunch before i find out what the day is going to bring i can tell you what most people think he has in mind for you oh please pia snapped lets not get into that again ive told you time and again the mans never made one advance or offcolor comment in my presence what he is is a genius who believes hes surrounded by morons and he might be right at least comparatively all hes interested in is his work and im interested in it too im well aware of his asocial reputation but im lucky that he tolerates me i cant wait to get in there if i have a moment as the day progresses ill call your cell for a brief second george saw red all at once his brain was flooded with unreasonable jealousy of the prick rothman everybody hated the guy and here was the woman he was romantically obsessed with essentially telling him to bug off and that she couldnt wait to rendezvous with the aged sourball instead of planning to get together for what might be the last lunch of the month george sucked in a lungful of air while he regarded pias obviously scornful look in a flash he wondered anew what the hell he was doing continuing to pursue this woman when she seemed to be merely tolerating his company instinctively george knew he shouldnt put so much importance on whether or not she would make plans to meet for lunch but he couldnt help it it was just another episode in a long list of episodes the last time they had made love which was the way george wanted to think about the hookup as she called it george had tried to be open about how her dismissing him made him feel her response then as it was now about lunch was to get irritated of course after he left her room instead of feeling good about making his feelings known hed worried himself sick that hed scared her off for good but he hadnt instead a couple of days later george had received a surprising note from pia in his mailbox maybe you should call sheila brown it included a cell phone number george called sheila brown and had one of the oddest phone conversations of his life he was to learn more about pias past in that one conversation than she had ever shared with him hi my name is george wilson pia grazdani asked me to call you hello george pia told me you would be calling i was pias caseworker and her therapist for some time pia told me it was okay to talk to you oh er okay caseworker whatever george had been expecting it wasnt this i know its extremely unusual for a therapist to talk to a stranger about one of her patients but pia asked me to speak with you therapist this was going to be interesting normally i wouldnt be speaking to you as i am since its against any number of rules of my profession but pia persuaded me to do so if i can help pia emerge from what she faced in her upbringing im willing to do most anything within reason i worked with pia for years since she grew up in foster care including a stint in what used to be called a reform school as a result let us say that shes always found it very hard to form any meaningful relationships trust is an issue she didnt tell me much about you but i find the fact that she asked me to talk with you very encouraging i think she wants you to know something about her but she cant tell you herself so she asked the person who she believes knows her best to do it pia has different ideas about privacy and attachment than most people that george knew from painful experience without going into specific details sheila encouraged george to keep trying with pia because it was her opinion he would be good for her sheila concluded by giving him her office number to have in addition to her cell phone number in case he ever wanted to call back george never did and despite sheilas disclaimers he questioned the professionalism of the conversation at the same time he appreciated the information he never brought up the issue directly with pia by saying that he knew shed been through foster care but rather tried to get her to open up about her childhood in general unfortunately she always responded that it was something she did not want to discuss it was a nogo zone that was okay with george he set it aside and didnt think about it he was giving her as much time as she needed george let out the lungful of air with pursed lips the slight delay gave him a chance to collect himself and not blurt out something hed regret later he even tried to mask the fact that he was upset well i hope your day goes as well as can be expected he said finally i know you can handle yourself pia but i still dont know how you can stand to work with him i dont need to get along with him george its not kindergarten if he tolerates me and i learn from him and he can help my career thats all i ask were grownupswe dont have to be friends shed used that line before and george had to wonder was she talking about rothman or about him georges worry that pia was going to abandon him resurfaced okay george said simply while holding up his hands in mock surrender sorry to even mention it stop apologizing pia said sharply looking at her watch you sound nerdy when you apologize now i really am going to be late pia hurried away george asked himself what time pia might have gotten up had he not gone to her room to wake her he couldnt help but notice that shed not bothered to thank him much less make a commitment to have lunch unfortunately it all was irritatingly pro forma pia showed her id to the security guard with all the other students who were mostly first and secondyear heading off to their eight oclock lecture instead of following them she took the elevator to the fourteenth floor of the black research building and headed for rothmans sizable laboratory he commanded the most space of any researcher in the entire center as soon as she went through the anonymouslooking metal door and entered the suite she could sense that the labs day was already in full swing the three research technicians panjit singh nina brockhurst and mariana herrera were loitering around the labs communal coffeepot having already calibrated all the instrumentation that needed to be done on a daily basis rothman fastidious about what he ate and drank kept a nespresso machine in his office that only he and dr junichi yamamoto his senior associate were allowed to use morning miss grazdani said marsha langman rothmans secretary from behind her desk one overdefined eyebrow was raised as she looked at the clock on the wall opposite you dont want to make this a habit pia followed the womans line of vision and glanced at the clock the second hand had just ticked past vertical it was pia stopped and half turned toward rothmans ultraloyal retainercumsecretary for the inevitable reprimand you know he likes everyone to be early marsha said in an accusatory tone im not late said pia students were supposed to begin lectures and other activities at eight unless they had been on call the night before for specific rotations that required it ah but you arent early either lets not start the month off on the wrong foot and i should warn you youll be having some company in your office theres a man from maintenance in there trying to find a problem in the wiring the security system is down how longs that going to take marsha a middleaged africanamerican woman in a lab coat her position didnt call for made a face that said how would i know pia was exasperated there was barely room for her in what was generously described as an office is the chief going to have time for me this morning pia was one of the handful of people who didnt reflexively kowtow to rothman and wait for him to come to them as pia asked the question she turned to fully face marsha the research technicians were quiet pia wondered if theyd timed their coffee run for her predictably notquiteearly arrival and were eavesdropping for any possible gossip you know how pressed for time he always is marsha said hes being pressured to finish his most current salmonella typhi experiment with dr yamamoto we have to email the manuscript to the lancet in the next day or so marsha always talked as if she were actively involved in the research it was part of her strategy of erecting barriers and building sand traps for those wanting time with rothman she watched over him like a killer guard dog hes been in since sixin being the biosafety level lab frequently referred to as bsl where the work on the salmonella strains was being done ill see if i can get word to him that you want to speak to him thank you pia said her eyes betraying irritation getting word to rothman meant flipping a switch and talking to him by intercom hating to waste time and having finished the last project he had assigned to her pia needed to see rothman to find out what she was going to be doing that month and now there was some workman in her office to complicate things pia was fortunate to have an office at all few of the other people in the lab had such a privilege when rothmans chief technician was fired after getting into an argument with rothman over some picayune detail of lab procedure his successor arthur spaulding took an office nearer the biosafety level area and pia took over spauldings broom closet pia saw that her office door was ajar and she bristled there were sensitive files in there even if only a handful of people on the planet would understand what they meant as she entered she saw that her bench area that also served as her desk was occupiedan electrical blueprint was laid out on the flat surface and there were tools and wires strewn on top in the corner of the tiny windowless room was a stepladder with a human form standing on the top platform head and shoulders hidden up inside the dropped ceiling three panels had been taken down and stacked against the wall excuse me pia called out when there was no response she called louder hey you up there pias sharp words caused the man to flinch and hit his head on a pipe up in the ceiling the man let out an indistinct curse and slowly emerged from the ceiling after taking one look at pia he climbed down from the stepladder he was about fortyfive with grayish stubble and saltandpepper hair wearing dark blue coveralls his forehead was deeply lined and he had the sunken cheeks and pale complexion of a lifelong smoker his body was thin but muscular his security tag read vance goslin how long are you going to be pia demanded she had her arms akimbo goslin was struck immediately by pias remarkable and exotic beauty her glowing flawless skin her full lips and perhaps most of all her huge dark eyes adding to her allure was her apparent confidence and forthrightness in goslins world girls who looked like pia acted significantly differently he was more than casually attracted to her he was intrigued depends when i find the problem he said he pointed to two areas on the blueprints lying on the bench he had a distinct accent that pia thought she recognized especially given the name goslin if the problem is here its easy to fix if the problem is there its harder but one way or the other well get it done it might even be done by tonight goslin nodded as he finished talking eagerly continuing to scan pias shapely body as hed done while hed been talking he did it overtly as if it were a matter of right eventually his gaze alighted on pias hospital id grazdani he voiced raising his eyebrows questioningly now thats an unusual name pia didnt respond making him think she might be hard of hearing your name is unusual is it italian he said raising his voice he had assumed a wry smile as if he knew grazdani was not italian it was his way of flirting no it isnt italian and why are you shouting pia had talked about her albanian heritage maybe twice in her life and she wasnt about to do it now with this person there were thousands of albanians in new york city and pia remembered enough of the language to recognize an albanian accent when she heard it once when she was ordering a slice of pizza two young men behind the counter started a frank appraisal of her physical attributes in their language before pia asked them in english if they wanted her to talk to the manager about their rudeness actually id guess albanian goslin said the smile continuing im of albanian descent and i have a lot of albanian friends here in new york they work in maintenance like me weve kinda taken over the business pia wasnt listening it was barely an hour since shed been dreaming about one childhood nightmare and now this man was reminding her of anotherher fatherwhich added to her growing irritation even though she was offering nothing to this maintenance worker that he could take as encouragement he was still talking trying to engage her in conversation so where are you from he asked his eyes narrowed and head tilted as if he were about to make a guess such a situation was not uncommon for pia many people particularly men tried to guess her genealogy from her appearance usually coming up with such suggestions as greek lebanese or even iranian but she wasnt going to play the game with this guy even though hed been correct about her name her father was indeed albanian although her mother was italian im american pia said hurry up with what youre doing im going to need my office sooner rather than later and what do you do goslin asked vainly trying to keep the conversation going pia didnt answer she walked out of the room pausing only to pick out a couple of files she thought she might need to the surprise of the lab technicians who had moved from the coffee nook to their respective individual benches rothman suddenly emerged from the biosafety unit this was a surprise because everyone expected that he would be closeted in there for the day as had been the case for the last several weeks as a stickler for rules he had gone through the airlock and removed his protective lab garb and donned his street clothes without a lab coat on he resembled a gentleman banker more than a research scientist coming from working with extraordinarily deadly typhoidcausing salmonella although asocial to a fault he was a careful dresser a disconnect as it suggested he cared what other people thought but he didnt the clothes were purely for him and the ensemble was the same day after day conservative threebutton italian suit pressed white shirt dark blue tie with matching pocket square and black penny loafers he was not a tall man but he projected well and appeared taller than he was moving quickly he was an intimidating figure with martially erect posture and an expression that did not encourage conversation his dark brown hair was cut conservatively to match his suit his almost invisible rimless titanium glasses were his only concession to current fashion as rothman strode toward his private office the eyes of the technicians followed him it was immediately apparent to all of them what had brought rothman out of the biosafety unit catching sight of pia he had motioned for her to follow him as the office door closed the lab technicians exchanged knowing looks with a tinge of collective jealousy all of them knew that with the pressure of the upcoming lancet article rothman would never have left the biosafety unit specifically to talk to them in their minds pia was a kind of teachers pet made worse by her not being all that friendly similar to rothman she was always too busy for small talk and kept to herself on top of that they all thought she was a bit too goodlooking to be a medical student and thought captiously she would have been better suited to playing one on tv pia was an enigma to the laboratory staff made more interesting by the gossip that had it she was going to be a nun if the lab technicians had had the opportunity to view the scene inside rothmans office they might not have felt any jealousy whatsoever it appeared more like rothman and pia were engaged in an arcane ritual rather than having an actual conversation neither looked at the other throughout the entire brief encounter after rothman told her he wanted her to edit the current salmonella study for the lancet that day he picked up one of two copies of the paper from his desk which he was now studying intently pia appeared equally distracted her arms crossed looking at her feet the uninitiated might sense a social ineptness on both sides as the awkward silence extended a clinical psychologist given enough time might talk more in diagnostically precise language finally rothman half standing leaned over his desk and handed a copy of the lancet paper to pia make sure this is up to snuff ill want it by morning tomorrow well talk again about what you will be doing for the month he still did not look at her let me say that i know you have always been more interested in my stem cell work than my salmonella work and im fine with that youve earned it considering you finally know something practical about genetics rather than the garbage they taught you in class and one other thing two fourthyear students have been foisted on me for a month of elective by the damn dean so i want you to give some thought to what they can do while theyre here its not going to be easy im sure theyll be worthless where are they and how can i meet them they are supposed to start tomorrow dr yamamoto will introduce you the main thing is that i dont want them tying up a lot of junichis time as he seems to enjoy that kind of crap i need him to concentrate on our work i cant do anything with that maintenance man in my office my understanding is that hell be done sometime today so tomorrow then rothman was never much interested in the details of running his massive lab suddenly he was again absorbed in the lancet manuscript ignoring rothmans dismissal pia said there is something i want to tell you the residency matching results came in im going to be here at columbia doing a combined program getting a phd in cellular biology with you as you so generously offered and completing a residency in internal medicine i hope youre pleased well im not rothman said with emotion his infamous ire rising im disappointed if i told you once i told you a dozen times that for you doing an internal medicine residency would be a complete waste of time just like it was for me i think it is totally apparent that you like me are cut out for research not clinical medicine you should be here in the lab fulltime i said as much in my letter of recommendation for the phd program a level of tension hung in the air for a few beats neither spoke nor did they so much as exchange a glance but i have the sisters to think of pia said pias education had been partly underwritten by the missionary sisters of the sacred heart an international religious order situated in westchester county pia had fled to the order for emotional safety after aging out of foster care at age eighteen although initially pia had thought briefly of joining the order as a nun after finishing her high school equivalency and a portion of college at new york university she had changed her mind consequently the relationship with the sisters particularly the mother superior had become more transactional although pia would complete her medical training and still go to africa to help with the organizations missionary work she would not become a novitiate although pia had received full scholarships from new york university and columbia medical school the sisters contribution had been considerable she felt justifiably obligated i dont think i can renege on a plan i made ten years ago although ive come to agree with you that my personality is more suited to research i think i have to go through with the original plan to become a doctor and at least for a time serve the orders needs a rush of mumbled profanity escaped from rothmans lips he shook his head in disbelief here i am offering you a part in making medical history with my stem cell research and i have to be concerned about a bunch of nuns in westchester he paused for a moment to collect his thoughts what kind of money are we talking about i dont know what you mean come on dont be obtuse what do you think you owe them in dollars im not sure i can think of it in those terms lets not be difficult give me a figure however you want to create it pia thought for a moment it was not an easy task shed never put a figure on how the sisters had nurtured her and given her a sense of protection from the evils of her foster care experience she shrugged i dont know maybe fifty thousand something like that done rothman said youll get a loan from my bank to the tune of fifty thousand and ill cosign for it pia found herself momentarily speechless never in her life had someone stood up for her financially especially to the tune of fifty thousand dollars she didnt know how to react i dont know what to say she mumbled then dont say anything well revisit this issue but for today i want you to jump on this paper for lancet it needs another set of eyes and the statistics checked i know you are a whiz with statistics rothman got up from behind his desk with his attention buried in the piece of paper hed been intermittently studying he walked out of his office pia was stunned rothman had just essentially lent her a large sum of money and asked for her help on a vitally important paper okay pia said to herself ive got work to do now i just have to get that man out of my work space following rothman out through the door she headed back to the lab bench where she had set up her temporary work space convent of the sisters of the sacred heart westchester new york february pm armed with dr rothmans pledge of financial support pia made an appointment with the mother superior of the convent of the sisters of the sacred heart for that same evening it wasnt a meeting she looked forward to pia recalled how years before the mother superior had found her as a teenager sitting on the convent wall after getting into a fight with her foster family at the time who lived a couple of miles away she had brought pia inside and they had talked the result was that pia returned the very next weekend with her familys permission to help out in an unstructured fashion the rest was history culminating in pias decision when she aged out of foster care to join the convent with the idea of possibly becoming a novitiate pia would be forever grateful for what the mother superior had done for her in the years following her moving in especially as it was an enormous improvement on what she had experienced in the foster care system although it was in reality another institution pia had finally been at peace she had found the mother superior to be sympathetic not only in helping her adjust to the convents community living but also in helping her navigate the tempestuous waters in the real world beyond the tranquillity of the convent it had been at the mother superiors insistence that pia turned to academia and became a superior student rather than an adequate one but obtaining her high school equivalency and attending college had allowed pia to learn about herself to the extent of realizing that a nuns life was not for her instead she decided on a career in medicine where she sensed she could excel and find equivalent peace after all during her entire tumultuous foster care experience she had always viewed the doctor as the sine qua non of power and control of ones personal destiny but the decision had had consequences especially with regard to the mother superior about five years earlier pia had made a similar appointment with the woman it was then that pia admitted that she was not going to become a sister but rather a doctor it had been a difficult meeting as the mother superior had been obviously disappointed and made her feelings known at the same time she had been encouraging about pias new career track and voiced how desperately doctors were needed at their missionary locations in east africa now as pia walked into the mother superiors stark office she knew she faced as difficult a situation asand maybe even worse thanwhen she had decided against becoming a nun the more she thought about her goals the more she thought rothman was right about her being uniquely qualified for medical research pia my dear its a blessing to see you we have all missed you all the sisters ask about you day after day and you reverend mother pia kept her eyes glued to her hands as they worked at each other in her lap her anxiety had peaked she hoped it was not reflected in her voice she had dressed simply in a black dress that broke at the knees and plain pumps at first glance the mother superior had looked the same as when she first met her ten years before the uniform of the order helped with that but pia could tell that age was taking its toll the mother superior had moved slowly when she walked around her desk to greet pia from pias perspective her hand had felt bonier and more delicate when she placed it on pias shoulder than on pias previous visit a month or so previously on the short train ride out of manhattan pia had rehearsed what she was going to say she wanted to be clear so there would be no misunderstanding she was confident in her decision more confident then than shed been in rothmans office but she knew the mother superior had a talent for ignoring what someone was saying as she worked the conversation back to a position more in tune with her interests and opinions as the pleasantries continued pias mind rapidly played over the extraordinary changes her life had taken since she arrived at the convent in what at that moment seemed like a previous life she was now in her fourth year at columbia medical school as amazing as that sounded even to her she recalled how difficult it had been to convince columbia to accept her she remembered how shed had to explain why at age eighteen shed decided to join a catholic african missionary order her experience at new york university had been a breeze from the getgo the college admissions people were convinced no questions asked that pia as a young woman emancipated from foster care would make a valuable addition to the rich tapestry of nyu undergraduate life columbia on the other hand had expressed early concern about pias history and its potential effects on her independence and ability to empathize with patients they didnt voice their concerns in such a clear fashion but pia had gotten the message especially when she was asked to undergo an interview by one of the medical centers psychiatrists recognizing that she wouldnt have been asked to do the interview if they werent interested in her pia had acquiesced to her surprise the interview turned out to be more pleasant than she had feared the psychiatrist had been well versed in the inequities of the new york foster care system and seemed sympathetic when he learned that she had been under its questionable aegis from age six to eighteen unfortunately she had never experienced an adoption or even a final placement although the psychiatrist did not have access to her records by law pia was rather open with him and explained her experiences although she downplayed some of the grittier elements she fully admitted that in retrospect she knew that she had been abused and that she had had to grow up without a nurturing presence in her life but she added that rather than hindering her she believed her experiences would make her a better doctor she also downplayed any symptoms shed experienced such as her mild brush with an eating disorder as a teenager and the recurrent nightmares she still experienced as the interview had progressed pias openness apparently won the day as the psychiatrist was equally open with her he actually told her that he was impressed with how she had been able to cope and that he agreed with her that her experiences might make her a better doctor especially if she became interested in a specialty like pediatrics he told her that he was particularly impressed by her near perfect grade point average at nyu her near perfect mcat scores and the fact that she had won acclaim as an actress with the nyu theater group he said it was all indicative of her commitment to her goal of becoming a doctor and to the adjustment she had achieved to everyday life despite her history he also told her that he would be strongly recommending her for admittance to the class of after the psychiatric interview pia had been ecstatically hopeful that she would be accepted but months later she found out that it had not been enough to convince the admissions committee there had been a number of people whod apparently demurred thinking it was too big a risk despite the psychiatrists recommendation it took an unexpected lastditch intervention by two people to carry the day first the mother superior offered to become involved and sent a flurry of carefully worded beautifully argued and persuasive emails and the second person was dr rothman who at the time was sitting on the admissions committee for an obligatory threeyear term pia found out about this surprising twist of events only years later after working with rothman during her thirdyear elective hed brought it up suddenly at one of their typically uncomfortable meetings he admitted to her something that he said no one else knew that he too had suffered through the new york state foster care system because he had been a difficult hyperactive child he said a diagnosis was not made until he was an adult when he himself recognized he had aspergers syndrome pia had been stunned and was still stunned respecting his confidence she had told no one about the revelation the last time you made a formal appointment to see me the mother superior continued you had sad news for us here at the convent saying you had decided against joining us by becoming a novitiate my intuition tells me that you are here today for similar reasons i hope that is not the case we love you here at the convent and are very proud of you and your accomplishments pia looked up briefly to engage the mother superiors unblinking stare but she couldnt maintain it almost immediately she looked away finding herself staring at the crucifix on the wall over the womans shoulder thinking of pain sacrifice and betrayal pia took a fortifying breath as usual the mother superior was miles ahead of her seemingly sensing what was coming im starting another month of research in dr rothmans laboratory he is a gifted man the lord has looked kindly on him he is going to make history by personally ushering in regenerative medicine his work with stem cells will be seminal i want to be part of it from my perspective you already are from what you have shared he has taken to you not that i am surprised how can i help pia looked back down at her hands she felt a tinge of guilt after all that the mother superior had done for her and here she was immediately offering to do more i believe i will want to do medical research fulltime meaning i dont think i want to go to africa there its out pia thought she felt immediate relief for a few moments silence reigned in the room pia suddenly realized how cold it was i know this is a rather large change since i offered to go to africa to repay you and the order for all the help youve given me over the years since i aged out of foster care your going to africa was to be for you not us the mother superior said pia please dont be rash i know im going to sound very oldfashioned but is there a man involved there must beit is your burden to be so beautiful i hope to god that dr rothman is being honorable pia suppressed a smile the mother superiors suggestion was so far from reality as to warrant such a reaction she and rothman had trouble making eye contact much less something more intimate i can assure you that dr rothman has been quintessentially honorable god has limitless ways to test us the mother superior continued reverend mother i dont believe god is testing me this does not involve a man i assure you i have made my decision because it pleases me and because god has given me a facility for the work but i would like to repay the convent thanks to dr rothmans generosity i have access to fifty thousand dollars i would like to donate this money to the convent i will be willing to accept any donation but not as repayment for our services you do not owe us anything after all your presence was payment enough it would please me to donate the money pia said as you will but i do have another request i dont want you to forget us i trust that you will still make it a point to visit us on occasion if you forget us that will be a betrayal pia who had been looking past the mother superior at the crucifix was stopped short suddenly her suit of armor was dented and she looked down at her shoes feeling young and small betray betrayal when she first encountered the word betray in a novel when she was eleven she looked it up in the schools big dictionary the definition seemed just right thats what her family had done it had betrayed her betrayal was the tragedy that had stalked pia ever since she was six on the day when the police burst through the front door of the apartment she shared with her father and uncle and placed her in the clutches of the new york city foster care program columbia university medical center new york city march am she knows the mans important but she cant remember his name the girl is standing in front of a long desk wearing a plain very loosefitting institutional gray shift with her shoulders slumped forward and her hands clasped in front of her elbows tucked into her sides even sitting down the man is very large enormous in fact and hes leaning forward talking to her not looking her in the eye but right at her chest she cant make out what hes saying shes been bad shes misbehaved shes going to need to be punished thats all she knows she can hear him now hes even bigger than he was before telling her to stand up straight to pull her shoulders back why is she wearing that shapeless garment pia remembers that shes fifteen or at most sixteen and this is the head of her school and its as if shes at the back of the room watching this girl who is her but not her he pushes his chair back and stands up coming around the desk he approaches her with a cruel lustful smile pia he orders pia pia pia pia sat up in bed and breathed a deep sigh of relief her tshirt was sticking to the sweat on her back as she stretched forward listening to george calling to her from the other side of the door she let him in and hurried to get dressed vowing that shed remember to set the alarm that night her internal clock used to wake her up at six without fail but the last couple of weeks shed had trouble sleeping suffering from a number of recurrent nightmares she felt exhausted shed not had nearly enough sleep after visiting with the mother superior shed gone back to rothmans lab by the time shed gotten back to her dorm room and crawled into bed it had been in the morning as she dressed she found herself mulling over the meeting with the mother superior and she shared some of it with george on the way to the medical center im glad you went george said as they walked in the crisp morning sunshine i mean you were never going to join the order and i cant see you in africa doing whatever missionaries do nowadays ive never known any nuns but i cant imagine youre the nun type from one of their four lovemaking events an erotic image of a satiated pia naked in bed flashed through his mind he noticed pia shoot him a look and he cringed could she read his mind it wasnt the first time george had this worry i dont think becoming a nun and taking the vows would have been a problem for me george im not even saying ill never do it ive seen how life is at the convent and its very peaceful its different from the world out here the sisters support each other its safe george immediately felt uncomfortable like he was patronizing pia he couldnt blame her for wanting some security in her life with the little he knew of her childhood but becoming a nun it seemed extreme i guess what i mean is that it seems like a way of avoiding life there are other ways of being safe besides going and hiding out in a convent i dont think of becoming a nun as hiding its the oppositethey have to give all of themselves to the world they have chosen they dont betray each other either thought pia to herself they had reached the black research building actually i think youd be equivalently hiding if you end up spending your whole career working in there with rothman george said indicating the building with a tilt of his head his concept of medicine involved helping people directly oneonone having an effect on the lives of people he could see and touch as far as he was concerned research was too cold and abstract and populated with asocial martinets like rothman who were as welcoming and warm as a file full of algorithms so what about lunch today george said changing the subject and ever hopeful as he had feared they hadnt met up for lunch the day before in the threeplus years that george had known pia theyd never had an official lunch date they had lunched together numerous times but not as a planned event during the first two years they had managed to have pretty much the same schedule so it just happened but now that george was on a radiology elective and pia was holed up in rothmans lab he knew that the chances theyd run into each other by accident were slim but why he was bothering to ask her he had no idea since he knew it wasnt going to happen and why was he always so damned accommodating sorry george i cant make plans she said yesterday i had to spend the entire day and come back at night to work on one of rothmans journal articles and it still isnt done on top of that ill be meeting with him sometime to find out what he has in store for me for the entire month i seriously doubt ill even be getting lunch pia was unhappy to see that the pesky maintenance man was still in her office he was up the stepladder again only facing a different direction this time the day before as she had worked on rothmans paper on one of the benches out in the lab proper shed noticed that hed left at twelve and didnt come back for four hours at that rate she worried about him being there pestering her and keeping her from her cubbyhole for a week her office was small but it was hers and she could leave her stuff spread out on the countertops something she couldnt do in the main lab pia made enough noise dropping her bag on her toollittered desk to ensure vance knew she was there and not particularly happy hey you up there she called out vance pulled his head down into the room and seeing pia climbed down smiling rubbing his hands on a rag ah miss grazdani how are you today i missed you yesterday when i left i noticed you took a fourhour lunch you should have told me youd be away so long i could have been working here in my office anyway yesterday you thought youd be finished whats up how long is this going to take the job is turning out to be more difficult than i had thought all i can really say is that im trying my best as soon as i figure out what the hell is wrong ill knock it right out and be outa here pia merely sighed irritably and lifted her bag miss pia ive got a surprise for you i made an extra sandwich today for lunch one for me and one for you how about joining me for a bite i make a wicked pastrami sandwich on a ciabatta roll what do you say he was smiling again jesus men were so predictable pia glowered was this guy suffering from delusions she wasnt staying to find out nor did she want to encourage the man just hurry the hell up with the job please she snapped as far as the sandwich offer was concerned she didnt even want to acknowledge it pia turned and stepped back into the main lab she put her bag on the bench area where shed worked the previous day but instead of jumping right in she walked back to marshas desk to find out where their leader was that morning to her surprise she learned that rothman was in his office and waiting for her pleased pia hurried in through the open door immediately she noticed he was dealing with the same maintenance inconvenience overhead a number of ceiling tiles were missing and spaghettilike wires dangled from the holes an assortment of tools dotted one of the countertops and a few were scattered on the floor in the corner was a stepladder leaning against the wall and the security camera was missing from its mounting good morning dr rothman pia chirped she never knew what to expect moodwise but hoped for the best marsha said you were expecting me miss grazdani how do you spell catheter rothman demanded not even bothering to look up from the sheet of paper he was holding she could tell it was part of the lancet manuscript shed worked on catheter why well it seems you know how to spell it so im wondering why you felt the need to make up an alternative version for my paper pia had worked on rothmans article making several suggestions for changes in structure and rewriting one whole section she found particularly opaque late last night she had been in a hurry to finish and she hadnt run a spell check one wonders what they taught you at nyu if anything there were several spelling errors and two grammatical ones from experience pia knew how rothman worked these jabs at her spelling and grammar almost certainly meant that he had accepted her structural changes if you lived for compliments and praise youd starve to death working for rothman rothman took good work for granted if you werent good you didnt last long so the only elements worth talking about were the minor faults rothman twisted in his seat to face his mac and started pecking his way around the keyboard pia surmised he was adding her changes to the original manuscript pia took a seat without being asked if she waited to be asked shed be standing all day pia had enjoyed laboring over the lancet piece scientific writing was something she enjoyed and seemed to have a facility for over the previous three years pia had collaborated with rothman on his salmonella studies and had even got credit as one of the authors on several it had been exciting work rothman was continuing his awardwinning landmark research that he had accomplished concerning salmonella virulence a subject for which hed won his nobel and lasker prizes virulence was the microorganisms ability to invade and kill its host cells something salmonella was particularly good at over the years rothman had found classified and defined the five pathogenicity islands or areas in the salmonella genome that encoded for various virulencerelated factors such as specific toxins and antibiotic resistance both of which had contributed to salmonella being by far the largest cause of human foodborne illness in the world every year salmonella caused the mortality and morbidity of countless millions of people every year typhoid fever alone still killed upwards of half a million people a situation rothman had his sights on rectifying and was coming closer to each year initially when pia first joined rothmans lab she had been more interested in his newer area of research namely stem cells and had hoped to work with them but he had had other ideas and wanted her to cut her teeth with his continuing salmonella work as time passed shed become as committed as he in the microbiological arena fascinated by bacteria and viruses in general and salmonella in particular and the microscopic realm they inhabited soon she found herself reveling in the involved science while enjoying the thrill of working with one of the greatest minds on the subject on a daily basis pia had come to relish refining her knowledge of genetics so that she could one day make her own contribution to basic research gradually she had come to realize how exciting research could be and how well it fit with her personality pia watched rothman type away in front of her the level of his concentration was truly remarkable one minute hed been talking with her the next he was totally absorbed as if she were no longer in his presence pia did not take any aspect of his behavior personally after hed confided about his aspergers shed read about the syndrome and guessed that many aspects of his personality were dictated by it even ignoring her as he was doing at that moment instead of being annoyed she thought about the content of the article shed rewritten it was about studies that rothman had been doing involving salmonella typhi grown in outer space on the orbiting international space station rothman had found that growing the bacteria in a zerogravity environment made it enormously more virulent than control bacteria grown back on earth it was rothmans belief that the conditions in space somehow mimicked to a marked extent those present in the human ileum triggering the bacteria to turn on the genes in the pathogenicity islands to produce effector proteins pia was one of the few people who knew that at that moment in the refrigerated storage facility inside the biosafety unit there were three strains of these enormously virulent spacegrown salmonella she also knew that what rothman wanted to do was to figure out how zero gravity caused these changes with the hope of learning how to turn them off not only in space but in the human ileum as well although pia had learned to be patient in rothmans presence she had her limits after a few minutes had gone by pia coughed lightly shed found by experience that coughing seemed to penetrate rothmans concentration more than anything else almost immediately he peered around the screen of his mac and pushed a box of tissues in her direction he had a phobia about people coughing in his presence he was after all a firm believer in the germ theory pia took one of the obligatory tissues right miss grazdani for this months assignment he disappeared from her sight again he resumed his twofinger typing but at least kept talking she couldnt see his face but she preferred it that way which he did too as both had trouble maintaining eye contact not only with each other but with everyone else as well i want to move you over into our induced stem cell work youve done a knockout job with salmonella but its time you started in the other arena a smile of anticipation appeared on pias face rothmans words were music to her ears weve been making breakthrough discoveries of late involving organogenesis pias heart picked up speed it was the first time rothman had talked to her about his stem cell work she knew what organogenesis meant as the word was selfexplanatory it was now the cutting edge of stem cell research it was the last hurdle before creating organs that could be transplanted into patientsorgans like hearts lungs and kidneys it thrilled her to think that rothman was making enormous leaps forward and the idea that she would become part of the effort gave her chills down her spine at this stage our biggest problem is that tissue culture techniques and fluids have not kept up with the breakthroughs that were making current tissue culture techniques were developed for sheets of cells not solid organs im sure you can gather what i mean it relates to oxygenation and removing metabolic waste while maintaining acid base balance within extremely narrow parameters its been basically a combination of pushing the limits of biochemistry and engineering we have come up with some impressive hardware breakthroughs but the involved fluids have not kept pace the problem that is now holding us back is the acid base balance my guess is that the ph is varying too much we cant figure out why what i want you to do is to become a tissue culture fluid expert and figure out why were having this ph problem got it i think so pia managed she had learned that it was never a good ploy to question any of rothmans directives anything and everything could be discussed again but not on the spur of the moment good get to it and when i finish making these changes in the manuscript ill see that marsha gets you a copy for your final review now get out of here rothmans typing picked up pace a few keystrokes followed by several frantic deletions pia kept her seat despite rothmans final comment she sensed that this was all the information she was going to get about her months elective at the moment and it wasnt much inwardly she shuddered a little she had expected to be working on some aspect of rothmans salmonella research as shed done in the past tissue culture was a new discipline for her and what she was being tasked to do sounded like an entire phd project not a months assignment she was going to need a lot of help from rothman and from the other technicians especially nina brockhurst whose job it was to take care of the physical plant of rothmans organgrowing experiments which would include the baths in the past nina had openly resented pia claiming rothman played favorites with her pia had taken the situation in stride as she knew there was always intrigue when people were forced to work together especially when the bosss signals were so hard to read but whatever the workload and her colleagues demeanor pia knew she was going to find the month fascinating even if the fluid bath assignment wasnt on the face of it very exciting in and of itself it was still vital experience she would be gaining learning the basic techniques for taking care of newly created organs a key steppingstone in the journey from studying organogenesis in mice to studying it in people most important the work was in the stem cell arena the place she believed she really wanted to be pia coughed again this time into the tissue that she had in her hand rothmans face reappeared around the side of his mac his expression was one of surprise that pia was still there i went to see the mother superior at the convent last night she said i told her about my not wanting to go to africa good rothman said simply his face disappeared the typing recommenced she was nice about it but i could tell she was not happy thats her problem not yours youll be doing a lot more of gods work here in my lab than going to any godforsaken part of africa she said she did not want to be repaid good for her so dont i think i should are you still willing to cosign for a fiftythousanddollar loan i am but i think youre crazy she doesnt want to be repaid or so she says save your money she used the word betrayal pia said she knew she was distorting the reason the mother superior had chosen to use the word but the fact that she had used it at all still bothered pia rothman gave a short mocking laugh betrayal shes just trying to foist some catholic guilt on you pia for chrissake pay her the money if you need to and be done with it ill have marsha take care of it with my bank as a fourthyear medical student im sure your credit is adequate remember its your life not the mother superiors now get out of here and get to work pia got up and left rothman to his typing passing marsha she thought about hitting the library her initial plan was to read everything on tissue engineering that she could get her hands on she had no doubt it was going to be an overwhelming amount of information columbia university medical center new york city march pm having loaded up on books and printouts from a google search in the library pia spent the morning reading sitting deep in concentration at a bench area outside her windowless office shed been vaguely aware of the maintenance man doing his thing but she had ignored him until he came up behind her disregarding the fact that she had her ipod buds in her ears he had the nerve to tap her on the shoulder pia darling dear want to reconsider my pastrami offer you wont be disappointed not on your life pia said with emphasis hoping hed get what she intended as a definitive message he shrugged and smiled and gave a little silly wave as if pia had been gracious rather than scathing she was beginning to think that vance was one of those men who reveled in rejection irritably she repositioned her earplugs and went back to her reading when she heard her name being called again pia was momentarily livid wondering what she was going to have to do to get him to leave her alone tearing out her earpieces she looked up to see rothmans assistant dr yamamoto standing in front of her flanked by a young man and woman in newly laundered dazzlingly white lab coats miss grazdani yamamoto said he was a slight man with what appeared to be a kind of halfsmile frozen on his face i would like to introduce our new students with us for the month dr yamamoto was often held up within the medical center as a perfect example of how opposites attract he was well liked softspoken considerate and communicative always encouraging people to address him as junichi the positive to rothmans negative also in contrast to rothman he was casually dressed as always in a hawaiian shirt beneath his wrinkled and nottooclean lab coat if there was one nod to his playful side yamamoto was said to be the originator of elaborate and brilliant practical jokes stemming from his graduate student days involving one particularly pompous medical students expensive fools errand to a convention in geneva that never was on the serious side dr yamamotos most important characteristic was his complete and total devotion to rothman and rothmans work what was accepted around the medical center was that rothman was the brains and yamamoto was the worker bee they were yin and yang perhaps you know lesley wong and william mckinley yamamoto said like the president the young man said but call me will will stepped forward a big smile on his face hand outstretched columbia university medical school had about students spread over four years of training in general the first two years were primarily spent absorbing the science of medicine with progressively more and more time creatively devoted to introducing students to patients the third year was the principal clinical year with the major attention devoted to internal medicine and surgery the fourth year was mostly rotations in various clinical subspecialties combined with electives according to each students personal interests at columbia the emphasis was on academic medicine lesley and will were fourthyear students in pias class both thought they had a new interest in research which was why they had been assigned to spend a month in rothmans lab pia took wills outstretched hand and stood up pia grazdani she noticed that will was tall even a little taller than george who was above average like george will had blond unruly hair youre georges friend right will said george yes of course love george great guy i often play bball with him im lesley wong the woman said shaking pias hand in turn for a moment there was an awkward silence pia briefly eyed the two students realizing they had to be the students rothman had briefly mentioned the day before and then never brought up again he had said something about tasking her to come up with something for them to do as if she wasnt going to be busy enough one way or another it was going to be a burden of sorts lesley and will eyed pia back for their part they werent terribly excited about meeting her either for them finding out they had been assigned to rothmans lab was the equivalent to being sent someplace in dantes inferno rothman had the reputation of destroying every students sense of selfconfidence by making them feel stupid which they invariably were in comparison to rothmans encyclopedic knowledge and they had heard about pia as well she too was known as being overthetop smart and also strangely detached and had taken an early interest in research in addition to the regular curriculum for most people being a medical student was demanding enough except for being tight with george wilson who was one of the more popular students in the class a mark in her favor pia never had had the time or inclination to be particularly friendly with many of her classmates and all that was on top of the gossip that she and rothman had something going since she was the only person in the entire medical center that he got along with except for dr yamamoto lesley looked over at will but he was staring at pia when theyd received their assignment lesley had told will that shed sat next to pia in a lab every day for a month the first year but she was sure pia wouldnt remember lesley hadnt made up her mind if pia was extremely focused on her work or just plain rude although she thought it was the former as for will he was excited to be finally matched with piahed wanted to be for three and a half years hed been sure to introduce himself to every woman in the student body he deemed attractive but this was the closest hed come to her okay introductions done yamamoto said it hadnt been quite as awkward as he feared and he was relieved he could get down to business if its okay we can go to my office id like you to come as well pia there are a couple of things we need to talk over and then we can all go take a look at the organ baths with dr rothman yamamoto beamed a smile and walked away the two new students padding closely after him pia brought up the rear reluctant to be leaving her reading but excited at the same time even though she had been working there for years she had never seen the organ baths although she had spent more actual time with dr yamamoto than she had with rothman she didnt feel she knew him as well in her mind he was more complicated than rothman she thought of him as a kindly man but knew that in his own way he was just as demanding as the chief he suffered fools no more gladly but his reprimands and corrections were delivered more politely and at lower volume pia had gathered from experience that the quieter yamamoto spoke the more important it was to listen okay guys find a seat the condition of yamamotos office in comparison with rothmans was as different as the mens personalities yamamotos looked like a typhoon had passed through it books journals files documents papers lay everywhere including on each of the two seats in front of the desk visitors took it on faith that yamamoto actually had a desk as every square inch was under paper including a mountain of academic journals positioned so that a curious passerby couldnt see whether the doctor was sitting behind his desk or not just move those papers yamamoto said as pia and lesley wong gathered them up from the chairs but searched in vain for a free surface on which to put them down yamamoto gestured to the floor a suggestion the women took he leaned his posterior against the front of the desk and folded his arms you could get a chair from the lab he suggested to will no problem will said ill stand i thought it appropriate for us to do a small review and go over some introductory material so you people can better appreciate what youre about to see yamamoto said you are in for a treat today ive gotten special dispensation from dr rothman to show you our organ bath program which has been kept a secret of sorts up until now it couldnt have been kept a complete secret as there are too many people working here and were here in a very public medical center since the professor and i are close to publication secrecy is no longer the issue it was since the university has already seen to it that the appropriate patents have been applied for at the same time we would prefer that you keep what you see today to yourselves deal all three students nodded all right lets start at the beginning but i dont want to make this a boring monologue so help me out somebody tell me what a stem cell is the three students eyed one another will spoke up in simple terms its an undifferentiated immature cell that has the potential of becoming a differentiated mature cell right on yamamoto said an example is a bone marrow stem that can become an adult blood cell these cells are often called adult stem cells whats a pluripotent stem cell lesley spoke up a stem cell that can turn into any of the three hundred or so types of cells that make up the body of a multicellular organism like a human right on again you guys are making this easy for me pia felt a wave of impatience wash over her she was eager to see the organ bath unit had it been up to her she would have preferred to forgo any review session up until four or five years ago how were pluripotent stem cells obtained from blastocysts pia spoke up by reflex she wanted this little talk over with right yamamoto said blastocysts from fertilized eggs meaning very earlystage embryos why was that a problem that led to serious delays in stem cell research because it offended conservatively minded people pia said particularly here in the united states limitations were placed on what could and could not be done in stem cell research with government funds well said yamamoto commented heres a harder question lets say that the research on embryonic stem cells had been allowed to proceed unimpeded can anyone say what the major problem would have been if the research had advanced to a point of using the stem cells to treat patients none of the students moved let me give you a hint yamamoto said im referring to an immunological problem rejection lesley called out her eyes lighting up exactly rejection meaning that any use of such embryological stem cells would have elicited some degree of rejection reaction some techniques would have reduced this problem but not completely eliminated it all three students nodded everything that yamamoto was saying they had heard before now can anyone define induced pluripotent stem cells in contrast to embryological stem cells these are the cells that dr rothman and i have been working with exclusively they are pluripotent stem cells made from mature cells usually a fibroblast and not egg cells pia explained they are induced by particular proteins to revert back from being a mature fibroblast to being a stem cell exactly yamamoto said and isnt it a marvel that it works for a long time one of the tenets of biological science was that cellular differentiation was a oneway street meaning the process could never revert but people should have known that this particular tenet was false after all it was known that certain animals could regrow body parts like starfish and salamanders also cancer should have been a hint that the process of differentiation could go in the opposite direction as many cancers are composed of immature cells that arise in organs populated by mature cells pia found herself glancing at her watch and sitting up straighter in her seat she wanted to speed up the review session but didnt know how she inwardly groaned when lesley piped up with a question how exactly are the cells changed back from mature to immature the same way that everything else is accomplished in the cell yamamoto said by switching on and off genes remember every eukaryotic cellthat is a cell with a nucleuscontains a copy of an organisms entire genome meaning that every nucleated cell has all the information necessary not only to build itself but to build the entire body how this works is a process called gene expression meaning the turning on and off of genes in a kind of molecular ballet i know you learned all this in your genetics courses in college and during your first two years here at columbia anyway cellular maturation proceeds by a sequential switching on and off of the appropriate genes it used to be thought that genes functioned by producing specific proteins sorta one gene for one protein but now we know its far more complicated as there are significantly fewer genes than originally thought for the cell to go in the opposite direction of maturation the sequence has to be reversed are you all with me so far all three students nodded despite feeling impatient even pia was now finding yamamotos review fascinating like all other researchers pia was aware that biological science was unfolding its mysteries at an everincreasing mindboggling speed the nineteenth century had been chemistry the twentieth physics the twentyfirst was undoubtedly going to be biology yamamoto checked his own watch as if answering pias hopes he said weve got to move this along if were going to catch dr rothman in the organ bath unit lets go back to our discussion of stem cells now that we have the induced pluripotent type that are going to avoid immunological rejection problems and be more acceptable to religious conservatives what is the first step toward making them useful to treat the patient who donated the fibroblast anybody yamamoto glanced from face to face will shrugged and offered get them to mature again but into the kind of cell the patient needs thank you yamamoto said indeed that is exactly what most stem cell researchers have been busy doing for years finding out how to regulate gene expression such that the stem cells mature into the kinds of cells that make up the body like heart cells kidney cells liver cells and so forth stem cell researchers have now gotten very good at this including dr rothman and myself but here is where dr rothman and i have separated ourselves from the pack and are about to usher in twentyfirstcentury regenerative medicine thats going to extend and improve the quality of life we have been able to make virtual leaps in the ability to have these mature cells organize themselves into whole organs in other words weve managed to stumble on a host of structural genes and other transcriptional processes that are responsible for creating the latticelike scaffolding that forms the basis of a threedimensional organ once we had the structure it was relatively easy to get it populated by the appropriate cells its a process called organogenesis take for instance a liver although we and others have been able to make hepatic cells for years we have never been able to get them to organize themselves into a whole liver with collagen nerves and blood vessels the whole deal we can do it now were doing it with rapidly increasing efficiency its phenomenal i assume youve been doing this with animal models pia said of course mostly mice the whole stem cell field has extensive experience with the murine model and you believe what youve been learning will be applicable to human cells we do and not only on a theoretical basis concurrently weve been carrying on this research with human cells as well yamamoto held up his left arm and pulled his lab coat sleeve down with his right hand proudly he pointed to a number of inchlong scars of varying age along his forearm ive been the guinea pig for the source of human fibroblasts although most of our research is done with mice we have some human organs functioning equally well human organs that could be used to treat me if i needed one of them youll see in a few minutes any questions before we head over to the unit yamamoto looked at each of the students in turn and then paused finally he said okay lets make our visit hope you guys are ready you are about to visit the future he pushed himself up into a fully erect posture when the women started to replace the papers and journals they had removed from the chairs when they first arrived yamamoto motioned for them not to bother with yamamoto in the lead the group exited his office they walked the length of the sizable lab since the organ bath unit was located at the far end on the opposite side from the biosafety unit as they passed through the lab some of the technicians looked up from their work and eyed them questioningly visitors to the organ bath unit were not common first they entered an anteroom where there were caps gowns booties masks and gloves there was a similar room on the other side of the lab that guarded entrance into the biosafety unit just as this room guarded the organ bath unit interestingly enough the rationale was just the opposite for the biosafety unit the gear was for protection of the visitors with the organ bath unit it was called reverse precautions and was for protection of the contained specimens it wasnt until everyone was suited up and had been checked by yamamoto that they proceeded columbia university medical center new york city march pm using a keypad dr yamamoto punched in a combination unlocking a simple door although she wasnt trying pia noticed it was the same code used for the biosafety unit an alphanumeric sequence that was the time and date of rothmans birth yamamoto stepped aside and ushered the three students into a starkly modern brightly lit room filled with the gentle hypnotic sound of running water pia felt a slight breeze against her as she advanced she knew that was evidence of the room having positive pressure meaning air came out of the room not in that was the opposite of the biosafety room where the laminar flow was into the room stepping beyond the door pia shaded her eyes against the sharp bluish light that came from banks of recessed fiberoptic fixtures she assumed the light had something to do with sterility in the room stopping with the others she took in the scene before her they had entered a large space painted bright white pia was puzzled as to how this lab fit in with the rest of rothmans suiteit seemed larger than it feasibly could be at the back of the room a figure dressed in similar protective garb was hunched over a stainlesssteel cart mounted on wheels making some adjustments on a control panel there were three rows of such carts and pia counted thirty of them in all set atop each were clear rectangular plexiglas aquariumlike containers of various sizes below were shelves holding various and sundry equipment each also had an attached pole supporting a control panel with an led display one of the carts was a few feet to pias left and she moved over to take a closer look lesley and will followed this was one of the organgrowing baths whose contained fluid was what pia would be investigating for the month she leaned over and peered into the container at a miniature translucent object suspended in the liquid by a kind of spiderweb that she was later to find out was made of the same material as real spiderwebs as for the object itself she could see it was connected by filamentthin lines to a central clamp where the lines were gathered a thicker cable fed out of the bath and down into the body of the cart where there was a boxy device with multiple readouts monitoring the conditions in the bath an attached magnifying device on a movable arm was also connected to the cart pia maneuvered it into position so she could see the contained object better although it was not too much larger than a pine nut its appearance was unmistakably that of a kidney albeit a very tiny kidney most of the lines contained red fluid along one larger one that was clear the red ones were presumably functioning as veins and arteries the clear one was acting as the ureter to take away the urine the miniature organ was producing to one side of the container was a jet like one attached to a pool circulator only in miniature it was pulsating at a very rapid rate gentle eddies of liquid coursed around the container causing the organs surface to pulsate slightly we find that we must keep the fluid in the baths in constant motion despite the organs being perfused internally but it has to be carefully modulated occasionally the rigid bath sets up a wash that can disturb the organ yamamoto had stepped over to join the students he noticed pia straighten looking down the length of the room its quite something isnt it he said speaking directly to her of course i see it every day so ive come to take it all for granted how are the organs started pia asked they are started in tissue culture dishes designed to mimic the mouse uterine environment in terms of temperature and with pulsation waves close to the normal mouse heart rate of around five hundred and fifty beats a minute as i said earlier the whole process first in the tissue culture dishes and then in these organ baths is a ballet of gene expression with a careful adherence to sequence and timing it starts with an aliquot of induced pluripotent stem cells held in close proximity by spiderweblike restraints remember to form a whole organ we have to involve all three germ layers ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm once the organ has reached a size that can be manipulated it is moved into these baths to develop to its full extent are there other organs in here besides kidneys will asked heavens yes yamamoto said weve got all the usual transplantable organs such as livers pancreases lungs and hearts so far the kidney program is the most advanced since it was kidneys we started with to prove we are on track with what we have been doing we have already transplanted some organs back into the individual mice from which the fibroblasts were taken with complete and utter success and let me share another leap forward that we are in the process of making weve found that carrying out organogenesis with multiple organs works even better than growing them singularly meaning we have preparations in which the developing organs are helping each other like the heart pumping the perfusing fluid and the kidneys removing waste do you think sometime in the future you could essentially make a whole new organism pia asked with astonishment and not a little dismay at the rate were going i see that as a definite possibility although i cant imagine what the rationale would be pia reflexively shuddered as she realized that frankenstein that nineteenthcentury nightmare could very well resurrect itself to haunt the twentyfirst in a frighteningly more plausible fashion if the rothmanyamamoto organogenesis worked well with kidneys hearts and pancreases there was no reason it couldnt work just as well with brains where are the human organs pia asked yamamoto took a few steps down the kidney line and pointed into a larger plexiglas container this is human as you might expect considering the size its also one of the composite preparations with a human heart to do the kidneys internal profusion pia stared into the bath transfixed by what she was looking at the kidney did look human but the heart did not she asked yamamoto why good question since oxygenation of the perfusing fluid is being done by the oxygenator on the lower shelf we did not need a fourchambered heart as two would do so we altered the design of the heart once again pia was amazed you have that much control of the organogenesis process to alter the overall threedimensional architecture absolutely as i mentioned once we made the original organogenesis breakthroughs our progress has been truly phenomenal and isnt slowing down the figure pia had seen earlier finished what he was doing stood upright and came toward the group as he neared and despite the surgical mask pia was further surprised she could tell it was rothman wearing some kind of goggles with thick tinted lenses he made for an eerie figure like the prototypical mad scientist in his lair pia knew that what dr yamamoto had said outside was truethis truly was groundbreaking work in the stem cell race to move from the promising hypothetical to the clinical rothman and yamamoto had advanced much further than any other team in the world rothman moved the goggles to the top of his head as he came to a stop he looked at yamamoto have they been given a short introduction yes doctor rothman nodded he knew he was going to have to show off his work to any number of interested biotech venture capitalists over the coming years even though it wasnt something he enjoyed or found easy yamamoto had helped him prepare a script that hed practiced again and again with his wife the students were to be a kind of dress rehearsal welcome to columbia university organogenesis laboratory rothman said yamamoto coughed gently into his hand rothman had trouble deviating even slightly from the prepared text it is common knowledge that there are currently more than one hundred thousand people on waiting lists for organ transplants in this country and these are people with endstage disease the list grows at a rate of about five hundred a month currently the same number of people five hundred or so die every month on top of this grim statistic there are thousands upon thousands of additional patients who could benefit from an organ transplant even though they are not yet in a lifethreatening situation obviously in the current environment the supply of viable organs from either a live donor or a recently deceased individual has not come close to keeping up with demand even for those patients lucky enough to receive an organ the match is often far from optimal meaning they are relegated to a life of immunosuppression with dire health consequences what we are doing here in a costconscious fashion is to create organs which will simultaneously solve the supply problem and the immunological issue this goal has not yet been reached but we are making significant progress at this stage we are looking for outside funding to ramp up production at multiple centers across the country what you see in this row of baths are kidneys that have been created from stem cells derived from fibroblastsconnective tissue cellsof specific mice yamamoto tried to interrupt to say that rothman was covering material that had already been mentioned but he couldnt get rothmans attention rothman was on a roll i wear these magnifying lenses so i can work with the lines but take my word for it each organ is hooked up to a pump that circulates a bloodlike solution into the kidneys main artery and out its main vein its connected by a cannula or thin tube from its ureter to a port where its urine output can be sampled thats one of the functions performed by the monitoring unit beneath the bath all the data is collected in the mainframe so we can see how tiny fluctuations in conditions affect the kidney and its development each kidney will soon be implanted back into the same mouse that supplied the original fibroblasts weve already done this twice with no rejection phenomena whatsoever with his hand rothman gestured toward another group of baths these vessels contain pancreases which have quite different needs than kidneys initially we had more difficulty getting the organogenesis process to start than we had with the kidneys but those initial reverses have been solved and we are now doing equally well with the pancreases we have had to be very careful about the integrity of the connections with the pancreatic duct since the pancreatic secretions contain digestive enzymes initially some of our preparations digested themselves have there been any problems with teratomas pia asked in contrast to the others she did not feel intimidated by rothman she knew that teratomas a kind of developmental tumor were something feared by stem cell biologists for a moment rothman faltered he had not been expecting to be interrupted in his prepared remarks except for the sound of moving fluid emanating from all the organ baths a brief silence reigned no teratomas at all yamamoto said coming to his bosss aid he was well aware of his bosss quirky personality as if he had forgotten the students and yamamotos presence rothmans attention diverted to the appearance of a small blinking light accompanied by a pinging noise coming from the control panel of one of the baths without a seconds thought or explanation rothman headed in its direction slipping his goggles back on as he walked thats an alarm that some aspect of the baths parameters has started to change yamamoto explained the students watched him go lesley and will were awed at having been in the famous researchers presence and having survived without being belittled pia was impressed by the alarm what would have happened if no one had been in here to hear the alarm not a problem yamamoto said all information is followed in real time by the universitys mainframe and dr rothman and i have apps on our iphones such that we would have been instantly alerted earlier dr rothman talked to me about a problem with the tissue culture fluid pia said was he referring to the fluid in these baths im sure he was yamamoto said weve been having a continuing problem maintaining the correct ph balance did he ask you to look into the problem because if he did it would be a great help its not been a particularly big problem but neither of us has had a chance to look into it i know id feel a lot better if we could solve the issue ill give it my best pia said the problem is im starting at ground zero ive had no experience whatsoever with tissue culture that didnt seem to bother you in relation to salmonella yamamoto said pia smiled behind her mask she took yamamotos comment as a compliment what about lesley and will maybe it would be appropriate for them to give me a hand thats a great idea yamamoto said he looked at lesley and will how does that sound to you both students shrugged sounds good they said in unison as they left the organ bath unit pia turned just before exiting she looked back at rothman tending to the bath the pinging had stopped once again the thought of the mad scientist in his lair popped into her mind and once again she shuddered shed visited the future in this room and was excited to become a part of it at the same time she knew instinctively that there could be a dark side biological science was advancing almost too fast and the problem with science is that it cannot be unlearned greenwich connecticut march pm edmund mathews went to answer the front door of his waterfront mansion in an extraexclusive enclave of the alreadyexclusive connecticut town of greenwich it was unusual that he was alone in the house but his wife alice had gone to the city with a girlfriend on a shopping expedition and the au pair ellen wasnt back from school with darius yet there was no gardener on the grounds no workman in the house nor were there any painters decorators deliverymen mechanics cooks or anyone else anywhere on the property the million house was quiet and unattended just the way edmund liked it this will be russell edmund thought edmund and his partner russell lefevre had decided to take this tuesday off because their work was about to get crazy this was going to be the last free day they would have in months and it seemed like now he was losing some of his free afternoon russell had called a few minutes earlier sounding upset and said he wanted to come over immediately to talk about something important russell had a habit of insisting on talking about anything sensitive in person back at morgan stanley when they worked together in assetbacked securities their calls had been recorded in case either party misremembered the terms of a trade later on edmund doubted very much that anyone was listening in nowadays but the old habit lingered with russell he was a worrier and he always had been edmund opened the door and greeted russell his partner was a tall lithe man with a sweep of blond hair tinged with gray he was wearing tennis whites with a sweater thrown over his shoulders for a man who was usually quite a dandy he looked thoroughly bedraggled when he wasnt in a suit edmund preferred to wear old tshirts and shorts even in winter he was thicker in the body than russell but not overweight and he kept his hair short and neat with weekly trips to the barber in town edmund could see that russell had haphazardly parked his aston martin db in the driveway and not over by any of the garages as edmund preferred the aston martin was a fine piece of automotive engineering but it was too ostentatious a machine for everyday use for edmunds taste the garish crimson paint job only exacerbated the feeling edmund preferred the inyourface statement he made in his black escalade but for driving enjoyment he loved nothing better than taking his morgan runabout on the back roads deep into connecticut his true pride and joy he drove only rarely in his garage was a ferrari gto that had cost him millions back in the days when that didnt seem like such an extravagance weve got a problem russell said as he entered the atrium so i gather lets go into the kitchen said edmund who preferred to keep business discussions out of the house if he could help it this was going to be one of those days he didnt have any choice russell and edmund had both worked as derivative traders at morgan stanley edmund was one of the best traders there agile and decisive and brilliantly able to find someone to take the other side of a position he was holding he knew russell had some limitations as a trader but he had a quants mind that could calculate risk quickly and edmund could rely on him to tell him if something he was planning was feasible russell had seen the potential for making money in cdoscollateralized debt obligationsexotic financial products that took advantage of the subprime mortgage market to create apparently riskfree investments that could make billions in profits for the company and tens of millions for the traders with property prices on their seemingly unstoppable upward curve the investments were safe as houses as people in the know liked to say eventually it turned out that many of the executives at the brokerages selling cdos and at the financial institutions here and in germany and japan and elsewhere who bought them were completely ignorant of what a cdo actually was they knew what assetbacked securities were but the assets here were mortgage bonds packaged together and sliced up and sold in bundles many of the individual loans the bonds were backed by were subprime loans that would never be paid off and only a few loans needed to fail before the whole package defaulted it was inevitable that this would happen when russell explained to edmund precisely what the subprime loan crisis was going to mean to cdos and other financial products and for the system as a whole edmund was unnerved and excited at the same time he immediately and secretly used his own money to short his own firm and made bets on the failure of other companies exposed to cdos he continued to sell the doomed bonds even when disaster was inevitable he made staggering amounts of money and after a while he told russell a loyal company man whod never dreamed of acting that way what he was doing as edmund predicted russell wanted in and edmund gave him some of his action as the banking catastrophe unfolded there were many victims investors whod lost their money shareholders who found their stocks worthless countless workers who lost their jobs men like edmund mathews and russell lefevre were not among them amid a clamor that the bankers involved should go to jail they left the firm with close to million in compensation between them edmund had enjoyed his first weekend of unemployment to some extent taking darius to soccer practice without bringing his blackberry having dinner with alice and another couple in town reading the sunday paper but by am on that first monday he was bored stiff in his home office he had two screens showing bloomberg and msnbc and he noodled around making minor trades for a few tens of thousands of dollars through his online account at ten he called russell and suggested they get back in the game on their own okay russell whats the problem edmund said after handing russell a glass of ice water the men stood at either end of the island in the middle of the stateoftheart kitchen edmund flipped russell a place mat before he could put his waterbeaded glass on the butcher block i was playing tennis with teddy hill teddy hill hes got to be sixtyfive i hope you went easy on the old boy ed this is serious i play with teddy because he knows everyone and he tells me things he hears as he did today when he told me i practically ran off the court left him standing there told you what russell were being shorted big time russell was right this was serious when he called russell during his first monday of alleged freedom edmund found that russell was as anxious as he was to get something going unbeknownst to edmund russell needed to be earning in he found himself personally long on real estate owning a portfolio of properties in florida and california suddenly worth a lot less than their outstanding mortgages when russell had fixed his problem he was low on cash and needed to leverage his severance money into something more substantial as they had done many times as part of a large corporate group the two men took a weekend away to a hotel in boca raton to brainstorm before getting down to business russell insisted on going to the local mall to pick up some tshirts for his four kids edmund waited for russell outside the gap and watched people passing by look at the people russell edmund said when his partner returned what do you see families strollers couples lots of old people whats on your mind right old people its florida famous for oranges and old people what do old people have i dunno high car insurance premiums russell said that edmund said but this generation also has lots and lots of life insurance and edmund told russell his idea it was called life settlement the partners figured they had stumbled upon something big russell crunched numbers for weeks while edmund discreetly got advice from his old contacts lawyers traders bankers ratings experts and hedge fund managers the idea was legal and it was doable and russell said the numbers were watertight the only way this doesnt work is if we have the second coming and jesus stops people dying russell said and we know thats not going to happen in early lifedeals inc was formed with russell as ceo and edmund chairman of the board the startup money was most of their million take from the subprime debacle and they used it to buy up life insurance policies from thousands and thousands of americans desperate for cash edmund hired the most aggressive salesmen he knew and told them to hire even more hungry people to go out and pound pavement and buy policies for no more than cents on the dollar there were millions of americans who needed money for longterm care or to finance an operation when they didnt have medical coverage or as was increasingly the case even when they did but the coverage wasnt adequate or the insurance company figured out a way not to pay lifedeals had to pay the balance of the premiums but when the policyholder passed on as they would as surely as night follows day the payout was theirs within six months the lifedeals board was confident enough to take the company public edmund and russell held options that made them very wealthy once again but they wanted capitalization to buy more policies edmunds favorite statistic was that there was more than trillion in life insurance policies sloshing around out there for the taking their plan was to start securitizing the policies aggregating them and selling bonds this time the assets behind the securities were castiron personally guaranteed by the grim reaper and thousands of people every day were walking away from policies they had paid into for years because they couldnt afford the premiums they were waiting to be picked off edmund liked to think his company could someday be worth a trillion dollars who is it edmund asked teddy doesnt know he heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend but he trusts the party swears its true its just someone being a wiseass said edmund no said russell its a biggish bet whoever it is theyre sure were going down the toilet well we fucking well better find out who it is before we catch a cold russell knew the implications as well as edmund they needed a large institutional investor to underwrite their securitized package and if it was known on the street that lifedeals was getting shorted that partner would be very hard to find everyone remembered what happened in we need to start going through the fs right away russell said referencing the quarterly statements institutional investment managers had to file with the sec outlining their holdings and i need to start making some calls russell had left wall street with more intact relationships than had edmund and he could easily plug into the rumor mill it was after all a very small community edmund didnt need to say anything both men knew what was at stake columbia university medical center new york city march pm off by themselves pia lesley and will were sitting in the mostly empty hospital cafeteria nursing cups of postprandial tea and coffee seeing what rothman and yamamoto were working on had left each of them shellshocked as medical students they were well aware from an academic standpoint what was being done in the lab and having seen it with their own eyes made it real and concrete theyd been to the future and it was difficult to absorb i cant get over it lesley wong said im still blown away growing organs from a patients own stem cells something like that is going to revolutionize medicine its certainly going to revolutionize the care of degenerative disease pia said its going to provide cures instead of just treating symptoms down the road we could grow our own organs and freeze em for when we need em will said hey i wonder how columbia divides the cash on a medical breakthrough like this this is going to be huge yamamoto said that the university has filed patents but dont you think that rothman and yamamoto have to get some kind of cut dont you think pia pia had come with lesley and will not because she wanted company per se but because she still felt unnerved by what she had seen and wanted to talk about it after dr yamamoto led them out of the inner lab with the organ baths that morning theyd settled in a corner of the lab with the intention of discussing tissue culture fluid instead they couldnt stop talking about the progress rothman had made in organogenesis as interested as they were they realized that reading books from the library and doing web searches was fruitless the textbooks on this stuff hadnt been written yet youre asking the wrong person pia said responding to wills question about rothman and yamamoto getting a cut money and i dont have much of a relationship but hes gotta be looking at billions here doesnt he im going to call my dad hell know someone who knows your dad lesley said yeah his broker is pretty well connected i dont think you should be talking about any of this to others pia offered particularly people outside the medical center remember what yamamoto said at least during this month while youre working there or until the key publication is released you might be right will said but it cant be that much of a secret as yamamoto admitted but certainly its best not to get on rothmans wrong side especially with his reputation im just pleased to be part of the scene lesley said id be happy just checking bath temperatures for the month after all the terrible stories ive heard about rothmans treatment of students i was expecting the worst today will said but hell he seemed very nice to us maybe he didnt know we were coming today or didnt know who we were he had to know who we were lesley said i think he was using us to practice showing off the progress theyve been making but whatever the reason i dont care im happy just to have been able to see it inwardly this was exactly what pia was thinking it had been a magical experience for her to visit rothmans inner sanctum it had been a long wait but she didnt care nor did she feel any resentment that lesley and will had gotten to do it on the very first day of their elective for pia it was as if she had entered a different physical dimension the room and what was happening inside it seemed to belong to a realm quite apart from all that lay outside what she remembered was a white space glowing blue like something from a science fiction movie it was one of the most tantalizing experiences of medical school will said i loved it me too pia said i could have just stood there and watched baths all day hey everybody a voice announced it was george wilson standing at the foot of the table carrying a cafeteria tray hed just emerged from the food table line is this a private party or can a tired radiology extern join you the three students eyed each other it was will who spoke up if it isnt mr wilson hello george will hows it going george said he tried to conceal his displeasure at seeing mckinley sitting at a table with pia you know lesley wong will said playing the host and pia of course lesley hi how are you pia how was your day with rothman george was feeling extremely uncomfortable as hed not yet been invited to sit down and so stood awkwardly next to the threesomes table it was late and hed managed to get to the cafeteria just before it closed the last person he expected to see there was pia the secondtolast person was will mckinley who usually held forth in the medical school dorm cafeteria chatting up all the women medical students we were just talking about it pia said unaware of georges discomfort social cues were not one of her strong points lesley and will are also spending their electives in rothmans lab and about the day it was lets say interesting crazy rothman saves the world will said what do you mean by that pia said there was a sharpness in her voice nothing nothing will said holding up his hands as if he expected pia to attack him its known you worship the guy i respect the guy listen its fine hes clearly some kind of crazy genius the look on pias face persuaded will that he might be better off changing the subject what we were wondering will said is how much money rothman stands to make if he finds investors to back him you were wondering lesley said yes i was wondering theres got to be big money in this rothmans sitting on a gold mine dont you think george im not exactly sure what youre talking about george said but i can tell im interrupting a meeting here he started to leave but will grabbed his jacket just above the elbow and restrained him dont go take a seat george glanced at pia and she motioned with her head for him to sit down which he did unsure if it was the right move greenwich connecticut march pm edmund mathews was back at his front door and again it was russell this time russell hadnt called ahead he simply texted edmund on his blackberry to say he was coming over there was only one reason hed come back edmund figured he must have found out who was shorting lifedeals edmund we need to talk tell me what you found out i need a drink and so will you can you fix me a scotch edmund knew russell liked the eighteenyearold talisker single malt he kept in the den so he walked russell over to the room and closed the door behind them edmund had been sitting in there reading some research and had started a fire in the grate the room smelled slightly of smoke and when edmund opened the bottle the peaty aroma of the whiskey added to the effect that they were in a highland lodge so what do you know edmund poured two drinks and handed one to russell who stared into the fire an elbow leaning on the mantel im a big boy russell ive heard bad news before out with it gloria croft russell said snatching a glance at edmund then throwing down all of his drink in one shot excuse me i thought for a second you said gloria croft i did thats who it is edmund gloria freaking croft shes doing it plain as day through bigskies youve gotta be kidding me you have got to be fucking kidding me edmund was yelling nearly at the top of his voice this was why russell had been concernedhe knew edmund was going to flip out there was a knock at the door and alice edmunds wife popped her pretty blond head in oh hi russell edmund darius is going to bed alice took one look at her husbands face twisted in a rictus of unalloyed rage she could see it would be a hopeless task to get anything out of him in this state ill say good night for you then bye russell alice blurted and withdrew closing the door behind her the interlude cut short edmunds tirade he poured himself another drink and then one for russell closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath why did it have to be gloria croft youd better tell me everything russell sat down on a low padded stool by the fire edmund stayed standing i made some calls it only took two actually i called the guy who told teddy hill he heard about the shorting and the guy gave up his source it was someone id met before at some mortgage convention in vegas he runs this bullshit financial newsletter he got it from the horses mouth the horses ass more like did he say why shes doing it didnt say much i think once hed told me he thought better of it and got off the phone pretty quick he got nervous shes a big player bigskies has a lot of money edmund was experiencing a lessthanpleasant sense of deja vu through her hedge fund bigskies gloria croft had taken huge positions betting on the failure of the cdos issued by among others edmund and russells desk shed taken the positions early in when no one else was doing it and when it was cheap to do hundreds of thousands of dollars could turn into tens of millions what she was indicating was that she thought the aaarated mortgagebacked bonds would fail and jeopardize the futures of wall street giants like bear stearns and lehman brothers almost no one agreed at the time there was no chance their stock could go so low but it did and it went lower russell and edmund were quiet russell staring into the bottom of his glass edmund at the fire hissing and spitting in the grate he held back the fire guard and popped another log into the flames shes got some balls russell said finally she does this is different though youre right about that russell and edmunds thinking was following the same track subprime mortgages were a disaster as assets they were just terrible in their life settlement paradigm the debtors were the nations largest insurance companies some of the richest institutions in the country the bottom line was solid encapsulated in one of edmunds favorite sayings of recent months what are the insurance policy holders going to do not die so what is she doing edmund said after another long pause it doesnt make sense we know the numbers right were solid all round actuarially we did the worst casepeople living a little longer for god knows what reasonand weve taken those tolerances into account unless shes shorting you and me personally but shes too smart for that way too smart theres gotta be something she sees in the numbers if there was anything in the numbers id have seen it russell said a little testily i know that russell shes seeing something that isnt there it really doesnt matter why shes doing it shes doing it and we might be left standing in the rain with our dicks in our hands god damn it so what do we do we have to talk to her find out what she knows edmund said try to talk some sense into her when she understands what the upside is perhaps we can help her out edmund was talking about offering gloria an inside track to invest in the company and share in the enormous windfall they were confident was coming maybe thats what she wants russell said shes sending up a smoke signal she could call us on the telephone and ask edmund said he thought for a second lets call her right now now its after nine oclock at night call her anyway shes always working im not sure ill be able to get to sleep tonight unless we talk to her do you have her cell yes but why me you did business with her and shes not going to take my call pure and simple years back gloria had worked for edmund as a humble analyst two jobs before she went out on her own edmunds desk was a boys club and women had to be very thickskinned to work there this much russell knew there was more he didnt know but the bottom line was that it hadnt ended well russell happened to have been present the last time edmund had seen gloria when she walked out of a bar full of abouttobeformer traders where shed gone to commiserate with one of her friends who had been fired she was walking out because edmund who was very drunk was yelling at her youre the reason these people are out of work edmund had shouted many people would contend that it was the products edmund sold that ruined the firms and caused people to be fired rather than the shortsellers who saw an opportunity but from edmunds perspective his own participation was purely shortterm expedient glorias role was more causative russell scrolled through his blackberry for gloria crofts number he dialed and gloria picked up after a couple of rings gloria its russell lefevre russell how are you glorias voice was level and deliberate she didnt act surprised in the slightest to hear russells voice despite the hour good thank you i trust you are too where are you i hope youre not still in the office at this hour russell could hear background sounds that suggested she was just watching asia open ive been expecting your call is edmund there with you you can put me on speaker if you like hang on a second gloria as edmund rolled his eyes russell fiddled with the buttons on his phone then propped it up against the bottle of talisker okay gloria russell said hello edmund how are you okay gloria edmund said trying to sound carefree he looked imploringly at russell this was his call couldnt he just get on with it gloria wed like to get together with you russell interjected we have some things wed like to discuss what types of things russell her voice was carefree as if she were enjoying herself stop screwing around gloria edmund said all lightness gone from his voice lifedeals as you know perfectly well ah the same charming edmund mathews i remember so well if you want to talk youre welcome to come and see me at my office this was a power move and edmund was making a vigorous throatslashing gesture with his right hand he didnt want to go to her office and cede her the offensive how about we meet for lunch russell suggested you like terrasini i remember and i havent been there in a while would that work for you he was suggesting the excellent midtown italian restaurant long a financiers favorite russell im sorry im booked solid and im going out of town its here or its nothing until next week hold on gloria russell picked up the phone and quickly muted it just in time jesus who does she think she is the veins in edmunds neck were bulging it was as if gloria were still working for him and she were talking back to him edmund shes got us over a barrel and she knows it we need to know what shes looking at ill go if you cant stand it no ill go like some damned supplicant shes going to pay for this somewhere down the road and bigtime for once edmunds curiosity had trumped his vanity russell got back on the line gloria sorry about that any chance we can see you tomorrow how about nine oclock it was another raised middle finger as far as edmund was concerned nine oclock meant driving into manhattan and battling all the commuters edmund had an aversion to public transportation so taking the train was out of the question edmund was making the throatslashing motion again sorry gloria ive got an appointment early on that i cant break how about tenthirty okay russell gloria said with amusement she could imagine how her request had been greeted by edmund see you tomorrow russell said ending the call edmund sighed grateful for the one small concession park avenue new york city march am edmund and russell entered the midsize highrise along park avenue in midtown manhattan predictably edmund had been in a sour mood on the town car ride down from greenwich russell had insisted on sharing the ridehe wanted to see if he could soften his partners mood before they met gloria croft edmund had been a bully all his life and he felt uncomfortable in any situation where he wasnt in charge not only was he not controlling events here it seemed like he was being played and by a woman and by a woman who used to work for him russell doubted whether his calming words had had any effect when they arrived gloria used a script she had learned from edmund and edmund knew it the two men were buzzed into the suite and shown into a glasswalled conference room where they were left to stew for fifteen minutes the receptionist was very polite and they were offered coffee or water outside the room the office seemed calm and peaceful with only the hum of the airconditioning system breaking the silence the image exuded was of quiet authority then gloria emerged shed changed her look since edmund had last seen her there was now a slight wave to her midlength lustrous brown hair she wore a welltailored business suit with a lavender blouse and black heels there was just the right hint of decolletage she looked like ten million dollars gentlemen im very sorry something going on in singapore russell and edmund had stood up when gloria entered and she walked over to each man and shook his hand there was a slight almost imperceptible smile on her face she was clearly enjoying herself follow me she walked out of the conference room quickly and edmund and russell gathered up their coats and briefcases and hustled after her shes got us trotting along like a couple of poodles edmund muttered under his breath gloria was already sitting at her desk when the men entered her office some giant abstract and presumably very expensive painting hung on the wall behind her the desk itself was bare save for several large telephones carrels behind gloria were strewn with prospectuses and various files one entire mahogany wall was inset with the mandatory array of televisions carrying the financial channels gloria pressed a button on the underside of her desk and the office door soundlessly closed when she spoke she sounded coy even if edmund knew that was something she was incapable of i feel like im twentyfive again back then i was like a suckerfish hanging around the great predators looking for the little scraps of food they missed when they fed the ocean was full of blood it was a lot more fun then than it is now dont you agree edmund didnt like the way this had started out even he wouldnt have been this bold now she was the shark and they were the suckerfish and it was their blood she smelled in the water he bit his tongue until gloria started talking about the opportunities she had lucked into in the subprime field opportunities she was grateful that the market meaning edmund and russell had made available to her well gloria edmund said trying to control himself youre just not as smart as you think you are that subprime stuff was never designed to succeed we knew it was going to fail we were shorting each other we were shorting ourselves maybe you were but not till the very end i was buying swaps five years before youedmund snortedand you guys were still leveraging your position selling the worthless bonds right up until lehman went down tell me you werent gloria had at least one of her gloves off now she felt she held a winning hand against lifedeals it might make for a longer game if she held her cards but she had edmund and russell right where she wanted them and she could enjoy witnessing their reaction if she played her hand now shed probably make just as much money in the long run if lifedeals wasnt a public company it depended on how far edmund was going to push his luck that morning before they arrived shed looked at herself in the bathroom mirror and said payback time gloria cleared her throat and went on the traders who sold those cdos should have gone to jail the whole of wall street was tarred with that brush immoral greedy selfish it was stealing nonsense edmund said you said it yourself it was an opportunity you destroyed those companies your fingerprints are on the bodies the government mandated that mortgage lenders make subprime deals everybody should have a home no one held a gun to anyones head i dont understand why were raking over all this again weve moved on you clearly havent but id urge you in the strongest possible terms to get over it edmund was exerting as much selfcontrol as he could speaking slowly and evenly russell knew the plug on the volcano was shaking the whole thing was threatening to blow robotically edmund continued we have the utmost confidence that lifedeals is a winner and is going to prove to be so in the very near future oh really gloria said well i have half a million in credit default swaps on the line that says it wont and im going to buy more and you know what ill be glad when it fails because i think youre stealing again only this time youre stealing vulnerable peoples life insurance and youre paying them pennies these are old people who are desperate for money because they need an operation and dont want to go bankrupt because our health system has written them off edmund was massaging his temples they were bankers they made money end of story the supreme court has ruled that life insurance policies are equity that people can buy and sell edmund said youre paying fifteen percent of face value ten if you can we are offering a legitimate financial service to older americans who need cash for whatever reason we havent created the need were merely filling it its of no concern to me whether an individual is paying for a new hip or a cruise to alaska perhaps they just dont want their ungrateful children to get the money theres nothing immoral or unethical about it were helping put money back into the economy you should thank us oh spare me edmund now that the mortgage market has dried up some clever analyst zeroed in on life insurance its another gold mine and damn the consequences for the people involved russell could see this was going nowhere fast he moved forward in his seat gloria with all due respect edmund and i didnt drive down here to debate the ethics of life settlements although i have to say they have been around for years with little protest well have to agree to disagree wed like to know why youre so sure were wrong i brought along some research as backup russell placed financial statements in front of gloria along with complicated graphs that showed bell curves for the life expectancy of people whose policies lifedeals had purchased separating them by the diseases the holders suffered he gave gloria the whole picture letting her see her more information than was normally presented to prospective hedge fund managers he then described the plan how they would securitize the policies into bonds resulting in vastly increased income that was then used to buy up more policies to make into more bonds the bonds were weighted the largest segment based on diabetes the second largest on cardiovascular disease and the third on kidney disease while russell talked gloria glanced at the financial statements and the bell curves it didnt take her long when she was finished she tossed them aside as if she didnt believe any of it finally russell explained that since the bell curves could accurately predict when the policies would pay out they could factor in all the other cogent data and determine their cash flow extremely accurately and buy as many policies as the revenue streams allowed their actuarial data was enormous going back fifty years and even longer if they needed it weve left nothing to chance russell said its foolproof based on real numbers sure a few people are going to have spontaneous remissions but others will pay out faster than predicted its all based on accepted mathematics and the bedrock is the insurance companies it might be the best investment opportunity ever backed by the supreme court ruling so theres no chance the insurance industry can lobby congress to have laws and rules changed the insurance companies are going to pay every penny the policies have accrued russell suddenly stopped out of breath russell and edmund looked at gloria who stared back for a couple of beats there was silence dont you see it russell questioned i see it gloria said youre the ones who dont see it its real weve run the numbers up and down and confirmed it with all the actuarial companies its real were already holding fifty thousand policies gloria whistled how much are the premiums on fifty thousand policies russell you must be paying out about four five million a month youre going to run out of capital by the end of next year if you dont start having significant income russell and edmund knew she was right that gloria was smart was not news to edmund he wouldnt have hired her otherwise way back when but in this instance theyd be fine they were going to be fully capitalized by the end of this year he wondered if gloria might be bluffing and was beginning to think she was so far shed given them nothing he was getting tired of this gloria all youve told us is that we are mean heartless bastards taking money from old ladies edmund said but we knew that already i think youre fishing you told some guy you were shorting us knowing it would flush us out and wed come down here and explain our business plan which we have done congratulations now we should go and not take up any more of your time well be more than happy to mail you a prospectus in due course edmunds irritated expression had morphed into the insufferably smug look gloria remembered from whenever he had dressed her down in days of yore she pulled out the central drawer of her desk and found a red sharpie on her desk looking at edmund she took one of russells graphs and copied the bell curve only drawing it shifted to the right of the one printed on the paper she held up the graph what would it mean to you if this happened russell squinted at the paperit was the diabetes chart thats not going to happen humor me hypothetically youre projecting chronically sick diabetes patients living about ten years longer than theyre going to live as i said its not going to happen lets say forty percent of your policies are diabetes patients if we have a curve like mine instead of the curve like yours i reckon thats twenty thousand policies youre stuck with for ten additional years thats um two hundred and forty million in premiums you werent expecting to pay kind of cuts into your model doesnt it perhaps theyre half your policies i think the curve needs to move a little more fifteen years and its four hundred and fifty million your biggest source of revenue becomes a sinkhole of toxic assets thats hypothetical and it flies in the face of fifty years of actuarial data fifty years edmund was yelling but gloria was looking at russell he looked worried yes you have fifty years worth of old data but youre not looking at the future technology can make a monkey out of a table in a minute if you have any more great ideas please share them with me i will be happy to take a position on them too what the fuck are you talking about edmund demanded do you know what an ips cell is ive heard of them yes said edmund something to do with stem cells but i dont see induced pluripotent stem cells said gloria if you looked to the future and not to the past you might know that ips cells are going to have a huge impact on regenerative medicine you mean stem cell therapy said edmund that bubble burst ten years ago all those biotechnology startups penny stocks today edmund youre still talking about the past gloria had come this far youre ignoring the future okay gloria what do you see in your crystal ball have you heard of the nobel laureate tobias rothman or junichi yamamoto what theyre doing at their research lab up at columbia medical center no russell said feeling that the ceiling was pressing in on him through a contact who follows biotech patents ive learned that rothman has mouse organs entire organs that he has grown from ips cells that hes transplanted back into the same mice that donated the cells any day now hes going to do it with human ips cells if he hasnt already hell be able to grow pancreases for humans to make insulin pancreases that are custom made for a patient so no rejection you know what thats going to do gloria pointed to the graph she had drawn over and dragged her finger from russells bell curve to her red version that gloria sat back russell had done the real math in his head thanks to some particularly aggressive salesmen in texas and florida they were extremely long on diabetics policies gloria had in fact undershotthey were almost twothirds of their policies meaning they might be on the hook for almost million in additional premiums who knew if the science was going to work and when and not every patient was going to be helped but still if she was right their paradigm would be in tatters was there any way they could dump those policies could they securitize them anyway would anyone invest in the company with this much doubt about the nature of the risk these questions were occurring to russell edmund just wanted to get the hell out of there think of lifedeals as a swimming pool said gloria theres water pouring out already and theres going to be a lot less of it pouring in than you planned in the near term you guys are going to be left high and dry with no life preserver gloria was enjoying herself you want some advice i doubt it but im going to give it to you anyway hurry up and securitize and sell those tranches asap before others start to see that the ground under lifedeals is going to be more like quicksand than bedrock once that happens your bonds are going to go begging some of the money that comes in from the bonds you might be able to squirrel away if youre clever and i know you are but you certainly arent going to get back your seed money unless you want to break the law which brings us neatly full circle perhaps youll end up going to jail this time russell we gotta go edmund said as russell gathered up his papers edmund and gloria held each others glare gloria had played her hand and she could see it had hit home so sorry you guys have to run but i have to go to lunch anyway she said gloria handed russell some more of his papers shed already decided to strengthen her position against lifedeals significantly later that day edmund was right in partshe had wanted them to tell her about their business plan and she assumed edmund would be arrogant enough to tell her too much now shed seen their model and it was even worse than she could have hoped or better maybe shed cost herself some money but she already had more than she could reasonably spend in three lifetimes that look on edmunds face was priceless edmund and russell were silent as they waited for the elevator russell stole a look at edmunds face and it bore an expression he had never seen it looked like grief they got in the elevator hold these a second edmund said to russell handing him his case and his coat edmund stepped forward and slammed the elevator door hard with the fist hed made of his left hand he cried out and grabbed his hand the pain when it came was a relief columbia university medical center new york city march pm pia had quickly learned to feel at home in what dr yamamoto liked to call the bathroom the organ bath facility where the mouse kidneys hearts lungs and pancreases were being nurtured she had spent the morning in there harvesting reams of data on the ph levels in the baths and using a handheld tablet to look at the histories of a few organs that had failed they were later found to have very subtle variations in acidity or alkalinity from the rest of the samples pias task was to monitor the baths and she tried to figure out how she might rig up some kind of electronic alarm to her cell phone like rothman and yamamoto had that would alert her when a bath developed a slight variation in ph dr rothman had come and gone a couple of times pia knew from speaking with dr yamamoto that the team was running complex and timeconsuming studies concurrently both here with the baths and in the biosafety level lab on the other side of rothmans complex rothmans work on salmonella had made his reputation and he wasnt about to abandon it even if it meant working at superhuman levels of energy and concentration he treasured his access to the highly virulent strains that nasa provided him with and with the space shuttle program winding down he didnt know when he might get more lesley and will had left the room to find dr yamamoto it had been decided that in addition to helping pia they would initiate their own study of the effects of slight variations in the temperature of the baths unfortunately their study had reached a quick impasse and they preferred to consult dr rothmans associate rather than the man himself dr rothman entered the room moving to the last row of baths we seem to have a problem with number nineteen he said apparently into thin air pia joined rothman who was fiddling with the monitoring unit under the bath the blood flow is compromised theres a blockage so we may have to section the organ to see if the problem is developmental or some kind of embolus there are few journeys longer from in vitro to in vivo how long before you can start human trials pia said rothman flinched a little and looked around at pia apparently in surprise had he been talking to himself were a little closer with the kidney than with the pancreas the kidney is basically a filter quite simple but the pancreas is very complicated its fascinating to me that one gland would have so much to do and such important tasks hormones and enzymes pia said the islets of langerhans i always loved that name they were discovered by a twentyoneyearold german named paul langerhans in i remember when i was a teenager and first heard the term i thought they were named after some actual islands someplace pia had rarely heard dr rothman sound so jovial he seemed to revel in his lair pia thought it fitted his temperament to enjoy the name of the hormoneproducing cells of the pancreas that pumped insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream to regulate sugar levels or at least they were intended to of course it was necessary to locate the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum so it could inject its enzymes into the digestive system the ampulla of vater another of my favorites rothman was referring to the junction of the bile duct and the pancreatic duct where food passing through the intestine was mixed with the agents necessary for its digestion and to control the level of acidity but its so deeply buried in there its very elusive thats why pancreatic cancer is so hard to detect and so lethal the organ has such a large blood supply cancers tend to spread very quickly rothmans mind was wandering he seemed so uncharacteristically relaxed its organogenesis is very elusive too all the hormone and enzymeproducing cells have to be genetically coded to create the gland and were just coming to grips with the process rothman had moved to a different bath the mouse pancreas is remarkably similar to ours were making strides here but i want to speed things up some scientists were working on implanting glucose sensors and insulin pumps into patients others were examining gene therapy solutions with patients ingesting a medication containing a virus to cause the production of insulin in the presence of glucose rothman was tackling the issue the only way he knew by swinging for the fences pia loved that confidence and ambition she felt some of it had rubbed off on her in the time she had spent with rothman over the last three years she also knew how other people saw him they saw that confidence as arrogance of the worst kind but it could be arrogance only if the conceit was deliberate it wasnt just that rothman didnt care what other people thought he didnt notice either i wanted to thank you doctor pia said for what for offering to lend me money to pay the sisters the sisters helped you in the past but the past is the past you dont need them anymore you need to move beyond all the problems foster care caused you just like i did im trying to she said referring to rising above the legacy of her childhood experiences but about not needing the sisters anymore she wasnt so sure my sons are not as healthy as i would like i feel very guilty rothman said out of the blue shocking pia he rarely said anything personal especially something so very personal the only other time was when hed admitted having aspergers im so sorry pia said i had no idea nobody does rothman said uncharacteristically wistfully i never talk about it but its a big part of my race with stem cells and stem cell science pia didnt know what to say what was suddenly clear was why rothman had made such a deviation in his scientific pursuits after such success with his salmonella work rothman continued to watch the tiny pancreas suspended in the bottom of the bath pia could only imagine what flight of hope his mind was taking him on now she could see him almost physically shake it off he took one more look at the figures on the monitor and wordlessly left pias side it was amazing and distressing how he could turn on and off new york city march pm after leaving gloria crofts office edmund mathews still steaming mad and nursing a sore left hand turned east onto lexington avenue and found a duane reade pharmacy he bought a bottle of motrin and took four his hand throbbed sharply but he was certain he hadnt broken any bones when he slammed the elevator door had he used his stronger right hand he surely would have russell lefevre often found edmunds behavior during crises to be unpredictable and alarming but he knew edmund had a laserlike focus that he could bring to bear at times like this edmund had the ability to break down complex problems and attack them piece by piece until he had it licked edmund had the car brought around and the two men sat in it doubleparked on east fiftyeighth street russell swore he could hear edmund thinking we have to get a head start on securitizing what we have russell said yes for certain and look at the diabetics whose policies we own said edmund see if it mightnt be cheaper to cancel some rather than carry them and we should lay off some of our sales force until further notice edmund had russell call a contact at goldman sachs a man named mcdonald in the assetbacked securities division mcdonald had been interested in lifedeals but was wary russell was still confident they would get one of the major players on board and he hadnt spoken to mcdonald in a while it happened that mcdonald had a few minutes to spare an old client and edmund and russell headed down to west street in battery park city and goldmans global headquarters that guys smalltime no vision edmund said after the unsatisfying meeting russell had answered all the questions the traders asked about securitizing their portfolio of life settlements sooner rather than later but the traders couldnt see what the hurry was from their perspective the more policies they had to bundle the better their product was going to be and they hadnt done the grueling legal legwork to create the complex cdos to be in a position to take them to market what russell and edmund had been looking for was reassurance after their meeting with gloria croft as they left goldman they admitted to each other that the reaction theyd gotten wasnt exactly negative it just wasnt wildly positive either in the car russell and edmund made another decision as gloria croft had so devastatingly demonstrated the main problem they were facing was with the mortalityrate bell curves that lifedeals viability was predicated on and the damage that medical advances might do in terms of moving the curve to the right we need to go see henry green edmund said henry green was ceo of statistical solutions llc the company that had produced all the actuarial data including the bell curves edmund got out his blackberry this was a call he wanted to make henry green please okay well tell him edmund mathews is in the city and on his way over and needs to see him right away well im sure hell understand when you tell him our key data has flaws theres new information we need to fix it edmund hung up hell see us edmund said lifedeals had put statistical solutions on an expensive retainer russell wanted to be armed with the best available statistical analysis when they went on the road selling their product one supposed lesson from the subprime debacle was that investors wanted to know exactly what they were investing in it might appear to be selfevident but it wasnt russell wanted to be able to show an investor the latest data even individual policies if they cared to see them for his part henry green was less than pleased to be hearing from edmund mathews at all let alone when he was demanding a facetoface meeting without notice while russell lefevre wanted the full breadth and depth of research that statistical solutions offered he gave the firm time to accomplish what was asked for in contrast edmund mathews would call up and want immediate answers to complicated questions green had had to drive his people hard squeezing every last cents worth of work out of the company to comply edmund expected henry to drop everything whenever he called edmund and russell arrived at the statistical solutions offices in chelsea in short order and within a couple of minutes were sitting with green in his office edmund i gather you mentioned something on the phone about new information green said hesitantly thats right said russell who wanted very much to avoid having edmund yell at henry green which had happened in the past theres new material and we need your expert opinion to see if we need to be concerned about it edmund sighed at the understatement what my colleague is trying to say henry is that you may have been wrong in some of your forecasts by amounts that could put us out of business so id be very grateful henry if you could get those geniuses you told us about who could have gotten jobs at google to come in here and prove to us that they are in fact smart enough to tie their own shoelaces after all edmunds voice was rising in volume but the dam held just henry green pressed a number on his phone pad and picked up the receiver yes laura would you have tom and isabel meet us in the conference room right away green hung up the phone gentlemen shall we everyone russell and edmund could see around the office was young henry green at least affected the look of a businessman with his dress slacks and dark shirt but his messy hair was at least two inches too long in back the numbers geeks dressed in black looked like they had just come in from an allnight party statistical solutions was gaining a reputation for all kinds of data collection and algorithm solving and a lot of their employees did indeed go on and work for silicon valley giants that paid for their dry cleaning and accommodated their dogs at work to keep them henry green had to be equally tolerant and generous as long as they gave him six months of hard work henry green didnt mind statistical solutions was strongly in the black anticipating that russell wanted to speak edmund dove right in addressing isabel and tom directly what do you know about stem cell research in relation to the treatment of diabetes i know what stem cells are isabel lee said did you build it into your projections build what in the fact that a professor up at columbia is making strides toward creating human pancreases outside the body to be used as transplants if he succeeds hell be prolonging the life of diabetes patients which is a good thing of course isabel said neither isabel nor her colleague tom graham enjoyed working on mortality statistics for lifedeals even less when they found out what lifedeals was doing with them theyd mentioned their misgivings to green but hed waved them off saying they were not being paid to make ethical value judgments yeah the concept of making money from peoples deaths is creepy but the pay is good yes its a wonderful day for medicine and fat people less good for my investors edmund said listen we gave you full license to draw up parameters for us using actuarial data and crossreferencing it with our cashflow projections and nowhere did we see any information about this russell said getting a nod of agreement from edmund russell we built in increases in life expectancy and added tolerances for unexpected developments but they were capped at five percent henry said as we discussed as you agreed if there is about to be a major breakthrough like custommade transplantable pancreases from stem cell research or fallout from the human genome project we cant be held responsible you cant anticipate onceinacentury events then all this fucking statistical research is useless edmund snapped throwing up his hands in frustration its all nothing but mental masturbation naha isabel said not at all intimidated its good data for what we had if theres a paradigm shift then numbers change and graphs have to be adjusted to reflect it simple as that she shrugged and sat back in her chair tom graham was looking at a fingernail and didnt respond thats it thats what we get whoops sorry wrong number we didnt think of that we were paying you to think of everything its not as if stem cells popped out of the blue what sort of company are you running anyway okay lets not get worked up here russell interjected henry edmund apologizes dont apologize to me apologize to them henry said indicating isabel and tom isabel glowered at edmund who eventually raised a hand to speak it was about as contrite as he was going to be henry listen we need some fresh models run based on some new assumptions that i can email to you in an hour or so soon as we get back we need to see how our cash flow is affected in these new scenarios youll have to make assumptions as there is no real data available wed be very grateful if you could do it for us and we need it right away as you know theres provision in our contract yes russell i know said henry in actual fact i happened to take a look at our contract when you were on your way over well do the work for you have it for you tomorrow as soon as we can as you know russell theres a mutual twentyfourhour cancellation provision in the contract under certain circumstances i believe circumstances such as these cover the provision more than adequately so consider this your notice more deflated than they had been on arrival edmund and russell didnt have it in them to protest they got up to leave castle towers retirement home phoenix arizona march am at her home outside phoenix sally mason sat on a bench next to the entrance making the most of the last of the morning air before the sun made sitting outside unbearable even though sally had been born in the state and lived here all her life the heat had always got to her sally was proud of the fact that she was a lifelong arizonan thered been only about people living in arizona when she was born in and that was about the current population of mesa a place that was barely a dot on the map when she was growing up today sally was scheduled to receive another visit from howard essen the salesman shed met a couple of times and spoken to on the phone frequently in the last few weeks sally appreciated the fact that essen hadnt been too much of a hardseller not as relentless certainly as the man who sold her husband the life insurance policy in the first place shed actually enjoyed talking to howard about his family a wife and three children to whom he was clearly devoted hed also shown interest in her story about arizona when she was a girl when they still tied up horses outside stores in downtown phoenix about her preston now twenty years gone and about their only daughter jean and her son this was one of the good days a day she didnt have to travel fortyfive minutes for hours of tedious and uncomfortable dialysis sally had decided that today she was going to tell howard essen she was accepting his proposal howard agreed to sallys request to come at noon as she wanted to keep the afternoon free she checked her watchit was about ten ofand sally closed her eyes and thought about preston as she did most days shed been so young when they met barely eighteen and he looked so dashing in his air force uniform when he came into her pops convenience store the fifth day in a row he came in he ran out of things he needed to buy and he had no ready excuse he was here to see sally life with preston hadnt always been easy but he was always a caring man toward the end he set up the life insurance policy for sally and funded an annuity to make the payments with a little left over preston wanted to make sure their daughter jean was taken care of and he hoped that would be one less worry for sally the money going to jean under the policy always seemed like such a huge sum to sally that was until jeans husband died suddenly leaving her with a mountain of bills and debts she had no idea existed the money that sally had squirreled away after selling the house preston bought in the best year hed had in his plumbing business had been diminished to help jean pay her bills now jean was having to give up most of her inheritance to help her mother sally protested a little but jean insisted and sally knew she was right preston mason would never have hesitatedhed have done whatever it took to help his wife live the best life she could sallys kidney condition was at stage five the end stage and she needed a new organ but there were thousands of people on the waiting list and the state had just decided to stop paying for lung transplants altogether as well as some heart and bone marrow procedures how long would it be before kidney transplants were added to the list sally didnt want to wait to find out she didnt want to spend her last years chained to a machine she wanted her freedom back but it came at a price she needed at least for the operation above and beyond the money shed need to keep her place at castle towers she had some savings and there was a little money jean had promised she could have but she was still tens of thousands of dollars short which was the reason that when the idea of selling her life insurance policy was presented to her she was receptive to it the call from howard essen came at a particularly apposite moment it wasnt a coincidence although sally would have been upset if shed known how it came about howard found potential clients through an informal network of contacts hed established at more than two dozen retirement homes and nursing facilities he paid a mix of orderlies and supers and frontdesk staff to tip him off when a resident told them about certain medical or personal issues like starting dialysis or visiting a heart specialist or not being able to afford to help with their grandchilds college tuition howard found it distasteful but he felt he had little choice these were tough times and he had to find a way to keep his own familys heads above water in this case sally had told a friendly orderly her predicament and he mentioned it unthinkingly to the superintendent who in turn called howard for ten years howard had made a decent living selling starter mortgages to young arizonans when things were going well hed been caught up in the allpervasive hysteria of home ownership everyone was selling mortgages with no supporting documentation so why shouldnt he there was no one who said it was a bad thing after more than six months out of work hed found this job with lifedeals in fact theyd come after him looking for oncesuccessful mortgage salesmen and offering a job paid almost wholly on commission the cheaper howard bought a policy for the better his remuneration it helped him sleep at night when he didnt squeeze that extra percentage point out of the policyholder not that he thought it would have been so easy to get sally mason to capitulate the first time he paid her a visit howard had introduced himself and sally said essen like the city in germany yes maam exactly this was a sharp one he could tell at once howard presented his spiel showing sally the graphs and tables indicating how much money sally would save if she didnt have to make the premiums and how much money she might make if she invested it wisely so if i stop paying into the policy and use the annuity money i can have this much cash when im lets see a hundred and two sally pointed at a very large figure at the outer edge of one of the projections thats right whos to say youre not going to live twenty years with your new kidney and we base our projections on a historically average rate of return on a sensible mixture of investments i can give you the name of a great investment specialist who could help you with that im sure you can howard and what rate of return might you expect as i said using historical averages about eight percent give or take oh howard i wish youd called me thirty years ago if you had i wouldnt be in this position a couple of minutes before the hour sally saw howard pull up in his ford truck and park she waved to him and he walked over hello mrs mason he said good morning howard lets go do some business and howard smiled at her sallys room was small so howard and sally sat in the dining room of the home where she felt more comfortable howard had brought all the paperwork and he laid it out in front of sally for her to sign sally picked up her pen and put it down again you know howard when preston bought this policy he said it was going to set up our daughter for life but instead of that im using it to give me another ten years because i cant trust the state ive lived in all my life to help me anymore im almost out of money my daughters almost out of money theres just my grandson george up there in new york at medical school whos always said he wants to make some money so he can help his mom out he doesnt know anything about this because hes already further in debt than my kidneys going to cost me no ones got any money theyve just got debt howd it get this way howard howard essen looked down at his feet theyd talked a little about howards previous career and the mortgage craziness and about how sallys pop sometimes gave customers a little bit of credit at the store before the end of the week when theyd spent the previous paycheck and how he almost always regretted doing it i swear i dont know mrs mason oh i think we have some idea howard howard watched as sally mason signed the paper that turned over her halfmilliondollar life insurance policy in exchange for just over percent of its value sally had gone quiet and didnt say much to howard after the transaction was completed howard would come by in a few days with a cashiers check and sallys copy of the agreement when he finished up and said his goodbye and left howard felt like going back home and taking another shower sally decided shed wait a couple of hours and call her grandson george and leave a message she wanted to make sure things were still going well for him in new york greenwich connecticut march am edmund mathews was sitting at his kitchen island with a cup of coffee when the house phone rang edmund picked it up in the middle of the first ring it was russell sorry if i woke you god no ive been up for hours you hear anything henry green emailed me a couple of minutes ago his team has put together some numbers and they want to show us at nine this morning whats the earliest i can pick you up you can pick me up now what did he say about the numbers did you call him no his message said not to call just come by so we have no idea what they came up with great well just swing by whenever you can im ready when you are edmund hung up the phone nothing hed thought about since the meeting at statistical solutions the previous afternoon had offered edmund much solace he wasnt a numberscruncher like russell but he understood how heavily they were exposed by the insurance policies theyd purchased from diabetics these people had looked like such a solid foundation for their business a widespread and chronic condition with severe complications and a lot of lowerincome policyholders hed seen more than a few emails from salesmen saying theyd reached someone whose policy was in arrears just as they were about to lose it these were the perfect candidates people happy to settle for ten cents on the dollar for something that to them was worth nothing edmund wasnt a man who spent a lot of time in regret or recrimination if something was broken you fixed it the key was you had to get ahead of the problem before it got serious edmunds favorite historical character predictably enough was general george s patton edmund appreciated such a man of action if patton had been allowed to reach berlin first in and then been allowed to keep going to moscow how different would things have turned out in the world such great men of history were always thwarted by the weak and the smallminded edmund hated nothing more than feeling powerless which was where the events of the previous day had left him gloria croft had fired the first shot and then henry green provided the coup de grace edmund felt completely blindsided he hadnt seen it coming and neither had russell russell was supposed to be the details guy who knew people who knew what was going on the one who had his ear to the ground edmund had said as much on the long car ride home from statistical solutions the previous evening gloria would have been gratified at how long they spent stuck in traffic by the time he got home edmund was done sniping at russell and a dark cloud had made its way across his face and stationed itself there alice spent another evening staying out of her husbands way and again edmund had few words for their son with his scotch bottle as a companion edmund had taken up sorcery he was trying to bore his way into henry greens simulation software willing it to come up with some way of limiting the damage that was being threatened to lifedeals future short of relying on magic he was certain there was something he could do he had to get himself and his company to berlin columbia university medical center new york city march am the call early the previous evening from his grandmother sally had jolted george back to a place nearer his usual moorings one day before that he had found pia in the hospital cafeteria with will mckinley lesley wong had been there too but george had fixated on the fact that will mckinley had worked his way to pias side for a months elective although george considered himself reasonably facile with women in that he got along with most will was a more practiced seducer with fewer scruples george wouldnt have imagined pia would be interested in a guy like will but what did he know jealousy was a cruel emotion and while the four of them had sat together hed suffered through believing will was reveling at the scale of georges discomfort will had never made any secret of just how attractive he found pia more than once hed asked george what he thought pia saw in him george secretly enjoyed wills rude question because it implied that he as well as others saw him and pia as some kind of couple george knew his grandmother well enough to know she would disapprove of pia or rather she would find his continued interest in her to be unhealthy for him with all that he had on the line george wondered for the thousandth time what he was doing continuing his pursuit of pias affections it wasnt so much the time that it took up though it took up enough it was the amount of emotional energy he expended on her dissecting her words and actions thinking of strategies to win her affections worrying about her wellbeing he needed to conserve that energy for his studies more than anything he wanted to be the best doctor he could be george knew how much his family was pulling for him to succeed they had suffered so many reverses and it seemed like they were sliding down a oneway slope like so many middleclass families if he didnt make it he knew his mother and grandmother might put a brave face on it but be devastated inside george also knew his mother jean had money issues shed moved into a much smaller house in the same baltimore neighborhood a few years before and still didnt seem to have any extra cash jean had had the misfortune or lack of foresight to work in decaying industries after georges father died she had been a bookkeeper at the bethlehem steel works at sparrows point for a while then she found and lost a job at the general motors plant she always said she was fine when he asked about her finances and refused to let him look at her bank statements although george was on a full scholarship she never failed to send him a twentydollar bill whenever she could youre a student george she told him you concentrate on your education when sally had called it was five oclock in the east and she didnt expect george to pick up his cell phone her intention was to leave him an encouraging message without taking up any of his precious time she had an exaggerated sense of how busy george was every minute busy day not too bad theyre not killing us just yet actually it was a good time for you to call since im on a break im taking a radiology elective and they dont work themselves to death like some other specialties how is your day going oh you know its pretty quiet around here these days have you spoken to your mother recently not lately whats up something interesting did happen yesterday i sold your grandfathers life insurance policy to a very nice gentleman ill be paid in a few days how are you doing moneywise are you okay i could send you some im doing fine george said even though he was constantly short of cash he couldnt wait for july when hed start his residency instead of money going out hed be getting a salary it wasnt going to be great but anything was better than it was at the moment even with his scholarship hed assumed a sizable debt if you need any money let me know i will george said although he had no intention of asking his grandmother for money ive never heard of someone selling a life insurance policy is that common mr howard essen the man who bought it said its very common oh george said simply he told himself hed try to remember to investigate online such a scenario when he got back to his room at that point hed switched the conversation with his grandmother back to her health which he knew was not good as she was being kept alive by kidney dialysis later when george had looked up life settlements and read about the issue he wasnt happy it seemed to him that it was one more way that the elderly could be victimized this time by the financial world he couldnt help but worry that his ailing grandmother had been taken advantage of and such a thought had helped rearrange his priorities grabbing his jacket from the closet george headed down to the elevators once there he briefly thought about pia and wondered if he should go up to her room to make sure she was awake but he hit the down button hell if she was going to be spending the day with will she could get herself up instead he decided to grab a coffee rewarding himself with a more leisurely entry into the day than usual statistical solutions llc chelsea new york city march am as was his habit edmund made sure he and russell were fashionably late for their meeting at statistical solutions headquarters they were greeted coolly by henry green and hustled directly into the same conference room as the previous day the mood was somber if not funereal the room was occupied by a halfdozen people including the slacker tom dressed in a plaid shirt wrinkled lowriding bermuda shorts and flipflops isabel was not to be seen two of the other people in the rooma young man and a womanwere dressed in a similar casual vein as tom two additional men who were a couple of years older wore dress shirts without jackets pleated pants and striped ties their haircuts were neat conservative the final man was dressed in a full dark suit and had an ostrich briefcase at his side henry green spoke first in front of him were several copies of what looked like a bound report thank you gentlemen for coming in today as i mentioned yesterday statistical solutions llc has decided to exercise its option to terminate its consultancy agreement with lifedeals incorporated as of close of business today march third in doing so we are acting without prejudice and we adhere to the articles of our initial agreement yes yes blah blah blah edmund said interrupting henry rudely we get it henry youre reading us the legal fine print so we think twice about suing you for incompetence if our information is useless dont blame us now lets play a game hands up who in this rooms a lawyer you edmund asked pointing quickly at tom tom stared back at edmund and didnt flinch dont think so edmund commented with a snicker how about you two edmund gestured toward the two men dressed in shirts and ties wrong again looks to me like a couple of accountants mr mathews i am trying to do this as painlessly and professionally as i can yes i have asked our legal representation to join us as you have so astutely observed hes calling me mr mathews now edmund said swinging around to address russell hes definitely been talking to his lawyers okay edmund thats enough russell mumbled he was tired of making excuses for edmund when he blew up in public like this it was like traveling around town with a rebellious and obnoxious teenager in fact russell and edmund had discussed whether they should bring their own lawyer to the meeting russell contended that if each side lawyered up it was more than likely that the meeting would be aborted before it began one lawyer would speak the other would object and lifedeals and statistical solutions would be advised to leave the matter to their legal representation what russell had not anticipated was that edmund saw red the moment he spotted statistical solutions legal counsel who stood out from the others like a sore thumb on edge from everything that was going on edmund took the mans presence as a personal affront if i may make a suggestion russell said we came here this morning for the report that you promised lets deal with the legal issues of our relationship after the fact okay russell thank you henry said glancing at edmund who appeared reasonably composed well you wont look so composed in five minutes henry thought well proceed with our presentation theres a copy of our termination letter in the packets well give you at the end of the meeting as well as a completely nonprejudicial note from our legal department reiterating the reasonable scope of our services which is what i was trying to do a few minutes ago but i appreciate youre eager to hear the results i want to assure you that we had our best people working on this isabel lee whom you met and who is unable to join us today put in a solid shift on this so did tom graham who graduated two years ago from mit edmund rolled his fists one over the other like an umpire indicating for play to proceed he wanted the facts not the support behind the facts and the longer it took getting the information implied that it wasnt going to be to their liking and paul who had more than five years experience at the department of defense edmund drummed his fingers on the desk okay the work we did last nightall night in factwas to estimate how a shift to the right of the bell curves we previously created on the timing of the redemption of the life insurance policies lifedeals holds would affect cash flow well have the formal report in a day or two but we can give you a preliminary one today i have to say we were surprised henry paused and took a sip from a glass of water we were surprised how quickly even the slightest shift of the bell curves would affect the companys financial situation it would create a period of time in which the payment of premiums would need to be continued to maintain policy values with limited income this effect is predicted because of the steepness of the bell curves slopes as we know once the policies start to be cashed out by lifedeals income can be expected to rise very rapidly which is why we had strongly recommended that you maximize your purchase of life settlement policies in relation to capitalization everyone clear on this russell nodded vigorously there was nothing new here okay good next we looked at the lifespan statistics of individuals lucky enough under current procurement and distribution protocols to get a new organ be it a lung a heart a liver a kidney or a pancreas depending on which degenerative disease is involved we found that getting an organ alters these peoples life expectancies to a marked degree understand that we already factored in standard organ replacement rates in the preliminary data that we all approved and it was at that time a small variable but the new circumstances the potential new circumstances i should say caused us to drill down into those statistics further and find different research that previously wasnt relevant henry paused again to take a drink edmund was fit to burst there are newer statistics which show how well new organs work for patients over a long period the older figures implied that organ recipients still had the propensity whatever it was to affect the new organ and often adversely but to a greater extent than we initially would have expected new organs or at least a large percentage of them do very well over many years provided its a good match of course newer antirejection drugs have helped as well in many or most cases ten to fifteen years of life expectancy can be added to patients lives in lay terms it appears that you can put a new radiator in a beatup car engine and it doesnt matter so much how you drive the radiators going to hold up we applied these newly developed statistics to the bell curves of lifedeals policyholders and theres no way around itthe implications are pretty catastrophic for cash flow if a percentage of policyholders get new organs the higher the percentage of course the more catastrophic the effect what percentage edmund barked well the problem seems to be that the cash flow issue starts almost immediately with just a small shift to the right just a few percentage points what do you mean by a few five ten er fives not good ten would be as i said catastrophic so wed need five to ten percent of diabetics to get a new pancreas said edmund what are the chances of that happening there was silence these are not rich people they wont be able to afford it its fucking pie in the sky not necessarily tom graham said speaking up for the first time his voice surprisingly deep what you said about people not being able to afford it look at the statistics there might well be thirtyfive million people with diabetes in this country it costs something like a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year to treat them you think insurance companies wont want to jump on this opportunity how about state programs that have to carry the cost of these people for decades not to mention medicare medicaid even farright politicians are going to find a way around their qualms about stem cells because who wont want to help get twenty thirty million americans healthy its a magic bullet if it works it cures people and once the organ is accepted it costs nothing pancreas doesnt work well grow you a new one and youre welcome people have been searching for decades for a way to reduce healthcare costs regenerative medicine is going to be the answer this was worse than edmund had dared think he was a salesman he knew that even if not every diabetic got a new pancreas the idea of buying diabetics life insurance policies in a climate in which people could receive a new organ was suddenly looking very outdated like investing in steam engines after the model t ford was produced this is all laid out in the final report russell asked it will be henry said its summarized in the report well be giving you today of course this is all confidential of course but its all dependent upon the date induced stem cell organs will be available edmund said its not happening next week at least i assume it isnt what is ittwo years five years have you looked into that perhaps ginny here might speak a few words in that regard henry said sitting next to tom graham a tall woman with long black hair nodded to henry she shared toms fashion sense and was wearing a tshirt with a bright image of a robot on the front i read the journals i could find online and tried to figure out some kind of timeline but the articles in this arena arent very speculative its a new technology so there are no statistics to predict such a big leap in something like regenerative medicine ginny said ginny proceeded to talk about the rapid developments already accomplished for stem cell maturation into specific cell lines by researchers around the world the next step would be to turn these cells into organs or organlike apparatuses by a process called organogenesis this work is going on in russia in china in germany but its having the most success at columbia university with doctors rothman and yamamoto rumor has it that these two researchers have already formed whole organs which have been transplanted back into the mice that donated the cells from which the organs were formed supposedly in the next month or so theres going to be an article in nature about it with all the supporting data apparently they have had such success that theyve already requested clearance from the fda to do it on a human theyre waiting for fda clearance for the next step said ginny and when might that happen asked edmund i did talk to one scientist friend last night ginny said he told me no one knows but the best guess is in the next couple of months as far as the business angle on this the numbers strongly suggest that partial remedy would be provided in circumstances like this if the party holding the policies were to raise capital immediately as a hedge against this newly raised eventuality henry was taking over in the hope of wrapping up the meeting edmunds fuse was getting shorter by the minute he could tell henry was now practically reading verbatim from a script we already ran revenue models for you based on the idea of securitizing tranches of life insurance policies and while its difficult to build into the models the prospect of degraded assets in the final report there will be a recommendation that the securitization proceed immediately and that a significant portion of the funds obtained be set aside to satisfy premiums on those policies that will have to be carried longer than expected as far as additional life settlements it would make sense to buy only those life settlements involving individuals with clearly terminal illnesses like metastatic cancer als things like that the list was a lot longer but henrys distaste had finally got the better of him edmund thought that all this meeting had done was to confirm what gloria croft had told them less than twentyfour hours earlier it figured gloria was one of the best analysts he ever had and she knew about this before he did edmund was confounded by the fact that his great moneymaking scheme could be jeopardized by two geeks hed never heard of let me ask you a question he growled at ginny you find this research and you find a scientist to call in the evening who says the fda is going to greenlight this project that could revolutionize medicine or whatever so why am i not reading about this in the new york times because researchers and their universities have become much more sophisticated about patent issues there used to be a rush to print because they yearned for the notoriety but theyre much smarter now there are fortunes to be made in biotech and this area of organogenesis might be the biggest yet it will probably overshadow every other technological milestone in the history of medicine believe me when the rothman work hits nature its going to be all over the new york times the wall street journal and every other media outlet edmund and russell rode the elevator in silence it was the same car that edmund had assaulted the day before hed taken a prescription painkiller from his cache so he was feeling only a dull throb in his left hand he looked closely and thought he could make out a slight indentation in the metal elevator door the trouble was he felt like doing it again only when they reached the street away from any prying ears did they speak what do you think russell said i think we paid those idiots too much money and we will sue them they met their car in front of the building and got in edmund thought for a moment his mind was racing okay heres what were gonna do today no more diabetics obviously tell the sales force even if theyre hooked on the line even if theyre in the boat and you have the billy club in your hand put em back in the water any contracts in the workscancel checks being cutcancel have someone go back and look at contracts of people who have diabetes and something else we like the something else now get the lawyer to draft a letter in his best incomprehensible legalese to say were no longer interested in diabetes and send it to these people scrub those people out of the stats they never had diabetes and we need new policies target smokers i know theyre the worst because none of them thinks theyre going to get sick and when they do they die too fast find out if we can target smokers or exsmokers with policies whove missed a couple payments theyre all lying anyway and offer them twentyfive percent but the model said russell fuck the model roared edmund dont you understand as of today there is no model we dont have a business if this shit goes down never mind a model jesus these are bandaids im talking about and weve got a head wound potentially russell said right yes theres a chance this research may not get anywhere but still were up to our necks in this either way gloria croft is already shorting us and she wont be shy talking about it we have to do something its not like we can sell our stock and walk away perhaps we should go and see jerry trotter russell said after an awkward pause yeah i was thinking the same thing said edmund dr jerred l trotter an old friend of both russell and edmund ran a very successful hedge fund trotter was a man who enjoyed outthinking people which meant he wasnt above a certain amount of sharp practice if he was confident he could get away with it there were so many areas where the regulatory authorities were lax or there just werent any regulations it was by using trotters good offices and through a number of disguises of trotters creation that edmund had purchased credit default swaps on his own company while continuing to sell subprime bonds to his corporate clients it was just the kind of caper that trotter relished especially when his cut was so generous edmund had sounded trotter out very early in the planning stage of lifedeals he sent russell over on what looked like a factfinding mission did jerry think a model like this might work did jerry think these were good assets to spin off bonds from did jerry think enough investors would want to buy such a product russell never mentioned that they were seeking investors three days later jerry had called practically biting edmunds arm off over the phone hed run the numbers and he wanted in edmund after pretending to think about it pretended to reluctantly allow jerry to invest million of his own money and more of his funds trotter would definitely want to hear about these new market conditions he wouldnt be pleased to put it mildly but he was always a man of action and hed think of something the driver had been awaiting instructions as the two men sat in the back of the car now edmund gave the driver an address and they set off terrasini restaurant midtown manhattan march pm there was no way we could meet you guys today no way and then russell said the magic word terrasini everyone laughed even edmund who was making an effort to calm down dr jerred l trotter former plastic surgeon current hedge fund maven and lifedeals angel investor was holding court alongside his longtime number two maxwell higgins there was always a table at terrasini for trotter and the four menhiggins trotter mathews and lefevrewere nestled at a table in a corner of the restaurants front room i thought it couldnt hurt russell said attempting to sound breezy edmund and russell were glad trotter could see them at short notice even if it had meant killing a couple of hours until lunchtime you know its my favorite place to eat unless im picking up the tab right edmund theres no danger of that jerry edmund said everyone knows its against your religion to pay for lunch trotter guffawed damn straight he said loudly and waved expansively toward no one in particular and a waiter quickly came over that glass of barolo make it a bottle i trust thats okay gentlemen second thought bring the glasses and then the bottle in a few minutes i need a real drink after the morning i had edmund looked on suppressed irritation sticking in his craw that little sideshow just set him back at least a couple hundred bucks but scenes like this were part of the cost of doing business with jerry trotter no serious problems i hope jerry edmund said everythings a fucking problem jerry said in his usual penetrating voice a man in a cucinelli sweater whod brought his family to lunch turned around and shot jerry a look whoops apologies forgot where i was jerry said to the man i thought we should meet in the office edmund said you know easier to speak freely jerry trotter like a lot of financiers swore like a stevedore edmund didnt care about that but he wanted to discuss lifedeals predicament without having to hold back in front of the other diners got to eat edmund trotter said picking up the menu of course jerry edmund thought that jerry trotter probably knew the menu better than the restaurants own waitstaff everyone insisted on playing these childish games thought edmund aware that once more he was the one being toyed with edmund studied trotters face he knew the man was at least sixty but he looked closer to fortyfive with his sweep of gunmetal hair a few trace laugh lines and bright blue eyes still a shade of azure that caused more than a few people to take a breath when they saw them if hed had any cosmetic work done it was very good max what was that special again the waiter was handing out the glasses of barolo the pasta higgins questioned with his uppercrust london accent orecchiette with sweet sausage broccolini touch of ricotta sounds marvelous ah gives me a hardon just to think about it of course times four what do you say guys cold day calls for some soup i think the other special squash soup little bit of cream am i right max all around sir if you dont mind the waiter agreed it was a great selection edmund made a point of looking at his menu a couple of beats longer then folded it and handed it over he was too upset to protest now trotter was swirling the red wine around in his glass it was a lovely ruby color and on another occasion edmund would have been rhapsodizing about it in the often flamboyant world of hedge fund management jerry trotter was something of a celebrity hed already enjoyed one very successful career as a plastic surgeon catering mostly to the moneyed ladies of new yorks upper east side for whom he performed face eye and buttock lifts in truth trotter was a better showman than he was a surgeon he knew like everyone in the medical profession that during medical training grades counted more than the need to display particularly good physical skills in obtaining training positions in such surgical specialties as the eye or brain or in plastic surgery trotter had made sure he always got good grades to make up for his handeye coordination which was poor enough for him to find surgery a taxing grind but that was in the past and he didnt need good handeye coordination to manage money trotter had always enjoyed looking after his own money and taking the odd risk here and there after years of working six days a week at his practice he had a lot of it to manage trotter had known max higgins for years and well enough to know he was keen to strike out on his own from his trading position at goldman trotter made a proposition to higgins well set up a fund you run it and teach me what you know and ill supply the money it worked and trotter quickly found that his patients trusted him and were grateful and many were happy to let him invest for them trotter was a quick study and soon his fund the immodestly and unimaginatively named trotter holdings was heading toward the middle rank of name funds so edmund russell what was so urgent that we had to meet today russell looked over at edmund before he started the delay in trotter being able to meet with them had at least allowed edmund and russell to decide how they were going to present their news to trotter theyd sat in a diner on lexington avenue for an hour and strategized we have a potential public relations issue we want to give you a headsup about we thought you might be able to help us get out ahead of the possible publicitynip it in the bud so to speak edmund has your checkered past finally caught up with you jerry asked not sounding as though he was joking at all weve heard about some medical research thats taking place russell continued to spare edmund from having to respond its at an experimental stage with no guarantee its going to work or anything but in some quarters its being taken more seriously than in others how does that affect lifedeals asked jerry who glanced between edmund and russell even though it was russell who was speaking all the joviality had left his voice the two waiters brought over the soup and left it quietly detecting the tension at the table it may not mean anything russell added as i said we want to get ahead of any potential bad publicity jerry trotter picked up his spoon and tasted a mouthful of soup it was delicious of course but when he sensed he was about to hear something unpleasant his appetite faltered russell youre going to have to tell me a little more clearly whats going on okay jerry sure there are a couple of researchers at columbia who think they can grow artificial organs using human stem cells that they make from a patients own cells obviously i dont know the details but the process is called organogenesis its supposed to start what will be called regenerative medicine if they can grow new pancreases for example they can help people with diabetes live longer but at this point its a huge if i read something about that idea in some research we did on our due diligence for lifedeals but it sounded like science fiction jerry said apparently not anymore the future is now as they say or it might be russell said how many people know about this max higgins asked not many russell said outside columbia and the stem cell field very few is my guess how did you hear about it there was a pause this was where it was going to get a lot trickier gloria croft told us edmund said max higgins quickly figured out the implications and way ahead of trotter asked russell the main question is she taking any action yes and knowing gloria shes shorting lifedeals am i right yes hold on hold on wait a second jerry said lifedeals is being shorted because of some work being done in a lab at columbia im afraid so jerry higgins went on am i to assume that some numbers have been run looking at cash projections based on a potential breakthrough in diabetes treatment and that the projections dont look so good is he right trotter asked higgins had got right to the heart of the matter in seconds broadly but look so he is trotter questioned as i said its early in the would you mind telling me how this this fucking disaster is what you would describe as a public relations issue jerry was hissing using his soup spoon to point first at edmund then at russell the table was silent until max higgins spoke up again the science may fail eventually but with gloria croft taking a position investors are going to be alarmed when they find out then it becomes as much about gloria as about the science shes a barometer so from that perspective theyre right jerry its a pr problem first and if the science succeeds jerry said then we have a bigger problem said edmund jerry put down his soup spoon and took a large drag on his aglass barolo you guys didnt see this coming obviously not edmund said its a onceinacentury breakthrough if it happens you cant do projections for being hit by an asteroid no one was eating now the waiter coming by for a second time asked if anyone was still working on their soup and no one was yes the soup was fine but everyone was preoccupied the uneaten soup disappeared at jerrys insistence russell walked him through what they knew of the research he made a point of saying that there was no guarantee it would succeed the odds had to be that it wouldnt because in the vast majority of research projects there was always some major unanticipated obstacle that would arise to thwart the hopedfor result so what are the chances it will succeed trotter questioned edmund said there was no way to know he then had russell talk about the effects such an eventuality would have on lifedeals cash flow as edmund and russell had agreed before meeting with trotter russell erred on the conservative side whats our position visavis the public offering jerry directed his question at max his partner he didnt care that he might offend his lunch hosts the lockup period expires may thirtyfirst max said when an investor takes part in an initial public offering they cant sell their shares for a certain amount of time in this case days trotter holdings was halfway through the mandated blackout period meaning that jerry trotter and his fund were stuck with his shares for another three months shit what are the chances of gloria croft keeping her mouth shut for three months listen jerry life insurance is still a twentysixtrilliondollar business edmund said theres plenty of money to be made these diabetes policies are basically a drop in the bucket its not a question of dumping lifedeals shares its a problem that needs a solution thats why we came to you youre the man who deals with problems everyone knows that edmund was being purposefully flattering and trotter wasnt unhappy about it its true he was a guy who could solve a problem but this was a big problem and a new problem gloria croft is so full of it you wouldnt believe edmund continued she was carrying on telling us that our life settlement bonds were a bad product blah blah blah she even told us that we should have been prosecuted over subprime she is one sanctimonious bitch i know that for sure jerry agreed she was enjoying telling us about the research twisting the knife the pasta was set at each mans place there was slightly less tension around the table nowthe problem had been identified there was a common enemy and the four of them were on the same side soup could be resisted but the pasta was a different proposition and each of the four men ate of course there is a medical angle here jerry that we think you can help us with and statistical solutions is drawing up projections of the effect on revenue if we have to pull the diabetics policies were going to need more capital we can see if we can fill in these capital shortfalls with different initiatives weve already directed our sales teams to go back and beat the bushes for metastatic cancer patients with big policies it costs more money to buy those policies but its completely riskfree more money how so higgins said weve authorized the salesmen to offer more than the standard fifteen percent metastatic cancer patients are not going to cause us any problem about dying on time its just that we have to be more aggressive to find them okay edmund im hearing you needless to say max and i will have to put our heads together and talk about this research issue we want to see that statistical solutions data as soon as you have it of course and we have a bunch of meetings this afternoon so im sorry but we have to eat and run jerry downed another forkful of his lunch and chased it with the remnants of his third glass of wine the leavetakings were quick and less effusive than the greetings had been when the four men met trotter and higgins left edmund and russell behind picked up their coats and got into their waiting town car on fiftyfourth street so trotter asked when he was settled in his seat they were heading south on park avenue gloria croft higgins said shes a pit bull i sense theres history there with edmundperhaps its more about that than about the product maybe its both shes found a flaw in the model and it just happens to be edmund mathews so its a bonus be that as it may we have to do something jerry said and we cant leave it to those two theyre floundering you can tell theres too much time till we can sell the stock i agree but edmund has a point its still a good business even if there is a bump in the road with the current model it will just take some juggling and deep breaths on our part its not a time to panic besides since we cant sell the lifedeals stock we cant panic even if we wanted to i also agree that in an ideal world he should have seen this coming but our due diligence didnt pick it up either its a function of the times technologys changing too fast just like markets are changing too fast its getting harder and harder to factor this kind of thing in well i think we need to do some of our own research a little more streetlevel we cant rely on edmund et al for that clearly lets get an investigator up to columbia sniff around a little and someone can do some digging on gloria croft a woman like that doesnt get where she is without pissing a lot of people off and maybe cutting some corners we need to get some angles to work with get some leverage okay ill get right on it this is a new one on meshorting stocks because of a medical breakthrough its new allround we may have to get creative trotter said watching the park avenue traffic move slowly in a steady afternoon drizzle jerry trotter knew how to make an entrance into a room and he also knew how to make an exit edmund didnt know what to make of what had just happened sure jerry was royally pissed when he first heard about the problem but he seemed calmer when he left the problem was that the departure had been so sudden what do you think edmund asked russell they had ordered cappuccinos for me higgins is the brains of that operation he sees the bigger picture said russell it didnt take him long to zero in on the heart of the problem they definitely got the message do you think theyll come up with some suggestions edmund asked i do russell said i think it was right to tell them early in the game it feels good to have jerry trotter and his team working on this with us i just hope they get back to us soon my guess is that he will edmund said jerry isnt the kind of guy whos going to watch while his sixty million dollars turns into pocket change but i do have one reservation whats that i never can be a hundred percent confident jerrys working with us columbia university medical center new york city march pm pia glanced up from her reading to see that it was almost sixthirty and she wondered how long she was going to have to wait she was sitting in the deserted lab outside her office which continued to be offlimits she was waiting for rothman who was still in the biosafety unit trying to finish up the data for the lancet article yamamoto had told her to wait because rothman wanted to speak with her what about she had no idea whatever it was it made her feel uneasy the day had been interesting in some regards although it had not been one of her best she had spent the morning doing the lab equivalent of kp duty washing and rewashing glassware for the second day in a row pia had been actually late not just late by the secretary marsha langmans standards for the second day in a row george had failed to appear at her door and she wondered why it irked her to a degree because shed come to count on it even though she was the first to agree that he wasnt obliged to come and wake her shed slept badly again as shed been doing for a week or more as per usual it was nightmares involving childhood memories shed battled to suppress and which surprised her in their lucidity even after years they still possessed ample power to shock and disturb her the head technician arthur spaulding had seemed amused by pias punishment he had made a point of detouring when in the lab to pass by pia saying nothing he didnt have to his smirk was enough spaulding had been at the research center for years and he liked things done just so hed started working for rothman only in the last eighteen months and spaulding got on with him about as well as his predecessor had before he was fired spaulding seemed to take exception to any irregular request from rothman and rothman being rothman most of his requests were irregular do you need something mr spaulding pia said finally on about his fifth pass you seem to go out of your way to come over here spaulding said nothing and left as yamamoto had suddenly appeared and come over miss grazdani we would like to see you in the organ bath lab dr yamamoto hadnt directly said anything about pia being late and he didnt need to pia had gotten the message she suited up quickly and went in the lab to join lesley and will who had been in there all morning they were standing in a side room with rothman who was holding a thick paperback book in one hand and pressing impatiently at the display of a newly installed machine that looked like a large inkjet printer dr yamamoto it appears we have bought a lemon rothman said will gestured down to the power strip in the wall and yamamoto bent down and flicked on the surge protector the machine wheezed and babbled into life anyone know what this piece of machinery is rothman said not missing a beat and bending forward to stare into the innards of the device as she moved closer pia could see how intricate the engineering on the device was with tracking bars and a large array like the inkjet of a printer pia opened her mouth but lesley beat her to it an organ printer she had seen the cover of the book rothman was holding yes for threed bioprinting we have an older machine but this one is new someone from the manufacturer is coming tomorrow to show us how to use it perhaps we should wait till then to turn it on doctor yamamoto said no harm in warming it up mr mckinley what do you know about threed bioprinting i think it works like a regular printer spraying living cells onto a sheet of a sheet of something it goes back and forth building up the layers into a threedimensional structure the cells can often organize themselves to function collectively so far it has applications making skin and cartilage indeed you can print a spinal disk which i may need to try by tomorrow said rothman straightening up and rubbing the small of his back were all going to get up to speed on this machine together as this engineering matures it might be quicker than growing organs at this stage im thinking of using it to fix defects in the organs that were growing but who knows the value of this technology is that an organ would be fashioned as the mirror image of the patients by using data from mri studies as is often the case with organogenesis the hardest part is not in replicating the function of the organ or gland but in connecting it to the rest of the bodyveins arteries ducts and so on have to be oriented appropriately to make the surgery feasible rothman had found a switch and he toggled it on and off he then reopened the instruction book and immediately became engrossed yamamoto ushered the students away will looked back at rothman i hope that things still working when the guy comes tomorrow the students spent the rest of the day monitoring the organ baths theyd found that some did experience small changes in temperature or ph spontaneously and the three talked with yamamoto about designing an alarm system even for those minor fluctuations it seemed to them that even such small changes might impact the results it was real science demanding and exciting for each student will and lesley worked closely keeping a respectful distance from pia who was in her own world after dr yamamoto dismissed the students for the day he asked pia to stay behind for a moment dr rothman would like to speak with you later after were done in the levelthree lab i hope you dont mind of course not pia had said what else was she going to say one central park west new york city march pm jerry trotter and max higgins left edmund mathews and russell lefevre with a souvenir of their lunch together at terrasini it was a healthy check and as edmund paid up he hoped that jerry and max were going to do something to justify it he was reasonably confident as he knew them to be guys who did not sit on a problem they were known to do whatever it took and jerry and max did not disappoint within an hour of leaving the restaurant trotter and higgins had two of their best investigative guys working on the two separate cases one on the columbia regenerative organ situation the other on the hopedfor dirty little secrets of gloria croft in hopes of having something to control her with jerry knew that everyone especially wall street people had their secrets the pis were also given edmunds and russells full names so they could google them for background information jerry couldnt use his very best guy who was in fact a woman named jillian jones because she was already involved in looking at a company that higgins thought might be tanking its results to pave the way for a takeover but as pis tim brubaker and harry hooper were separated from jones only by a sliver theyd do a thorough job and they were very quick this was the first time jerry ever had three pis on his payroll at once strictly speaking jones brubaker and hooper werent on the trotter holdings payroll at all each was employed off the books in a strictly cashonly arrangement there was no paperworkno pay stubs or invoices or receipts the latter because trotter trusted the three not to pad expenses the pis undertook enough onthebooks domestic surveillance cases to report to the irs to show sufficient income to justify their lifestyles they were usually able to piggyback a cash job for someone like jerry trotter on one that was recorded by the business accountant jerry trotter loved this semilegal clandestine work because it was so far removed from anything hed done as a plastic surgeon or a money manager he loved everything about it and even saying brubaker and hooper gave him a little thrill to his mind they were perfect pi names for him it was like being in his own movie brubaker and hooper were excops and had seen everything jillian jones had seen everything too but no one knew what work she had done prior to this and no one dared ask in contrast to most pis she always acted anxious and quick to take offense she also had a black belt in karate and was always armed as usual higgins took care of all the practical arrangements he bought three useandlose cell phones and used one to place a prearranged marketing cold call to hooper and brubakers offices the call purported to be from a firm interested in talking to the business manager about the companys metered postage this identified the source of the call the first digit of the callback number times one hundred was the rate being offered the last four specified a time for a meet at the usual location brubaker and hooper had a habit of checking their messages regularly and both picked up higginss call within a halfhour the promise of a anhour rate drew them to the four oclock meeting place in a back booth at flanagans bar on second avenue it took higgins five minutes to give them their marching orders a cell phone for each to call in on and a down payment on their work another aspect of the game that trotter relished was asking his guys how theyd found whatever information they dug up at first neither brubaker nor hooper wanted to talk about their mos but theyd come to indulge trotters whims he did sign the checks after all when the phone rang at eightthirty trotter was fixing his second glenlivet in his apartment near the summit of the trump international on the corner of central park west and columbus circle trotter lived so high up he didnt bother with drapes in the living roomhe didnt want anything to interfere with his view of central park tonight banks of low clouds and rain were all he could see he was pleased to see it was brubaker the number on his led was the cell phone higgins had given him its b brubaker said it was the code name trotter insisted on his using so soon trotter could barely conceal the childish excitement in his voice yes i got to speak directly with the laboratorys secretary by posing as a journalist couldnt shut her up thought she was doing her boss a favor talking him up thinks hes shy and needs the pub she even said as much so she was informative very dont understand half the stuff she was saying but she was knowledgeable im transcribing the tape myself word for word i dont want any transcription service looking at this stuff of course very prudent so give me the headlines okay the two names you mentioned to me are the guys for sure rothman and yamamoto trotter said talking over brubaker shit whats the point of the code words and all the cloakanddagger you insist on if you dont follow it yourself yes those are the guys the first one is the big cheese sorry trotter said inwardly cursing himself okay so she tells me all this stuff that theyre doing and im supposed to be a science reporter and able to follow it so i asked her at the end for the cliff notes version that i can use for the readers what paper does she think this is going in no paper i told her i was doing the research to see if there was a story and if there was id sell it and call her again what if she calls you she doesnt have my number i told her this was very hushhush on my end and i asked her not to tell anyone wed spoken because this is such a big story that other reporters are going to be on it soon and i want to get a jump on it im actually thinking of writing it up for reali wasnt lying to her this is going to be way big jerrys joy at playing dick tracy evaporated what do you mean big well according to her these guys are close commercially to growing organs outside the body organs that will be perfect matches for the person who needs them the trials have worked with animal subjects and they want to move on to using human stem cells when she did get a little cagey there not because she wouldnt tell mei think she didnt know and didnt want to let on that she didnt know but its months that they will be moving to human cells maybe even weeks and certainly not years weeks or months the difference is important well i guess i need to make a few more calls but its happening and soon hes working on something else too something about growing salmonella strains that cause typhoid fever on the space shuttle can you imagine to think where our tax dollars go it makes me sick tell me about it jerry said okay thanks b keep me posted got it boss after hearing from brubaker trotter was impatient to know what kind of progress if any hooper was making although it was technically against protocol trotter called hoopers new cell yes hooper said after one ring he was between calls on the gloria croft assignment and thought it might be one of the contacts he had made calling him back hi its the boss hi boss whats happening any dirt im only three hours in not even whats the setup im a headhunter looking for someone for a major bank ceo job the board wants a woman for appearances sake im asking around about people on my supposed list our friend doesnt need a job she makes seven figuresplus a year said trotter with disappointment he purposely avoided using crofts name i know that they know that but people like showing off how much they know i think someone might tell me just how much she doesnt need a job in a bank or need the scrutiny of running a public company more like it so you want someone to brag about what they know sure everyone does it most everyone and the finance world is like a small competitive club which feeds on gossip okay that was more like it jerry was struck again by how much hooper and brubaker sounded alike they sounded like brooklyn cops which is what they both had once been so you shake anything out of the tree yet just spoke to a guy who knew her at morgan back in the day i said someone mentioned him as a possible reference and he laughed real asshole thinks im a moron having gone to brooklyn college nights i dont like these ivy league types but he has something im sure trying to fuck with me a little hope he doesnt push it cause hes messing with the wrong guy i can get his nice car towed tonight and it aint goin to the pound yes im sure you can thats what keeps me honest in our relationship hooper laughed then added one other thing he mentioned that i might ask one of the bankers higgins mentioned when we talked this afternoon he said if i wanted dirt on our friend to ask him because he thought he had been literally and figuratively fucking her back in their morgan days trotter frowned which one the thick guy with the short hair hooper said now that is interesting trotter said dont call and ask him directly make it part of your investigation it could be interesting got it hooper said as trotter hung up the phone he smiled edmund you rogue columbia university medical center new york city march pm pia waited more than two and a half hours for rothman and yamamoto to finish their work in the bsl lab she spent the time productively reading papers on tissue engineering and organ printing on the internet which is what she would have been doing anyway if shed gone back to the dorm as the time had passed and her empty stomach growled she became progressively concerned it had something to do with her being late two days in a row eventually rothman and yamamoto appeared yamamoto immediately left rothman wordlessly waved for her to join him in his office where he got straight to the point i want to talk to you about the future your future i need to know that you are committed to this work i am truly pia said she was panicked i know i was late this morning you were late two mornings in a row at least according to miss langman im sorry pia stammered her fears were coming to pass it doesnt help to be sorry rothman shot back im concerned about what it implies i will make sure it never happens again pia offered rothman waved her off let me speak while im inclined to do so as you know im not accustomed to talking too much about this kind of nonsense i dont have the time last year i confided in you some information about myself because i had been progressively confident that you were turning out to be the person i thought you could be remember as i told you i played a role in getting you admitted when others on that damn admissions committee where i was forced to serve were reluctant because of your foster care experience since i had the same experience i thought you might have promise of being a researcher ive come to the same conclusion pia blurted dont interrupt rothman snapped last year when i told you those secrets about me that are only known by my wife bless her soul for putting up with me concerning my foster care history and my aspergers i wasnt completely open i said my sons were not as healthy as i would like to be more specific not only are they too on the aspergers spectrum but even worse they have type diabetes having passed on the aspergers was reason enough for guilt and depression the diabetes has put it over the top the main reason ive turned to stem cell work is to see that my boys are cured in my lifetime its a quest that pulled me out of a serious bout of depression depression has been my bete noire im so sorry to hear about your boys pia offered im not telling you this to elicit any sympathy im telling you this so that you understand me better i have never ever agreed to mentor anyone and it is not just because my aspergers puts me at a social disadvantage i feel i dont have the time for other peoples nonsense and this includes phd students as well as medical students you were a first i thought your foster care experience would make you thrive in the lonely pursuit of science and that you should have been given a chance i think youre right pia said i know i struggle with social issues as well pia commitment to research has to be total two days ago you came in here and told me that yes you were going to take me up on my offer to do your phd here in my lab at the same time you told me you were going to do a simultaneous residency in internal medicine and then you expected me to be pleased pia that old myth of the doctor doing both clinical medicine and research at the same time is totally passe it wasnt even true when it was current research is more than a fulltime job for one of the first times in their three and a half years of knowing each other pia and rothman held each others eyes it was a kind of mexican standoff both were conflicted pia had struggled hard and surmounted considerable obstacles in her drive to become a doctor and now she was so close in months she would be getting her md degree the problem was she wouldnt yet be a doctor one that can get a license from the state a resident was on his or her way to becoming a real doctor if she didnt take a residency shed always be a medical student with an md both individuals looked away i realize that im hard to read rothman said breaking a short silence or at least my wife tells me so she advised me to have a conversation with you she knows about me she knows about everything in my life it is the only way we could have survived as a couple im not easy to live with rothman had been rehearsing this speech for days so he was relatively comfortable once he had started talking what i seek in a colleague is commitment a med school graduate knows nothing no offense but if theyre able to pass through medical school it means they have the basic intellectual wherewithal to do research after the initial flash of inspiration that tells you what to look for most of the success in research lies in doggedness in covering every angle tracking down every lead im mixing metaphors but you know what i mean dr yamamoto was in fact a rather mediocre student but he exhibited more application than ten other men who had better grades i can already tell what kind of doctors your colleagues will be ms wong is desperate to help sick people and shell be very good at it mr mckinley will probably end up doing something flashy but unchallenging like surgery and worse yet plastic surgery pia didnt know what to say im pleased you made the right decision about the nuns it shows me that youre orienting yourself in the direction of research but i dont want you to make the same mistakes i made for me doing a residency in internal medicine was a big waste of time rothman paused i think were similar in a number of ways pias eyes opened wide and she flushed and looked down at her feet she didnt share rothmans newfound comfort in discussing such personal matters i need more help here dr yamamoto cant do everything and i cant rely on med students rotating in and out of the lab no offense the two of us are spread thin working on salmonella and organogenesis at the same time but the university is committed to helping us and i hope well be able to add laboratory staff and take over more lab space to ramp up our organogenesis work we need at least another researcher which is why im talking to you about commitment although i usually have no time for excuses tell me why you were late the last couple of days theres no excuse really pia admitted but ive been having trouble sleeping silently she cursed george for her getting accustomed to him waking her up even though she knew it was totally unfair why have you been having trouble sleeping anxiety nightmares about what if i may ask childhood memories ancient history pia i think i need to know more about you youve told me little about yourself even though ive tried to be open with you about me what do you want to know everything pia took a deep breath occasionally in life there is a key crossroads moment that can be identified as such even as its taking place pia understood she couldnt hide or keep quiet the time to talk was now except with her caseworker sheila brown shed never talked about her childhood she took another breath she felt as if the room were closing in on her the only light in the room was a small library light on the desk which put rothmans face in shadowy relief i do remember my mothernot much just little things she was also a pia my first name is actually afrodita but we were both called pia sometimes out of the blue a scent on someone or a gesture will make me think of her but she died when i was little i dont know how and i dont even know how i know she died but i do i lived somewhere in the city with my father burim and his older brother drilon who stayed with us they were albanians real albanians just off the boat very rough around the edges my father was away a lot and i had to spend time with my uncle who was a real creep have you got any water or anything pias throat was dry rothman got out a bottle from a small fridge under the nespresso machine he pushed it and a cup across the desks leather surface he hit me a couple of times my uncle he used to touch me never when my father was around he was very careful he made me touch him inappropriately to say the least he took pictures of me you know and developed them himself and i think he used to sell them to other creeps like him it developed into a side business for him one night i had enough and i went for him what did you do i tried to stab him in the penis with a pair of scissors unfortunately i missed the target it bled a lot i remember later during firstyear anatomy when the professor was talking about the femoral artery and joked about how you should avoid puncture wounds there i suppose thats where i must have stabbed my uncle when he got out of the hospital he beat me up pretty well and i guess someone called nineoneone about a little girl with a bruised face because the police came and grabbed me my uncle and my dad both got arrested so i became the property of new york city child protective services pia took another drink of water and your father he vanished years later i made sheila brown my final and best caseworker tell me what happened she managed to find out that the two of them made bail and disappeared into the city ive no idea where he is if hes even alive i guess i convinced myself that my father wasnt to blame for what his brother did to me when i was in foster care i used to fantasize that he would suddenly appear and rescue me from those places i was in but he never did i gave up hoping after a few of years how old were you when you were taken into care six i was a problem for the foster care people from the getgo my father hadnt officially given up his parental rights so i couldnt be adopted he had to register with child services beforei wasnt in school i guessand genius that he was he said i was a muslim which as an albanian he may have been sheila said he must have thought id get better treatment if i was a minority but it just meant none of the religious agencies wanted me back then the system was dominated by catholic protestant and jewish organizations so instead of having a chance at some reasonably appropriate placement i was put in a kind of temporary group home and a janitor there tried to abuse me like my uncle did but i fought him off i complained about it and i guess that marked me down as a troublemaker i ended up in juvenile court a couple of times i was lucky not to get locked up i suppose but i was designated a person in need of supervisioni love that phrase so the first dump i got sent to was called the wilhelmina shelter for troubled children i got in trouble a lot theyd write me up for not looking the staff in the eye which they interpreted as being insufficiently remorseful that kind of thing pia looked at rothman his face was impassive he nodded almost imperceptibly when i was twelve or so i got shipped to the hudson valley academy for girls in a town called eden falls it sounds nice right eden falls the supposed school was a nineteenthcentury institution they used to send teenage prostitutes there you know to reform them but when i was there it was all the hard cases whod been thrown out of everywhere elsethe girls no one wanted to adopt or deal with appropriately the girls lived in these cottages the paint was peeling the plumbing didnt work roasting in summer freezing in winter that was bearable it was the other girls that were the problem the place was run by these girl gangs that were like crime families well organizeddaddies at the top then housewives cousins uncles and so on theyd take your money make you do their chores beat you up for no reason they came out at night there was a lot of abuseyou know physical stuff sexual stuff sometimes the staff knew but they didnt carethe girls kept much better order than the staff ever could i tried to stay out of the way but they got everyone in the end they found me hiding one night and attacked me in a bathroom she paused anyway i found an old book on boxing in the library and a couple of the younger girls knew some karate so we did a makeshift selfdefense class i was determined every time they came looking for something from me i fought back so i never joined their shadow society as one social worker called it i got into a lot of fights spent quite a lot of days and nights in the little punishment room which was the moniker for solitary confinement i spent a week there once what i did was get the girl who was the leader of the group that attacked me in the bathroom off by herself and gave her one hell of a beating pia worried that she was saying too much but rothman simply nodded again when she looked at him i worked really hard at the lessons that were available at hudson valley academy it was my escape there were some teachers who cared i was determined not to end up pregnant on welfare or in jail like most of the girls did when they left for the most part the staff didnt care what happened or what anybody did as long as we didnt actually kill each other excuse my english but it was like a goddamn garbage dump leave the trash there till its eighteen and had developed a taste for drugs and then release them into the world with no supervision good luck the superintendent there he knew it was the system that created as many problems as it fixed papitano was his name he tried to get better therapists and teachers he even tried to have the place shut down but he was threatened so he stopped trying i knew about that because the superintendent lived in a big mansion on the school grounds and a few of us used to clean his house and make his meals he helped me out by putting me on that detail and getting me the good teachers but he was a real sad sack and abusivei guess his wife had left him and he never saw his kids i was sixteen and i was around his house a lot and he got it into his head that i was interested in him even though i had resisted all his advances one night he got really drunk and i was in the library readingit was the only library in the whole schooland he came down and said he loved me he was really pathetic but he got me in a corner and i dont like being cornered i think he said he got the black eye falling in the shower i think papitano was more embarrassed than mad at me because nothing happened to me except he wanted to get me out of there which was a good thing in retrospect i dont think it was for me but rather so he wasnt tempted again or whatever his problem was but his intercession worked by finding me a good and competent caseworker sheila brown rothman said sheila brown she was very persistent and she went to court and child protective services agreed to move me to a group home so i could possibly get my high school diploma before i was emancipated out of the system emancipation which is a very well chosen word so i left eden falls thank god i was happy to leave but that papitano guy the superintendent pias voice trailed off and she paused to collect herself when she resumed she talked very quietly leaning forward practically addressing rothmans desk you know i really had grown to trust him i thought we had a connection but before i got shipped out he got drunk again and he was a big man he caught me alone in the library again id let my guard down and he betrayed me pia stopped talking they were sitting so still that the motiondetectoroperated switch in rothmans office doused the lights the sudden pitch darkness caused both pia and rothman to jump the lights came right back on jesus i thought they fixed that rothman said used to happen to me all the time you must think i have an antisocial personality disorder pia said regretting saying so much about her violent past it had been like a dam bursting ive never really talked about it straight out like this not to anyone except maybe sheila but with her it wasnt all at once it was over time i dont think you have a personality disorder in the slightest rothman said you did what you had to do i admire you my foster care experience was nowhere near as bad with jewish parents i got a decent placement right off it wasnt a picnic and i had to do without much nurturing but i was older to boot i was eleven at the time also i got to spend vacations with an aunt who wasnt the warmest of souls but at least was family even though my label then was only adhd my parents couldnt deal with me so they had given up in their defense i was a handful they had four older children and i just figured that my mom and dad had run out of love by the time it got to me listen pia im not trying to make you feel grateful to me or feel any different about me because of what ive told you im just saying that i understand some of what you went throughmore after what youve been willing to share tonight its no wonder you have nightmares and to tell you the truth your being late doesnt bother me as much as it bothers marsha and junichi especially with what i know ironically it bothers them because they believe it bothers me the major point i want to leave you with is that research is the calling where i found myself despite my past and despite my aspergers i think it could be for you as well but youre going to have to make a decision it cant be halfway its got to be either research or clinical medicine it cant be both reactive attachment disorder pia said one of the social workers at hudson valley academy told me i had reactive attachment disorder its supposed to mean i cant establish a relationship with anyone well i guess we make quite the pair then rothman said and smiled pia had never seen rothman smile before and his whole face lit up for a second you think about your future you dont have to say anything now but i have to know soon so i can prepare once our article for nature comes out things are going to accelerate rothman stood up now i have to go back in the biosafety unit for another hour or so typical of his aspergers syndrome behavior he didnt comment further just left pia remained sitting after rothman had departed except for the sounds emanating from some of the automatic equipment out in the lab there was silence even the desk lamp went out again until she waved her hand in the air shed been taken aback by the evenings events she felt exposed emotionally naked and found herself worried that rothman might decide on further thought that she was much too big a risk she sat in her chair for at least ten minutes before she got up and left as she descended in the elevator she started to feel better relieved to a degree that shed been as open as she had having been in foster care himself rothman understood her all at once pia felt confident all was going to work out it was her opinion that you can trust only a man whose actions match his words or better still who acts without asking for anything in return the only person she knew who fit that bill was dr rothman she knew that even george as generous as he was had his own agenda exiting into the cold night pia didnt know exactly what she was going to do but she had to admit that rothman had made a lot of sense and as unbelievable as it was she felt hed morphed into the father figure shed never had one central park west new york city march am when his home office phone rang just after eight in the morning a very anxious jerry trotter snapped it up hed been hoping it would ring and he was hoping it would be harry hooper i just had breakfast with that morgan guy i was telling you about last night hooper said launching right in after trotter picked up you met with the guy sat down in front of him and ate breakfast trotter was surprised brubaker and hooper were usually more indirect avoiding facetoface meetings he wouldnt say anything more over the phone he wanted a meeting insisted on it at sixthirty in the morning he thinks im a headhunter for real and he wants a new job like yesterday i couldnt see the harm in it its not like im going to see the guy again but what do you know about being a headhunter whats to know i just asked the guy to tell me about himself about his strengths where he sees himself in five years all that bs i said i didnt know of anyone who needed someone exactly like him but id keep an ear to the ground keep him in mind didnt he ask you for your business card said i was all out hooper said said id been meeting with a lot of bankers the last couple of weeks and underestimated demand almost convinced myself i was that busy anyway we finally got around to talking about your woman friend she and the thick guy who she was working for at the time definitely slept together more than once not just some drunken hookup at a convention but an actual affairhotel rooms in the afternoon that kind of thing and he knows this how he was going out with this woman who was good friends with your girl real good friends like girlfriends who told each other everything so your friend tells this woman shes seeing this guy whos married then she says its her boss she swore the friend to secrecy made her swear shed never tell anyone all that but the woman told my guy informations valuable as you know and it all depends on the circumstances this woman thought it would help in her relationship with my guy bring them closer having a shared secret it didnt work they broke up after a while so whyd he tell you like i said information can be valuable i was asking about your girl he knew something maybe he wanted the supposed job i was checking out your friend for i dont really know i guess i may have led him to believe im better connected on wall street than i am hes going to be pissed when you disappear all of a sudden whats he gonna do tell his boss anyway i plan to call him next week start letting him down slow it looks like im going to be downsized myself sure is a cruel world okay jerry said give me a second to think jerry held the phone in both hands this was goodgloria croft and edmund mathews had slept together ten twelve years ago and clearly it hadnt ended well because gloria was apparently enjoying trying to ruin edmund but for what jerry had in mind there had to be more this was good but it wasnt enough okay i like this but i need more keep digging try and figure out why it ended between them and why it ended so badly all right got it jerry sat back in his chair he was a man with a lot of secrets which is why he assumed everyone else had them some of jerrys secrets concerned the fact that he was unfaithful to charlotte his wife of twentytwo years he had had affairs with some of his patients one of which continued after trotter ended his medical practice and went into finance it was still going on with trysts at an apartment trotter maintained in the village for that express purpose trotter didnt feel any guilt about charlotte he thought of it as a kind of deal even though charlotte had never been approached about it he played around and she lived the high life shopping was her sport from jerrys perspective risk was a big part of life everybody handled risk differently he thought he handled risk well which was what made him a good hedge fund guy others handled risk poorly the real question that dogged jerrys mind at that moment was how much would have to be on the line for someone to do something truly desperate he was just beginning to think there might be a way to solve the problem that edmund had tossed into his lap jerry trotter had another secret one that weighed on his mind more heavily than any other it had nothing to do with women not only had jerry taken a very sizable personal stake in lifedeals in addition to the position his fund had acquired publicly but he had made a third and completely clandestine investment that was larger than the other two stakes combined jerry had studied what edmund and russell had set up with lifedeals read the business plans and pored over the sales reports he had commissioned his own secret research and paid lawyers hefty fees to set up financial instruments ready to be sold at a few days notice and then masked by a series of offshore shell companies he had set up the bare bones of a parallel company that would mimic lifedeals right down to the type of policies it went after as edmund never tired of saying life insurance was a trillion business in the usa alone there was plenty of money to go around edmund and russells bad news about regenerative medicine had hit jerry trotter like a hammer blow much more than edmund could have guessed his due diligence had completely missed it as had edmunds to his partner and his firm lifedeals predicament was unfortunate but it hardly threatened the hedge funds success even in the short term but jerry stood to lose much more his personal stake was very large but also survivable but if the shadow company that he was rolling out went down he was probably ruined the various subsidiaries were already buying policies individually each was tiny compared with lifedeals together jerry had once been proud to think they were larger over the course of approximately eighteenplus hours from the moment hed left the terrasini restaurant jerry trotter had become an extremely desperate man he hadnt slept all night instead using his old calculator and various files and portfolios to try to figure out ways in which he could emerge from this intact he knew he was clutching at straws with harry hooper but he was hoping against hope that edmund mathews had something more than just money at stake something that would mean jerry didnt have to try to fix this mess all on his own jerry had few qualms but he much preferred to delegate the truly dirty stuff the stuff that could get you thrown in jail or worse one central park west new york city march am by noon jerry was near to being a basket case after finishing the call with harry hooper he went back to doing what hed done at the end of the night surfing the internet just to have something to do jerry was buzzing on the amphetamines hed taken to keep him awake and he knew he had thirtysix to forty hours until he crashed every couple of hours he drank a red bull and he chugged diet cokes constantly his wife charlotte had no idea what was going on but was familiar enough with the routine to keep well out of her husbands way for jerry the internet was a wonderful resource and babysitter so to speak you could find out anything you wanted to know on it as well as plenty of things you didnt know you wanted to know it couldnt help much with finding the fountain of youth or proving the existence of god but otherwise it was golden the internet was particularly useful when it came to providing practical solutions to all manner of problems jerry had recently discovered how to tune his universal remote so that it operated the controls on his tv and he was grateful for that this was a different kind of problem as he sat alone in his darkened study with the shades drawn he stared at the screen on his mac following threads in obscure discussion groups piling up memberships in esoteric organizations clicking on links that took him to some tortured recesses of our collective consciousness as represented on the world wide web some of jerrys onscreen reading reminded him of being at medical school what he wouldnt have given to have had this resource back then the dry phrasing of the medical material hadnt changed in thirty years jerry thought hed perhaps spent a couple of hours reading about salmonella when he was a student hed always been slightly germophobic especially when it came to the more powerful microbes and reading about this one made him uncomfortable but dr rothmans first specialty the one that brought him his first nobel was fascinating it was such a versatile and dangerous bacteria the longer he sat at his desk the more convinced jerry became that only one course of action was open to him he was initially horrified by the thought but it looked like there were no other options and he hated to be backed into a corner whenever he got squeamish jerry pondered the prospect of being broke and disgraced if it all came crashing down hed be a laughingstock some ambitious hack would write a book about him and hed come across like a buffoon an idiot he would avoid that fate at any cost once jerry had the idea percolating in his mind really all he needed was the resolve and the money spending hours researching certain specialized activities on the internet had convinced him of something else money really could buy you anything he had the money he just had to convince himself he could follow it through now toward midday the throwaway cell phone rang again trotter was hoping for hooper but he got brubaker what do you have trotter said confirmation that those two guys are definitely the leaders in this organmaking field way out in front independently confirmed beyond that source i mentioned and no one can be precise on the timeline because it depends on the results of tests that no one can predict they might do a test and it doesnt work which sets them back a week a month or it does work and its on to the next one but eventually its going to work thats what im hearing too much to hope that it blows up in their face if youre looking for them to fail doesnt look like its gonna happen from every source theyre very confident how do you know so im told plus theyve formed a private company to control the patents that have been applied for and its not one patent it is a whole series of patents to be sure theyll control the whole field thanks i figured that means theyre close not necessarilyjust means theyre confident theyre going to get there howd you find out about the company you really wanna know indulge me okay boss i have a friend in the new york state division of corporations can find out when people register corporations or llcs comes in handy when guys set up limited liability companies to hide money from their wives ill bear that in mind rothman medical they call it so it wasnt hard to find registered two weeks ago they probably registered it overseas too in better tax locations as i said theyre being thorough and who are the partners the members of the company just the same two guys jerry ended the call rothman and yamamoto it seemed like the two of them were piloting the whole ship on their own jerry checked his watch it was nearly twelvethirty almost four and a half hours since hed spoken with hooper suddenly jerry felt crushingly tired it was vital to him that hooper find something he could use as leverage on edmund mathews his brain was close to fried he had to have someone help him with this he knew hooper would call him the second he had anything but like the previous evening he couldnt resist calling its me he said redundantly when hooper picked up is there a problem just checking in jerry said trying to control his voice with his antennae constantly up hooper sensed there was a problem and the problem was jerry jerry had said only five words but it sounded to hooper like trotter was tweaking on crystal meth having been a policeman hed had to deal with all manner of drugs you dont sound so good im tired is all well i got some lines in the pond said hooper just waiting for a bite just try and relax sure thought jerry as he broke the connection thats easy for you to say columbia university medical center new york city march pm the night before pia had taken the time to set the alarm that george had given her as well as her own cell phone and had awakened refreshed and ready to go at shed slept like a rock first time in more than a week after showering pia had taken a trip to the cafeteria and knocked on georges door bearing a toasted bagel with cream cheese and a cup of coffee wow this is a first george had said when he answered the door and you brought breakfast come in im just returning the favor or favors but where were you yesterday and the day before i was late both days and yesterday i ended up scrubbing beakers for two hours as punishment oh i doesnt matter i have some news good news i think so george had continued getting ready while pia sat on his bed rothman wants me to work in his lab fulltime when i graduate george had come out of the bathroom holding his toothbrush his mouth was agape and foaming can he do that i think around here he can do pretty much whatever he wants all he has to do is threaten to go to harvard or stanford so what did you say i didnt say anything for one thing i was too stunned and for another he told me to think about it but its a nobrainer im going to say yes ill talk to the dean about postponing my residency i imagine i can still qualify as a phd student but the important thing is to work in his lab you cant believe whats happening in there hes going to become even more famous i wouldnt be surprised if he wins another nobel george had returned to the bathroom and stood in front of his mirror he looked himself in the eye and bit his tongue thats great pia congratulations he had tried to sound convincing but didnt think he managed it i thought you were going to give me one of your rants about rothman hey if this is what you want to do i think you should do it he bit his tongue again my thoughts exactly come on george hurry up were going to be late the early morning had been dark and a cold drizzle was in the air march was not one of the best months in new york city george and pia had hurried to their assignments talking about how their first days had gone so whats it like working with will mckinley hes a bit of an ass and into himself rothman thinks hell go into plastic surgery anyway hes holding his own since hes smart enough i do like lesley im sure that rothmans comment was not meant as a compliment ive heard hes never said anything positive about anybody pia had merely raised her eyebrows without commenting mckinley reckons hes gods gift to women im sure you figured that out pia had shrugged as if to say and is he leaving you alone i can handle will mckinley believe me he is quite cute though george had caught up the stride after momentarily lagging behind pia he looked across at her she was smiling having a laugh at georges expense he couldnt help but laugh along with her silently he chided himself for being such a wimp the morning passed uneventfully for the students they spent their time on their respective projects in the organ bath unit pia also spent several more hours reading about ph buffers designed to be used for tissue culture the maintenance man had still not finished in her office or in rothmans office either and wires still hung out of both ceilings the electrical blueprints that had been in pias cubbyhole were now in rothmans office pia had gone in to see if the worker was there as he wasnt in her space she wanted to give him an earful about the job not being done but he wasnt in there either and after starting her reading she forgot about him altogether as if taking a cue from jealous george will showed up and tried to engage pia in small talk pia wasnt sure if he was hitting on her or not but couldnt have cared if he was she answered his first few questions but then told him directly she wanted to concentrate on her reading he took the hint and vanished at twelve thirtyfive rothman and yamamoto appeared from the depths of the bsl pia couldnt help but notice that they were acting out of character they were actually talking excitedly to each other pia didnt stare directly but watched out of the corner of her eye the lab was quiet which was why she had heard them emerge it seemed that everybody was at lunch all at once yamamoto came toward her as rothman disappeared into his office but without shutting his door even that was out of the ordinary pia sensed that something was going on where are the other students yamamoto asked when he reached pias side his voice had what pia would have described as an anticipatory ring pia looked up i believe in the organ bath unit she said good yamamoto said i want you in there too rothman and i want to show you students something five minutes later all five people were in the organ bath room attired as per usual in caps gowns masks and booties okay rothman said clasping his gloved hands together in excitement after pias surprising talk with him the previous evening and now his excited behavior she felt she was seeing a side of rothman that she never imagined existed dr yamamoto and i want to show you something but in the strictest confidence you will be here a month pia longer but we would be very grateful if you could keep what youre about to see to yourselves in that period and thereafter agreed the three nodded their assent good we dont want anyone to get excited prematurely the stakes here are very high as he talked rothman edged toward the back of the room set in the wall was a door with another security pad like the one on the main door outside rothman shielded the code pad with his body punched in a code which pia assumed was the same as for the other security doors and pulled open the door dr yamamoto held it as rothman stepped over the threshold followed by the students yamamoto stepped in and closed the door behind him they were standing in a room that was maybe ten feet square an identical but smaller version of the one they had just left the five people made the room feel crowded the same bluish light filled the room which had its own hvac system that hummed a little louder than its larger neighbor the recessed ceiling light illuminated two carts like the ones they had been working with next door they stood side by side but only one was operating rothman gestured toward the bath atop the one cart it was similar to the ones out in the main room in it was a kidney much larger than the mouse organs soon they learned that it was a human kidney and like the human kidneys in the outer room it had been made from yamamotos fibroblasts it was a pale color and appropriately kidneyshaped the difference was that this organ had ports through the plexiglas wall that were connected with y connectors to the organs artery vein and ureter what youre looking at is what is going to be the worlds first human organ exoplant made from induced pluripotent cells this morning we received official sanction from the fda to go ahead and attach this organ to dr yamamotos cannulated inguinal artery and vein we will be allowing the organ to function as it would if it were transplanted into dr yamamotos abdomen youve volunteered for this will asked yamamoto yes of course yamamoto said with enthusiasm it is a great honor for me when will you do it pia asked it seemed as if she was being overwhelmed on a daily basis in rothmans laboratory as soon as we can schedule it with the surgery department it will be done in one of the main operating rooms for safetys sake well allow the organ to function for several hours while we monitor it carefully its going to be a big day a milestone really but what pia could see before her seemed like a destination in itself the dreams inherent in what was growing next door were being made into a reality in this tiny secret chamber pia felt a sense of awe that she was present at the creation of something immense and extraordinary no one in the room was saying a word pia stared at the artificial kidney sitting in its nutrient solution the blue light reflecting in the bath and flickering over her face she had been working in rothmans cathedral but now she had seen the shrine she knew that rothman would have preferred the organ to be a pancreas but she knew he knew that would not be far behind she could hardly wait to see that happen one central park west new york city march pm jerry trotter was slumped in his study his head twisted awkwardly as it rested on his desk next to his slender mac keyboard as he snored fitfully jerry was having a particularly lurid dream he is sitting as far back in a chair as he can while a man is yelling right in his face in the dream jerry is late for a vital appointment but he doesnt know what its for and he cant find out until the man stops yelling at him and gets out of the way jerry twitched himself half awake but didnt move hed drooled on the desk and his head was pounding a phone was ringing somewhere nearby after an hour that morning jerry had turned off the ringers on all the phones in the house and on his regular cell phone it appeared that there were plenty of people who wanted to talk to him he hadnt shown up at work so they figured he was at home or at least somewhere where he could pick up his cell phone but the only calls jerry cared about would come in on the device that max higgins had given him so that must be the phone that was ringing jerry sat bolt upright and pulled something in his neck a quick spasm of pain ran up into his head as he scrambled for the phone it stopped ringing shit shit although he was onepart asleep and couldnt orient himself properly jerry found the phone and pushed at the unfamiliar buttons a number came up and he pressed the green button the phone redialed it wasnt higgins and he couldnt remember hoopers number or brubakers let it be hooper he said quietly with purpose let it be hooper someone picked up the call whereve you been i called twice it was hooper you got something bingo what is it you gotta tell me we need to meet the starbucks on the corner of sixtieth opposite the mandarin oriental thats right across the street see you in ten minutes jerry trotter looked at his rolex again and then around the starbucks harry hooper had said ten minutes and that was almost a halfhour ago jerry had come straight down to the street from his skyscraper aerie and hurried across columbus circle and hed reached the place in four minutes flat max higgins would be at the apartment at any moment too jerry had quickly called him and asked him to come up from the office with the car things seemed to be moving as usual the starbucks was jammed there was a line of people snaking around the store all waiting to order and customers to their left waiting for their beverages to be delivered most of the twotops were occupied by individuals with laptops and a lot of notebooks who were these people jerry wondered didnt they have homes or offices a homeless guy had wedged his shopping bags and himself into a corner he had a cup of water and as long as he stayed awake he could sit there for the rest of the year what sort of venue was this for a meeting jerry wondered there was little chance of finding somewhere to sit and less chance of talking discreetly jerry took out the phone and was ready to call hooper again when he felt a hand squeeze his elbow and not lightly he twisted around hooper lets take a walk he said hooper guided jerry out of the store and across the street so they skirted the front of the time warner building hordes of people were coming in and out of the doors hooper turned right on fiftyeighth street and walked toward columbus steering jerry through traffic to the south side of the street they entered a pair of light green glass doors and took an escalator up to the lobby of the boutique hotel on the corner hooper led jerry to a quiet section of the expansive lobby and sat at a table where a drinks menu was resting a little quieter in here hooper said what was all that about we could have just met here you sounded very tense on the phone hooper said id say nervous was more like it and nervous people make me nervous just basic precautions jerry looked at hooper how old was the guy fiftyfive he was smaller than jerry remembered no more than fiveeight with dark hair that might be dyed but which was all his he had a pinched smokers face and friendly eyes trotter trusted him not at all shall we have a drink sure said jerry who was running on fumes hooper waved a hand and a waiter came over from a bar scotch rocks a little water hooper said vodka martini with a twist jerry said thank you you look a bit rough there boss didnt sleep well jerry said nothing some good news wont cure im presuming its good news because you couldnt tell me over the phone i wanted to have a little word with you facetoface oh yes im kinda wondering why youre so interested in this guy well whats it to you harry i asked you to find out some information and you seem to have found something obviously i want to have some leverage over this person but its nothing you need worry about im curious how valuable the information might be jerry paused while the waiter served their drinks was this little asshole trying to shake him down the waiter left and jerry picked up his glass slowly cheers harry jerry knocked back half of his drink and put it down id say the information is worth the three hundred an hour im paying you that was our agreement i believe a very generous one agreements are made to be renegotiated hooper said what do you have in mind another ten grand ten grand are you kidding not in the slightest jerry laughed he couldnt help himself ten thousand was chicken feed anticipating that hooper would try something like this although not quite so unsubtly he had brought fifty thousand dollars with him and was willing to spend it let me think about it jerry said pretending to look pensive you must think im an idiot he added taking another gulp of vodka you and brubaker both do you call each other and say what an idiot that jerry trotter is thinking hes some kind of spy hooper looked at jerry coldly he didnt say no im an idiot but im not a total idiot jerry reached into the pocket on the front of his leather jacket and took out a small digital recorder of the type hooper was familiar with whats that now hooper was smiling i taped our calls harry not on this machine but another one just like it what did you saybasic precautions i prefer to think of it as insurance ha me and insurance jerry finished his drink and held up his glass for the hovering waiter hooper hadnt touched his drink theres nothing on there i never say anything on the phone oh really then youve got nothing to worry about hoopers eyes darted around the room briefly and he took a sip of his drink jerry had got him thinking he could see that were in this together my friend i have no intention of doing anything with the recordings as you say theres probably nothing there but weve definitely entered a new phase in our relationship you were very honest with meyou want more money okay jerry reached into his jacket again and took out a thick manila envelope he threw it down on the table next to hoopers drink hooper picked up the envelope held it below the level of the tabletop and opened it with a finger he flicked through the bills and looked up at jerry jerry thought that if hooper had ever seen that much money before it was evidence hed seized in an investigation and it was going under lock and key i dont get it hooper said thats a lot more than ten yes it is thats fifty fifty grand holy shit ah mr hooper your grim exterior is slipping jerry finished off his drink he was feeling a lot more like his old self what do i gotta do you tell me two things and i give you another one of those envelopes in a couple of weeks thats all first im going to tell you what i think i think youre a greedy little man i know you pad your bills for methats fine everyone does it but this is real money and i have more real money that i intend to keep giving you as long as we can help each other out because we really are in this together i also think you dont know exactly what i have on tape hmm hooper had regained his composure and was looking jerry right in the eye i notice you already took the money i also think youre thinking screw it i want the money its easy money too harry because i know you already know the first thingthats why were here and i really think youll find out the second one very quickly a man of your experience youre playing a dangerous game youre an amateur i know jerry closed his eyes and smiled but im a quick learner so tell me what you found out about edmund mathews and ms croft in a few sentences harry hooper told jerry trotter what hed been told and about the source of the information there was no doubt in hoopers mind that it was true thank you harry that might just be enough for me so whats the other thing you want to know jerry leaned in toward hooper i want you to tell me how i get my hands on some polonium greenwich connecticut march pm it was thirty miles give or take from columbus circle in manhattan to edmund mathewss house in greenwich and by some miracle jerrys driver a former new york state highway patrolman made the trip in just over fifty minutes after leaving harry hooper in the hotel bar jerry had found max higgins waiting in the limo in front of his building he got in and called edmund mathews immediately pretty much ordering him and russell to leave their greenwich office and meet at edmunds house within the hour jerry had told max nothing max thought jerry looked terribleredrimmed eyes unshaven cheeks hair in disarray and wearing a strange and rumpled shirtandkhakis combination under an old leather jacket such as a biker might wear and he could smell the alcohol on his breath max would have to wait for an explanation because as soon as hed spoken with edmund jerry stretched out in the limos generous backseat and fell into a noisy and fitful sleep in the hours since their lunch with jerry and max the day before edmund and russell had done nothing significant in terms of solving their problems russell had busied himself overseeing the implementation of some of edmunds ideas about buying different types of life insurance policies and legal staffers had started combing through existing diabetics policies looking for what russell had called anomalies anyone whod used a middle initial on one document and not on another they were to see if that was grounds for termination of the policy any agreements in progress were halted pending investigation but these were stopgaps if there was to be a macro solution edmund and russell hoped it would come from jerry when edmund received jerrys summons he was optimistic that salvation was at hand jerry had sounded hoarse and he was even more abrupt than usual but no matter russell had been positively giddy as the two men waited for jerry edmund more reserved from experience edmund knew that if jerry had thought of something it wouldnt be painfree thered be a price to pay somewhere down the line jerrys limo pulled up to edmunds front door as edmund watched from a secondfloor window the driver hopped out and held the door open for jerry who slowly stepped into the chilly winter air even from this range jerry didnt look so hot as edmund made his way downstairs his wife alice ever the good hostess opened the front door alice jerry said jovially i was hoping id see you you look as lovely as ever and she did her blond bob tucked back behind her ears her light green eyes set off by a mintgreen sweater her gymtoned legs setting off a sharp kneelength skirt hello jerry how are you alice grabbed jerrys elbow and leaned in to kiss his cheek jerry had tried to tame his hair and had quickly polished off half a roll of breath mints but he hadnt completely overcome his dishevelment nor had he done anything about a subtle ripeness that hovered around him like an invisible cloud alice recoiled a little i was just saying to max jerry continued as edmund joined them what a wonderful couple alice and edmund are and little darius makes three beautiful wife a healthy heir this stunning house edmund you are a lucky sob the man who has everything wasnt i just saying that max absolutely jerry and who could disagree max had no idea what jerry was talking about but he played along two minutes earlier jerry had been all but dead to the world jerry had his arm around alices shoulder as the group filed into the house edmund wondered what on earth was going on jerry had never shown the slightest interest in alice nor edmund in charlotte trotter they didnt have that kind of relationshipit was all business russell here ah yes there you are jerry said spying russell emerging from the library can i get you gentlemen anything alice asked extricating herself from jerrys grip jerry moved to lean against a wall from edmunds perspective it appeared as if jerry was having trouble standing up id love a coffee thanks alice you have one of those fancy machines right as strong as it comes and in a large mug if you wouldnt mind didnt sleep so well last night alice moved toward the kitchen and the four men stood in edmunds expansive entryway we dont have all the paperwork from statistical solutions corroborating the concerns we have about the bell curves edmund said eager to get the ball rolling i dont care about that jerry said its as bad as you thought actually its probably worse than you feared we have to preserve the capital weve invested and the only way to do so is to act quickly and decisively like now well shall we go into the library and sit down and talk about it edmund asked or the living room no edmund jerry said suddenly sounding more focused you and i are going for a little walk outside a walk its freezing out there its going to snow later dont worry edmund youre not going to freeze to death go grab a coat as russell and max moved into edmunds library edmund and jerry stepped outside edmund fortified by a woolen overcoat jerry by the coffee alice had made it was five shots of espresso staining the inside of a syracuse university mug theyve set up a company to control the patents for the organogenesis techniques jerry said rothman and yamamoto these are the guys no doubt about it theyre the problem im glad youre taking the issue to heart edmund said they walked along an ornamental path in the front of the house past rosebushes that had been severely pruned back for the winter patches of snow lay on the lawn in the shadow of the hedges this was as barren as edmunds garden ever looked we have to act at once those bell curves move at all to the right its a disaster im pleased you see the same problem we do jerry stopped walking just short of the lawn unfortunately we dont see a simple financial solution like selling ourselves short through an intermediary or securitizing our policy holdings immediately with gloria croft shorting bigtime we probably couldnt find any institutional buyer i agree edmund said but the life settlement concept is still sound its maybe the best business opportunity ive ever come across it would be a shame to have to give up at this early stage i agree jerry said and more than you know he thought more than even max knew which is why ive come up with another plan there was a silence then jerry went on its a little unorthodox but its the best plan that serves all of our interests believe me ive thought about nothing else over the last twentyfour hours but its not for us to doits for you to do it was your idea this whole thing your mess to get out of just you and i will speak of it nothing will be in writing edmund nodded he didnt expect anything different not from jerry theres only one solution and its the way it has to be because this guy rothman has got himself out there so far ahead of the pack another silence ensued i think rothmans momentum has to be stopped if it is i think well have a good five years before the rest of the research community catches up to where rothman is today neither man said anything jerrys words hung heavily between them as if they were written in the air finally edmund broke the excruciating silence how do we stop rothmans momentum jerry easy said jerry you kill him edmund turned and walked away from jerry back toward the house he took a path on the side of the building and jerry set his empty coffee cup down and followed him to the rear garden where edmund sat on a bench with a view of long island sound jerry sat down next to him murder jerry like having him shot edmund was appalled at the same time he didnt think he had the luxury of dismissing any idea out of hand no matter how preposterous it sounded no not at all the two of them should die in a way that doesnt invite suspicion of homicide it must look like an accident there shouldnt even be an investigation although i suppose that would be inevitable but there can be nothing that makes this look deliberate because it wouldnt be beyond the realm of possibility that any semicompetent murder investigation would lead right to lifedeals you sat there yourself at statistical solutions and talked about what this could do to the companys bottom line do you have any specific suggestions jerry although the proposal was outlandish and terrifying edmund wanted to find out what jerry was proposing it wasnt as if edmund had any plan b waiting in the wings as a matter of fact i do edmund continued to stare out at the water ill tell you said jerry most of the medical people will know that rothmans first interest in research before he became involved in regenerative medicine was salmonella which is the numberone cause of foodborne illness in general and typhoid fever in particular hes investigating the virulence of the bacteriawhat causes it to be a tremendously deadly bacteria on the one hand and a bothersome but nondeadly cause of gastrointestinal distress on the other why does one type give you the runs but another kills you we did a little research hes found that growing salmonella in outer space produces a very lethal strain he should be fed some of this particular strain a lot of people dont care for the mantheyre jealous of his nobel prize and they think hes got an attitude if he dies from the bacteria hes studying a lot of people are going to say oh thats terrible and then smile at the irony of it later jerry made it sound so easy i suppose that would be clever edmund said he felt he had to say something thats not the half of it the typhoid fever hed immediately develop might or might not kill him there has to be something else that will kill him quickly and definitively but its got to be something you cant easily detect theres a substance called poloniumvery radioactive and deadly if you ingest it but not harmful otherwise wed use it because it produces many of the same symptoms as typhoid and would be masked by it its what killed alexander litvinenko in london a few years ago i remember that that was just a theory surely the polonium i think it was more than that jerry said why do we need it to make sure the guy dies its very potent the challenge is that rothman and his sidekick work in one of the premier medical centers in the world the salmonella no matter how virulent it might be cannot be counted on by itself one or both of them could be saved thats a chance that cannot be taken we need to be sure onehundredpercent sure ergo the polonium and a massive dose of it to boot so where the hell do you get this stuff whos going to buy it russell you hire the right people professionals youve been watching too many movies edmund said so tell me jerry who is going to procure this deadly radioactive poison for us albanians albanians edmunds voice betrayed his skepticism theres an albanian mafia thats grown big in new york in the last twenty years very violent very ruthless but also very reliable if you do business with them their word is their bond and all that the fbi put a crimp in their operations in the nineties but theyve grown back and theyre looking to make names for themselves again youre going to ask how do i know i got this from a man who spent years of his life trying to put these guys in jail he gave me a name jerry held out a piece of paper folded in half for edmund edmund thrust his hands in his coat pockets and looked at jerry youre out of your fucking mind jerry let edmund stew for a couple of minutes edmund had moved down to the edge of his property and was standing looking out at the gray water of the sound jerry could imagine edmunds state of mindpart of him horrified to even consider such a thing another part telling him he had no option but to consider doing it which side was winning jerry decided to play his trump card he didnt want to have to do this either but again there was no choice he walked down to join edmund and stood about four feet to his right looking ahead i know about you and gloria croft what about me and gloria croft you mean personally edmund waited a beat then turned to look at jerry who was stonyfaced and staring straight ahead whats that got to do with anything so you know what im talking about yes yes gloria and i had a a thing when we were working together when you were her boss yes jerry jesus what does that have to do with anything you got married young i believe i was married at the time i admit it i was a bad boy i got carried away and i wasnt the only one whos ever done that you tell me you never did but i learned my lesson i steer very clear of bitches like her so no harm no foul is what youre saying right edmund jerry i swear i have no idea what the relevance of this is you just asked me to kill two people for christs sake edmund turned his head as he said it checking that no one had joined them are you trying to put pressure on me with this theres something i dont think youre aware of i was hoping i wouldnt have to bring this up but it seems like you leave me no option jerry looked at edmund he had crossed one bridge with edmund a few minutes ago now he was going to burn it down when you were sleeping with gloria croft she got pregnant oh bullshit jerry she got pregnant edmund and she had a termination and it didnt go well she used a good clinic i can give you the name but the procedure had some serious complications i can give you details if you need them she survived but it left her sterile so she cant have children and i would imagine it also left her with a lot of resentment for the man involved why should i believe this edmunds face was dark with fury his hands bunched into fists still thrust deep into his coat pockets his left hand throbbing from punching the elevator door he leaned toward jerry almost goading him youre trying to blackmail me i cant believe you the information came up quite by chance jerry said he was surprised how remarkably calm he felt we were looking for dirt on gloria when we heard about this i know someone who has contacts in the records department at certain hospitals and he found the relevant file the timings right we checked and theres even a note in there saying that she only had one sexual partner they were ruling out some stds so they asked my guess is that partner was you bullshit you use a condom every time edmund she miss a bit of work around the time you stopped seeing each other you might not remember but i doubt you liked your analysts taking a lot of time off and perhaps she left the company soon after that am i right edmund sighed he felt deflated almost literally as if the air had been sucked out of his lungs he stared back out at the water again so what will you do with this information and im not saying its true i said just now what a lovely wife you have what a beautiful home its true of course im just pointing out to you whats at stake here edmund you might not see things as clearly as i do weve all worked so hard to get what we have and there are so many people who are jealous of us who say we dont deserve all this but we both know the truth we earned everything we have without us this country would be starved of innovation nothing new would be created okay so someones going to grow organs outside of the body but not now not when theyll destroy this wonderful product of yours its a fantastic idea that you had and you have to protect it jerry paused now you say what i just told you is bullshit its not all bullshit is it it cant be and whats alice going to say if she gets a note that says her husband slept with his analyst and she got pregnant i doubt shes going to be placated that easily just by telling her its all bullshit edmund said nothing im telling you these albanian guys can make all of this go away i assure you they have done more difficult things than this it turns out that its true what they say money really can buy you anything just look around you edmund you just have too much to lose what about gloria croft dont worry about her jerry said shell get hers when lifedeals share price skyrockets jerry held out the piece of paper again this time edmund wearily put out his hand and took the scrap unfolded it and read it jerry touched him once on the shoulder with his left hand and turned and walked back toward the house edmund stood where he was staring at the name written on the paper a name that meant nothing to him and everything part ii columbia university medical center new york city march pm tobias rothman was happiest when he could work uninterrupted in the safe confines of the lab with dr yamamoto at his side yamamoto was like rothmans right arm he could hold out a hand and yamamoto would know what he wanted without him having to ask for it the two men communicated by looks and pointed fingers and sometimes rothman swore by intuition if rothman could intuit anything as they worked together under the hood in the biosafety level lab today it was that his colleague didnt feel so good because a couple of times hed uncharacteristically missed rothmans cues in truth rothman hadnt been feeling particularly well himself for the last hour or so he had some mild gastric distress but worse was a kind of lightheadedness as if he were walking on eggshells it had started about an hour after their coffee break at nine theyd been in the unit since six rothman looked over at yamamoto he was facing the wall resting his hands on the lab bench breathing hard yamamoto turned to look at rothman and rothman could see that he was shivering with a hood and mask all rothman could see of yamamotos face were his eyes which reflected fear suddenly rothman felt it too and began to shiver himself it was as if hed just jumped into a bath of ice water yet he was sweating and he felt nauseous it was impossible that what flashed through his mind could be happeningtheyd taken all their usual precautions and their safety record was perfect the next moment yamamotos eyes rolled up in his head and he collapsed limply onto the floor rothman tried to steady himself before going to yamamotos aid but he felt suddenly much worse the room swam before him he knew he was going to black out and just before he did his hand reached for the red button on the wall pia was sitting in her office comparing notes with will and lesley it was crowded but quiet theyd taken refuge in there despite its diminutive size as there was yet another workman in the lab proper again working up in the ceiling with all the electrical wires hed briefly been in her office as well as rothmans but thankfully had left both luckily it wasnt the same guy vance whod been such a pain weeks earlier the three students had formed an effective unit in their three weeks together and were making good progress with the temperature and ph issues with the organ baths theyd spent almost all of their waking hours including weekends in the lab but none of them begrudged a minute of it then in an instant it was as if a riot had broken out at the door to the lab what the hell will said as the three students piled out of pias office from her vantage point all pia could see were people barging in through the door the place was being invadedshe must have seen twenty people dressed in gowns hats masks and booties rush toward the biosafety unit bringing up the rear was a pair of gurneys sprouting iv poles with plastic bags of iv fluid slapping against the metal poles pushed by more gownedup figures the gurneys disappeared into the biosafety unit whose door had been propped open with a doorstop pia felt a terrible sensation growing in the pit of her stomach one man stopped by marshas desk and stood next to the terrified secretary who had a hand clasped over her mouth another blocked off the entrance door which was again closed denying access to the corridor and the rest of the medical center the laboratory staff crowded into the center of the room and there was a ripple of loud conversation and shouted questions is this a drill lesley said whats going on the figure by marshas desk pulled down his mask he was a fiftysomething africanamerican man with skin as black as ebony his voice was calm yet commanding okay folks this is not a drill we have a situation and i need you all to stay right here right where you are is everyone in the lab accounted for people looked around checking for coworkers among the fifteen or so technicians and support staff standing around pia could see the maintenance man in his coveralls standing at the back of the room gaping like everyone else everybody here okay my names david winston im from hospital security these other people are a mixed group from the hospital er and the department of infectious disease ill give you more information when we have it i am asking you to please remain in this area thank you for your cooperation the staff stood in small groups and talked among themselves pia unable to stay still walked around in a small tight circle whatever was happening she knew it wasnt good a wave of anxiety washed over her the lab door opened abruptly and a tall distinguishedlooking man walked in quickly and made his way through the cordon toward the biosafety unit conspicuously avoiding eye contact with anyone he was dressed in protective clothing like the others except his mask hung down on his chest under the gown was a suit not scrubs like the others pia knew this was the chief of infectious disease dr helmut springer as she had attended several lectures hed given during secondyear pathology the background buzz of conversation grew louder most recognized dr springer everyone in the lab was well aware that they worked with highly virulent and contagious microorganisms was it possible thered been some contamination of the lab where were dr rothman and dr yamamoto springers appearance only heightened the tension the man by the door was on a cell apparently quarterbacking whatever was happening were on our way eta five minutes he was heard to bark into his phone quickly tying his mask in place springer pulled the biosafety unit door fully open as if on cue the gurneys reappeared the one in front carrying dr rothman dr yamamoto in the rear both men had ivs and were wearing oxygen masks rothman passed right in front of pia who pushed forward to take a look she could see he was deathly pale and shivering violently his eyes were fixed straight ahead staring at the ceiling he looked like death as fast as they had come the cavalcade of medics was gone only dr springer and winston remained springer addressed the shellshocked staff a few of whom were clutching each other for comfort others holding their hands over their mouths in disbelief at what they had just witnessed as you can see doctors rothman and yamamoto have been taken ill at first guess we have to consider it to be severe typhoid fever both men are presenting the classic symptomsfever sudden prostration abdominal distress delirium right lower quadrant borborygmi springer counted off the symptoms on the fingers of his left hand as if he were on formal grand rounds once a professor always a professor thought pia obviously they were working in the biosafety unit but can anyone tell me what they were working on exactly lab technician panjit singh stepped forward they were working on salmonella strains grown in the space station lab i know that for a fact because i set everything up for them this morning theyve been working on it for weeks okay thanks thats very useful do you know if there are any antibioticsensitivity studies available for these special strains yes lots of them i can get them for you thats good im going to need them thank you mr winston here will talk to you about procedure a bit later but heres a thumbnail no one is to go into the levelthree lab until its cleared the rothman lab itself will be offlimits until further notice ive already put in a call to the cdc to get their help on the epidemiology side so we can find out how this contamination occurred right now everyone needs to follow me to the infectious disease clinic where youll be screened for typhoid fever everyone will also need to take a prophylactic course of antibiotics this is very important for the next week youll have to monitor your own temperature twice a day anything unusual come in right away a degree either side of normal i want to see you any questions who raised the alarm singh asked theres a panic button in the biosafety lab springer said one of the doctors must have hit it well check the tape does everyone need to come to the clinic pia asked even people who havent been in the biosafety unit today absolutely and mr winston will also be gathering names of everyone whos been here delivering supplies or takeout or whatever we want to see everyone who has set foot inside this lab thats it thank you for your cooperation the din of conversation erupted again oh my god lesley said did you see how they looked it must have come on fast dr yamamoto told me he didnt feel so hot this morning will said but yeah i saw how they looked i guess we better go do what the man said pia looked around the maintenance man was hanging back and though pia didnt want to talk to him she knew he needed to follow the protocol theres a medical issue she said to the man his temporary name tag read omeary you have to come to the clinic with everyone else omeary looked nervous and didnt say anything winston called out to pia time to go he said were locking down there was clearly no room for argument pia waited for omeary to leave and exited in front of winston as the last person out winston pulled the door shut and talked to two figures in full hazmat suits standing outside no one gets in winston said put up the caution tape the men in the hazmat suits nodded and set to work as they made their way to the elevator pia could see that the whole floor was being cleared with other personnel being led down the stairs there were more people in hazmat suits that looked like robots on the elevator ride down pia could feel her heart beating too fast and she had to concentrate on breathing deeply she felt some dizziness from her shallow breathing as she walked along the sidewalk she was gripped by what felt like paniceverything around her felt very close and incredibly far away at the same time she had stopped walking and was holding on to someone voices were loud in her ear come with me a woman is saying its a hot sunny day but pias freezing cold the woman has a nice smile and shes holding pias hand this is a new place pia knows that she hasnt been here long this is the first smile shes seen though its odd nowgrownups dont keep smiles on their faces the whole time pia and the woman have come inside and theyre walking up to a large door it feels like theyre walking uphill this is the headmasters office the woman says she opens the door and pushes her in pia can hear the lock being turned hello pia says the man hes smiling too but its a twisted smile not a smile of welcome pia looked up she was sitting on the ground on th street with traffic passing by winston was supporting her with his hand looking down at her you okay yes i think so you fainted or almost fainted youre not perspiring so i dont think you have a fever i think youre okay ready to get up pia waited a second and allowed winston to pull her to her feet then she remembered where she was and what had just happened with disturbing clarity she saw rothman lying on the gurney his face looking like death and the image terrified her over the course of three and a half years shed come to rely more and more on the mans strange friendship particularly after their heartfelt conversation a few weeks ago up until then their relationship had been akin to two people comfortably wandering around in a darkened room occasionally sensing each others presence but not much else but after the conversation and the personal revelations she felt theyd moved to another level rothman had become the ersatz father shed always pined for most important shed allowed herself to begin to trust rothman despite having learned not to trust anyone not to allow anyone into a position where they could betray her like so many had done now as she stumbled along the street pia was overwhelmed by the thought that just when shed allowed rothman into her world he was going to abandon her why was he doing this and why now it was irrational to think so but did he do this to spite her did he purposely set her up after all hed admitted to being depressed she was almost paralyzed with anxiety at the infectious disease clinic pia was shaking when she was handed the zpak prophylactic antibiotic she sat down in the waiting area and her head started to clear she was aware that several people had tried to talk to her but she didnt hear them miss grazdani a nurse called out sharply standing directly in front of pia she was on the brink of calling the er if the young woman continued in her fuguelike state thinking pia might have to be admitted not quite awakening pia sat up straighter and focused on the nurses face im here pia voiced im sorry what did you say i said that you cant go back to the lab its going to be closed until the cdc epidemiologists get here from atlanta and declare it clean what you should do as we have advised the others is go home start your antibiotics and watch your temperature is there someone we can call who can meet you there miss grazdani are you okay miss grazdani im just fine pia assured her columbia university medical center new york city march pm it wasnt a warm day but pia had wanted to sit outside she had found a bench set in a small rectangle of public cement what in new york city is called a park and sat down hands in her coat pockets her chin down hood pulled over her eyes her mind played over the scene she had just witnessed several times there was a surreal quality to it like it was one of her nightmares unfortunately it was real after she had gotten herself reasonably calmed down pia got up from the bench and started to walk toward the dorm she got halfway changed her mind and turned and headed back to the hospital there she took the first two of her antibiotic tablets at a water fountain before heading to the internal medicine floor at the main nurses station she asked for dr rothman and was directed to the infectious disease wing a floor above where rothman and yamamoto had been admitted she wanted to check on rothmans status hoping that hed revived with treatment and if so she wanted to ask him if he knew how he and yamamoto had become contaminated pia knew the epidemiologists would certainly be asking the same questions but she had a personal reason for finding outthe crazy thought that hed done it on purpose an idea she knew to be irrational but which demanded in her mind to be investigated pia had another concern experience had taught her to absolutely distrust authority in any institution and to assume that nothing would happen the way it should she knew rothman was disliked by almost one hundred percent of his colleagues in the medical center he was rude seemingly arrogant and antisocial while medical protocol and simple human decency demanded that each patient receive the undivided attention of medical staff and the best care available she couldnt help but think rothmans reputation might degrade the standards pia used her medical student credentials to get on the floor and found that the two researchers were in adjoining negativepressure rooms where air flowed in but not out they were in strict isolation but there was no one guarding the rooms pia started to put on the isolation gear in the anteroomthe gown hat mask gloves and bootiesbut just as she was about to put on her mask dr springer emerged from rothmans room he undid his mask and stared at pia what on earth are you doing here youre rothmans student arent you youre supposed to be home i took my antibiotics and my temperatures fine i know im cleani wasnt in the biosafety unit today or even in contact with dr rothman or dr yamamoto its very important i speak with dr rothman good god of course you cant speak with him the only people allowed in are medical staff assigned to his case no family no friends and certainly no medical students theres no one in there looking at him now are you sure of the diagnosis is this the best place to treat his condition what do you mean is this the best place springer shook his head in disbelief i know what people around here think of dr rothman young lady i dont know what youre implying but everyone at columbia medical center gets the same superb care as everyone else friend or foe rich or poor it makes no difference whatsoever and i happen to like dr rothman okay okay sorry im just upset pia didnt want to get thrown off the floor ive been working with both men for more than three years on the salmonella strains that are probably involved and i thought i might be able to help okay said springer he relaxed a degree he sensed pias intentions were good even if totally unrealistic i have to tell you that both men are delirious even if i let you in there you wouldnt get anything out of dr rothman follow me springer took off the protective gear and tossed it into the covered hamper pia did the same springer took pia back to the nurses station and sitting down itemized the laundry list of tests that had been ordered including a complete blood count electrolytes blood cultures urine cultures stool cultures stat dna microbiology tests and the appropriate xrays at that point the tests that had come back confirmed that the infectious agent was one of the salmonella strains rothman and yamamoto were working on which rothman had named the alpha strain the most virulent of the three grown in space he also mentioned that the white cell count showed a mild leukopenia meaning the white cell count was mildly depressed something often seen with typhoid fever he declared the electrolytes meaning primarily sodium chloride calcium and potassium were normal springer concluded by telling pia that rothmans and yamamotos temperature heart rate blood pressure degree of oxygenation of blood urine output and central venous pressure were being monitored and that at the moment the only thing abnormal was the temperature theyre both in bad shape especially considering how quickly the illness came on springer added what antibiotic are they on as pia knew from her studies with rothman there was debate about which was the best to use in serious salmonella cases thats a good question dr springer said actually dr rothman briefed me recently on findings he had made in his studies of antibiotic sensitivity on these zerogravity strains all three strains he was working on are very sensitive to chloramphenicol thats an antibiotic that at one time was considered the best choice for typhoid but it went out of favor in the seventies because newer strains of salmonella were becoming resistant dr rothman said that because these strains were grown in space they were more virulent but somehow theyd also lost their chloramphenicol resistance he was interested because drug resistance is a big problem with salmonella have you thought of trying ceftriaxone pia asked referring to a newer antibiotic springer hesitated giving pia a onceover look hed been trying to be nice to her as she was obviously concerned about her mentor when he resumed speaking his voice and syntax had changed there was an edge i actually wasnt requesting a consult by speaking with you its purely as a courtesy that im filling you in on dr rothmans condition and course of treatment but to answer your question if it was a question there is some sensitivity to ceftriaxone but significantly less than there is to chloramphenicol chloramphenicol can cause aplastic anemia pia said missing springers signal that she was pushing it yes weve taken into account the side effects of course excuse me springer suddenly got to his feet abruptly he left pia talked briefly with one of the residents helping with rothmans and yamamotos care then left the floor pia waited for a few minutes before wandering over to the same resident who was reading a chart what do you think of dr springer do you think hes qualified what do i think hes the best in the country i wouldnt be here otherwise puzzled by the question the resident walked away leaving pia standing by the nurses station alone columbia university medical center new york city march pm news of the rothmanyamamoto event spread rapidly through the columbia medical community george wilson like everyone else had heard about it and he could only imagine the effect it was having on pia concerned he had looked for her it took some searching but george finally managed to track her down she didnt answer her cell phone and neither will nor lesley had seen her so he had had to physically find her george struck gold in the library stacks a place he knew she found comforting after some cajoling pia agreed to go with him back to the dorm cafeteria pia was as distraught as she could ever remember being she was especially upset because her emotions were so conflicted usually in her tumultuous life distress had a definitive cause but now she didnt know whether to be upset about rothmans dire condition or angry at his carelessness in getting infected with the bacteria hed been working on and there was an undercurrent pia was terrified about her own future which she thought shed been so careful about but now seemed to be in the balance she was also furious with herself for allowing rothman to penetrate her wellconstructed protective shell and now she had the added distraction of george who was trying to be solicitous but making things worse with all his questions i cant sit here anymore pia said suddenly interrupting george but she didnt care you havent eaten anything george said looking down at her tray youve got to eat i cant eat pia complained feeling im in control is important to me i dont feel in control my life is coming apart ive got to see rothman i have to security was essential to pia as was control at the moment she felt neither is he allowed to have visitors i dont even know if hes conscious but im not a visitor im concerned about the course of treatment hes on ill come with you george said pia didnt know whether she wanted him to come or not dont you have things to do nothing important i want to help you whatever pia jumped up from the table leaving her tray of food untouched george stuck her turkey sandwich still in its wrapper in his jacket pocket and hustled after pia as she marched to the hospital george trailed along in her wake he tried to talk to her but gave up when she wouldnt answer she was on a mission the floor housing rothman and yamamoto was bustling with staff and orderlies there were few patients in evidence most were too sick to be up and about pia found the resident on duty dr sathi de silva as the sole infectious disease resident she had her hands full not just with her two celebrity patients but a ward full of others and several more people in the emergency room awaiting her attention pia and george were in their medical school white coats so dr de silva accepted them as students most likely on their internal medicine rotation dr de silva took her teaching responsibilities very seriously so when pia started asking questions about dr rothman she stopped what she was doing to answer your question both dr rothman and dr yamamoto are dangerously ill theyre both delirious and uncommunicative i understand theyre on chloramphenicol whats your feeling about such a choice dr de silva shrugged i think its a good choice yes its a unique situation because there are newer antibiotics but in this case we have sensitivity studies that show the involved strains of salmonella to be uniquely sensitive dr springer believes its our best hope were monitoring for side effects but we havent seen anything if there are any problems we can always switch to one of the newer thirdgeneration cephalosporins strange case pia commented one of the strangest dr de silva agreed and not a little ironic do we know how they got infected if we do i havent heard anything i know the cdc epidemiologists went through the lab and particularly the levelthree containment area where the salmonella strain was kept i think their initial concerns were about a malfunction of the hood but apparently it was working fine there was some bacteria in the hood itself but youd expect that they took cultures i know and well get results in twentyfour hours im hearing all this secondhand my job is to look after them of course said pia has the cdc finished with the lab dr springer said an hour ago that most of them were already headed back to atlanta dr de silvas cell phone beeped and she glanced at a text message oops gotta go nice talking with you can we see dr rothman i dont see any harm but youre not going to be seeing much dr de silva said already walking away as i said hes delirious if you do go in just make sure you put on all the gear and dont bring anything out eagerly pia set off toward rothmans room george stumbled after her what are you doing george complained you cant go in there hes sick he cant tell you anything why take a chance pia didnt answer she suited up as per the universal precautions established by the cdc which were posted on the outer door george continued to try to talk pia out of the visit but she ignored him he found a set of protective gear for himself and followed pia into the room as they passed through the door they could feel air entering with them pia walked directly over to the bed several ivs were running each laced with antibiotic dr rothman dr rothman rothman stirred and half opened his eyes dr rothman can you hear me what are you doing georges nerve was failing him on many counts neither of them was on an internal medicine rotation so they had no business or excuse to be there and why was pia trying to talk to dr rothman the man was delirious apart from the trouble they could get into george was nervous about the salmonella that was making dr rothman sick the man looked gravely ill with an ashen coloring and loose strands of hair matted to his pale forehead he doesnt look good at all pia commented tell me about it george said nervously my gosh look hes losing some hair pia pointed to tufts of hair on rothmans pillow but george wasnt interested rothman had become agitated now twisting against his restraints while mouthing some words pia grabbed his chart and was flipping through the pages his temperatures upnot a lot but up nonetheless pia lets go george stagewhispered you go george im not leaving not yet from working with rothman pia had learned a great deal about typhoid fever and its cause salmonella typhi she knew the danger signs of the illness and the fact that the disease attacked the small bowel concentrating in lymphoid tissue in the small intestine called peyers patches rothmans gown was pulled over to one side and pia exposed rothmans abdomen a little more she slowly pushed in on his upper abdomen and rothman squirmed and moved his head from side to side hes definitely showing signs of discomfort maybe pain in his abdomen pia said this is not a good sign george was beside himself he could see a few people passing by in the outer hall through the wireembedded windows in the two doors of the isolation room he walked over and closed the blinds hoping to buy pia some time when pia suddenly let up on the pressure she was exerting rothman reacted slightly to pias surprise as if that caused more discomfort did you see that he recoiled would you say he recoiled pia repeated the maneuver and got the same result he definitely recoiled whatever it is youre doing its going to get both of us kicked out of school if we dont leave right now were pushing the limits on a couple of celebrity patients its rebound tenderness she said its a sign of peritonitis inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity it means the bacteria have penetrated the lining of the small intestine pia reached over and punched the intercom button the nurse at the station picked up is dr de silva available if she is get her in here stat the patient has developed rebound tenderness george was hopping from one foot to the other now shes really done it he thought at once dr de silva came in the room palpated dr rothmans abdomen and confirmed pias finding and look hes losing some hair pia said that could be the chloramphenicol but regardless the rebound tenderness suggests the chloramphenicol is not controlling the infection well have to change the antibiotic ill call springer and get his suggestion thanks for your help dr de silva ducked out of the room hes getting worse pia said looking at rothman forlornly rebound tenderness isnt a good sign i know that george said but youve done all you can do lets go you heard her shes calling springer by the time george and pia took off their gear and got back to the nurses station dr de silva was on the phone with springer pia stood where she could hear dr de silvas half of the conversation it sounded like springer was doing most of the talking okay ceftriaxone she said and the hair loss right of course well stop the chloramphenicol okay ill see you soon and ill call dr miller dr de silva turned and saw pia she hung up the phone and redialed immediately she covered the receiver with her left hand and talked to pia as the phone rang dr springers on his way in he wants to check the rebound tenderness for himselfoh hello i need dr miller dr miller this is dr de silva in infectious diseases im treating dr rothman and dr yamamoto dr springer would like a consult were seeing rebound tenderness in dr rothman and may have to remove the infected bowel no just dr rothman at the moment his temperature is up slightly other levelsblood pressure pulse oxygenationare the same okay thanks dr de silva hung up the phone and exhaled she was a small woman of sri lankan descent who prided herself on running a tight ship she was embarrassed that a medical student had picked up an important sign that shed missed i just checked him a few minutes before you two showed up temperature was holding steady she said half to pia half to herself she turned to pia it can come on very quickly dr miller the chief surgical resident is coming in and dr springers on his way over so whos your preceptor i should at least give you credit for what you found and how did you know what to look for im impressed actually im not on internal medicine at the moment are you on an infectious disease elective if you are i havent heard your name im not on an infectious disease elective either george was desperately trying to get pia to shut up out of dr de silvas line of sight he was frantically making a timeout gesture like a football official well what brought you here dr de silva asked i just happen to know a lot about salmonella really from whom dr rothman pia said as george grabbed her arm and literally pulled her away angling her toward the elevators george felt a sense of relief as they left the hospital with as busy as dr de silva was he hoped she wouldnt say too much about the two mysterious med students one of whom had been very helpful actually he doubted she would he knew that there hadnt been any negligence on dr de silvas part but he knew that in the competitive atmosphere of the academic center she was probably chagrined that shed been in a fashion upstaged by a medical student pia had detected the change in dr rothmans condition before she did but georges relief was shortlived i want to go back to the lab pia said stopping suddenly they had just reached the corner where th street turns into haven avenue i want to see if there are any clues as to why or how he got infected hes so careful i dont understand it hes so detailed and compulsive about his work his organization his technique its all flawless it doesnt make sense still lurking in the back of pias mind was the thought that rothman had infected himself intentionally but why would he involve dr yamamoto it couldnt be the case or could it what she wanted to do was completely eliminate the idea as even a remote possibility if rothman died it was going to be a betrayal of sorts but she didnt want it to be his betrayal betrayal by fate she thought she could ultimately handle personal betrayal by rothman would be something entirely different george groaned inwardly visiting rothman had been bad enough visiting a lab that was offlimits by order of the cdc was something else entirely the lab is closed george said in a fashion that wouldnt brook discussion order of the cdc lets head up to your room i saved the sandwich you didnt eat to prove his point george pulled the food from his pocket im going pia said what on earth do you think youre going to turn up that the cdc hasnt i dont know but i cant do nothing you can come with me or not im going anyway of course two sets of eyes may be better than one george realized pia was asking for his help however indirectly which was a first still it wasnt an easy decision he was okay with bending the rules but not breaking them like this he couldnt afford to get kicked out of medical school it had been his goal as long as he could remember and he had his family to consider but george had no time to ponder his decision pia had already turned around and was heading toward the research building youre not worried about getting typhoid fever he asked catching up to her i was in there this morning and theres protective gear we can put on just like we used in rothmans room pia entered the building george followed it was like making a decision without making a decision they showed their ids to the security man and headed for the elevators as george had expected the door to the lab was crisscrossed with yellow caution tape see just as i expected we cant go in pia didnt respond she merely peeled back the necessary tape and tried the door which was locked it didnt deter her many times over the last three and a half years pia had been asked to take a reading in the lab at night or monitor an automated experiment she took the key shed been given for those eventualities opened the door and stepped over the threshold pia this is crazy george said reluctantly he came in after her it was dark and very quiet relax the security cameras are out theyve been working on them again for days whos going to come in now i just want to check the refrigerated storage facility in the biosafety lab and take a peek at the logbook and before you say it i know the cdc has probably investigated all that they might have even taken the logbook be that as it may i need to make sure they didnt miss anything pia turned on the minimal light necessary it was a small lamp by the communal coffee machine she then quickly checked her own office and rothmans george trailed after her like a shadow as far as she could tell nothing had been disturbed in either office pia pointed out rothmans desk to george the intray the few files the pictureseverything was just so see how orderly he is said pia all george could think about was getting out of there an air circulator kicked on and george jumped half out of his skin he followed pia to the biosafety level room and they donned the protective gear once more pia used the coded punch pad to reach the lab itself since there were no windows pia turned on the overhead lights the ventilation system was still running and there was an eerie calm in the place pia checked the logbook which the cdc had not taken there were the usual entries the next to last one was panjit singh when he went in that morning to set up then there was rothman and yamamotos entry there was nothing abnormal she then went to the refrigerated storage unit using a separate keypad she was about to open it when she heard a noise that caught her attention did you hear that she whispered intently to george hear what george said nervously pia held up a hand and went to the door and cracked it open there were quiet sounds but unmistakablevoices in the lab outside voices getting louder in here cmon she said urgently shit george said under his breath hed heard the voices shit on a brick he mumbled to himself silently but urgently pia waved for him to follow her george saw where they were heading and beat it out through an emergency exit in the far corner of the lab the door complained when he pushed it open as it hadnt been opened since it was installed back when the lab was last renovated it had also been made airtight pia followed close behind george she might have stayed and faced the music had she been there by herself but she was well aware of georges utter fear of authority where that had come from she had no idea the units emergency door led to the lab storeroom where pia and george pulled off their protective gear and stumbled out into the main part of the microbiology department that housed rothmans lab staff on the evening shift at the microbiology clinical lab were curious to see two young people running by then stunned to see them followed a minute later by three figures in full hazmat gear microbiology led into the anatomy department and george and pia crashed through the connecting doors and into the familiar surroundings as firstyear students they had spent a good deal of time in the department george was leading but he didnt know exactly where he was going all he knew was that he wanted to avoid getting caught he ducked into the darkened anatomy room dimly illuminated by nightlights for the benefit of the current firstyear students who were taking anatomy at the time the room was well stocked with cadavers most covered with oilcloth shrouds several torsos sat upright on the head teaching table theyd been cut across the upper chest and then halved in a sagittal section so that half the gullet and half the brain were visible george was eyelevel with the torsos the exposed whites of their eyes seeming to glow in the halflight george and pia ducked behind the long teaching table but there was nowhere to hide a moment after their arrival the banks of ceiling lights flickered and came on three security guards in hazmat suits stormed into the room pia stood up and george very reluctantly followed suit the security men were angry demanding pias and georges identification cards they then made several calls on their radios before turning back to the students george was cowering pia taking it all in stride youre coming with us said the nearest figure to george grasping his arm and marching him out of the room pia was escorted out behind him the group wended their way past the few onlookers in the clinical microbiology lab and down to the street via a service elevator georges mind was racing but he couldnt think of any way pia could talk her way out of this as they walked across the campus the group attracted a lot of stares and comments from passersby some of them wondered if they were watching some medstudent prank george and pia were taken through a featureless corridor in the hospital bowels to the security department they walked past a bank of tv screens being monitored by two boredlooking men down another corridor and into a small office with a handwritten sign on the door duty officer standing up watching a couple of monitors mounted on the wall was david winston the man whod taken charge in the lab earlier that day he recognized pia having helped her when she fainted in the street ah you again i see youre feeling better than when i last saw you mr winston pia said my friend and i were just retrieving some of my belongings from my office winston referred to a list on a clipboard resting on his desk miss grazdani and he looked at george george wilson george wilson not on my list you a fourthyear student as well george nodded well youll be taking antibiotics too winston said folks theres a protocol we use in these situations you broke into a secure potentially contaminated area i actually saw you do it myself sitting right here the cameras might not be operating inside the lab but outside they work just fine so i see two people go into the lab and i have to send three of my guys in full body gear to go in and find you and it turns out to be you two so the protocol is i make a call to the dean of students who loves to hear from me as you might imagine its just a headsup because my next call is to my friends at the thirtythird precinct and ill have a full and frank conversation about criminal trespass george was aghast if the police got involved he was screwed i dont know why you guys went in there and im not going to ask the cdc might have cleared it but the caution tape was still over the door especially you miss grazdani as you were specifically told the lab would be offlimits frankly im dumbfounded but ive never understood medical students since i took over this job heading the centers security pia started to speak but winston held out his hand to silence her and called the dean of students he explained the situation he then listened for a good two minutes and hung up the phone shes coming down i dont know who id rather deal with if i were you the dean or the thirtythird winston showed george and pia into a small side room and closed the door george was too agitated to speak pia started pacing around the room she couldnt sit still after what seemed like an age but was in fact thirty minutes the door opened and a tall darkhaired woman in sweats and a ski jacket came in and shut the door behind her her name was helen bourse she had been dean of students for almost a decade and was well liked but hardly a pushover what the hell did you think you were doing you two have made me cash in more favors than i actually own stopping mr winston from having you arrested i want you to convince me i did the right thing im so sorry mrs bourse george said he took one look at pias defiant face and decided he should speak for the both of them were very sorry so what in gods name were you doing there in a lab that was sealed and potentially contaminated the only part that might have been contaminated was the biosafety unit pia said interrupting george whod started to respond we took the necessary precautions i wanted to look for myself i just cant understand how dr rothman managed to get infected knowing him as i do so you werent picking up your stuff as you told mr winston and what youre suddenly epidemiologists we had a team of actual epidemiologists check out the lab today both from here and from the cdc they combed the place including the biosafety unit what did they find nothing but thats not the point ive been working in there on and off for over three years i wanted to check it out if something was different i might have been able to see it probably better than strangers from atlanta some of bourses vinegar lost its acid she realized that pia had a point still it didnt justify what these two otherwise gifted students had done something totally foolish and out of character after a pause she asked well what did you find nothing but we were interrupted do you have a report from the epidemiologists certainly not from the cdc not yet but i spoke to the head of our own team apparently nothing was found amiss dr bourse knew that dr rothman was closer to this student than to anyone in the whole medical community she knew quite a bit about pia more than she guessed pia surmised bourse had had access to all the deliberations of the admissions committee which she had pored over in great detail up until the call from winston shed had high hopes for her hopes she wanted to maintain for pia bourses intent was to try to keep the damage from the evenings escapade and poor judgment to a minimum such was the burden of being dean of students earlier that evening bourse had had to deal with an even more difficult issue a thirdyear student had been caught stealing prescription drugs from the medical floors bourse turned her attention to the second delinquent at least he met her eye which she couldnt get from pia so whats your excuse she asked george with a certain resignation in her voice no excuses i was helping my friend he said as evenly as he could dr bourse studied george he too was a top student more liked in general than pia who could be considered standoffish bourse was well aware of georges apparent infatuation with pia so she took his excuse at face value once again she marveled at how such an apparently accomplished young man like george could be reduced to such a lovelorn teenager that hed risk his future like this if bourse had allowed winston to have him arrested it could have affected his becoming a doctor all right bourse said she took a deep breath and regarded the ceiling for a moment to clear her head heres what were going to do youre going to go back to your rooms and stay there you wont fraternize with anyone or talk about this episode with anyone youll monitor your temperatures and take your antibiotics as directed george ill make sure you get some and ill see both of you in my office at seven tomorrow morning well discuss your elective then ms grazdani mr wilson tomorrow you will return to radiology both of you will also say a prayer for me and thank the lord that im in a benevolent mood ill now go and square this away with mr winston if i can with the dean out of the room george let out a deep sigh and sat back in his chair oh my god i thought we were dead if the police arent involved its just an internal thing it wont be on our records itll be like this never happened george looked at pia who didnt respond her face was a blank her mind clearly still back at the lab you cant let this drop george questioned of course i cant let it drop pia shot back something had to have happened something out of the ordinary what about one of the technicians messing up either by accident or design i mean rothman was like a bull in the proverbial china shop i imagine there are a lot of people who arent crying tonight about what happened to him pia shook her head there were people in the lab who found him unpleasant but the same people admired him greatly i cant imagine anyone in the lab being involved in any underhanded way so what are you thinking i dont know what to think pia said her mind was swirling her first concern was whether or not rothman would pull through at the same time she was reconsidering the two possibilities for what had happened rothman contaminated himself by accident or he did it deliberately but then another idea started to take shape in her mind she realized there was a third possibility she hadnt yet considered columbia university medical center new york city march am although it was only a little after five in the morning pia finally quit trying to go back to sleep and got out of bed the previous night shed returned to her dorm room from the security office exhausted mentally and physically before she and george went to their respective rooms he gave her the turkey sandwich that hed saved it was flattened to a degree but still recognizably a sandwich once back in her room shed eaten a corner of it then threw the rest in the trash and went to bed hoping to get some rest shed not slept well but at least she couldnt remember her dreams pia showered quickly and dressed she understood how essential it was to her future that rothman pull through despite the hour she knew she had to go over to the hospital to check and make sure he was okay her hope was that the new antibiotic had worked wonders and was controlling his infection in that case she further hoped that his delirium had cleared up and she could have a word with him she wanted to ask him if he had any idea what had happened in the biosafety lab the previous morning emerging from the dorm onto haven avenue pia felt conspicuously lonely it was morning although not yet light she felt like the only person in the world as she made her way over to the hospital once inside it was different as the hospital never slept quickly she made her way up to the infectious disease wing when she got to the ward she was perplexed she felt she must have gotten turned around because the room she thought was rothmans was being disinfected in preparation for its next inhabitant but no this was his room so rothman had been moved perhaps because he was showing signs of improvement following the new course of treatment pia didnt allow herself to think that anything else could be the case she checked yamamotos room his room was also being cleaned hed been moved as well pia turned around and went back to the nurses station to find out where dr rothman and dr yamamoto had been sent the station was humming even at that time of the morning in preparation for the shift change at seven excuse me pia said to one of the night nurses standing at the counter filling out one of the millions of forms they were required to do im looking for dr rothman and dr yamamoto suddenly pia felt nauseous and an overwhelming sense of panic rose within her they werent moved because they got better please tell me where they are pia pleaded hoping against hope and who are you are you related to dr rothman im dr rothmans medical student please where is he the nurse took pia by the arm and walked her away from the busy nurses station into the waiting room which was empty at that hour she didnt turn the light on and the two women stood in the semidarkness pia was worried her legs were going to give out and she would collapse on the floor like a rag doll listen we only just told the families the nurse said im sorry they both passed dr rothman first then dr yamamoto about an hour ago what do you mean they passed pia asked but intellectually she knew what the nurse meant but just maybe they died sweetheart im sorry dr rothman died being prepped for surgery thats all i know thats all i can tell you look i have to go the nurse put her hand on pias arm and left the room pia went down on her haunches her mouth open in a silent scream she clasped her arms around her knees and pulled herself tight into a ball as if she were trying to hide somewhere within her own body pia felt like shed been punched in the gut she was disoriented and angryangry at the hospital angry at the world angry at rothman himself if she was going to judge a man by his actions what had he done shed been abandoned betrayed pia stumbled out of the room and off the ward descended in the elevator walked outside in a daze the sky was now light in the east but the sun had yet to make it up over the horizon columbia university medical center new york city march am pia staggered down fort washington avenue like a drunk clutching her stomach thinking she was about to throw up she stopped by a garbage can but she was only able to bend over the rim and dryheave a couple of times pia stood up and breathed deeply in and out she had to get a grip on herself but what was she going to do there was an immediate issue to contend with and she was almost grateful for the distraction she remembered that she and george had to see the dean of students at seven so she went to the dorm to find george george had set his alarm for he was accustomed to sleeping soundly even if the rigors of medical school meant it might be for only three or four hours at a time but last night hed been unable to sleep save for brief snippets constantly turning over the events of the evening in his mind at one point hed given up and sat for almost an hour in the semicomfortable armchair by the window and nursed a glass of jack daniels from a bottle that had lasted through his whole medical school career through the window he could see a portion of the george washington bridge and a bit of the new jersey hudson river waterfront he was totally confused and humiliated about his motivations last night pia had come desperately close to wrecking all of georges plans george stopped himself it really wasnt pias doing that he had tagged along with her he had to take some responsibility the problem was that he cared about her too much to let her blindly charge into these predicaments by herself and whether she acknowledged it or not she needed his help still he knew there was a point where hed have to stop and put his own interests first he just didnt know where that point would be hed been asleep for only a little more than an hour when the alarm went off and george unknowingly swept his hand over the snooze button nine minutes later he did it again and he would have done it a third time if pias knocking hadnt woken him up he was pleased to see her until he saw the look on her face and realized there was something wrong what happened wait what time is it weve got the dean pia walked into the room like a reanimated zombie and fell fulllength on georges bed she mumbled something into georges pillow whats wrong george saw what time it was and started to get dressed after a few seconds he went over to the bed and sat on the edge and moved a few strands of hair from pias cheek she was a basket case tell me he said quietly hes dead theyre both dead who rothman yamamoto yes oh pia im sorry im so sorry george laid his hand on pias shoulder pia i dont know what to say god this is really a tragedy from what youve told me they were on the verge of something huge what a setback for regenerative medicine probably years maybe even a decade theres no one to fill their shoes pia was silent george removed his hand she turned to look up at him her face no longer looked blank just angry right now i dont give a flying fuck about the future of regenerative medicine jesus pia sprang up from the bed and stormed out of the room george followed her tucking in his shirt at first he couldnt see her but heard footfalls receding down the stairs pia wait up george ran down the street after pia who was speedwalking toward the deans office he caught up with her and jogged alongside pia pia waved her hand dismissing george look im sorry she stopped dead in her tracks clenched her fists with her arms by her sides and let out a low scream in exasperation she turned and looked george right in the eye george dont tell me youre sorry please just shut up with that she walked off and left george standing in the street like a justdumped lover georges shoulders fell condolences clearly werent his strong suit although he hardly thought he deserved such a brushoff he thought back to his long night of selfexamination if this woman needed him especially now she sure had a funny way of showing it columbia university medical center new york city march am pia and george arrived separately at the suite of offices of the dean of students they were each buzzed in by the dean herself as the secretary due in at eight had yet to arrive they sat at either end of the leather couch outside the office proper avoiding eye contact not saying anything for pia such silences came naturally while for george whod happily talk to anyone it was a strain not to communicate at the same time he had no wish to be told to shut up again by pia which was what he was certain would happen since all he wanted to do was apologize again for inadvertently upsetting her it was part of his nature to feel responsible a few minutes after the hour helen bourse emerged from her office thank you for being on time this morning bourse said beckoning pia and george to follow her she gestured to a couple of straightbacked chairs for them to sit in she had seen a note in pias file which shed read overnight written by a particularly zealous clinical preceptor during her secondyear introduction to surgery it said that pia had difficulty arriving on time for earlymorning appointments even after being admonished that such behavior was not tolerated in surgery although it was usually only about five to ten minutes it was consistent and the preceptor indicated that she thought it was a serious lapse dr bourse sat down and regarded her two students to begin im afraid i have some very bad news her voice had the gravity appropriate to the situation theres no way to say this other than just to say it doctors rothman and yamamoto both died this morning they were being prepped for surgery for rapidly developing peritonitis but they didnt make it i know pia said how do you know dr bourse was confused she had just learned it herself i went to the infectious disease unit this morning i woke up early i thought maybe the new antibiotic would have had an effect but i was told they had died dr bourse stared at pia whose voice sounded as if all the fight had gone out of her she could see that the young womans eyes were rimmed with emotion and fatigue dr bourse sighed here was yet another example of pias marked willfulness as she herself had told both pia and george in no uncertain terms to go back to their rooms check their temperatures regularly and stay there until this meeting yet pia had willfully ignored the order dr bourse sighed again still looking directly at pia whose eyes were as usual diverted okay ill try to overlook the fact that i told you to stay in your dorm room i gather you went to the hospital because of your closeness with dr rothman pia nodded she had an urge to admit that for her rothman had morphed into the father she never had but she held her tongue it wasnt in her to be forthright with her secrets at least you made no attempt to go back to the lab or did you george looked quickly at pia worried the thought that pia might try to go back to the lab without him had not occurred to george no i didnt pia said quietly and george exhaled did you both check your temperatures as i asked both students nodded although george had had to abandon his thermometer when pia flew out of his room that morning and i assume everything was fine okay rothmans and yamamotos deaths are a blow to everyone here at the medical center particularly the school i knew dr yamamoto a little and he was a fine colleague dr rothman i knew better of course and i understand you got along well with him miss grazdani he certainly took a keen interest in your progress and afforded you more privileges than he did other students and any fellows thought dr bourse i viewed that interest as a compliment to your abilities as a researcher and to the potential that dr rothman recognized in you pia was staring at the ground of course its terribly ironic that dr rothman who spent so much time uncovering the pathogenicity of salmonella should die from the same organism hed come to understand so well bourse let the thought drift so miss grazdani i have arranged for you to do research starting today with dr roselyn gorin who is one of the most talented people on campus she has a lasker prize as you may know and shes doing absolutely groundbreaking work on the differentiation of stem cells into specific adult cells roselyn is a friend of mine shes a wonderfully warm and understanding person i just talked with her ten minutes ago and shes very happy to take you on happys not the right word in these circumstances but shes very willing to help dr bourse smiled hopefully today i cant possibly start today pia said george winced as it was apparent to him that dr bourses first reaction was of intense irritation dr bourse paused in order to gain control of her emotions as she was as irritated as george had sensed roselyn was a friend but in fact she hadnt been overjoyed about taking on a new student especially rothmans student who had built up a reputation of her own fairly or not dr bourse wanted to tell pia to get her act together but she held her tongue im very grateful for what youve done pia said quickly trying to sound sincere really she added as if she sensed she was pushing it but i just got this news an hour ago and i really cant think straight i need a couple of days to get my head together dr bourse sighed again pia was not the easiest individual to get along with at the same time what she was saying was undoubtedly true everyone at the center was going to be shaken by the deaths dr yamamoto was a very popular presence and even if few could tolerate rothman on a oneonone basis his death was still a blow especially under these circumstances he was after all the centers scientific celebrity okay miss grazdani today is thursday monday morning first thing i shall expect you to resume your responsibilities as a fourthyear medical student i am also reminding you to stay away from dr rothmans laboratory this is compassionate leave not an opportunity for you to play epidemiologist again we have real epidemiologists who are qualified to do the work do you understand pia nodded please say i understand dr bourse said she wanted to be absolutely clear i understand pia said almost inaudibly mr wilson youll return to radiology today absolutely dean george said cutting her off and you will also cease enabling miss grazdani perhaps you might want to ask yourself why you with a hitherto spotless record are drawn into the kind of behavior we saw last night gnothi seautondo you know what that means it means know thyself and its something that we as physicians need to remember always i doubt that it was your idea mr wilson to break into dr rothmans lab and i hope that in the future you will let your actions be guided more by your intellect than by your idby your cerebrum more than your hypothalamus george eagerly nodded agreement everyone clear dr bourse said pia and george nodded in unison well thank you you can go dr bourse watched george hold the door open for pia who left without acknowledging george she acted as if george holding the door for her was a matter of right dr bourse sat at her desk for a few minutes of contemplation since a large part of her job was to get to know her population of medical students at the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons she thought about the strange relationship between pia and george of course fraternization between students was not necessarily encouraged nor was it discouraged provided it did not interfere with performance in this romance it was pretty obvious what he saw in her as she was the source of considerable gossip around the center as a particularly beautiful intelligent but enigmatic young woman what wasnt so clear was whether there was any reverse attraction relations between staff and students on the other hand were officially frowned upon but it was difficult to enforce a ban when the parties were all consenting adults and the students mostly in their late twenties there had been persistent rumors concerning pia grazdani and dr rothman again pias exotic beauty and obvious intelligence were lost on few people but what she might possibly have seen in him was beyond most peoples comprehension but nothing was ever substantiated and while there was every reason to believe that dr rothman had given his student significant responsibilities and privileges there was never any evidence that he had done so inappropriately and now dr bourse thought the conundrum of their relationship would just have to remain one of lifes little mysteries columbia university medical center new york city march pm after leaving the deans office pia spent the rest of the morning stewing in her room her feelings were in absolute turmoil emotions and thoughts swirling in and out of her consciousness so that one minute she felt utterly depressed the next she was sharp and motivated she was still angry at rothman for getting sick and also at springer the chief of infectious diseases for letting rothman die which she believed he did by selecting an outdated antibiotic despite the supposed sensitivity testing that rothman himself had done and why did it have to be her a lowly fourthyear medical student who made the diagnosis of the incipient peritonitis the onset of which had heralded the mans death but most acutely pia knew she was devastated by the simple fact that rothman was dead she was depressed at the thought of what it meant to her future pia had a lot of practice at dispassionately breaking down a situation and identifying how it affected her it was the emotional aspects of her state of mind that she struggled with the most pia had been completely convinced by rothmans argument that she wasnt suited to clinical medicine since she actually didnt like most people especially when they were sick and complaining about it she had little sympathy for illness and none at all for any kind of complaining at one point during her residency after thirtysix hours without sleep she had had to take blood from a patient a toughlooking young policeman who was deathly afraid of needles as the man wriggled and squirmed and pia couldnt for the life of her find a vein she told him to quit whining like a baby fortunately no one overheard her and the man didnt complain although the staff did wonder why he made such an effort to avoid pia for the rest of his stay with rothman gone she didnt know if she had it in her to follow through with getting a phd which was a requirement if she was serious about pursuing a future in research most of all the nagging issue of what had happened to rothman wouldnt leave her alone and she mulled it over continuously it could have been an accident she knew but it seemed very unlikely knowing rothman as well as she did he was too careful too compulsive and the two of them getting sick simultaneously it didnt make sense but the alternatives seemed equally unlikely especially the idea that he did it deliberately the only other possibility namely the idea that someone else did it deliberately like panjit who might have had the opportunity seemed even more unlikely the longer pia sat in her room the more agitated she became and the more motivated to take some action but what she paced around the room as best she could given the close confines of the living area she lay on her bed but that was intolerable she thought about calling will or lesley but she didnt know what she would say to them she walked down the corridor to the soda machine but she didnt want anything to drink her mind was buzzing racing overheating suddenly pia knew what she could do to get herself centered to regain some focus george had been hanging around offering to help she thought there was something he could do for her as hed done a few times in the past george wasnt so different from any other man shed ever encountered but each time it had happened when pia thought george would have been put off by her needs there he was back again the next day pia imagined that george would be on his lunch break one of the benefits of a rotation in something predictable like radiology or pathology there was a predictable schedule she wanted to call him but she couldnt find her cell phone and when she did find it in the pocket of her coat she saw that the battery was dead she plugged the phone into the charger and called george catching him as she had hoped on his way over to the cafeteria i was going to swing by later to make sure you were okay george said they hadnt parted on the best of terms after meeting with the dean and georges perennial insecurity about pia had surfaced again you offered to help is that still the case or are you still mad at me for getting you in trouble im not mad at you im just worried about you pia rolled her eyes so youll help me this was awkward pia wanted george to say yes ill be right over instead he said not if it means going back up to the lab no george what id like you to do is come over here for a few minutes right now right now george i assume youre on lunch break okay george said ill be right there pia prepared almost to the minute of his expected arrival there was a knock on pias door she pulled it fully open georges eyes sprang open to their fullest extent he was clearly taken aback nervously he glanced up and down the dorm hallway to make sure no one could see what he could pia was standing in the open doorway buck naked this isnt quite what i expected he managed as pia pulled him into the room she was shockingly deliberate as she had been on previous occasions and again as on those previous occasions he didnt resist under the circumstances she was a force greater than him and he was powerless pia grabbed at the belt in georges pants and he obliged she then pulled his sweater and tshirt over his head pia pushed him onto the bed and handed him a condom just as she had on the other occasions he was readyachingly soand pia got up on him immediately she closed her eyes and looked up rocking herself rhythmically and hard against him he knew it was simply sex that she was looking for the endorphin rush and she found it fast shuddering slightly as she did so as soon as she was finished pia put her hands on georges chest and slipped off him she looked right at him but it was like she didnt see him thanks i needed that she said she walked over to her bathroom turned on the shower and after a couple of seconds jumped in george put his hands behind his head and looked down at himself for a few beats he then slipped off the condom walked into the bathroom and flushed it away from a birth control perspective it had been a waste pia had finished showering and was toweling off george couldnt help but admire her athletic body exquisitely shaped breasts and deep flawless honeycolored skin would it kill you to kiss me george was bemused he didnt know what to think he was being used he knew and didnt understand why i dont like kissing doesnt do anything for me george could tell pias mind was already elsewhere there was no point in him saying well what about me he could hear her reply what about you george didnt know what else to say each time they had sex george hoped it meant theyd made a breakthrough that their relationship had climbed out of its curiously stalled state into a level of true intimacy but it had never been the case nor was it now she was a train running on a totally separate track in many respects his role was irrelevant as if it could have been anyone lying there thanks pia repeated airily as she passed him coming out of the bathroom there was no modesty whether pretend or real in her upbringing there had never been an opportunity for even pretense what for i didnt do anything no you did really youve given me a reboot like what needs to be done with a modem once in a while youve made it possible for me to see what i have to do rather than sit here paralyzed is that what it was i want i want us george felt like that hopeless teenager again pia was dressing quickly george was standing naked and felt very selfconscious he slipped on his boxers so tell me what are you going to do get in more trouble i expect what does that mean you should just leave george my problem is i dont think rothman was treated correctly whether people believe it or not there was something wrong about how he got sick and there was something wrong about how he was treated chloramphenicol its almost never prescribed these days thirdgeneration cephalosporins are where its at now so why give him something old that potentially causes truly catastrophic side effects you told me yourself they used it because of rothmans own sensitivity studies thats what they said he shouldnt have died period yet he was dead within what fifteen sixteen hours he got sicker in the hospitalthere was no delay in treatment he was taken straight to the ward right after he showed the first symptoms i think the treatment made him worse okay i understand youre frustrated said george but the dean told you directly not to interfere not to play epidemiologist do you want to get kicked out of here in your fourth year ive got time off im not sitting here ill lose my mind im going to talk to springer about the treatment and why it didnt work no one said i couldnt talk to him springer everyone knows he hates med students by reputation he was second only to rothman you pull him as a preceptor for your rotation in internal medicine and half the students try to switch within a week and the other half are lining up on the roof to jump off the building not to mention the fact that youve already pissed him off dont worry george ill be my normal diplomatic self thats exactly what im worried about columbia university medical center new york city march pm as pia sat and sat in the narrow waiting room of dr helmut springer her determination to see him didnt waver her tryst with george had succeeded in establishing in her mind what she needed to do she had a burning need to know two things the reason why dr rothman became sick was one issue another was why the vaunted and lauded columbia medical staff had in her mind apparently screwed up his treatment she knew she was only a fourthyear medical student but from her perspective she couldnt come up with a compelling reason why dr rothman and dr yamamoto should have died at all let alone died less than a day after the men were admitted to the infectious disease ward at the hospital it wasnt as if they were in some backwoods operationthis was one of the absolute premier medical institutions in the world though springer probably wouldnt be happy to see her she was hopeful that if she talked with him he could aid her quest to find out what had happened he was after all a worldrenowned infectious disease specialist she knew his reputation of not treating medical students with anything close to respect and she knew their meeting the day before had not ended well still she was optimistic if he didnt know that she was the one who first recognized rothmans incipient peritonitis she was going to tell him herself thinking it should count for something after fortyfive minutes of waiting springers receptionist finally announced to pia that the doctor could see her now pia quickly entered his office springer was at his desk facing into the small room there were no other chairs it was springers way of keeping meetings short dr springer im sorry to bother you again and i know i annoyed you the last time we met i apologize for all that but im a medical student and if i cant learn from my experiences then im a pretty poor excuse for one and i apologize for questioning yes yes springer said cutting pia off midstream her apologies sounded rehearsed and there was nothing resembling contrition in her eyes worst of all his schedule was completely full with residents at that moment awaiting his arrival in the emergency room he cleared his throat from our last chat i suspect you believe you know better than some of the foremost authorities in the land what has taken place here well i want to disabuse you of that notion also id like to say that i wouldnt have even taken the time to see you this morning were it not for the fact that you discovered the early signs of peritonitis in dr rothman dr de silva told me about a medical student who she assumed was on rotation catching rebound tenderness in dr rothmans abdomen which had not presented itself previously well overlook the fact that this medical student was not in fact on rotation and had essentially broken into the ward and was wholly unauthorized to approach the patients of course i later learned that this medical student was yourself it took pia a couple of seconds to realize that springer was paying her a slight compliment even if it was cloaked in a sardonic reprimand pia took it as an opening i fully admit it was and perhaps i shouldnt have been there she said but it was an important discovery with important consequences the man was clearly getting worse which makes one wonder why the original antibiotic was chosen please springer said his face empurpling this is where we left off last time i just indicated that we were grateful for your help and now youre back with this nonsense i cant win again there is nothing to indicate that chloramphenicol wasnt doing the best job under the circumstances and as we have said about fifty times we were informed by the sensitivity studies carried out by dr rothman himself that it was the correct choice of antibiotic we are working under the assumption that dr rothmans work in the study was as thorough and accurate as was customary pia couldnt believe what she was hearing was springer attempting to shift some of the responsibility onto rothman in this case it seemed especially crass to even suggest blaming the victim so how come considering those sensitivity studies neither dr rothman nor dr yamamoto showed any sign of response to the chosen antibiotic springer closed his eyes for a moment the answer to your question is simple the virulence of the involved strain of salmonella overwhelmed both the antibiotic and the patients defenses remember antibiotics contrary to myth do not cure it is the patients immune system that cures obviously with rothman and yamamoto their immune systems were completely overwhelmed simple as that pia started to respond but springer cut her off listen weve been over this issue and let me add that a department head at this hospital does not have this kind of conversation with a medical student a department head does not have this kind of conversation at allthere are protocols to be observed there are panels that are convened if there are questions about the diagnosis or treatment its not clear in this case that there are any questions jesus why am i justifying myself to you this is not how we conduct business around here pia wasnt picking up on springers rising sense of outrage she had him in the room and she wanted answers why werent rothman and yamamoto being monitored more closely they were being monitored extremely closely each had his own nurse closely how did it happen that a medical student had to pick up on the signs of developing peritonitis that was a fluke it would have been picked up very quickly trust me now is there anything else i can help you with any other hospital policy you might want to critique for me springers sarcasm was lost on pia this case confuses me pia continued in fact its one of the worst cases of salmonella or typhoid that ive ever come across in your vastly broad experience springer said in my experience yes well what are you alluding to im sure youre alluding to something so enlighten me please one of the first things they told us when we got here was about diagnosis when you hear galloping hoofbeats you should think of horses not zebras yes of course its the oldest saw in medicine what about it should we be looking for zebras here dr springer we are not looking for anything here ms grazdani but i am dying to know what it is that you are looking for so enlighten me again okay is it possible that this case represents some exotic form of an antibodyantigen reaction the body can have like a shwartzman reaction in which case would it not have made sense to use decadron or some similar antiinflammatory agent something potent to try to head it off at the pass if that is your great revelation well im sorry to say its not much of one because we used decadron in the evening when it became clear that the two researchers were approaching extremis perhaps you should review the patients charts before making accusations like that of course if i had been given access to the charts i wouldnt have made the mistake but im not making accusations i just want to get to the truth dr springer we all do ms grazdani springer was suddenly overcome with fatigue talking with pia grazdani was frustrating and he had more people he was going to have to deal with that afternoon who were going to be even more of a burden there would be the inevitable press and the patients families it was not going to be a good day since ultimately it was the patients he cared about do you think perhaps there could have been yet another bacteria involved besides salmonella a bacteria or a virus that was being covered or camouflaged by the salmonella and maybe it was this bacteria that was totally resistant to chloramphenicol and was the real killer there was silence while springer tried to control his anger this was simply too much his eyes drilled into pias while she maintained her composure waiting for an answer while looking down at her feet finally springer exploded with bottledup emotion i cannot for the life of me imagine a more ridiculous scenario we made the diagnosis by fulfilling kochs hypothesis the illness was caused by salmonella whose presence we ascertained in multiple ways but most convincingly from blood culture we classified the strain in multiple ways as well particularly by dna analysis the offending organism was without an ounce of doubt the alpha strain of salmonella typhi that rothman himself had had grown in space with the cooperation of nasa there was no other pathogen for christs sake the blood cultures only grew out the salmonella nothing else nothing at all undaunted pia changed the subject on a dime what about the hair loss does serious salmonella infection cause hair loss springer was having difficulty controlling himself yet the woman seemed completely calm the stress of almost any severe illness particularly one presenting with high fever can cause hair loss anyway what hair loss are you talking about i saw hair loss with rothman before i discovered the rebound tenderness the resident suggested it could be attributed to the chloramphenicol thats not something i am aware of he said and then suddenly and angrily oh for gods sake you wait here springer bounded out of his desk chair pushed past pia and disappeared pia stood in the room and waited within a few minutes springer reappeared and sat down giving pia a nasty look thinking she had probably maximized what she was going to get out of the conversation pia eyed the door i told you to wait springer said stay there confused pia did as she was told there was silence except for springers labored breathing the mans boiling she thought im not getting anywhere pia eyed the door again dr springer i sincerely thank you for your time stay where you are springer said brusquely pia rolled her eyes confused first he cant wait to get rid of me now he wants me to stay then bursting through the door came dr helen bourse dean of students ah dean bourse its simply not possible for me to do my job if i am to be hounded by a medical student who thinks she should be running my department she goes onto the floor and sees patients with no authorization which i am sure could open us up to all manner of liability issues she repeatedly questions my medical ability and secondguesses decisions that were made and now shes come up with an outlandish suggestion that we might have completely missed another organism which was responsible for rothmans and yamamotos untimely deaths first it was the choice of antibiotic now its a second pathogen this is outrageous and it has to stop pia looked at springer and she was unable to conceal the contempt she was feeling he had run off like a coward and got the dean to come tell her off she glanced at bourse who was standing arms akimbo a hard expression on her face she was angry and dumbfounded i would like dr springer to understand that im not trying to do his job pia said in her defense im just trying to answer some questions that i would have thought were important ones my sense here is that something is wrong neither springer nor bourse could believe the gall of the young woman the question in both of their minds who the hell does she think she is springer found his voice first do you see what im talking about this woman is off the wall im going to talk with groekest about the advisability of rescinding the position she was offered here as a residentphd candidate this is absurd at the mention of the chief of the internal medicine department helen bourse signaled with a snap of her head that pia should leave springers office pia was happy to oblige bourse then nodded to springer to indicate that she had the situation under control ill get back to you sorry about this bourse then followed pia out of the office and into the hallway pia might be temporarily unbalanced but springer was a bully and hed made his point before pia had a chance to say anything bourse lit into her what the hell do you think youre doing when we spoke this morning and i gave you time to get your head together i dont believe i said you should go see dr springer and belabor the head of infectious diseases about his patients or his diagnosis where is your social sense good grief woman its common knowledge that springer is not a fan of medical students in general but this episode has pushed him over the edge i have never heard him as exasperated as he was when he called pia started to speak but bourse wasnt done with her youre fast developing a reputation as a troublemaker ms grazdani and that will not look good on your resume if it gets recorded you are here essentially as a guest of the institution and guests do not behave like this if they do theyre usually asked to leave i gave you a couple of days to get over the tragic death of your mentor and that wasnt supposed to be time for you to come in here and stir things up again but dont you think these questions need to be answered no i dont not if he doesnt bourse said gesturing at the door pia started to speak again but the dean had had enough have you shown any signs of a fever no then get yourself back to your room if i hear youre causing any more trouble over this unfortunate affair i will think seriously about rescinding your welcome here as a medical student which would be something of a tragedy for you considering you only have a couple of months left before you graduate and it would be a tragedy for us because wed be admitting we made a mistake in taking you in the first place i dont think dr springer will go to dr groekest on his own but he might so be careful young lady you are now officially on very thin ice i must not have made myself clear last time we spoke am i making myself clear now yes said pia perfectly columbia university medical center new york city march pm for pia being in trouble was as natural as breathing in and out shed spent most of her life under some kind of probationary supervision undertaken by people who didnt know her care to know her or understand her situation long ago pia had wondered how it was that she was the one who ended up in front of some panel or other she never instigated the trouble she was always reacting to someone older and more powerful trying to take advantage somehow that fact got lost in the paperwork more often than not it was only she who suffered the inquisition and the punishment that followed for her injustice belonged with pain on the same oneway street by the time she reached age twelve pia had simply stopped questioning the way of the world as it concerned her this was just how it was and how it was going to be over the years shed come to know how the individuals of influence in her life operated dr springer was a familiar type he was fiercely protective of his own reputation and would adopt any position that protected him even at the expense of reason and fact quick to take offense springer had no backbone when pia pushed back and kept pushing springer literally ran away he went and found someone who did have some fortitudedr bourseand he hid behind her bourse was a different proposition she wasnt afraid pia could see that and she wasnt willing to take the easy way out and simply dispense with the problempiawhich she could have done pia had spent the afternoon anxiously mulling over springers behavior shed learned nothing there was also the fact that no one seemed concerned about the medical issues she was raising which couldnt help but fan pias semiparanoid belief that the medical center and the infectious diseases department in particular hadnt looked after rothman and yamamoto properly and how could anyone prove that some medical center personnel had nothing to do with their getting sick in the first place pia was starting to consider the idea that some kind of coverup might be under way orchestrated by dr springer and rothman was still emotionally in her head if she hadnt let him take such an influential role in her life she wouldnt have found herself in her current predicament if you let people into your life she thought you were bound to hurt sooner or later a knock on her door jolted pia out of her agitated state it was george who else what happened with springer i was so worried i couldnt concentrate all day it was a disaster im sorry im also sorry i didnt offer to go with you really i am you shouldnt have to do this all by yourself george stop saying youre sorry please besides i never expected you to come with me in fact i never gave it a thought and after what happened im glad you didnt come springer was a lot angrier at me than he was the first time he went and fetched the dean to tell me to stop interfering and he threatened to go to groekest if i didnt so are you going to going to what stop interfering how can i theyre the ones interfering covering things up not me theyre sitting on something im sure of it if you dont mind me saying so that sounds rather paranoid so be it and remember even paranoid people have real enemies so you got confronted by the dean again afraid so what did she do bawled me out bigtime gave me a lecture about being a troublemaker threatened to have me kicked out of school shit george commented pia checked her watch actually i was just about to go back to rothmans lab im just waiting until its late enough i dont want to run into anyone especially not the dean pia the last time i looked the dean isnt working security they have a whole staff for that and they caught us in about five minutes the last time we went to the lab bourse made it pretty clear youre not supposed to go back to the lab now shes spoken to you a second time maybe theyre right you are crazy i think i have an aptitude for science george there are facts here evidence that doesnt add up no scientist is going to just walk away from that then tell me this what are you going to do when you get kicked out of this place that would make you an exscientist or not even more like an exalmostqualified scientist i dont think theres a great deal of demand for them in the job market today youre going to graduate in a couple of months if youre lucky yes rothmans death is a bad experience a terrible one but you might be compounding it and throwing away a career before its even started career right now i dont see that i have a career and i couldnt live with myself if i gave up now do you know if rothmans lab is still officially closed how would i know well i do know its closed to you the epidemiologists must be done by now pia said ignoring georges point if theyre not still checking the place out theres no reason i cant go i do have stuff i left in there the dean was upset that we went in when it was still officially closed if its still officially closed i wont go in i promise but if its not offlimits i will at the very least i need to check the contents of that storage freezer in the levelthree biosafety unit which we didnt get a chance to do last night remember im one of the few people who knows the code that spaulding uses in the logbook for the storage freezer i want to be sure that all the samples that should be in the freezer are in the right place whos spaulding the head lab technician rothman and spaulding used to argue about the state of the storage freezer rothman thought the freezer was a mess spaulding disagreed rothman was thinking of sacking him but that wasnt unusualeveryone thought they were about to get fired spaulding was the only one who pushed back this is all very interesting and maybe you might find something is amiss in the storage facility but even if you did then what remember its not rothmans lab anymore all that is history unfortunately and youre going to be history if you keep doing what youre doing and are you really suggesting that the senior lab tech might have had something to do with rothmans death thats crazy actually i dont know what im thinking i do have some wild ideas like these two scientists plotted together to carry off a dual suicide george looked at pia with consternation im kidding im kidding but there are so many things bouncing around inside my head right now so many theories and i cant rule anything out maybe its something someone didnt do rather than what they did dowhat do they call that a sin of omission not commission the only thing i know is that something about this whole situation is not right of course the whole situation isnt right piatwo people died that can never be right but it doesnt mean there cant be a simple and logical explanation for why it happened pia thought for a moment she considered opening up to george and talking about herself and her state of mind but that was something she had always been loath to do that was what she had done with rothman and look where it had gotten her she glanced at georges face hed been looking at her the whole time she had been mostly looking at the floor he looked less eager than usual and more serious pia took a deep breath she decided shed at least try i dont want to think rothman had anything to do with his own illness but id like to be sure if he did it will mean that he let me down in a real way he betrayed me rothman was very important to me and its hard for me to admit that anyone has such an influence on my life now hes gone i feel like im starting at square one and i dont want it to be his fault george nodded but he was having a very hard time understanding pias reasoning even if rothman accidentally infected himself why would that mean she should think less of him that he betrayed her it was rothmans idea to start the research track of my training and it was going to be under his direction whos going to do that for me now i was going to be working in his lab for my phd where am i going to go now once again ive been abandoned george was a little taken aback at what sounded like selfcenteredness in the face of rothmans and yamamotos deaths im sure the university will find you another lab he said they found you another rotation will and lesley are already doing theirs maybe theyll find me one maybe they wont george hesitated for a moment he knew there was a risk pia would take what he was about to say the wrong way but he decided to say it anyway pia im sorry but i dont understand how rothman could have betrayed you as you put it he got sick and died its tough for me to understand you sometimes i dont think you should insert yourself into this where you dont have to if youre now thinking rothmans death wasnt an accident and that theres a coverup going on i dont see any other way for this to end but badly unless its true youre talking about murder who would want to murder one of the best research teams in the country turning it over in his mind george could think of only one reason why someone would be so willing to risk their career without blinking an eye he knew for sure this line of reasoning was going to get him into trouble look its none of my business and ive never said anything to you that would make you think i was jealous of any other guy er getting close to you but your relationship with rothman well george was cut off by pias loud laugh oh god is that why you think im caught up in all this you think i was sleeping with rothman no well yes maybe i dont know it might explain why youre so worked up about it its what some people are saying on campus so i have to be sleeping with a guy to care about how he died thanks a lot george i did let him get close to me but not like that typical male ill say it if it helps no there was nothing physical between me and dr rothman zip believe me i can tell when a man is interested in me like that and he wasnt he was actually happily married and devoted to his family despite how asocial he seemed pia was steamed and george didnt know what to say the thought hed expressed had taken on a life of its own in his mind but as soon as he had voiced it he knew it was very unlikely now he was just embarrassed hed even mentioned it all right that does it im going to the lab pia said i really do have stuff there that i need to get i worked there for more than three and a half years and dont worry if its offlimits ill come right back like a good girl and if it isnt then ill check out the storage freezer and get my stuff ill walk over to the med center and wait for you in the library you dont have to do that after springer its the least i can do really i guess i cant stop you george knew that was as close to an invite as he was going to get columbia university medical center new york city march pm pia and george walked over to the black research building and passed through security with their medical student ids they were bucking the tide as it was past five oclock and most of the staff was streaming out having finished work for the day pia and george parted at the elevators with pia telling george she would come find him in the library when shed finished her visit in the elevator pia was glad george wasnt with her shed be able to do what she wanted more quickly without him she was pleased but not surprised that the caution tape was gone from the lab entrance more good news the door was unlocked meaning the lab was officially back to normal but the positive feelings were shortlived when she saw that a few of the familiar denizens of the lab had taken the same opportunity to show up and get on with whatever business was pressing marsha langman was tidying up her desk its previous pristine neatness a victim of cdc investigators who had gone through most of the labs records unfortunately the head technician arthur spaulding was also there for similar reasons trying to get everything back to normal seeing spaulding was a disappointment his presence precluded her plan to visit the biosafety lab if he saw her particularly if he saw her in the refrigerator storage facility he would undoubtedly make a scene pia cursed under her breath that she hadnt gotten into the lab before any of the others neither marsha nor spaulding nor any of the other technicians who were there greeted her or obviously snubbed herit was like she wasnt there at all it surprised her because they were all going through the same trauma involving their bosses deaths it was like they were a group of automatons pia headed toward the open door leading into her small office thinking she might have to get her stuff leave and then return later that night to check out the biosafety microbiological storage freezer in the process she practically collided with the maintenance man from the day before omeary obviously he knew pias name miss grazdani nice to see you again we just heard ten minutes ago that we can get back in here tomorrow morning to finish up im just checking the site making sure all the tools are here he then leaned toward pia and whispered im not a hundred percent happy about being in here after what happened yesterday but the jobs gotta get done you think its safe in here now our boss says so i think its safe pia said i dont think it was ever unsafe good to hear omeary straightened up to his full height he jerked his thumb toward pias ceiling i think weve isolated the problems with the short its up there so we should be outa your hair by lunch tomorrow pia didnt respond she doubted the problem would ever get solved besides she wouldnt be there at noon tomorrow or any other day i hope we wont be bothering you too much tomorrow omeary said trying to be considerate he tried to go around her pia stopped him i know youve only been here a couple of days but did you see anything unusual yesterday morning before all the excitement started anything that struck you as odd that springer guy asked me already and the disease control people they took a long time about it im sure they were very thorough but im wondering because you were in here all morning and in different parts of the lab with your wires if you saw anyone early on who you didnt see in the lab later anyone who looked like he didnt belong omeary narrowed his eyes but playfully what are you a cop now no im not a cop i wasnt working in that bio unit where they got sick so i wouldnt know about anyone in there are you sure this place is safe the disease people were asking about contamination like before the contamination and so on is it really safe in here im sure its safe i came back and im not about to take a risk with that bacteria so why the questions youre making me nervous im just making some of my own inquiries supposedly nothing abnormal was found here in the lab or in the biosafety unit did you see dr rothman or dr yamamoto at all i didnt even know which one was which there was a lot of people in and out of this lab dropping stuff off do you know arthur spaulding the head technician yeah he was introduced to us when we first came on the job did you see him when you were in rothmans office sure a few times quick ins and outs anyone else more than once the secretary martha marsha whatever yeah you know you sound an awful lot like a cop im not a cop just a student who has a few questions sorry to keep you but if you think of anything unusual just find me are you gonna be here actually no let me give you my cell phone number if you remember anything please call i rarely use it but ill pick up a message a message that i can ignore if its not germane thought pia she usually made it a point not to give out her cell number omeary wrote it down okay i got it over omearys shoulder pia saw spaulding say good night to marsha and leave she silently applauded she was now free to go and check out the storage freezer to be on the safe side pia did a circuit of the lab to see who else was around a couple of the other support personnel were tidying up in the main lab area and marsha was busy around the front desk but there was no one there who might go into the biosafety unit stepping into spauldings office she took the microbiological storage freezer log from where she knew spaulding kept it in his desk in the anteroom of the unit she quickly suited up and once inside the unit itself she used her own key to enter the large walkin storage freezer the door closed automatically behind her she was surprised the interior light was on which was odd because spaulding was scrupulous about turning it off when he left as pia started to contemplate what that might mean the door was yanked open pias heart leaped in her chest she found herself facetoface with an equally surprised arthur spaulding what are you doing here pia asked quickly feigning indignation i came to turn off the light more to the point what are you doing here this is offlimits to anyone but nina brockhurst panjit singh mariana herrera and me you know that and how did you get in damn it i have a key pia said producing it and dangling it in front of her masked face dr rothman gave it to me and he gave me authorization to come in here spaulding snatched the key roughly out of pias hand causing her to start again maybe you didnt hear but dr rothman isnt around anymore to give you his authorization i bet youre happy about that pia blurted as soon as the comment left her mouth she regretted it for now im in charge of this lab and from this point on you no longer have authorization and ill take that too spaulding snatched the logbook that pia was holding pia stood there for a couple of beats deciding what to do shed recovered from the shock of spauldings unexpected appearance and now was just angry shed never liked the man she brushed past spaulding heading toward the freezer door youre not the princess anymore pia darling your access to this entire lab is revoked as im sure the dean would be happy to confirm if i asked pia said nothing in the anteroom she took off her protective garb and passive aggressively left them where they fell seething she walked back into her tiny office and packed up the few belongings and files shed accumulated in threeplus years she found an empty box and put them in it without looking back she closed the office door and walked toward the entrance to the lab marsha langman didnt look up as she passed by what a bunch of jerks pia thought in a huff pia headed back to the dorm but then she remembered george in the library reversing her direction she quickly found him and got his attention she then left he quickly closed the journal he was reading and followed her out into the hall he had to jog to catch up with her it was no secret she was angry can i ask what happened you werent gone long was the lab still offlimits maybe it would have been better if it had been pia said i hope youre hungry because im starved im hungry enough lets go to the cafeteria fine pia said they exited the hospital it was cold and dark they walked quickly you still havent told me what happened george reminded pia what happened was that prick spaulding surprised me at the storage freezer and ended up kicking me out of the lab for good the dummy left the light on and came back to turn it off my bad luck hes so anal figures hes a huge asshole you cant be surprised he got mad and why do you care if he kicked you out of the lab youre going to another lab come monday you can strike another staff member off your christmas card list i dont send christmas cards its a figure of speech you know what i mean so now the labs really offlimits right pia nodded i guess so so theres not much more you can do unless you want to break into springers office pia looked over at george with confusion im joking seriously theres nothing more you can do youve talked to the doctor in charge of rothman and yamamotos care and now you cant go back into the lab you have to let it go and let the authorities do their work you can be sure theres an investigation going on so you should drop it yes pia wasnt hearing georges plea at all pia are you listening to me far from dropping it pia was now wondering whether spaulding was hiding something yet what could she do and what was she going to do with the rest of her life without her mentor and his program was research still a possibility becoming a physician had seemed to offer safety in her life something she coveted but rothman had made her realize that her discomfort with patients with other people in general might not bode well for such a career she was at a crossroads in her life and had no answers thinking about it made her anxious pia let out a sigh and george asked her what was up pia ignored the question she suddenly knew that her preoccupation with finding out what had happened to rothman was allowing her to avoid thinking about her career and the decisions she was facing it was her first line of defense the future could wait pia stopped walking and pulled george to a stop just outside the dorm im not giving this up ive got to find out why this tragedy happened there are too many questions every time i stop and think there are more questions more people acting strangely the infectious disease people insisted on using a fiftyyearold antibiotic and the patients died within hours despite being diagnosed and treated and no one i mean no one liked rothman all his colleagues were jealous of him having a lasker and a nobel and possibly being in line for another okay spaulding was mad that i was in the storage facility which he has always been weirdly proprietary about and he knew id been in his desk since i was holding the logbook but he was acting bizarre like the lab was now his the moron is only a fucking technician hes not a researcher and what about the fact that i a mere medical student was the one to pick up the peritonitis maybe if they had gotten him to surgery sooner he would still be alive what do you want me to say george asked he tried to look pia in the eye but she avoided it does it really sound like im paranoid dont answer whatever im not finished looking into all this as there doesnt seem to be anyone else doing it how many times do i have to remind you that this is one of the premier medical centers in the world do you really believe you have anything to add youre going to flame out pia is that what you want do you have a career death wish pia thought for a moment maybe even if you persist in this selfdestructive investigation or whatever you call it i dont see what your options are springer bourse spauldingyoure on a last warning from all of them im not afraid of spaulding he took my key but i still know where rothman kept his he was acting like he had something to hide as i said before i think this is crazy look if you insist on pursuing it why dont you check out the autopsies theres probably a simple pathological explanation for rothman and yamamotos clinical course or even a complex explanation i dont know but thats where youre going to find the answers not pissing off everybody in the hospital the autopsies were probably done today so they could dispose of the bodies because theyre still hot hot pia said yeah hot as in contaminated with salmonella george said sharply sometimes pia could be a little slow on the uptake she still looked bemused as if her mind wasnt making a connection you understand what im saying like youd say someone full of virus is hot exactly no pathology department wants to keep hot bodies around i tell you what you should do find one of the pathology residents tonight and ask what they know or what they can find out you havent worn out your welcome in that department yet have you actually thats a good idea i didnt think of that if you want to look into that ill come with you so you stay within the lines george smiled as he said it he wasnt reprimanding her he was joking because he knew he wouldnt be able to keep her out of trouble if she was determined to get into it shed more than proved it but im not going back to the lab he added if you want to do that youre on your own spaulding is bound to have alerted security and what does it mean if theres a sample missing in the freezer what does that prove other than the fact that spauldings not as good at his job as hed like to think which is another thing you knew already i dont think spaulding would alert anyone he doesnt have that kind of authority despite his big talk but at the moment im not thinking about going back to the lab i think ill follow your suggestion and check with pathology as i said i hadnt thought of that its a good suggestion then ill tag along i know id feel guilty if i dont go and you get carried away again and get yourself kicked out of school i dont care one way or the other said pia she was intrigued she wondered why she hadnt thought of it columbia university medical center new york city march pm the wind blew fiercely down haven avenue and into the canyon of th street pushed from behind pia and george made rapid but chilly progress from the dorm toward the medical center it was raining and george struggled with a cheap umbrella until it finally turned inside out for the third time he stuffed it headfirst into a trash can pia strode on head down the hood of her sweatshirt pulled tightly over her head once inside the hospital they descended into the labyrinthine bowels of the nearly centuryold building to the morgue it was malodorous and poorly lit and filled with outdated equipment the morgue served as a way station for the dead in simple cases bodies would be picked up by a funeral home a van from the ocme the office of the chief medical examiner would come if there were complicating factors both pia and george found it difficult to reconcile this rundown dirty place with the hospital and medical center as they knew it some campus buildings were slightly shabby on the outside but pristine and modern within the morgue was unkempt inside and out and at this time of the evening seemed to have been deserted by anyone from the realm of the living oldfashioned wooden meatlockerstyle doors with metal signs proclaiming that only authorized personnel were to be admitted were the order of the day the only noise in the godforsaken place was a lowgrade electrical hum and the drip of water onto cement floor following their noses they walked into the tiered amphitheater of the abandoned autopsy room which looked like the set of a horror movie depicting victorian times some of the seats were broken the pit area with its two ancient autopsy tables was being used as storage for a random collection of pipes old sinks and discarded toilets with the constant fight for space in the medical center george wondered out loud why the area hadnt been retrofitted finally pia and george walked into the morgue itself arranged along the walls was a series of walkin coolers the fifteen or so corpses in the room were on separate gurneys some covered by sheets others fully exposed still in place on a few of the bodies were the various tubes and wires used to treat and monitor them while they were still alive a couple of the bodies were clothed others naked most still wore the hospital johnnies they expired in mixed in were a couple of long black body bags pia and george were wondering why they couldnt find anyone working there when the night diener or mortuary attendant startled them what do you want the man asked it was obvious he was unhappy at being disturbed he was perhaps fifty or sixty small of stature wearing a stained lab coat he had a bulbous head too large for his body with a badly maintained combover wedged on top he wore small oval glasses and squinted through them at his uninvited guests the casting department for the victorian horror movie had done a good job and how did you get in he added before pia or george could answer his first question we came in that way pia said indicating their entrance route thats the back entrance visitors are supposed to come in the front no one ever comes in the back way were here to ask about a couple of autopsies george said autopsies that might have been performed down here today the patients would have been two staff members who died early this morning dr rothman and dr yamamoto the attendant laughed cynically as if this was the funniest thing he had heard in ages there hasnt been an autopsy done down here in fifty years i never heard of either of those patients theyre not here if thats what you want to know and if there was an autopsy it would be done in the anatomy department of the medical school where they still do them on account of the teaching you need to get in touch with the pathology resident on call and you can go out the front way the man pointed in the direction of the usual exit he then stood there implacably george looked at pia who didnt seem in the mood to argue okay george said thanks as pia and george waited for the elevator to rumble its way down to them george snuck a look back toward the chamber of horrors can you believe that guy ive been in some creepy places but thats the creepiest do you think he ever leaves george said you get the impression that he lives down here ill be happy if i dont see that face again i should think so said pia if we come back down here it means were dead back in the land of the living george called the oncall pathology resident dr simonov agreed to meet with them and asked that they come up to the clinical path lab when pia and george found him simonov was taking a break in a small windowless office with a giant mug of strong coffee on the desk in front of him so what can i do for you guys its not often i get called by medical students whats up simonov was russian but had lived in the west long enough to almost completely lose his accent only the occasional dropped article gave him away hed gone to both college and medical school in the states were wondering if there was an autopsy performed today on either dr rothman or dr yamamoto or both george said he had suggested to pia that he do the talking this time she didnt care they died early this morning when yes i know who they were simonov said everybody in the medical center knows about them why are you asking there are questions about how quickly they died pia said before george could speak it was a relentless downhill course despite maximum treatment so that we no autopsies were done on them here simonov said cutting pia off not a lot of autopsies are done anymore in general its a pity but it is reality theres no money but rothman and yamamoto they would not have been done here under any circumstances having died like they did of an infectious disease while working meant that they are definitely medical examiner cases pure and simple all we did here was put the bodies in body bags seal them up and decontaminate the exterior they were then picked up by the ocme he spelled out the acronym explaining it stood for office of the chief medical examiner i know what the ocme is so do you know the results results simonov laughed at pias question maybe in three weeks or more he said they get a lot of bodies down there and they generally take their time down where pia said where exactly is the ocme you gonna go down there now i wouldnt advise it but okay whatever its on east side first avenue and thirtieth street near nyu medical center thanks if we call them up do you think theyll answer our questions now tomorrow how would i know maybe they never had medical students asking questions but then again it is affiliated with nyu medical center which is a teaching hospital for all i know they may have a medical student elective who should we call should we ask for someone in particular i knew one of the mes but hes no longer there but they have a pr department id call them maybe call the medical legal investigator on the case do you think theyd tell us the results if we called george asked you mean call the mes office simonov smiled and let out a quick knowing laugh you think in this great big city bureaucracy you can just call and they jump and tell you results not in a million years this case is important they were important guys its going to be a media event theres probably going to be lawsuits about safety that kind of thing since its an infectious case the autopsies have probably already been done but theyre not going to release any results for three four weeks after the toxicology screens are completed but theres not going to be general access to the information and they definitely wont give the results to a couple of green medical students youre probably right pia said she knew more than most people about city institutions if i were you find something else to do but its your life if you insist on looking into the case id go down there i wouldnt try calling on the phone if youre there in person and meet with someone who more or less takes pity on you or likes you you might learn something simonov winked at pia she got his inference but ignored it so if youre really committed simonov continued go to the ocme just dont count on getting any answers as for calling you might as well call threeoneone simonov was referring to the citizens help linepeople called to report a cat stuck up a tree or a loud movie set on the street simonov checked his watch and picked up his coffee if you decide to call threeoneone tell them theres still a big pothole on my street been there since thanksgiving back out in the rainy night pia and george slogged along th street keeping as far away from the curb as they could every time a yellow cab zipped by it splashed water up onto the sidewalk well that was almost useless pia managed against the wind im not sure id write it off as useless he reminded us about the politics involved he also emphasized that theres undoubtedly going to be a thorough investigation as a prelude to any legal action i think thats information you should take to heart its time to drop all this pia dreamer pia said im in this until i get some answers you are impossible george commented as a sudden gust of wind came down from haven avenue halting their forward progress for a moment they had reached fort washington avenue looking to the side pia realized they had come abreast of the black research building what time is it pia asked george managed to glance at his watch its after ten time for us to be in bed for george the idea of bed had immediate appeal it brought up the fact that they had had sex that day or at least pia had had sex ever the optimist he wondered if just maybe after his accompanying her back over to the hospital to check on the autopsy she might consider a continuation george closed his eyes and screwed up the courage to speak do you want to come to my room stay the night or we could go to your room whichever you prefer what for pia asked blankly well for one thing we ended things a little quickly this afternoon maybe if we had more time thats a thought pia said in a preoccupied fashion have you noticed where were standing george looked up in truth he hadnt been particularly aware of the immediate surroundings were just outside the black building pia added its after ten as you said i want to go up to the lab for another quick visit to check out that damn micro storage locker im not going to be satisfied until i do it and this is the best time ive been in there fifty times at night like this no pia george said firmly its too big a risk i dont think theres any risk whatsoever you head back to the dorm itll only take me twenty minutes at most george looked ahead at the dorm looming in the misty night it beckoned as a haven of warmth and security he looked back at pia she was smiling up at him confident as usual most important she hadnt said no to his suggestion that they sleep together you really think itll be safe that no one will suddenly pop in absolutely twenty minutes itll take me ill call you as soon as i get back to the dorm and you remember that whatever you find out it wont prove anything im aware of that georges mind went into overdrive maybe it was a good idea maybe if she got the damn micro storage locker out of her mind shed give up on her selfdestructive investigation all right george said with sudden resolve im coming with you maybe i can help speed things up he grabbed her hand and started to pull her toward the black building entrance pia resisted are you sure im sure george said in his minds eye what he could see mostly was them climbing into bed holding each other tightly pia shrugged it might be quicker with two people all right lets do it without another word pia and george ducked into the black building the security man knew pia well and didnt bat an eye pia used her key to open the main door a key spaulding had not asked for the logbook was back where she expected it would be in spauldings desk inside the biosafety unit she used rothmans spare key from his office to open the storage locker they worked quickly and efficiently george wouldnt have wanted a physician to check his blood pressure at any point during the visit but pia seemed icy cool and focused pia had george read out to her how many of each sample were recorded in the logbook while she counted the actual samples as pia suspected there were three samples missing from the storage freezer at least according to the book there were supposed to be thirty samples of the zerogravity salmonella typhi divided evenly between what was called alpha s typhi and beta s typhi one of the missing samples was from the beta salmonella strain and the other two were the alpha strain which was the strain that had infected rothman and yamamoto out in the main part of the unit near the hoods pia found a small collection of six labeled petri dishes in the incubator each was labeled with either an alpha or a beta after pia and george had left the biosafety unit and removed their protective clothing pia found two of the same type of stoppered containers used in the storage facility without labels sitting next to spauldings sink after replacing the logbook and the spare key pia said to george okay were done georges heart rate calmed down once they had exited the lab without incident what does all this mean pia george asked as they rode down in the elevator i dont know pia admitted it might not mean anything but information is information what id like to do is go over the discrepancies with spaulding if i can figure out how good luck with that george said pia and george fought their way through the weather back to the dorm though he was exhausted george felt strangely exhilarated he and pia had actually worked together george knew hed been useful and was acutely sensitive to pias gestures like the way she had put her hand on the small of his back to encourage him to precede her through the outer dorm door she was obviously pleased with what they had accomplished they stopped in the lobby and pushed the elevator button both cars were on upper floors pia stared at the elevators slowmoving floor indicator george cleared his throat to speak but pia didnt want to hear what he had to say she just wanted to get to her bed and try to sleep pia you must know how i feel about you ive tried to tell you a hundred times more than that pia would you look at me pia reluctantly turned to george he had that earnest look you know i worry about you because of my feelings for you i love you you must know that i think about you constantly on hearing the words something in pias brain fizzed into life a laboratory animal learns to stop engaging in a certain behavior like touching a red button if it gets a painful shock every time even if previously it got a reward like a piece of food in pias mind there was a connection between protestations of affection and pain she had learned that the people who said those words would cause her pain and should be avoided like an electric shock pia pressed the elevator button again as it appeared that the car was stuck on the eighth floor she said nothing our relationship cant be totally onesided what do you mean relationship look george this isnt the time or the place for this when is the time pia ive wanted to tell you i love you for years the elevator finally arrived the doors opened and a cluster of students noisily piled out a party had started in someones room and now was moving to a bar up on broadway george pulled pia aside as the door closed she rolled her eyes george come on not now im sorry but i have to say it i know you dont want to hear this but i dont understand you that makes two of us but we need each other dont you think i know i need you i dont know what that meansto need someone someone needing me i dont want that responsibility the second elevator arrived with a straggling student who hurried to catch up with his friends pia got in the car and held the door for george get in george jesus pia punched the eleventh floor for her room and seven for his message delivered george reluctantly got in pias mind was already full of competing problemsrothman the sisters africa the rest of her lifeand now here was another one she wondered what it was like to think about someone constantly as george said he did of her it was an alien concept she glanced at george who was looking at the floor she had no idea what he was thinking or feeling the elevator stopped on seven and pia reached out and pressed the hold button george hesitated for a moment than stepped out good night george pia said george just nodded as the doors closed to pia he looked pathetic columbia university medical center new york city march pm george knew something about loss his own father morgan wilson died when george was three and no matter how hard he tried george couldnt really remember anything specific about him other than a vague sense of contentment he did have a few vague memories but theyd been pieced together from photographs shown to him by his mother jean there was one silent home movie of a time jean and morgan took george to see his grandparents sally and preston in arizona george had watched the film over and over and his father always looked impossibly young and endearing in the short film morgan is holding george on his lap and alternately kisses him on the cheek and hugs him morgans absence had caused george a degree of melancholy similar to the melancholy he was feeling at that moment george got up from his bed where hed flopped after pias rebuff he needed to get out of his room if only for a short interval there was always the vending machine room on the first floor he needed to see people normal people and there were usually students getting sodas or bags of chips as george headed toward the elevators he tried to concentrate on how much he was loved by his family hed always had that to fall back on whenever he felt lonely he knew that pia did not have an equivalent situation which made her behavior even more confusing why did she so consistently reject the love that he wanted to share with her and finally had the courage to voice it just didnt make sense george slapped the down button almost as if the car had been sitting there waiting for him the elevator doors opened inside was will mckinley perhaps the only person in the world who could have made george feel even lonelier george will said what a coincidence you heading down for a snack hop in will took georges arm and pulled him in the groundfloor button had already been pressed george lacked the strength to resist whats the matter george you look terrible im just tired its been that kind of day hows pia have you seen her she must have taken what happened to rothman real hard she did lesley and i tried to call her but shes not picking up shes not great at staying in touch with people george said the elevator reached the ground floor and will guided george off listen george if theres anything i can do to help pia just let me know really we want her to get through this in one piece shes a great girl george simply nodded will walked away toward the vending room when he realized george wasnt accompanying him he turned and waved to george to follow come on my treat george sighed wearily turned and pressed the button once more to call the elevator he wanted company but not wills company columbia university medical center new york city march pm the moment the elevator doors had closed on george pia had already relegated him to his proper place in her mind well down the list of her immediate concerns she didnt like being abrupt with him but she didnt want to get into a longdrawnout conversation either she was exhausted from not sleeping well the previous night unfortunately when she reached her floor she had a bit of bad luck she had run into lesley and had had to have a conversation about rothman and yamamoto curious if lesley had any interesting thoughts pia had tolerated the chat but after ten minutes or so when it was evident lesley was not about to add anything significant pia broke it off pia put the key in the lock and opened her door walked in and hooked the door with her right heel to slam it shut in complete darkness she felt the wall with her left hand to find the light switch and flicked it on with her right hand she tossed her keys in the general direction of the desk all pia wanted to do was take a quick shower before going to bed shed been on the go all day and tomorrow wasnt going to be any quieter with a planned visit to the ocme pia walked over to the window and closed the blinds she took off her lab coat and tossed it over the arm of her reading chair next she removed her sweater and laid it on top of the jacket she opened her closet door and kicked her shoes directly inside first the left then the right next she shucked off her black skirt and then her bra and let them fall to the floor pia couldnt wait to get into a hot shower she put her hand on the bathroom door and thought it was odd that it was closedshe never closed the bathroom door even when she was using the toilet before pia could process another thought the door was yanked open away from her and the handle wrenched out of her hand a tall figure materialized in the doorway and put the heel of his hand on pias breastbone and pushed her hard to the ground pias head snapped back and smacked against the floor a reflex cry rose in her throat but it was choked off by the man who was straddling her now with his knees on her arms his left hand over her mouth pia tried to clear her head but her ears were ringing the man kneeling on her was wearing a balaclava and she could see a second figure obscured by the first he was also hooded both wore hospital security uniforms the first man struggled to keep pia still he reached behind him with his right hand and the second man handed him a roll of duct tape the first man looked back again and waved the tape cut me a piece he said in heavily accented english and his colleague obliged he freed pias mouth took the strip of tape in both hands and clamped it down over pias mouth before she could let out more than a stifled screech stop moving were not going to hurt you the first man said pia wriggled once more but stopped she was struggling to get enough oxygen through her nose and her head was throbbing where she had hit it on the floor her arms were getting numb where the man was kneeling on them she looked into his eyes and nodded okay im going to let you up dont do anything stupid the man got to his feet digging his knees into the fleshy part of pias arms as he did so he stood back and she got up she felt small she was wearing only a pair of panties and even though they were wearing balaclavas she knew the eyes of the two men were moving up and down her body she was going to be raped she was certain pia raised her arms to rub her sore triceps and cover her breasts pia thought its only ten feet to the door pia thought theyre not expecting me to do anything pia thought i dont want to be raped not again pia looked from one man to the other and then down at the floor she wanted them to relax even slightly then she got up on her tiptoes tapped her right foot on the floor behind her and in one move using her arms first for balance and then for forward thrust she drove her right foot heelfirst into the front mans groin he doubled over and staggered back and into his colleague and pia stood square at once moved forward and reached over and hit the second man in the face twice boxing jabs that fit the narrow space she was in both men were hurt but not enough pia got in a couple more kicks that would leave bruises but the two men quickly regained momentum and charged her the first man his groin aflame feinted a couple of times then smashed pia in the jaw with a right hook knocking her unconscious when pia woke up her head hurt like hell and she couldnt move her limbs she understood why she was ducttaped to her chair her arms bound behind her and her ankles fixed together pias eyes were barely open but she could make out one of the men coming toward her his arm moving back and then quickly forward she flinched then took a facefull of cold water that the man had thrown over her using the tupperware container she sometimes fixed oatmeal in thats what you do when i say do nothing stupid huh the mans concealed face was very close to hers his blue eyes bored into pias she tried to speak or at least snort you are a good fighter but we are more experienced and there are two of us we have respect for you because we are family men but we know some young men who are less what is the word civilized they are in fact animals if they were here now and not us then god help you the man was speaking in a whisper the fight and the overturned furniture that resulted had prompted the upstairs neighbor to bang on her floor to ask for quiet the men didnt want to try the neighbors patience i say this only once we are here to give you a message stop what you are doing stop asking questions your doctor was careless and got himself and the other doctor infected and he put the whole medical center in a compromised position it will be dealt with quickly and quietly and everyone will move on pia was rocking back and forth in her chair her eyes wide with fury it was her rebelliousness surfacing stop rocking pia didnt stop the man slapped her in the face not hard but well placed enough to make her jaw throb even more severely than it had been pia sat still you will be watched not by us by our friends if you keep meddling if you call the police our other friends the animals will come and take you away and you will ask them to kill you after a couple of days you will beg them you understand pia stared at the man he moved even closer than before and the rough material of the balaclava touched her skin she could feel his hot breath through the damp wool he spoke in barely a whisper you understand pia waited a beat then nodded you will tell no one we were here if you talk with anyone here like that boy you are with they will be killed too if you go to the police or the medical authorities you will be killed its easy just stop go about your life and all this goes away the man stood up his colleague stepped forward and jabbed the needle of a syringe hard into pias thigh she gasped at the pain then fell unconscious almost at once the men tore off the duct tape binding her leaving her skin red and swollen where it had been in contact with the tape when they pulled the tape from her mouth it tugged at the wound on her jaw and further opened a tear in her lip blood trickled down her chin the first man wiped it off with a tissue he got from a box on pias dresser he pocketed it after using it he picked her up and laid her on the bed with her head over the side he knew that the drug hed given her had the tendency to cause vomiting the men removed their balaclavas and prepared to leave if pia had been conscious she would have seen at once that the face of one of the men the leader was marked with a cleft lip the other man had a peculiarly and memorably pointed nose the first man cracked the door open and seeing an empty hall quickly exited the room followed by the second man they put on their official hats and adjusting their uniforms made their way quickly to the stairs columbia university medical center new york city march am pia woke up in stages first when it was still night she skimmed the surface of consciousness but quickly fell back into the darkness then later it had become light outside and she was aware of her own breathing and a sharp pain in the back of her head and a throbbing along her jaw finally she awoke and was hystericalthere were men in her room chasing after her she had to get away she tried to get up but her body wasnt obeying her commands she slumped back on the bed and closed her eyes then she remembered men had been hiding in her bathroom and had attacked her the last thing she remembered was getting jabbed with a needle she felt her leg at that spot and it was sore she looked down at the puncture wound so she had been drugged and hit no wonder she felt so bad she reached down and felt between her legs nothing she experienced a modicum of relief dazed with the fog of her drug hangover pia was unsure of what to do her mind clicked over to george pia remembered the conversation theyd had in front of the elevator the confessions george made to her and the look on his face when pia said she wasnt thinking about those kinds of things right now last night she wanted george to leave her alone now she wished he were here with her as the drug gradually started to wear off the pain in pias jaw intensified she stood up she was dizzy she managed to get herself into the bathroom she looked at her face in the mirror and it was a mess a livid red welt with a small laceration covered much of the lefthand side along the jawline pias lip was swollen and bloody and there were red marks where the duct tape used to gag her had ripped at her skin she remembered the fight how shed kicked one of the men in the groin and been smashed in the face in return pia leaned in and looked at her eyes she saw that they were puffy and ringed with dark circles she hadnt had a normal good nights sleep in an age being unconscious for hours didnt count pia looked at herself again and hoped to get an answer to the question what was she going to do now she washed her face with cold water and took a long hot shower she put on her most comfortable sweatshirt and pajama pants she located a bottle of advil in her travel bag and took four tablets washing them down with two glasses of water then she called george on his cell phone when he didnt answer she didnt leave a message fearing she wouldnt be able to say anything coherent she sent a text message instead somethings happened please come over urgent p pia lay down on the bed and waited georges phone vibrated in his pocket he hung back a little from the group doing radiology rounds and read the message he had a coffee break coming up and he figured he could wait until then to reply pia had probably found a way of indicting someone else in her conspiracy theory and he had been enjoying being a regular medical student for the last couple of hours george put the phone back in his pocket and caught up with his group george called pia after finishing a cup of coffee in the xray technician lounge it was at first george thought he had a bad connection because he couldnt understand what pia was saying he moved out of the room with its background chatter into a corridor and stood by a window pia can you hear me youre very faint what is it what pia was trying to say was please can you come to my room but it didnt sound like that at first say that again pia i cant understand you pia repeated herself you want me to come yes george was confused by the sound of her voice and wondered if pias state of mind had anything to do with the way their conversation had ended the previous night it crossed georges mind that pia was drunk but it sounded more like she had a mouth full of cotton okay ill be right there george asked one of the other students to tell the resident hed been called away on hospital business and headed to pias room he found he was less eager to see her than usual the previous night hed made a decision recognizing that he was probably barking up the wrong tree with pia george wasnt confident he could follow through with his decision but he was going to try it was for his own peace of mind fifteen minutes later george knocked on pias door when she opened it and he saw her face all of his plans doubts and recriminations were washed away he was instantly morphed back into the slavish dog hed been for three years oh my god what happened to you pia shook her head and pointed to her jaw george fetched pias desk chair and sat her down take your time tell me what happened there were two men in my room last night pia said she spoke slowly and deliberately last night this was last night why didnt you call they drugged me i just woke up jesus who were these men what did they do did they george hesitated not sure he wanted to hear no they didnt rape me if thats what youre asking they warned me to stay away from the rothman case jesus pia do you want to lie down no im okay im going to call security and then the police no dont pia said she shook her head vigorously an act that hurt a great deal she was still dazed from the sedative but the clouds were clearing no security and no police i have to take what they said seriously they were waiting for me in my room they said theyll be watching me i mean they already had been watching me you see what this means george it means i was right theres a conspiracy behind rothmans and yamamotos deaths wait a minute pia slow down george said these two men who were in your room who obviously beat you up they said specifically stay away from the rothman case not like that but they said it george was horrified but his first instinct was one of skepticism did you recognize the men at all they had ski masks on but they were dressed as hospital security shit george maybe they were hospital security you know that would mean the hospital is covering it up spaulding the dean springer all those guys pia stood up as if she wanted to flee oh come on pia this is new york city in america maybe in a movie or some third world dictatorship they kill off their own doctors and beat up medical students but not here i cant believe you could think that get a grip well someone did this pia said pointing at her face shaking partly with rage partly with fear i know what institutions can do george what people can do to someone theyre supposed to be looking after if you grew up in the system i grew up in maybe youd be a little more cynical i know one thing everyone has their own agenda if youre in the way things like this happen to you pia sobbed once and her shoulders heaved okay pia george stood and reached out to pia and she went into his arms he held her tightly i think we should call the police you need an ambulance as well no pia pushed george away i need to think about what this means if we call the police theyll call the administration and security here and for all i know they were the ones who attacked me i need to think pia grabbed both sides of her head and shook herself the drug i cant think straight maybe we should go to my room george said they know all about you george it wont be any safer there they wont do anything now im just sitting in my room george looked around you think theyre watching you that closely well think about it every time we moved we got caught it happened twice in the lab one time it didnt but we didnt find anything important then remember and we were allowed to go through the morgue just fine because there wasnt anything there to find im having a hard time believing all these people are in on a conspiracy bourse springer dr de silva who was treating rothman why pia what are they conspiring about and theres no proof the deaths were anything other than accidents let me remind you again you have no idea how much people hated rothman i saw it every day i was in his lab no one liked himhe was rude disrespectful mean and they were all jealous of him how he got special treatment from the hospital how he got a nobel and might well get another he had a lot of enemies all sorts of reasons including people in his own lab okay but you dont kill someone because you dont like them its too much its so theatrical well how do you explain this pia gestured to herself i was attacked she yelled i was ordered to stay away now im sure rothman was killed his death wasnt accidental it was deliberate the only thing im not sure of is why they didnt kill me too last night rather than just warn me they must be more afraid of how people would react to my disappearing than afraid that i wouldnt respond to the warning as they said if i keep quiet all this goes away if i disappear they talk to you and find out what i was thinking george felt a sudden chill if pia was right he might be next in line for a visit but how could she be right it was so farfetched george needed some time to think too can i get you some ice for your face ill just be down the hall sure thanks george went to the ice machine at the end of pias corridor but it was out of order he could go down to the cafeteria where he knew ice was always available but that meant leaving pia on her own in her room for a few minutes george walked back to her door and opened it startling pia shit george cant you knock she said sorry the ice machines out im going downstairs to get some ill be right back columbia university medical center new york city march am george returned with the ice pia was sitting at her desk writing furiously on yellow legal paper trying to make sense of what had happened in the past fortyeight hours george took some ice and wrapped it in a towel for pia to hold to her face the rest he put in her sink he then sat on the bed and watched her write on page after page pia tested her prodigious memory trying to isolate fact from speculation she worked backward from the undeniable fact that shed been attacked and threatened in her own dorm room that was obviously a criminal actbut what else of all the events of the past two days had constituted unlawful activity while she worked on the what she also worked on the who she tried to piece together a cast of characters using the information she was certain about there had been two men in her roombut who else was involved and how broad was the conspiracy she now knew existed after an hour pia stopped this is getting me nowhere it could be anyone and theres so much thats happened and i bet we dont know the half of it what about trying to establish a timeline isnt that what they do in those cop shows on tv they use a whiteboard six fortytwo pm suspect seen in olearys bar but we dont know who the suspects are unless we just include everyone and we cant really investigate anything say we think springer was involved somehow the only times we know what he was doing are when i was with him i cant pick up the phone and demand he answer any questions about his whereabouts at any other time this is why we should call the police george said they can investigate to their hearts content and ask him anything they please given that theres a conspiracy one of the things we dont know is why only as you keep saying rothman was hated by half the human race of course that raises the question why kill yamamoto as well he wasnt unpopular was he not at all people loved him he was devoted to rothman they were like two peas in a pod working together if they werent working together in either the biosafety unit or the organ bath unit yamamoto was in rothmans office they even ate together if they took time out for lunch which wasnt always the case yamamoto was the only one rothman allowed to use his private coffee machine or drink the bottled mineral water from his private office fridge they were like siamese twins so theres much more we dont know than we do know as far as what other people were thinking and what they were doing george said so what do we know other than the fact that you were attacked last night and told to stop involving yourself in this pia turned back to her desk and picked up her pen and underscored a couple of lines on the page george looked at his watch he was concerned about getting back over to the hospital but decided he was more worried about pia the resident to whom hed been assigned for the day was rather laidback to say the least and probably didnt even realize george wasnt around besides george wanted to stay and humor pia for a while he was worried that she might have a concussion from the attack and he wanted to make sure her mental status didnt change in addition he reasoned she couldnt get into any more trouble while they were there in her room suddenly pia turned back around you know what we know the most about george shrugged we know the most about rothman and yamamotos illness even without the autopsy results and even without seeing their charts i was in the lab when it presented i saw them in the hospital i talked to the doctor who was treating them i examined rothman myself i diagnosed new symptoms i spoke with the department head involved good yes george said they had gone over all this before but under the circumstances george was happy to do it again pia tore the sheets she had written on off her legal pad crumpled them into a ball and threw the ball in the general direction of the trash basket she missed pia began writing again more slowly this time okay she said while she worked we do have a timeline of the infection the onset was extremely rapid rothman or yamamoto pressed the panic button and there was a medical team in the lab almost at once i saw them arrive rothman and yamamoto knew what to look out for so from the first symptom to the medical team arriving may have been only ten minutes at the outside springer showed up and he went into the lab then he stayed and talked to the staff while rothman and yamamoto were taken directly up to the infectious disease floor and put in isolation and treatment was started id say they were there in five or six minutes and springer told us it was classic typhoid feverhigh temperature delirium and so on so it was diagnosed immediately no delays they got antibiotics within an hour of the initial symptoms pia had the pad on her knee so rothman and yamamoto got all the symptoms straight off it apparently wasnt the usual sequence where a patient gets one symptom initially and then another a few hours later it happened like a bolt of lightning as far as i know thats not the way typhoid fever develops then the patients got the more ominous rebound tenderness by that evening its all so speeded up you said this was a particularly virulent strain george said true one of the zerogravity strains the alpha strain but still and you also said that rothmans own sensitivity studies suggested that the strain should have been knocked out by the antibiotic he was given thats right the chloramphenicol and later the ceftriaxone so what are you saying are you suggesting that it cant have been that strain of salmonella no im not the strain had to be involved since kochs postulates were satisfied meaning that they managed to grow the culture from samples taken from the patient or by using more modern dna techniques yes pia george complained youre confusing me whats the bottom line here what are you trying to say i suggested to springer that there might be a second bacteria involved a bacteria or a virus that was actually more virulent than the salmonella typhi and that was resistant to the antibiotics it could explain the shockingly fast clinical course rothman and yamamoto experienced what was springers reaction to your suggestion he went bonkers on me pia said with disgust that was the end of the interview because he went out and called in reinforcements meaning the dean pia put down her pad and pen back on the desk so you think there might have been two bacteria involved george said right at this moment thats the only thing i can think of the clinical course was just too fast especially in the face of two antibiotics given within hours of initial symptoms and known to handle salmonella i know its contrary to recognized diagnostic rules the major one being that one should look for a single causative agent even with seemingly multiple symptoms but its the only way i can explain what weve seen with rothman and yamamoto she turned back to her desk and read from her notes we have all the symptoms right here fever delirium prostration temperature elevation sweating low white cell count known to be associated with salmonella all leading up to abdominal rebound tenderness from intestinal perforation and finally death george got up from the bed and headed into the bathroom pia was overwhelming him he was amazed she remembered kochs postulates from secondyear microbiology he certainly didnt he put some of the ice that was melting in her sink into a fresh towel rolled it up and brought it to her desk he exchanged it for the first one hed made pia was staring at the paper her back to him heres some more ice he said pia swiveled around in her chair and george winced when he saw her jaw at such close quarters hows it feel its not too bad a bit better with the ice pia took the fresh towel and held it to her face an image flashed into her mind rothman lying on his deathbed sweating into his pillow delirious suddenly she stared directly up into georges eyes with a fierce intensity that made george look away the hair loss pia said slowly with emphasis what about the hair loss columbia university medical center new york city march pm pia got up from her chair put the icefilled towel down on the desk and started pacing her room circling george first hed been unnerved by the intensity of pias stare when she had her epiphany whatever it was now she was stalking around the room like a cat closing in on a mouse what hair loss george questioned rothmans remember i saw there was some hair on his pillow before we found the rebound tenderness yes i remember you pointed it out to the resident and as i remember she suggested it might have been due to the chloramphenicol exactly pia said she stood still can i use your computer pias laptop was old and slow the year before george had invested in a new dell with a much faster processor sure lets go george picked up the wet towel from pias desk and gestured toward her with it pia shook her head george took the towel into the bathroom while pia changed from her pajama pants into sweats she also quickly downed more advil gathering up her notes and heading for the door pia paused and looked back shed experienced a flash of anxiety although her room was where shed been attacked she still felt safer there than outside her attackers were lurking out there somewhere perhaps they really were watching her as theyd threatened george sensed her trepidation and put an encouraging hand on pias shoulder and squeezed lightly they exchanged a reassuring glance pia breathed deeply and walked out of the room shutting off the light as she went lets take the stairs pia said and she and george descended the four flights walked along the corridor but then stopped in front of georges door both had the same thought if they knew about george they probably knew his room number what do you think he asked it wasnt crazy to imagine that the two men might have it in their mind to pay george a visit too now i think were being paranoid pia said but as you correctly said even paranoid people have real enemies wait there george unlocked the door and pulled it fully open he and pia were prepared to flee if anything looked amiss nothing did george entered his room making sure nothing had been disturbed before throwing open the bathroom door all clear he said with a sigh of relief lets get to work pia said george booted up his laptop and checked the wireless signal before giving up his desk chair to pia he went and sat on the bed his room was a mirror image of hers pia quickly went online typed hair loss and chloramphenicol into the search engine and scrolled through the results for a few minutes theres nothing that lists hair loss among chloramphenicols side effects actually there are some alternative healers who sell chloramphenicol to reverse hair loss wow de silva was so wrong when she said chloramphenicol might be the cause of the hair loss pia continued surfing springer attributed it to fever and stress she said as she read it seems that stress can cause hair loss but i dont think it could be involved in this case i mean rothman and yamamoto were certainly being stressed with their fevers and all but for stress to cause hair loss i think it has to be over a period of months not hours pia continued her search george couldnt see the screen from his vantage point but he could see the light flickering on pias face as page after page flashed by suddenly there was a steady light and pia leaned forward in her chair yeah here we are hair loss and stress yup i was right pia read out loud unless the stressed patient is pulling his own hair out severe stress merely changes the hair follicle from an active state to a resting state the hair doesnt fall out immediately but rather over a period of months pia looked over at george clearly springers suggestion wasnt much better than de silvas so what are you thinking since ive never heard of salmonella causing hair loss we have to think of something else to explain it bringing us back to the secondagent idea like another bacteria or a virus but if there was another microbe involved it would have to be one whose clinical symptoms mimic typhoid fever because all the other symptoms were consistent with typhoid fever are you following me i think so im saying that we have to come up with an agent that mimics typhoid fever symptomatically but which also causes hair loss and can kill in hours in the presence of chloramphenicol and possibly ceftriaxone of course without access to the charts i cant be sure they ever got the ceftriaxone but for the sake of argument lets assume they did you know what i wish pia said after a few minutes of silence i wish that we examined yamamoto as well as rothman just to be sure he was suffering from the same signs and symptoms maybe we can ask dr de silvas opinion i dont think shes going to want to hear from me lets keep going pia looked up at the corkboard on the wall behind georges desk a business card for a taxi service was tacked next to a picture of georges mother and grandmother there was a postcard from hungary alongside it suddenly pia snapped around again what are the usual causes of hair loss besides what ive mentioned this sounds like internal medicine rounds which id like to forget that was one venue where i did not shine in the slightest come on pia said what causes hair loss er hormonal changes alopecia areata stress like you said pia motioned for george to come up with more he thought harder dermatological diseases of the scalp particularly cicatricial diseases wow thats a good one thats the kind of response that would have gotten me kudos on rounds trouble is i always choked up what else pia commanded she waved her hand indicating she wanted more okay certain drugs pia nodded and looked expectantly at george as if she knew the answer and was waiting for him to get it it was like a game of charades george became impatient ready to give up before he remembered something else what about chemotherapy and radiation george sounded uncertain sure they caused hair loss but what could be the relevance right on pia exclaimed radiation you saw people undergoing radiation when you were on oncology during internal medicine george nodded chemotherapy andor radiation destroys the hair follicles and the hair falls out immediately what are you getting at george noticed that pias face had brightened considerably i said i was wondering if rothman could have been infected with another bug besides the salmonella another bug that was not sensitive to chloramphenicol or the thirdgeneration cephalosporin he was given right the ceftriaxone i suddenly dont think there was another microbe pia said damn it george you said it yourself remember you said they had to autopsy the bodies the same day the men died because they were hot i thought at the time it was a strange word to use but i think you were more right than you knew i dont think they were hot because they were full of bacteria i think they might have been hot because of radiation office of the chief medical examiner first avenue new york city march pm laurie montgomery had been sitting in her office at the office of the chief medical examiner catching up with an old friend detective captain lou soldano when the phone rang she saw it was her boss apologized and took the call she was soon rolling her eyes and lou smiled laurie montgomery had been back at the ocme for eleven months since the harrowing events of the infamous satoshi machita case involving both the new york mob and the japanese yakuza which led to the kidnapping of her infant son john junior the story had been plastered all over the media for several days as the details of the case unfolded after jjs rescue laurie had come back to work but only after she had found a livein nanny paula who immediately proved to be a godsend with paula looking after jj laurie felt secure right now her husband and fellow me jack stapleton was working in the same building and jj was safe with paula at the couples home on th street it didnt hurt that she and her husband had friends like detective captain lou soldano either right after the kidnapping hed insisted on a twentyfourhour security detail for the stapleton home from lauries side of the conversation and from knowing lauries boss dr harold bingham lou sensed hed be in for a wait he took his copy of the new york post from his briefcase and flipped through it until he saw the story ivy space germ docs die he quickly reread the first few paragraphs he had wanted to show the article to laurie which was one of the reasons hed stopped by sorry lou laurie said hanging up the phone that was bingham i assumed as much no problem did you see this article he held up the paper yes but not that one specifically there was the same story in the times crazy and scary at the same time it says that two researchers at columbia contaminated themselves in a lab with some virus grown in the space station or something the bodies were supposedly brought here to ocme is this all true most of it but the contamination agent wasnt a virus it was a bacteria called salmonella typhi that causes typhoid fever jack did both autopsies yesterday very sad i understand they were stem cell researchers who were making huge strides growing human organs thats what i understand lou said anything unique about the autopsies there were some wild theories about the deaths in the article apparently one of the guys was a bigdeal researcher who was not particularly liked by his colleagues jack didnt mention anything other than that he was impressed with the pathology hed never seen an entire gut in both patients in such bad shape typhoid fever isnt usually so generalized anyway that was the case i was just talking to bingham about he expects there will be some political fallout if theres a press conference scheduled he wanted to give me a headsup that he might want me to host it he knows jack hates doing it and isnt the most diplomatic lou laughed because jack was one of the most undiplomatic men he knew you guys make a good pair because you complement each other changing the subject he said what about a bite of lunch today do you have time for a quick one im sorry lou theyre dropping like flies out there lou laughed again he was glad the public couldnt hear the black humor that was often engaged in within the ocme walls i hear you lou levered his stocky frame out of lauries chair put his trench coat back on and made his farewells columbia university medical center new york city march pm the first time george heard pias theory he thought she had lost it for sure she said she believed that rothman and yamamoto were murdered using a radioactive agent polonium that was masked by the salmonella bacteria they had also been given george had sarcastically asked which james bond movie shed gotten that from but pia was as ever deadly serious george its actually happened before so its a copycat crime someone was actually murdered in this fashion truly the mans name was alexander litvinenko a russian he was killed in london in dont you remember it was all over the news i dont remember george admitted pia waved george over to the desk so he could see several of the newspaper stories she had found online then she filled him in on the basics of the case litvinenko was in the kgb then the fsb which is what replaced it he fled russia and was given political asylum in england he wrote a couple of books that were critical of the russian president putin youd think he would have been supercareful knowing what he did he meets these guys exkgb like him in a london hotel bar for tea within hours hes sick and hospitalized after several days hes diagnosed with radiation poisoning which is later figured out to be polonium he gets progressively worse since there was not a lot the doctors could do and dies about three weeks later three weeks thats a lot longer than rothman and yamamoto yeah i know but poloniums effects are doserelated we dont know how much polonium was used and when rothman and yamamoto were poisoned we dont know if they were poisoned thought george but he kept it to himself pia was on a roll so the brits investigate and find out about the bar and the tea and there was radiation all over the place especially in the teapot ultimately it was proven that he died from deliberate poisoning they did an autopsy and the pathologists had to wear hazmat suits litvinenkos gi tract was very hot to use your word the guy had to be buried in a leadlined coffin okay i can see why one spy might use something like this to kill another spy but why use it on doctors if you want to kill them why go to all that trouble why not just shoot them thats the clever part whoever did this did not want anyone to know it was an assassination they wanted it to appear like an accident the symptoms of radiation poisoning are camouflaged by the salmonella fever prostration delirium gi symptoms low white count everythings the same except the hair loss they were counting on the fact that no one would think to look for this kind of agent because of the typhoid fever diagnosis polonium is unique in that it decays by only emitting alpha particles which would only be detected if someone thought to look specifically for it but nobody would because the diagnosis of typhoid was so obvious pia was picking up steam again it all seemed to fit nor would the alpha particles make anyone else sick which obviously has been the case alpha particles can only travel about a centimeter and they can be blocked by as little as a sheet of paper its only if the polonium is breathed in or ingested that its dangerous and then its really dangerous especially in a large dose which can be rapidly fatal even as little as a millionth of a gram can kill you pia sat back in her seat with a look of triumph on her face what do you think george george was overwhelmed both by the amount of information pia had thrown at him and by her enthusiasm things fit but he couldnt help but wonder if pia was getting ahead of herself you have to assume the hair loss had no other cause george said he thought a little more but i guess this would explain why the antibiotics didnt work or maybe they were working but the radiation overpowered them exactly pia said it is diabolically fiendish whoever is involved is smartprobably a doctor or a scientist who knows a lot of medicine george thought about it some more he started pacing the room i guess its possible george said he could see no insurmountable problems with the theory so lets tell the authorities let them figure it out no we cant we dont know who did it i guess you have to assume that the guys who attacked you had something to do with it no doubt but this has to be a major conspiracy you know what this stuff is used for they use it to make firing mechanisms for nuclear weapons no one admits to making it although the major source is supposed to be russia i just read about it two minutes ago so the fsb can just call someone and get it but how do you get it in new york city there has to be a lot of people involved serious people with access to this material and i believe those guys when they warned me not to go to the police im not going to the authorities till i have enough proof to go to the media at the same time the media i told you i dont trust the authorities pia made quote marks in the air with her fingers if i give this story to the newspapers whoever is involved wont be able to bury it so what proof do you need pia turned back to the computer and made another search okay polonium has a halflife of a hundred and thirtyeight days meaning that it takes a hundred and thirtyeight days for it to lose half of its radioactivity so if thats what they used there has to be some trace around someplace either in the lab or in the rooms rothman and yamamoto occupied in the hospital even if someone was very careful giving it to them theres bound to be some residue just like there was in london in george joined pia at the computer looking over her shoulder how is polonium detected here it is pia said pointing at the screen alpha particles can be detected with a geiger counter pretty simple where are we going to get a geiger counter george said oh lets use mine it should be in the bottom drawer on your right very funny pia said geiger counters are not all that uncommon especially around a medical center like this they must have them in nuclear medicine well go over there and see if we cant borrow one i couldnt help notice that you said we george said so is this a formal invitation of course it is pia replied well thank you george said actually there was no way he would have allowed pia to go over to the hospital without him he reached out and felt along pias jaw maybe we should get you xrayed while were there i know a technician who would do it as a favor pia pushed his hand away i dont want to take the risk all right heres the plan george said ill help you look for a geiger counter but first i have to talk to my resident and come up with an excuse for not being around fine pia said i wouldnt mind a few minutes of rest whatever drug i was given has me feeling sleepy again i could use a bit of rest while you take care of business do you mind if i just lie down here on your bed call me when youre ready pia moved from the desk chair over to the bed and lay down she closed her eyes and let out a sigh she was tired and wired at the same time george went over to her and taking out his pocket light made her open her eyes he quickly checked pupillary light reaction it was normal jesus thats bright she complained turning her head to the side what the hell are you doing im just worried about a concussion george said thats a happy thought pia said its something to think about especially if youre sleepy good point but i think im fine just tired ill go back to radiology and make my excuses ill be right back wedge the chair under the door handle do you have your phone pia nodded make sure its charged my chargers on the desk and call me if you need me george would have been far happier calling the police or renting a car and driving pia as far out of the city as he could but hed come this far with her he just had to cover himself and hed be clear to stay with her for as long as it took to resolve this thing theyd get a geiger counter and find the proof if it existed or they wouldnt find the proof and pia would have to drop this theory as she had all the others perhaps then she would quit sleuthing columbia university medical center new york city march pm pias brief sleep was interrupted by george knocking gently on his own door she woke up with a start and recognized that she was in a room that was not her own she sat up feeling like she had a hangover all at once she realized where she was and the whole previous nights experience came flooding back pia got up from the bed swayed for a moment and went to the door who is it its george pia took the chair away from under the door handle she then hurried into georges compulsively clean bathroom and checked out her face wincing when she touched her bruised left jawbone and wincing again when she noticed for the first time that she also had the makings of a good black eye reflexively she closed her uninjured eye to make sure she could see normally she also examined her cut lip and then wiped away a bit of blood encrusted in her nostrils then she began to fill the sink to wash her face what time is it she called through the open door her mind was clearing and the dizziness shed experienced when first getting off georges bed had totally disappeared its about two a little after said george you want something to eat no theres no time we have to get moving the longer we wait the less chance we have of finding anything as we learned polonium has a relatively short halflife and you can just wash it off normally like dirt so youre sticking to the polonium idea george had half hoped pia would have cooled to her rather outlandish scenario by the time he got back absolutely it fits so well you agreed it fit didnt you it seems to george said provided we cant think of another reason for the hair loss but the practicalities seem so daunting and youre sure there was hair loss right oh god yes george im sure you saw it yourself george looked at pia as she emerged from the bathroom she had an intent expression on her face it seemed that pia was pleased with the power of her deductive reasoning or else with the elegance of the plot to murder her mentor do you have any idea how hard this must have been to pull off she said it makes the kennedy assassination look easy i think oswald acted alone okay bad example this has to be a sizable conspiracy with a number of people involved once we confirm the polonium i cant let the authorities spin the story which they will i need to make sure my version of the story which is the truth gets out but if theres proof the police will protect you bullshit its the police im most afraid of listen the more i think about it the more i think it has to have been other researchers or doctors the science behind it is impressive i mean it had to be someone with a medical background who thought all this through otherwise as you said why not just shoot them pia stopped herself im jumping the gun weve got to look for radiation left in the lab if its going to be anyplace thats where it will be im sure we need that geiger counter but lets make a quick detour back to my room i need to dig out some concealer the fact that i look like i got run over is going to raise some eyebrows lets make it quick george said ive only managed to wrangle a couple more hours i have to be back in the radiology department for an important lecture at four oclock pia and george were able to borrow a geiger counter from a resident in the department of nuclear medicine with ease it was an outofcommission machine awaiting recycling that was actually better at detecting alpha particles than the newer models with the detector in hand they hustled over to rothmans lab to check for any leftover radiation once at the labs outer door they hesitated the only person id rather not run into is spaulding pia said hes the only one who might cause us trouble i never got the impression that any of the other technicians liked me much but i cant imagine they would physically stop us want me to duck in and ask if hes around george questioned good idea pia responded it took george less than a minute when he reappeared he said that the secretary told him arthur spaulding was taking a late lunch lucky us pia said lets do it the pair entered the lab with pia in the lead marsha langman looked up pia said she was just coming by to get some personal items marsha shrugged and went back to her work whatever that was pia made a beeline for the biosafety unit they quickly donned protective clothing they were in a hurry and didnt want to be interrupted pia wanted to start in the unit because it was there that rothman and yamamoto had spent the entire morning on the fateful day as well as the day before the geiger counter was a small yellow box about the size of a large flashlight with a handle on top pia held the main instrument in her left hand and ran the sensor much like a microphone over the bench surfaces the machine made a slight crackling sound from background radiation every few seconds to pias chagrin they found nothing even under the hood itself as they removed their protective clothing they didnt talk emerging back into the lab they detoured to pias small office for marshas benefit pia had said she was there for some personal items so it was a command performance as per usual omeary was still there half up in pias ceiling space he poked his head down when he heard the students enter miss grazdani you back my god what happened to your face pia said nothing good news i found the short after all this time it was between here and the doctors office well be out of here today sorry about the inconvenience pia ignored him is that one of those geiger counters we did some radioisotope labeling in here pia said were just checking the place is clean which it is how does that thing work then look it up online like i did it made george uncomfortable that pia was being so short with this guy as his family was bluecollar george felt a kinship with people like maintenance workers disappointed at not finding any contamination in the biosafety unit pia was beginning to feel a big letdown yet there was one other place she wanted to check rothmans office besides the biosafety unit and the organ bath unit that was the only other place where both rothman and yamamoto spent any time the problem was marsha and her guarddog mentality even with rothman gone she suspected marsha would be marsha as pia and george returned to the lab proper pia was running through her mind possible ways to handle marsha luckily the problem solved itself marsha was no longer sitting at her desk pia guessed and hoped shed taken a late lunch like spaulding with marsha no longer standing guard pia and george hustled into rothmans inner office inside there had obviously been some packing going on because scattered around were open cardboard boxes half full of books and papers pia ran the probe around the desk the shelving behind the desk the couch and the coffee table where rothmans guests usually journalists would sit and hope that they would be the one to breach rothmans famous guard they were inevitably disappointed next they tried rothmans private bathroom which his celebrity status had afforded him no other lab had a bathroom like this but the geiger counter stayed mostly silent except for the background crackle just like in the biosafety unit pia almost forgot about it but there was one more roomnot so much a room as a storage area where rothman used to keep supplies scientific and secretarial the place was stacked with toilet paper and paper towels cases of beakers and test tubes reams of paper and old files and here also was rothmans beloved nespresso machine well maybe thought pia just maybe there were a few wayward clicks from the geiger counter next to the coffee and cappuccino maker that made pias pulse pick up speed next to the coffeemaker was a dish towel folded in half and carefully spread out in a small space between the coffeemaker and the coffee fixings themselves the towel was supporting four white porcelain coffee cups two espresso size and two regular size they were sitting upside down there were a few more clicks as pia ran the probe over the bottom of the two regular coffee cups then she held the counter in her left hand and turned the cups over she put the probe into one cup then another there was definite activity it wasnt off the chart but there was more activity in the cups than in the rest of the lab they got litvinenko with his tea pia said excitedly maybe they used the coffee here it would explain how they both got hit at the same time and no one else was affected doesnt sound like much radiation you think its significant its not much but it is registering alpha particles the cups were probably washed but theres still something left anyway its definitely significant lets get out of here pia took one of the coffee cups and held it gingerly by the handle she took a padded envelope slipped the cup inside and put it in the reusable shopping bag in which shed brought the geiger counter george and pia reversed their steps and emerged into the main part of the lab unfortunately they were in for a surprise marsha had apparently not gone for a late lunch and spaulding had returned from his both of them with indignant expressions blocked their way spaulding in particular had his hands on his hips and glared at pia how dare you he said haughtily i told you not to come back here and what are you doing with that he pointed at the geiger counter pia motioned for george to follow her her intention was not to engage them in conversation she started to skirt spaulding but he grabbed her arm protectively george moved to get in between them its all right george pia said in a calm voice arthur let go of my arm or ill file a complaint with the medical center authorities for sexual harassment spaulding let go of pias arm whose geiger counter is that does it belong to this lab he was sputtering dont worry arthur we signed it out from the appropriate department but what are you using it for in my lab i demand you tell me its a bullshit detector arthur oh look pia held the sensor up to arthurs face and it crackled with its background noise it appears to be working just fine after all pia pushed past spaulding and shot marsha an indifferent look before leaving the office columbia university medical center new york city march pm george was relieved to get away from spaulding and the lab unscathed and hoped their trespass wouldnt be communicated to bourse he hustled to catch up with pia and found her waiting for an elevator third strike youre out with that guy and youre at ohandtwo now you really should stay away from him thats okay said pia i have no reason to go back to the lab we picked up some clicks from the coffee cups but it was hardly what i was hoping for i dont know if thats going to be conclusive enough we need more evidence i was worried you were going to challenge spaulding about the freezer log i thought of it hes such an ass he has no authority to bar me from anywhere i have no idea if what we found in the storage facility has any relevance whatsoever if someone used a sample of salmonella from the freezer to infect rothman and yamamoto theres no way were really going to know so do you really think spaulding had something to do with rothmans death if he did he was a very small part of something larger hes not smart enough to think that up all by himself pia thought about what that might imply about who might possibly be involved if there was a broad conspiracy if spaulding had been recruited anyone could be a threat to her a thought that made her shudder she felt extraordinarily vulnerable as much as or more than anytime during her childhood as difficult as it was she just had to keep her nerve and find some more evidence george can i stay in your room tonight i dont want to be alone of course you can george said he was pleased she was asking he only wished the circumstances were different when they reached the street george expected pia to head back to the dorm instead she accompanied him toward the hospital it was raining and the wind was blowing sideways people were moving along with their heads down collars turned up against the cold so youre not satisfied with the readings from the coffee cups george said you dont think its enough to go to the media with i really dont think so the few clicks we heard might not be that uncommon i really dont know the cups obviously were rinsed out i think but not scrubbed clean i want to check the infectious disease ward the killer may have been able to clean up after himself at the lab but they wouldnt have been able to get onto the ward unless they have people on a cleaning crew which was entirely possible thought pia so thats where were going george asked he checked his watch he still had time before the lecture he had to attend yes they reached the ward and quickly saw the futility of the mission there were new patients in the rooms that had been occupied by rothman and yamamoto an infectious disease ward had to be kept spotless because of the nature of the illnesses and infections treated there the hospital was always aggressive with its general precautions here even more so after a couple of minutes of scouting around pia looked at her watch were wasting our time here lets go back to the morgue they took the elevator down to the basement this time taking the approved route in daytime there was slightly more activity than they had found on their visit the night before when the place was presided over by the mortuary diener from central casting the place itself had gained no luster without windows it could be day or night still bleak and decrepit there were several quite normallooking men in their fifties whose job it was to handle the comings and goings of the corpses they were helpful seemingly appreciating a visit from live people pia and george asked them if they remembered handling rothmans and yamamotos bodies they did because there had been quite a bit of fuss including a warning about the possibility of typhoid and instructions about general precautions we disinfected the body bags on the outside after the bodies were put inside the first man explained of course we used full precautions the whole time pia and george could see no id tags on the men and thought it prudent not to offer their own names so which gurneys did you use and were they treated afterward sure they were treated the man said and theyre still where they were treated do you mind if i take a look the attendant took the two students to another old autopsy room this one had a special ventilation system because it was used for dirty or decomposing cases pia proceeded to run the radiation detector around the gurneys but she found nothing what are you looking for exactly the diener asked one of the patients had had radioactive isotope therapy pia said thinking quickly we want to make sure there wasnt any leakage which there hasnt been so thank you as pia and george made their way back to the elevator george complimented pia on her quick thinking in reference to the radioactive isotope idea i had to come up with something maybe ill use the same story when i go to the mes office then she added nix that i couldnt get away with it with a medical examiner from the autopsy they would already know neither of the men had cancer pia pondered again i know ill say that rothman and yamamoto were using a radioactive alpha emitter in their research and we want to be sure they didnt contaminate themselves with it as well as contracting the salmonella ill tell them that its a safety issue sounds good said george by now they were inside the hospital lobby i have to have something to eat before i go downtown the mes office closes at five i think but im going to faint if i dont eat something i dont even know if i ate anything yesterday i know i havent today how are you with time ive got a few more minutes before my lecture they went to the hospital cafeteria it was busy even at offhours like this as illness and its treatment didnt operate on a convenient ninetofive schedule staff patients and visitors alike had to grab something to eat when they could pia got something substantial while george grabbed a coffee and a cookie so george said what about revisiting the idea of going to the police and telling them about the clicks we got with the geiger counter i just cant believe its a large conspiracy even if it was murder with polonium im sure the explanation is going to be something much more banal something we havent thought of i dont know perhaps he had gambling debts i couldnt disagree more if it was polonium it would have to be a highlevel operation of some kind polonium is impossible to get it would mean there would have to have been intense planning for weeksmonths even there has to be powerful people involved there has to be i essentially lived inside a conspiracy for years i told you george if you saw what ive seen youd know people are capable of anything george was aware that a couple of other diners people he didnt recognize were looking over at them from other tables pias makeup couldnt conceal all her bruises especially in the harsh fluorescent light of the cafeteria george leaned in toward her and lowered his voice so what do you intend to do exactly before you give up on this thing theres only one more place to check for significant radiationthe bodies at the ocme if there is none or i cant get in to check then ill give up my investigation is that good enough how are you going to get in the door at the me office george asked remembering their conversation the previous evening with the pathology resident i dont know that yet she said with a touch of irritation if i just tell them what i believe theyll think im crazy remember those research guys from columbia that were brought in here well i think someone put polonium in their coffee i may go with the alpha particle emitter idea i mentioned i dont know ill see how the land lies im just going to have to wing it maybe you should just go and hang out in your room hold off on going to the medical examiners for today youve been running around like crazy and you got beat up last night for christs sake i cant go with you this afternoon but perhaps we can go together in the morning tomorrows saturday i have no idea if the mes office is even open i dont know how long they keep the bodies there either i would imagine the office encourages families to arrange to take their relatives to the funeral homes as quickly as possible plus if we go tomorrow theyre likely to be shortstaffed theyll probably say come back monday and i just cant sit around i have to know youre probably right about saturdays george said but no george im going today you go to class theres no way i can get in trouble at the ocme youre very resourceful george said with a wry smile pia ignored the comment ill leave now would you mind hanging on to this coffee cup ill keep the geiger counter and hope i need it george took the bag not at all well meet up as soon as you get back he watched a focused pia leap up and lift her cafeteria tray and be careful try to stay out of trouble pia merely glowered at him before leaving george watched her wend her way among the tables deposit her tray at the window and then leave the idea occurred to him to call the police now that pia was safely out of sight but he knew if he did that whatever the outcome pia would never talk to him again he was certain that she would consider it an act of betrayal tossing back the remains of his coffee george got to his feet at least he was going to be on time for the lecture part iii belmont section of the bronx new york city march pm aleksander buda ended the call on his cell phone and held the device in his hand then used his spatulalike index finger to tap the endcall button there was now a problem in an operation that had gone so smoothly up to now and he hated problems problems gave him terrible heartburn he found the container of differentcolored antacid tablets he always carried took a handful and chewed them quickly one after another buda was fiftysomethingfiftywhat he didnt know for sure because his family had left albania with a few pots and pans and a little money but no documentation indicating when he was born over time first in italy and then in the united states he had acquired the paper trappings of the immigrant including a date of birth in but he had no idea if it was true buda wasnt a big man perhaps fivenine but he had closecropped hair with a scar that ran into his hairline on the right side of his broad face and enough prison tattoos on his arms should he care to show them to make anyone think twice about approaching him buda dressed unobtrusively today in a tan longsleeved shirt and jeans and sneakers one might imagine he actually was a handyman for a group of east side coops work he showed up for every now and again rather than what he really was the head of a crew in the albanian mob budas crew or clan was less hierarchically organized than a cosa nostra family and leadership was often fluid and based strictly on results through a combination of caution and brutality budas power had remained unchallenged for years the members of the crew shared their compatriots reputation for ruthlessness and violence gained over more than twentyfive years of aggressive criminal activity the albanians had come late on the new york scene and they had been keen to make up for lost time they took lowlevel positions in italian organizations only to rise up and challenge the longerestablished mafia stalwarts in europe albanian groups established a strong presence in hard and soft drug trafficking dominating the heroin trade in many countries running the raw materials from afghanistan through turkey to albania processed heroin and other drugs could then be distributed anywhere in the world through hubs like the terminals at port newark new jersey heroin was just one business the crews were involved in they also had interests in such prosaic activities as extortion loansharking and illegal gambling aleksander buda had lieutenants working such operations so he could keep a low profile and take on more lucrative projects such as the one he was working now the one with a problem buda was very aware that albanian crews had developed a profile one based in queens had been taken down by the fbi a few years before another in staten island was broken up in there were now more than two hundred thousand albanians in the new york metro area maybe three hundred thousand the vast majority all save a couple of hundred were hardworking and lawabiding buda and his men drifted in and out of this albanian diaspora hiding among them in plain sight the mob groups were clannish and secretive hypersensitive to any kind of insult and quick to use violence for the sake of vengeance under the albanian code of besa a mans word was his bond and a handshake was a castiron seal buda had an agreement to complete this task and he realized he was going to have to expose some of his men to take care of this particular problem and doing work in public was another thing that made him nervous after jerry trotter made his proposal to edmund three weeks previously it had taken edmund two days to call the number trotter gave him ten fifteen times he had told himself that he wouldnt call that hed throw the piece of paper in the fireplace and forget all about it other times he convinced himself that this was a test of his resolve set by jerry that if he called the number jerry himself would answer the phone but at times usually in the dead of night when he sat by himself in his study drinking whiskey edmund ran through what such a call would be like to make say this guy actually was a killer for hire how do you introduce yourself to someone like that what do you say he figured that if you called on business like this you didnt use your own phone edmund finally called the number from a pay phone in a laundromat on second avenue in the sixties in manhattan a busy spot without any obvious security cameras trained on it edmund steeled himself inserted his money and dialed the number someone picked up but didnt speak and edmund ran through his rehearsed lines hello i got your number from a friend i have a proposition for you this isnt a joke edmund didnt say any more the phone line quickly went dead an hour later edmund called again from the same pay phone can we meet somewhere i think youll want to hear what i have to say click the next day on the fourth attempt at ten in the morning a thickly accented voice said call in an hour pay phone bank at grand central mainlevel concourse edmund did as he was told take six train to morrison avenue exit platform north side and wait edmund was at a point of no return all hed done was make a few phone calls but now he was going to meet someone he knew was a killer he looked at the commuters walking through grand central ordinary people like him if he went ahead with this he would no longer be ordinary in the recent endless days and sleepless nights edmund had weighed the possible costs of doing what jerry demanded and doing nothing if he failed to act hed be ruined financially and personally but jerrys terrible scheme gave him a chance another thought had occurred to edmund and was proving impossible to ignore these doctors were destroying his business it was their fault he was in this position and he was damned if he was going to let them get away with it edmund rode the subway north to a section of the bronx hed never visited before he got off the train on a windswept elevated platform there was hardly anyone else around at eleven in the morning just two men who had alighted at the stationone who had sat in edmunds car another from the car behind his edmund left the station walked down to the street and stood by the exit he checked his phone and crossed and recrossed the street looking for some sign of life suddenly a dark blue panel van drew up and the back doors opened a voice from within told edmund to get in and he did the van drove away and immediately edmunds arms were seized tape was secured over his mouth and a cloth bag was roughly forced over his head his body was patted down hands thrust into his armpits and groin then his clothes were removed all of them and he was left naked bound and gagged on the floor of the van first as it rattled along the street and then for what seemed like an age parked someplace okay mr edmund mathews rich banker man from greenwich how did you get that phone number the voice came from the front of the van somewhere edmund tried to talk but his mouth was taped shut he mumbled and the voice said how rude of me let the man speak the tape was ripped away crudely and edmund reeled from the shock a friend of mine gave it to me he wouldnt say where he got it well see so what you want edmund laid out what he wanted it didnt take long but he had to explain a couple of times the need for using polonium to effect the killings okay this is what we do you come to middletown road subway station eleven tomorrow bring a deposit for me as a gesture of goodwill say fifty thousand dollars in ben franklin notes nonrefundable give the man back his clothes edmunds arms and legs were freed and he dressed quickly the van moved again and stopped after a few minutes and the doors opened edmund got out in a bleak parking lot behind an abandoned building he figured out where he was less than a halfmile from where he had been picked up and he took the subway back to manhattan more than at any point throughout the whole ordeal edmunds flight reflex was strongest that night if he called the fbi surely he could give them jerry and this guy whoever he was and at least he would be free from this crazy plot but he wouldnt be free of lifedeals and gloria croft and his own imminent destruction the statistical solutions data had finally come in and merely underscored what russell and edmund already knew their model was shot to pieces the moment regenerative medicine became a reality his need to stand and fight kicked in edmund traveled again to the bronx and was again driven away in a van this time of a different color again he was bound and stripped but his clothes were returned more quickly this time and his mouth wasnt taped a small mercy for which edmund was grateful he could feel that the envelope with the was no longer in his jacket pocket thank you for the money the same voice said a more cautious man would throw you out of the van now and be happy with good takings for one days work but i read about you mr mathews and i am intrigued then i read about the people you say you want to die and i think what are they doing i dont understand i am a stupid peasant then i think this guy must be for real i dont know why but i do i also think this is a very expensive idea someone has to go to russia buy this radioactive material from some very bad men and not get caught they have to give this material to the marks plus the bacteria and not get caught we can do it but not for one million dollars how much then two and a half jesus mr money guy i see where you live how much money you make you are not doing a trade here on wall street i dont negotiatethat is the price and tomorrow the price is more okay sorry speak up please okay said edmund the two men met once more three days later edmund told russell he needed a huge amount of cash but not what it was for russell asked once and edmund bit his head off so russell just did what he was told it took russell two and a half days to assemble one and a half million dollars from various business and personal accounts edmund packed it into a large baseball equipment bag and drove to the address he had been given on the phone it was the same parking lot where he had been let out the first day once more edmund got in the van and went through the same degrading procedure i guess you trust me the voice said i now have onepointfivefive million dollars from you and i havent done shit but i am a businessman and i will fulfill my end of the deal the man gave instructions for paying the rest of the money once the job was finished the job would be done sometime in the next month edmund said nothing but one more thing first something i need to know otherwise i am afraid i wont be able to go ahead edmund said nothing who gave you my phone number was it your partner mr russell lefevre no so who was it edmund was silent i really want to know so edmund told him okay thank you now release mr mathews from the front seat of the van a man turned back toward edmund he was wearing dark glasses and a baseball cap but edmund could see a livid scar on the mans forehead running up toward his scalp the man was holding out his right hand shake my hand then we have a deal the men shook hands and edmund heard nothing more until march aleksander buda thought some more about the information hed just received and with his phone still in his hand he called edmund mathews yesterday we followed to the letter the course of action you recommended and it didnt work i didnt think it would someone i have onsite tells me he saw her going around today with a geiger counter her and that guy she hangs out with you know what that means it means someones seen through your brilliant plan shit yes shit as in what we are standing in up to our knees unless we do something right now its going over our heads the conversation was much too specific for budas liking but he felt he had to get the okay from the banker and make sure edmund realized the price had gone up the job itself shouldnt be difficult the girl was hardly being discreet but he had a troublesome task to take care of when he heard the girls name was grazdani he paused it sounded albanian to him and he wanted to be very sure that killing an albanian girl wasnt going to step on anyones toes he didnt want to be the cause of a blood feud like thered been in the s hed have to snatch her hold her and put feelers out to see if there were any grazdanis in the crews in the neighboring areas but what were the odds okay edmund said finally feeling the same numbness he had felt when he agreed to the deal in the first place there are two of them actually buda was saying it will be another ten percent ten percent of the total or the balance ah ever the money guy said buda the total buda ended the call and summoned prek vllasi and genti hajdini to his office in a trailer parked inside a lowceilinged warehouse buda dressed his senior lieutenants down severely in albanian you were useless last night she wasnt put off at all didnt you do anything to her you see genti said to prek we should have done her when we had the chance like i said last night knocking her around wasnt going to be enough he turned to buda shes a tough bitch i can see that buda said genti had been nursing a black eye all day now this whole thing is about to go down the drain because of her she knows what happened god knows how you gotta get back over there right now and take out her boyfriend and grab her off the street boyfriend prek said what boyfriend you mean the kid she was hanging around with last night unless hes with her when we grab her i dont know if wed recognize him hes the guy with his tongue in her ear buda snapped he was steaming but he quickly realized prek was right to be cautious killing the wrong man would be counterproductive ill get a picture of him from the medical school database and send it to your phones his name is george wilson he said referring to a note and remember pick up the grazdani woman buda said and dont touch her you animal unless shes not related to anyone important in which case shes all yours understand genti word is she was in rothmans lab just a few minutes ago poking around take her to the summer house and call me when you get there and take neri krasnigi with you it seems like the two of you cant handle her krasnigi was relatively new to the crew younger inexperienced and more vicious than either genti or prek the two men were affronted by the order but didnt show it as the men exited the trailer buda shouted after them use the white van for the pickup and then dump it take the blue one to the house prek gave a thumbsup sign and walked away prek and genti found neri krasnigi sitting in a battered old armchair at the back of the warehouse reading a german playboy prek told him to follow and the three men got into the white van the plates were obscured with what appeared to be dried mud but which was actually cleverly painted plaster as they pulled out into lorillard place heading quickly toward east fordham road prek filled neri in on the afternoons operation what they had in mind to pull off was a pair of albanian specialties a blindingly fast hit and snatch in broad daylight if necessary in the albanian mindset it didnt matter neri was excited this would be his first official hit they checked that their automatic pistols were loaded duct tape blankets balaclavas two columbia university medical center police uniforms and a can of ultane a volatile rapidinduction anesthetic were piled into the back of the van the white van pulled into a garage and genti got out and climbed into a blue van starting it up he followed prek in the white van they parked the blue van near the george washington bridge and set out again in the white van toward columbia university medical center columbia university medical center new york city march pm unbeknownst to george wilson at the same time he was thinking about contacting the police pia was too not seriously but it had crossed her mind it was certainly true that if an investigation needed to be done they were far more capable and could turn over rocks she couldnt even approach but then there was the issue of what she would tell them would she say that shed picked up a few lonely alpha particles in a coffee cup and thought it was evidence of a grand conspiracy of course not there was no doubt in her mind that she would not be taken seriously which ultimately would increase her vulnerability rather than decrease it the police would think she was crazy and probably call the dean believing they were acting in her best interest of course going to the police had another downside they might be tempted to look her up in their computer and even though bad stuff about her teenage years was not supposed to be there it might be no she would not go to the police instead as planned shed go to the ocme in a final attempt to figure out the affair if that didnt yield overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing shed give up just as shed told george when pia had reached the street coming from the hospital cafeteria her intention had been to head down to broadway to take the subway downtown but feeling the temperature and noticing that the rain had increased she decided to take a quick detour back to the dorm for a better coat and an umbrella she knew the subway would get her only so close to the ocme and that shed end up walking how far she had no idea in the dorm she hesitated outside her door just as she and george had done outside his earlier being attacked in her room the previous night made her paranoid she didnt know how the men had gotten into her room repeating what she and george had done after silently unlocking her door she opened it suddenly prepared to flee if needed she also carefully checked her bathroom to make certain it was empty it was with a warmer rainresistant coat and an umbrella pia set off on her way to the subway she had put the geiger counter in another shopping bag to make it easier to carry she checked the time it was almost four so if she was going to make it to the ocme before it closed she had to get moving walking quickly in the darkening day pia passed the black building she went another fifty feet along west th street when she saw two hospital security police up the street walking toward her she stopped she couldnt see them well in the fading light with mist rising off the pavement but she could see their uniforms well enough they were the same uniforms her attackers had worn the previous night to make matters worse they seemed approximately the same height and build fighting the urge to flee pia stopped dead in her tracks ahead to her right was a porte cochere for the hospital pia considered racing to it and into the hospital where she could vanish into the crowds but shed hesitated too long shed have to pass the security guards before she got to the entrance she looked behind her and saw there were surprisingly few people on the street she thought about dashing back to the black building but thought that if the men wanted to catch her they probably could before she got inside turning back around she eyed the approaching guards they seemed to be staring intently at her she froze suddenly remembering a similar scene imbued with the same fear and dread she was thirteen at the time and had been at the hudson valley academy for girls for maybe a year the stress of constantly being on guard the fear of being attacked at any time wore on pia a couple of times shed cracked and tried to run away from the school and she did so again this time she got lost and had to spend a harrowing moonless night in the woods surrounding the school grounds the night wore on and on and hummed with threat pia tried and failed to make her way back to the academy in the hope of breaking back in before anyone realized she was gone pia had spent the hours before dawn slumped against the trunk of a tree dozing fitfully she arose at first light and walked east toward the sun until she found herself on an unfamiliar street winding downhill it was then that she saw two policemen in the middle distance they were implacably and threateningly walking toward her staring at her unblinkingly silent like automatons pia froze as if by standing as still as possible they might not see her when they were within ten feet of her they parted one walking to her left one to her right perhaps they hadnt seen her perhaps they werent looking for her at all but when the men came alongside her they suddenly lunged at her roughly grabbing an arm each once again she was a prisoner of the state totally vulnerable now the same feelings flooded pias brain the security guards were coming at her with the same silent intensity drilling her with their beady eyes pia stood stockstill and closed her eyes just like the eden falls policemen the men parted right in front of her and went on either side and moved on the man to her left brushed past her upper body then turned and said somethingwas he apologizing or saying get out of the way or making a lewd remark pia didnt know she breathed out with relief unaware that shed been holding her breath pia was embarrassed by the depth of her paranoia she shivered and a chill ran down her spine the unnerving episode had taken only seconds she wiped perspiration from her forehead and then hurried on toward broadway by the time she passed the hospital entrance her breathing and pulse were almost back to normal on broadway she relaxed further as there were significantly more people she felt safer thereshe was safer there in the near distance loomed the subway entrance swallowing pedestrians like an insatiable monster a gust of wind blew the umbrella she was holding almost out of her hand and she fought with it for a moment to get it under control once she did she closed it and hurried forward to the stairs th street and broadway new york city march pm holy shit there she is genti shouted pointing as prek made the righthand turn from broadway onto th street running between the columbia university medical center on the left and the armory on the right gentis glance had alighted on the woman carrying a shopping bag when the wind blew her umbrella threatening to lift her into the air he saw her face clearly and it was the grazdani girl no doubt about it she was walking quickly toward the subway entrance stop genti shouted as prek slowed whos with her no one i didnt see no one shouted genti let me out wait for me here genti who was riding shotgun leaped from the van the moment prek was able to stop he ran after pia who he guessed was maybe twenty yards ahead of him making her way toward the subway entrance as he ran genti checked that the gun was secure in his jacket pocket he wasnt certain what hed do if he caught up with hershould he shoot her in the street grab her and bring her back to the van he just knew the one thing he couldnt do was lose her genti watched pia disappear from his view as she descended quickly into the station while he weaved in and out of the cars gypsy cabs buses and vans on the busy corner of broadway and th street he reached the subway entrance and rushed down the stairs but couldnt see her was she catching the a train or the probably the express train the a he thought he was desperately looking ahead for her half pushing people out of the way excuse me excuse me he didnt want to get too aggressive new yorkers were liable to get aggressive right back at you genti rarely rode the subway and didnt have a metro card that he could swipe to get through the turnstiles and he certainly didnt have time to stop and buy one from a machine hoping there were no cops looking out for fare dodgers he followed a schoolkid and pushed through the turnstile behind him genti had to choose the a or the changing his mind he opted for the and as he neared the giant aging elevator that took riders to the platform deep underground he caught a glimpse of pia at the head of a group of passengers whod just got on the doors began to close he saw she was standing to the side ready to be first off he raced forward hold the elevator he shouted hold it genti reached the doors as they were almost closed and frantically tried to stop them for a moment his hand was trapped and he was forced to pull it out quickly he looked around stairs genti wasnt careful anymore he pushed past an old woman and leaped down the refusestrewn stairs three or four at a time he didnt know that the platform was the equivalent of eight stories below and pressed on dodging the few passengers walking up or down yelling at everyone to get the fuck out of the way he was breathless but reached the bottom only to find that the elevator had already discharged its load of descending passengers and new ones were already boarding genti took in lungfuls of air his hands on his knees he was the first to admit not being in the best shape then he heard nearby the highpitched squeal of a subway trains brakes uptown or downtown he guessed she was going downtown as the majority of people were doing he pushed forward and heard the mechanical sound of train doors opening he entered a barrelceilinged passageway leading from the elevators to the station itself suddenly there was a crowd of people coming toward him filling the tunnel from one side to the other theyd just disembarked from the train and he had to fight his way through them when he reached the platform he looked up and down its length spotting pia farther down the platform genti saw her clear as day she was right there maybe thirty feet in front of him she stepped into a car then genti made a mistake while he waited for the please stand clear of the closing doors announcement that always preceded the trains departure genti marched down the platform intending to board the train through the same door she did then as he drew level the doors closed without warning genti banged on the door and looked back toward the conductor about twenty feet away hey man the door the conductor ignored him and the trains brakes released with a hiss of air genti looked into the car pias and gentis eyes locked for a brief second before the train began to pull away from the station all pia saw was another guy trying to push his way onto the train genti turned to stare down the conductor who drew his head into his cab with a slight smile on his face as the train picked up speed genti watched it disappear into the tunnel keeping his eyes on its taillights until they disappeared into the gloom hed failed genti walked back to the elevator in some ways he was embarrassed that hed missed the girl but he rationalized that it probably was for the best maybe he would have had trouble getting her out of the station without interference besides he reasoned if they were supposed to get the boy too it would be easier to get them together and deal with them at the same time if theyd taken the girl the boyfriend might have gone to ground and been hard to find by the time genti had ridden up in the elevator he was feeling much better about having missed pia and he had been reminded of what a beauty she was he looked forward to snatching her off the street and taking her to budas isolated summer house where no one could hear anything going on inside genti stepped onto the street and looked for the white van but couldnt spot it he called prek who told him he was down beyond the neurological institute where hed been able to snag a great parking place between the medical school and the dorm just beyond where th street turns into haven avenue genti walked west and soon saw the van he got in and related how hed just missed her in the elevator and then missed her a second time as she was getting on the subway car he said he was so close it was frustrating its not the worst thing prek said echoing gentis earlier thoughts this is the perfect spot right here hopefully if were lucky when she shows up it will be with the boyfriend and well be waiting im thinking we need to get them together how will we know which one he is genti said i bet she has a lot of boyfriends as if aleksander buda were reading their minds preks cell phone buzzed it was an email from buda with an attachment when prek opened the jpeg he found himself staring at georges medical school admission photo listing his height and weight hes sixone oneninety with blond hair said prek taller than most we shouldnt have too much trouble picking him out perhaps hell come by on his own genti said no my sense is theyll be together since they seem to be spending a lot of time together recently i know i would if i was him i imagine theyll meet up when she comes back from wherever shes going corner of first avenue and thirtieth street new york city march pm as the last of the daylight threatened to fade away completely thanks to the low clouds and rain pia paused outside the office of the chief medical examiner gazing at the front of the halfcenturyold building it wasnt inviting in the least with its weird facade of blue glazed tiles that reminded her of the ishtar gate of ancient babylon shed seen pictures of the latter in an almost equally ancient encyclopdia britannica at the academy she glanced at the tile and then at the outdated sstyle aluminumframed windows worldclass ugly pia had been worried about making it in time but shed been lucky with the trains now that she was there she wasnt as confident as she had been about going in cold like this she had no contacts there no one she knew she could trust no one she knew on any level and this wasnt a feeling she liked she was very aware that this was the new york city ocme and shed had a lot of bad experiences with various city agencies as a child the state may have provided her with food and shelter but it had also fed and sheltered her enemies and abused her there was not a lot of reason not to worry that this city agency wouldnt be equally as nasty pia had another thought what would happen if she went in there and actually succeeded in her mission what if she asked to see rothmans body and somehow got permission and then found that he had in fact been irradiated proving that he and yamamoto were murdered her mind raced thered be a huge police action and shed be at the center it would be a media circus she and george would be questioned shed have to voice her myriad suspicions and assist with inquiries and make statements and possibly appear in court but then she touched her tender jaw and remembered the beating and the warning shed gotten the night before she had no choice the answers to her questions lay in this building or they were nowhere at all taking a deep fortifying breath pia tucked her umbrella under her arm and went in the front door the reception area showed every bit of its fifty years it was dark and somewhat dingy with a worn dark brown leather couch and a few other worn mismatched chairs the linoleum floor was cracked and scarred on a low coffee table were some dogeared magazines with the address labels torn off the covers there was a crowd of people sprinkled on the furniture and some leaning against the wall soon it became apparent they were all together members of a grieving africanamerican family with at least three generations represented two teenaged girls were hugging in a corner crying softly excuse me pia said approaching the receptionist a security guard sat at another table off to the side next to a set of glass doors the receptionist carefully dressed and pleasantly plump was wearing a name tag that read marlene she looked up she had a friendly smile yes honey hi im a medical student and id very much like to talk to one of the medical examiners are you here to find out about teaching opportunities at the ocme like the elective for medical students maybe pia said wanting to keep her options open maybe marlene questioned with a smile what is it exactly you want to talk to the medical examiner about pia hesitated actually id like to discuss a specific case two cases to be more precise are they relatives of yours no perhaps its best if you talk to the department of public relations if its information about a specific case you want seeing as youre not a relative pia saw she was losing ground the last thing she wanted was to be shunted off to the public relations department where she surely wouldnt get access to rothmans corpse fearing she might be turned away pia studied the receptionists face trying to think of an approach marlene seemed to be a congenial person and for a brief moment pia toyed with the idea of telling at least a partial truth quickly she decided against it any way she explained the reason she was there that approached the truth would sound too bizarre actually i also want to talk about the teaching opportunities here the two cases i mentioned are teaching cases that ive heard about ive come all the way down from columbia pia smiled to try to cover up any potential inconsistencies ive become interested in forensics very interested marlene was confusedwhat did this girl really want she was also impressed that she had come all the way from columbia medical center way up in washington heights that took some effort especially late on a friday afternoon marlene didnt have the heart to send her away without talking to someone besides she was a pretty thing and marlene knew exactly who would be more than happy to speak with her okay then ill call dr mcgovern is he a medical examiner hes a medical examiner and he also happens to be the coordinator for teaching at ocme thank you pia was delighted marlene put in a call to chet mcgovern and motioned for pia to take a seat pia stepped away from the receptionists desk she didnt sit down as there were no chairs available it was close to five oclock so she had to make a quick impression on this mcgovern guy a moment later the glass doors opened and a heavyset woman in a lab coat appeared holding a clipboard she introduced herself to the grieving family as rebecca marshall an id coordinator and asked them to follow her dutifully the entire clan disappeared through a door marked id room pia took one of the newly vacated seats and tried to be patient while she waited she tried to decide what approach to take with the medical examiner should she be aggressive or coy eventually she decided shed have to wait and see what kind of man dr mcgovern turned out to be she was hoping for someone on the youngish side someone she could flirt with to a degree over the years shed learned she had an effect on most men and she thought that this was one of those situations where it could work to her advantage usually it was the opposite a few minutes later her prayers were answered when a youngish man came through the inner doors in a long white lab coat with the confident air of a doctor when he took one look at pia who was the only person in the waiting room his face lit up pia recognized the reaction shed seen it too many times not to he appeared to be in his forties early fifties at most he was blond and goodlooking in a masculine allamerican way somewhat like george and pia could tell he was in good shape he came right over to pia like a bee to honey and introduced himself pia did the same avoiding his stare she recognized the type immediately an irrepressible lothario who undoubtedly saw every attractive single woman younger than him as a challenge she was encouraged after the introductions which included him repeating proudly that he was indeed the current coordinator for teaching at the ocme he said lets go up to my office and see if we cant help you out thanks marlene mcgovern winked at marlene behind pias back and marlene rolled her eyes as mcgovern escorted pia to his thirdfloor office he peppered her with questions about where she was at medical school what year and what she thought she might like to specialize in he mentioned how interesting medical forensics was and offered up his credentials pia played along answering mcgoverns questions acting as if she were interested in his life story and achievements they entered mcgoverns small office and sat on either side of mcgoverns untidy desk sorry about the mess so what can i do for you miss er mcgoverns eyes shone with the struggle he was having remembering her name grazdani thank you for seeing me with so little warning my pleasure im sure i want to know about autopsies that were performed here on dr tobias rothman and dr junichi yamamoto from columbia university medical center they died the morning of march twentyfourthyesterdayof typhoid fever pia was all business taking mcgovern aback im assuming autopsies have already been done she said er well er i wasnt involved in either one and i havent heard much scuttlebutt around the office other than one of them was the famous nobelwinning researcher all i heard was that he died of an extremely aggressive infection but let me check what we have mcgovern keenly wanted to be helpful he looked at pia and she half smiled back at him using the computer on his desk mcgovern looked up the names to get the ocme accession numbers and then brought up the individual cases here we are yes it says the autopsies were performed the afternoon of the twentyfourth so that was er yesterday the day they died mcgovern scrolled through one file then the other they certainly were both serious infectious cases with severe erosion of the gut both small intestine and large wow anyway theyre considered osha cases which was the main reason they were autopsied osha cases pia questioned shed heard the acronym but couldnt remember what it was for mcgovern looked up the occupational safety and health administration its a government agency that gets involved when there are deaths in the workplace involving public safety issues the autopsy results will be reported to osha as the ocme is required to do by law mcgovern looked back at his screen okay both cases were done by dr jack stapleton hes our superdoc who does more cases than anyone else hes never satisfied always pushing for more works hard like he doesnt have a life lets see the cause of death for both cases is listed as infectious diseasetyphoid feverand the manner of death is accidental let me ask you do you know why the manner of death is considered accidental pia said that she didnt not adding that she might be challenging that official verdict if the two researchers had come down with typhoid after eating at a restaurant like the hospital cafeteria then their deaths would have been labeled natural since typhoid is a foodborne pathogen but since they contracted the disease in a laboratory or in a workplace setting then its accidental because it certainly couldnt be considered a natural process mcgovern was trying his best to sound authoritative and if for some reason the researchers infected themselves on purpose then the manner of death would be suicide and last but not least if someone purposely infected them then it would be homicide mcgovern laughed and held his hands out wide as if to say see what a good teacher i am pia didnt laugh with him or even smile for her he was acting stereotypically transparent hes talking to me like im a college coed she thought after a slightly awkward beat because of pias lack of response mcgovern said do you have any specific questions about the autopsies if you do i can call jack and ask him directly i know hes still here chet mcgovern would have liked nothing better than to have pia indebted to him for his help an hour earlier hed learned his fridaynight plans had fallen through and he hated spending the best night of the week on his own he was about to ask her if she was free and if she might like to have a bite of dinner when he noticed she was lifting her bag up onto the desk she then reached into it and pulled out a yellow instrument a lead and mikelike device attached it took mcgovern a minute but he recognized it as a geiger counter well pia said to be honest what id really like to do is check if rothman and yamamoto might be emitting a small amount of radioactivity i mean if that would be all right i suppose mcgovern said not wanting to say no but confused by the strange request there was obviously something she wasnt telling him but he decided to play along why do you think they might be emitting radioactivity here was the thousanddollar question she still hadnt decided how she was going to respond even though she had been reasonably certain it would come up she could go for broke and voice her suspicions or be more prudent and try to be obtuse about it on the spot she decided on the latter im involved in a project for a thesis involving radioisotopes used for research she said pia decided this wasnt the time to raise suspicion about why she was really there at the ocme she didnt want to show her hand just yet she didnt want the ocme calling up the medical center and talking about her visit because it would reveal to whoever was involved in the conspiracy that she hadnt stopped her meddling i worked in dr rothmans lab for more than three years and i know that certain isotopes were used in that period for various experiments i just want to be sure there hasnt been any contamination to the personnel i checked rothmans lab and there was a very small amount of what we want to believe was rogue radiation in the office by his coffeemaker i hope you can help its for everyones peace of mind pia stopped she knew what she had just said didnt make total sense but it sounded good she smiled as pleasantly as she could she hoped her smile didnt look as fake as it felt she could tell that mcgovern was suspicious and hesitant but that he hadnt ruled out granting her request is that what you told marlene downstairs he asked i told her i was interested in a couple of particular cases oh okay she said you wanted to know about the ocme electives never mind listen we have radiation detectors down in the mortuary area just in case and nothing has sounded recently especially not yesterday i know that for a fact well thats not surprising because the isotopes weve been using in the lab were all alpha emitters for targeted alpha therapy such as bismuth and lead which wouldnt be picked up by general radiation detectors made for beta and gamma radiation pia smiled again and mcgovern nodded knowingly even though he had no idea what she was talking about the last time he read much about radioisotopes was over a decade earlier when he was studying for his boards mcgovern looked pensive pia thought he was thinking about alpha particles in fact mcgovern was running a mental checklist at first hed questioned himself but no he was certain hed never seen a betterlooking medical student which was saying something as they were in his opinion getting betterlooking every year at least at nyu which was where most of the medical students he met in his position as ocme teaching coordinator were from he should spend more time at columbia he thought so you just want to make sure rothmans and yamamotos bodies are not emitting alpha radiation mcgovern asked just to be certain he understood thats right thats why i brought this geiger counter its specially programmed for detecting alpha particles mcgovern went back to his monitor lets see there might just be a problem the bodies of infectious cases like these dont stay around here very long for obvious reasons yup he said suddenly tapping the screen with a forefinger just as i thought theres a problem as i said in serious infectious cases like typhoid fever and a few other communicable diseases the bodies arent held here in the ocme after the autopsies are completed and the cause and manner of death corroborated the bodies are released to the families and the respective funeral homes and cleared for cremation in other words mcgovern said the researchers bodies are no longer here youre about twenty hours too late pia mouthed a repressed shit which mcgovern caught and appreciated he associated colorful language with feistiness and he loved feistiness in a woman it was his hope that now that hed ascertained the bodies were no longer at the ocme perhaps they could move on to more interesting topics like fridaynight plans meanwhile pia stared into the middle distance thinking she could hardly reproach herself twentyfour hours ago when the bodies left shed never even heard of polonium watching pias expression chet suddenly was afraid that after hearing the news she might get up and leave she was clearly disappointed in his mind her leaving at that point would be a major tragedy because so far hed not gotten either cell phone number or an email address from her the guy who did both autopsies is just down the hall chet reminded pia and hes a friend so if you have a specific question about what he found im happy to go ask him pia was disappointed it had never occurred to her that rothmans and yamamotos bodies would have already been sent to funeral homes she thought briefly about trying to find out the names of the funeral homes but she didnt know how she would do that without raising a lot of suspicion as for talking to the me down the hall what would possibly be the point columbia university medical center new york city march pm earlier while prek and genti had sat in the van neri krasnigi the recruit foisted on them by buda for god knows what reason had been continually walking along th street and the small portion of haven avenue from the medical school entrance back to the van hed been ordered to have his cell phone in the radio mode to act like a walkietalkie to stay in contact neri was dressed in one of the security guard uniforms which now looked pretty wet from the rain prek knew he was taking a chance that neri might bump into one of the real security guards but he had been willing to risk it prek wanted as much notice as possible when either pia or george appeared heading in their direction on their way to the dorm nevertheless neri had been ordered back inside the vehicle prek was as content as he could be given the situation he was certainly keyed up as he always was before a hit especially with a couple of red bulls under his belt he had another beside him just in case he needed it the radio in the van was playing heavy metal with the volume turned low as he sat and waited prek methodically rubbed the scar on his upper lip it was a habit that he wasnt even aware of it was now almost fivethirty aleksander buda had called to check in at five oclock and prek had to explain that they had spotted the girl but lost her in the subway when buda exploded with a string of choice expletives in albanian questioning the virtue of preks mother and parentage prek had held the phone away from his ear and even blushed slightly neri who could hear buda clearly even though he was sitting on a milk crate in the back of the van let out a chuckle before he could stop himself earning a scowl from prek as soon as budas volcano subsided prek held the phone to his ear again was she carrying anything like an overnight bag no just a shopping bag and an umbrella im sure shes coming back she better be what about the guy no sign of him yet he may be in class or whatever it is medical students do theyre just getting out now streaming by the van of course he could be in his dorm room having passed by before we got here but from watching her like we did im sure theyll meet up and well be here dont fuck this up buda said and ended the call prek looked around the floor of the van by his feet and picked up one of the empty red bull cans hed dropped there and hurled it into the back of the van in the direction of neri you ass you think this is funny get the dry hospital security uniform on youre going back out for a walk the commandperformance radiology lecture george wilson had made a point of attending had finally finished unfortunately it hadnt been great the speaker had a soporific voice and george and the rest of the attendees had had a difficult time staying awake late lectures were a problem in that regard for most people especially when the lights dimmed for the de rigueur slides halfway through the talk georges mind had wandered to what pia was finding downtown and whether or not she was safe and keeping out of trouble george knew that if she caused trouble and the ocme called bourse to complain it would probably be the end of pias medical school days at least at columbia as the lecturer had droned on george found himself wishing hed gone with her george got his stuff together and exited the lecture hall he certainly hadnt learned anything reaching the street he donned his coat and turned up the collar it wasnt raining so much as drizzling he had a knot in his stomach from worrying about pia he was worried that hed allowed her to go on her own and wondered when hed hear from her along with a large clot of first and secondyear students george walked through the earlyevening air toward the dorm and past a young security guard who seemed to be patrolling the front of the building george looked at him quickly as he had no umbrella and his black fakeleather coat with its fakefur collar appeared soaked he looked about seventeen and george paid him no mind he walked into the dorm building and waited with the throng of students for an elevator for the fiftieth time george checked his phone there was no text message from pia no call or email when he reached his room george flopped down on the bed exhausted and hungry he suddenly felt alone and afraid he knew he wasnt nearly as tough as pia armed with what little he knew of her upbringing he was aware of how much shed been through in her life it was so much more than he had ever experienced sure his dad died when he was young and there hadnt been a lot of money around when he was growing up but his mother had always made sure he was loved and looked after she paid attention to his educationmade sure he studied and guided him through high school and college and on to medical school she was always there making sure he worked hard enough to justify the scholarships he needed to attend arizona state university and then columbia medical school all in all george had had support and security all his life exactly the opposite of pia vaguely he wondered where he would be today had he shared pias experiences probably in something like a hamburger joint slinging hash suddenly george missed hearing a friendly voice he called his mom but got the ancient answering machine she still insisted on using he didnt leave a message then he looked at his watch and called his grandmother sally mason in phoenix he thought the middle of the afternoon would be a good time to catch her but it was not meant to be this time he left a message after george had passed by and entered the dorm neri went to the driversside window of the van prek lowered the window and looked at the rookie and felt sorry for him he looked bedraggled with his dark hair plastered against his forehead okay prek said get back in the van but stay in the uniform thanks neri said and meant it he quickly entered through the vans sliding door prek watched him in the rearview mirror as he pulled off the wet jacket genti was tapping a pencil against the dash in time to the music did the george fellow look at you prek asked still watching the underling in the mirror it was easier than turning around he did he looked me right in the eye why do you ask just curious it doesnt matter does it cant imagine prek said i was hoping theyd be together but what can you do when you finish getting settled bring that milk carton up to the front and sit between us i want you to look out the windshield for the grazdani girl along with us six eyes are better than four the trickle of medical students had swelled to a horde like livestock returning from the pasture on their way back to the barn the van was parked on the west side of haven avenue facing southeast prek et al were facing the medical students coming from the medical center complex passing the van on the passengers side we have one bird in the nest now where the hell is the other one where the devil did she go office of the chief medical examiner first avenue new york city march pm chet mcgovern waited with anticipation for the beautiful med student sitting in front of him to tell him if there was anything she wanted him to ask jack stapleton who had performed the autopsies on the dead researchers she was interested in mcgovern tried to read her face shed looked crestfallen a few minutes earlier when he told her the bodies were gone but now she seemed to have brightened after a few moments contemplation something seemed to have occurred to her well maybe there is something you could ask pia said what what would you like me to ask him mcgovern said he tried to mask his eagerness worried it might scare her off pia remembered rothmans rebound tenderness which she had been the first to find it heralded the peritonitis which bore witness to what was going on in rothmans gut typhoids target organ was the small intestine from her recent research she knew that the gut was also sensitive to radiation particularly the cells that lined the gut but it was the whole gut not just the small intestine if polonium was involved then the whole gut would have been damaged id like to know if the autopsy findings were typical for typhoid fever let me go and find him mcgovern said with alacrity not a problem dont move he jumped up before pia could change her mind and dashed out of the room heading down the hall to jack stapletons office he knocked on the door and barged in without waiting for an answer to his dismay the office was empty damn he then ran down to the office of jacks wife laurie whose door was ajar as usual to his delight both laurie and jack were there laurie and jack liked to hang out in one of their offices after the rush of the day and go over their cases and maybe make plans for the evening the rushhour traffic particularly bad on fridays would subside a little if they waited to leave until six and with the livein nanny at home tending to jjs needs there was no rush this was their quiet time and they relished it because it was in short supply considering how busy they both were jack thank god oh hi laurie how are you jack listen chet was talking excitedly and loudly at first but got mockconspiratorial he looked behind him and pushed lauries office door almost closed so no one else could hear jack i have got the bestlooking fourthyear medical student in my office that ive ever seen i mean ever i need you to keep her interested until i can get her info i had nothing to do tonight but then she showed up its like a sign you gotta help me man as usual jack was amused by chet his former office mate and longtime friend jack had heard innumerable episodes of mcgoverns social antics laurie on the other hand had wearied of chets incessant womanizing she couldnt resist baiting him a little chet how old are you she said i know he said pretending to be sheepish no seriously how old are you jack thought he should step in at this point between his wife and his friend how can i help you chet mcgovern stuck his head around the door and looked down the corridor to make sure pia hadnt left listen this columbia med student just came in asking about those two typhoid cases you worked on yesterday actually she came in supposedly interested in an elective but i guess that was a cover story for some reason she wants to check the corpses for evidence of alpha radiation because theyd been using some alpha emitter radioisotopes in the lab where your two patients worked she even brought in her own geiger counter when i told her the bodies had already gone she was disappointed thanks for being so overthetop efficient with the death certificates and signing out the cases jack youre welcome buddy jack and laurie smiled knowingly at each other this was typical mcgovern behavior each week there was a new hot prospect it used to be laurie felt badly for the man because she thought he was lonely but that had changed she was now convinced chet did not want to find a mate it was the chase he wanted and he never tired when i told her the bodies were gone she wanted to ask you whether your findings were typical for typhoid tell her the findings were indeed typical for typhoid but a very serious case of typhoid from a remarkably virulent strain how about coming and telling her yourself shell be more impressed jack looked at laurie who shrugged as if to say its okay by me jack heaved himself to his feet told laurie hed be right back and followed chet back to his office chet made the introductions and jack could understand chets enthusiasm grazdani was fetching he noticed the geiger counter he quizzed pia about her interest in his cases she gave him the same story shed told chet and jack purposely didnt challenge her although he was tempted instead he said my understanding is that youre interested to know if the autopsy findings were typical for typhoid fever yes they were a very virulent form of typhoid fever the gut the target organ of the disease was in bad shape which is why they died so quickly there were multiple perforations into the peritoneal cavity pia sat up straighter in her chair have you seen anything like that before she asked well no not to that extent but you have to remember that typhoid fever and especially such a bad case is rarely seen these days its no longer the scourge it used to be before we had antibiotics laurie suddenly appeared shed decided not to be left out chet introduced her to pia pia shook her hand and then turned her attention back to jack and said the strain they were working with and which caused their infections was particularly virulent because it was grown in space under a nasa program really jack said he made a mental note to ask why no one had mentioned that fact was the involvement just in the small intestine or was it the whole intestine pia asked it was the whole intestine jack said from the duodenum all the way down and including the rectum in that sense it was unique usually its just in the small bowel it was unique enough that i saved some rather large specimens in formalin i thought they could be used in the future for teaching purposes we take our teaching responsibilities very seriously around here right dr mcgovern the dig got chet mcgovern to mumble something and jack laughed pia looked confused but in actuality she was giddy she hadnt even heard jacks sarcastic comment all she had heard was that hed saved sections of the gut the bodies were gone but pieces of the involved intestine were still available i mean i cant show you any slides because the specimens havent been processed yet because the autopsy was only yesterday but if you want to view the gross specimens id be happy to show them to you as for slides if you provide your contact information ill either tell you when theyre ready and you can come back or if youd prefer i could send some slides up to you at columbia medical school oh absolutely i want to see the gross specimens pia said and i want to see the slides too when theyre ready jack looked at mcgovern with a smile dr mcgovern make sure you get miss grazdanis contact information ill be happy to do so mcgovern said beaming well lets go up jack said and all four trooped out of chets office and headed for the stairs pia carried both her umbrella and the shopping bag holding the geiger counter on the fourth floor they all filed into the histology lab the supervisor maureen oconner was still on duty jack could swear that since redheads had become very cool recently maureens red curls had gotten redder so what do we have here on a friday night maureen quipped is this a party or is it work she looked from jack to laurie to chet to pia chet made the introductions and maureen shook hands with pia i want to look at some samples if its okay maureen jack said i know its late ah its never too late for you jack maureen said and laurie rolled her eyes maureen had taken an early liking to jack and babied him with special attention jacks slides were always available a little quicker than everyone elses under jacks instruction maureen took out a number of formalinfilled sample bottles from the sample storage area and put them on an available and reasonably empty bench after donning gloves jack took out the pale intestine samples and put them on the countertop he showed pia the perforations and the marked erosion of the internal mucosal epithelium that lined the organ when she saw that jack was ready to put them back into the sample bottles pia asked a question as casually as she could would you mind if i checked the sample with my geiger counter jack shrugged its okay with me pia pulled the geiger counter out of the shopping bag after opening up the mica port specifically designed for alpha particles pia turned on the machine and positioned the geiger counter as close to the intestinal sample as possible without touching it immediately the counter started giving off the clicks that announced the presence of radiation as pia moved the instrument even closer the clicks intensified until they were a continuous noise then the needle on the counters gauge went off the scale whoa said jack whats that about pia said nothing and moved the counter away from the sample and then back it was unmistakable the sample was emitting radiation a lot of radiation she did it again just to be certain then turned off the geiger counter and slipped it back into the shopping bag the three shocked mes looked at one another and then at the young med student something wasnt adding up at all the sample of intestine had come from a man who had been signed out as having died of salmonella poisoning yet the sample was emitting extremely high levels of alphaparticle radiation this student had said that they had used radioisotopes in the laboratory as part of the experimental regimen but could that have caused this radiation whats going on here laurie asked addressing pia her voice was even unchallenging this is all rather surprising do you have any explanation pias heart was racing and she felt as though she might actually be in shock she was not prepared to face the reality that rothmans and yamamotos deaths might be a copycat of alexander litvinenkos in london pia was terrified of not being able to get to the truth now when it appeared that shed found it all she could feel was a rush of anxiety and paranoia all she wanted to do at that moment was to get the hell out of the ocme go back to the dorm and give herself an opportunity to think about the implications of the discovery and what her next step should be miss we need you to tell us what you think is going on laurie said her voice hardening to a degree this is an unexpected and very significant finding pia said nothing she could feel the eyes of the mes boring into her shed never had any reason to trust anyone in a position of authority these three werent the police or hospital security but they did work for the city who are the bad guys and who are the good guys she didnt know the bigger question was are there ever any good guys she had to get away jack was as flabbergasted as anyone else you mentioned isotopes radioisotopes being used in dr rothmans lab um ill have to find out for sure pia said i can get back to you in the morning do you come in on saturdays she picked up her umbrella and hooked the shopping bag over her shoulder she eyed the door to the hall chet mcgovern was trying hard to think of what pia had told him about alpha emitters earlier you mentioned something about lead and bismuth something like lead and bismuth was that it it was the other way around lead and bismuth actually but yes i did mention those isotopes and now i have to go back and check to make sure they were the ones being used i really need to leave pia checked her watch oh my goodness its almost six oclock i promised to be back by six and its a fortyfiveminute subway ride up to washington heights the mes could sense pias acute anxiety no one was convinced by her display of surprise at the time i think you need to stay here until we get to the bottom of this laurie said you might have been exposed yourself alpha emitters are dangerous if either ingested or breathed in there might be other people who need to be checked out thank you so much for your help pia said nervously looking at laurie and jack but not quite looking them in the eye she was itching to get away i can be in touch about the isotopes tomorrow pia didnt want to be trapped there when the mes called the authorities which she knew they would do shortly she had to finish this on her terms young lady whats going on jack said you show up with a geiger counter in a shopping bag and bruises on your face are you a medical student at all who sent you here no one sent me said pia i can see how this must look but i am a medical student you have to trust meno one else was contaminated im sure of it but i cant stay here i have to get back im sorry pia started backing toward the door and jack stepped toward her you cant hold me here if i want to leave pia said and i want to leave right now laurie touched jack on the shoulder and he paused pia turned and walked away quickly chet followed and looked back at jack puzzlement written on his face he had no idea what to do he didnt even have her cell number pia and chet disappeared maureen was confused too wondering if she should call security shes right jack we cant keep her here she said shes at columbia so she wont be hard to find if she wasnt lying about that too part of what jack and laurie liked about their work as mes was the unexpected this was something very new what do you make of it laurie asked i dunno said jack theres a lot she isnt saying she suspected thered be radiation in the bodies of course she did she brought her own geiger counter but when she found what she was looking for she was completely spooked more like terrified definitely laurie said we need to get someone to track her down i agree jack thought for a second lets check the other guy quickly maureen was glad to have something to do she fetched yamamotos specimens they looked for all intents and purposes the same as rothmans mirror images in fact but whether they were radioactive they had no idea pia had taken her geiger counter with her should we call devries to find out how we can determine what the radioisotope were dealing with is jack asked referring to the ocme head toxicologist suddenly laurie remembered a disaster kit that the ocme had put together after the agency had recovered from the events of which had caught them and most of the city agencies completely unprepared the concern was that if had been a nuclear terrorist event ocme would have been completely unable to cope so as not to be caught unawares the disaster kit had been put together i think theres an instrument in the disaster kit that detects radiation laurie said and it should be able to identify the radioisotopes involved you remember bingham insisted on getting it jack didnt recall but he trusted lauries memory when she left to see if she could find the device jack called john devries the toxicologist and asked him how they could identify the radioactive material i honestly have no idea jack my whole career ive never had to thank goodness the only radioactive cases to come through the ocme in my experience were patients being treated by nuclear medicine so we already knew the identity of the radioisotope i guess youll use atomic absorption somehow but ill have to get back to you its friday night you know jack i know it is john many thanks that was a dead end for now then laurie returned shed found the disaster kit and in it a berkeley nucleonics corp handheld model surveillance and measurement system capable of identifying individual isotopes together jack and laurie read the directions and then used the machine to measure rothmans intestines emissions after about five minutes the result was available although mostly alpha particles were being emitted there was also a low level of gamma radiation it was the gamma radiation that yielded the result it was polonium the death certificates are wrong both of them jack said damn it i missed this completely this was no accident obviously do you know much about polonium i happen to know a little bit about it first of all there are no medical uses for it in fact you know what its mainly used for its mixed with beryllium such that the alpha particles from the polonium cause the beryllium to release neutrons to act as a trigger for nuclear weapons good god laurie exclaimed how do you know that i dont know how i know it but i know it said jack he remembered something else it was used to kill that russian guy in london you remember that oh yes the defected former kgb officer right laurie and jack had taken a professional interest in the case a few years back as did most forensic pathologists we have to report this to homeland security laurie said yes jack said it doesnt mean rothman and yamamoto were making nuclear weapons but it does mean that they didnt die from typhoid fever alone they had typhoid fever from the salmonella but they obviously had radiation sickness on top of it my guess at this point is that the typhoid was a mask for the polonium which in retrospect was probably the lethal agent i should have questioned the fact that the entire gut was involved dont be hard on yourself laurie said i can assure you that no one could have made this diagnosis i suppose youre right jack agreed although he wondered for a moment if he wasnt just making an excuse for himself i have to say its a rather devilishly ingenious way of murdering someone and whoever did it nearly got away with it it fooled me it would have got past everyone if not for that girl what happened to chetmaybe he talked her into staying jack got out his cell phone and called chet chet that girl is she still here jack listened for a second all right you better get back up here jack disconnected he looked at laurie shes gone according to chet no matter what he said she literally ran out of the building and he didnt get her contact information shes got to be found she could be in danger said laurie youve got that right if whoever is involved in this knows what she knows jack didnt finish his sentence laurie instinctively knew what he meant instead jack said ill call the chief this is going to be a bombshell and a media circus and ill call lou and then paula it looks like were spending more of our friday night here jack nodded he looked over at maureen sorry about all this he said a bit of an emergency would you mind getting the rest of the specimens theyre going to have to be put in a shielded container of some kind will do maureen said shed picked up on jack and lauries anxiety jack and laurie then ran out of the histology lab down the stairs and back to lauries office as he punched in the numbers for dr harold bingham the ocme chief jack could already see the problems that lay ahead it was a highprofile case involving prominent medical researchers and the cause of death and the manner of death had been missed at least theyd found it now but that was unlikely to appease bingham it was bingham who would have to report the findings to the various government agencies and deal with them a job that jack was thankful he did not have to do while jack was calling bingham laurie called lou soldano on his cell lou its laurie can you talk she dispensed with any pleasantries hey laurie nice to hear your voice lou said his tone becoming wary whats happening we have a situation here at the office it seems we have a case of polonium poisoning remember that case in london four or five years ago of course i do lou said gravely laurie took lou through what she knewabout the mysterious medical student arriving with her geiger counter about how she was upset not to find the researchers bodies but able to test the tissue jack had saved and about her extreme reaction at the findings if youre right and its a copycat of that russian guy and you mention the words kgb and radiation this is going to be a shit storm pardon my french all the alphabet agencies the media and if the russians are involved its serious trouble you gotta keep a lid on it jacks on the phone to bingham right now ill call the pr people and get them in lockdown mode appreciate it laurie now we gotta find this girl any reason to think shes not going back up to columbia hold on a second lou chet just walked in laurie turned to mcgovern chet the woman she say where she was going no she half jogged down thirtieth street heading west i assumed she was heading back up to columbia why are you asking whats going on laurie laurie ignored chet id guess shes heading back to the subway lou ten fifteen minutes ago now lou are you talking to lou soldano laurie waved him off jack was standing in the corner on the phone with a finger in his other ear and saying a lot of yessirs and nosirs ill put out an apb if you can give me a description you said she seemed scared very she couldnt wait to get out of here laurie said sounds like she knows more than she should so how would you describe her maybe fivesix slim about what oneten black hair just down to the shoulder lovely skin lovely skin aint a description laurie jack had finished talking with bingham and he piped up shes incredibly attractive maybe frenchmoroccanslavic chet mcgovern here was panting like a dog mcgovern took the phone from laurie id say shes more likely italian dark skin like olive color soft features dark brown eyes gorgeous like a supermodel she told me her name is grazdani thats all you think shes in danger laurie snatched back the phone lou its laurie again remember i said shes a fourthyear medical student at columbia good point lou said if were lucky we might be able to get a picture from columbia if she actually goes to columbia now you guys have to zip your lips keep me posted if anything happens i gotta go laurie ill be putting a task force together including the nypd organizedcrime unit this is serious laurie this has organized crime written all over it and it has to somehow involve the russians jesus laurie that polonium stuff is associated with nuclear weapons broadway in front of columbia university medical center new york city march pm pia emerged from the subway at the same entrance shed used on her way to the ocme pausing near the mta area map in the shadow of the columbia medical centers art deco buildings shed raced out of the medical examiners office with her head spinning it was dark the streets were wet and slick and there seemed to be hundreds of people on the sidewalks pia couldnt face going all the way across town in the rain despite her umbrella so she took a different route walking to park avenue south and the twentyeighth street station on the line then traveling to grand central and taking the s train the shuttle across town to times square there she had taken the a express train up to washington heights throughout the entire unpleasant train ride pia had acted like a zombie seemingly impervious to her environment a few people mostly men tried to talk to her but she didnt respond in the slightest she was in a daze going over and over the events since rothman and yamamoto had fallen ill it was as if she were experiencing a living nightmare having her suspicions corroborated at the ocme afforded her no satisfaction in the slightest all it had done was cement her fears and sense of dread she didnt know specifically if the lethal agent that had been given to rothman and yamamoto was polonium but her intuition told her it was what to do now was the question for which she had no answer maybe she should just run and hide someplace until all the pieces fell wherever they were going to fall the reality was that she had certainly opened the floodgates at the ocme whether she liked it or not or intended it or not the police were now going to be involved along with every other law enforcement agency in her vernacular the shit was about to hit the fan pias intention when she got out of the subway was to hurry back to the dorm she felt her only resource was george even though she was under no illusion that george would know what to do she hoped she could use him as a sounding board the fact was she had no one else shed thought briefly about involving the two other stalwarts in her lifesheila brown and the mother superiorto get their advice but the story was much too long and complex and more important pia was reluctant to put either of them at risk in the current situation knowledge was dangerous although pia was desperate to get to the dorm she was also terrified the moment shed emerged from the relative safety of the subway she felt inordinately vulnerable the men who had attacked her said they would be watching her and she believed them it meant that they were there lurking somewhere in the darkness surrounding the medical center although where she was at that moment near the corner of broadway and th street was lit and crowded with commuters looking west down th street was neither holding her umbrella in the crook of her neck pia got out her cell phone which shed turned off before going into the ocme she switched it on immediately she saw she had more than ten missed calls and three voice mails she called george but he didnt answer instead she left a voice message of her own george its me its about six fortyfive im at the hospital entrance to the subway at th street can you come get me so we can walk back to the dorm together okay ill be waiting here haven avenue columbia university medical center new york city march pm george had not meant to fall asleep but he had it was a legacy from the soporific lecture there was also the fact that he hadnt been sleeping as well as usual with everything that was going on not only was he asleep he was in the deepest stages such that he didnt hear his cell phone emit its cricket chirping the phone was on his desk not ten feet away he didnt hear it again when it chirped fifteen minutes later but that call brought him up from where hed been such that when the phone chirped a third time he got up and answered hello george its grandma i tried you before but i missed you how are you george was suddenly wide awake he didnt know how long hed been asleep and he fumbled for his watch checking the time it was almost seven and he panicked where the hell was pia grandma im good but ill have to call you back okay oh okay george make sure you do now we havent talked in a while is everything good everythings good ill call soon gotta go george saw hed missed two calls and listened to the message pia left the first time he checked his watch shit shed been waiting fourteen minutes as he pulled on a pair of shoes he tried calling her but got her voice mail he then raced out into the hall heading for the elevators prek and genti sat in the front of the van anxiously scanning passersby through the windshield neri was perched uncomfortably on the milk crate just a little behind and between them what had been easy earlier checking out the students as they passed was now much more difficult there was a streetlamp at the corner of fort washington and haven but it was far enough away not to be of much help it was still raining and much darker they had been there long enough to be stiff and sore and in foul moods where the fuck is she prek questioned morosely he didnt expect an answer and didnt get one this is turning into a bitch neri as the most inexperienced was suffering the most hed been so keyed up with excitement and now that he had had to wait he felt let down depressed although his role was going to be the easiest in that he was going to do the hit hed never actually killed anyone before he had his right hand in his jacket pocket holding his militaryissue beretta m semiautomatic pistol with the thumb safety on hed fired the gun hundreds of times in practice and considered himself a good shot but shooting a man in the head at pointblank range was a very different proposition from hitting static targets at twentyfive fifty or one hundred feet yet he knew he had to do it to rise within the crew like prek and genti he had his wool balaclava in his lap ready to pull it over his head and swing into action an nypd cruiser drove by and all three reflexively crouched down prek watched it disappear in his side mirror then another nypd cruiser went past and prek tensed up further he watched that one disappear as well you see that he said of course genti said its friday night i wouldnt give it much thought i dont like to see cops in the area when were doing a job where the hell is this bitch its getting harder and harder to see these kids faces until theyre right on top of us genti said a group of three students in lab coats walked past the van followed by a couple of people walking alone one of them caught gentis attention and he leaned forward and picked up his balaclava a minute later he slumped back in his seat it was yet another false alarm pia had been walking back and forth along the side of the subway stairs waiting for a call from george trying to figure out where he could be they had definitely planned on getting together when she got back from the ocme more than once she had resolved to quit waiting for george and walk back to the dorm by herself at least until she looked down th street and saw that it was darker and more deserted than it had been fifteen minutes earlier pia had been about to call george for the third time when shed been frightened by a hand on her shoulder spinning around she had had to restrain herself from lashing out at her attacker but it wasnt an attacker it was will mckinley whod come up from the subway and caught sight of her pacing back and forth after initial small talk and mutual sympathies about rothmans and yamamotos passing pia had latched onto him for company back to the dorm as an enticement as if she needed it she had offered to share her umbrella after reminding each other about the deaths theyd each regressed into their own worlds they walked in silence until beyond the th street hospital entrance pia wondered what will might say if she told him what she now knew she thought he probably wouldnt believe her i was surprised to see you will said did you come out of the subway like i did i did pia admitted she tried to think of what to tell him if he asked where shed been so she changed the subject have you seen george at all today wilson no but i havent been around since lunch lesley and i still havent found a home for our months research elective i took the opportunity to do a little shopping he held up a shopping bag pia spotted a police cruiser heading in their direction along th street she tilted down the edge of her umbrella to keep her face from being seen which will noticed immediately as it bumped into his forehead she had reacted reflexively she wouldnt have been surprised if the police were looking for her although being picked up by the police was surely not something she wanted to happen at least not yet she was the first to admit it would be far better than being confronted by her attackers again what are you a fugitive from justice will quipped unknowingly interpreting pias gesture correctly hardly pia said with a fake laugh another police car was coming so she kept the edge of the umbrella angled down they reached fort washington avenue and waited for the traffic light to change there were only another couple of hundred yards to the dorm pia relaxed a degree they had not seen any men in columbia medical center security uniforms she was looking forward to getting to the relative safety of georges room genti was the first to spot pia and will coming around the corner heading right for them backlit by the corner streetlight there in front fifty yards both of them prek voiced with delight fantastic dday wait for my word you okay neri sure neri said with more bravado than he felt he slipped off the safety on his pistol and pulled on his balaclava as prek and genti did the same neri looked out the vans rear window to see if anybody was coming in the opposite direction wait he said whos this coming from the dorm is that him who said prek he swung around to look at george then he flipped open his cell phone and studied the picture buda had sent him the only illumination in the van was from the dim streetlights and it was a small photo he swung back around to look at the man walking with pia they could have been twins in the misty halflight it has to be the guy with pia what is this the swedish olympic team everybody is blond prek waited a couple of beats as the couple got closer its him hell he has his arm around her how close is the guy coming from the back neri checked again about two hundred yards prek picked up a rag from the dash and soaked it with a hefty slug of the ultane anesthetic which they were going to use to take down pia he shot a look at genti and genti nodded back okay go just as pia and will came alongside the van the three masked men leaped out prek and genti from either side of the front neri from the back neri stepped around from the back of the van as will mckinley stood stockstill in front of him his mouth open wide neri pointed the gun at wills head and a fraction of a second later will reacted by turning toward pia whod let out a scream neri fired sending a ninemillimeter bullet into the side of wills head simultaneously genti grabbed pia in a crushing bear hug while prek slapped the ultanesoaked rag over her face almost immediately the fight went out of pia and she lost consciousness neri ran around to the front of the van and got into the drivers seat while genti dragged pia to the back of the van and pulled her inside as prek ran to help genti he caught sight of neris spent casing he picked it up from the sidewalk just before jumping into the van behind genti and slamming the doors shut behind him neri already had the engine started and the moment he heard preks go he accelerated from the curb made a rapid uturn and headed north on haven avenue the hitandsnatch had taken about seven seconds there were three witnesses who saw everything and eight more who heard the gunshot and saw the van drive away one of the witnesses had his own reasons for not wanting to talk to the police that evening so he kept right on walking as if nothing had happened the second was a male med student who had been walking back to the dorm twenty yards behind pia and will he had watched in horror as the raid unfolded at first he thought he might be watching a movie being filmed but it was dark and there were no cameras and the blood coming from the shooting victims head was very real he called and tried desperately to remember what if anything hed learned in the past two years about gunshot victims the third witness was george hed seen will and pia before the event and had stopped waiting for them to come to him he was relieved to see pia but his relief was shortlived in the next second he saw the men leap from the van shoot will and snatch pia it happened so quickly he didnt have a chance to move he blinked as if blinking would reset the scene back to when pia and will were walking toward him but it didnt it was only then that he ran forward to where the other student was kneeling over will mckinleys body inside the van prek used a prepared syringe to give the barely conscious pia an injection of valium enough to knock her out completely dont drive too fast he yelled ahead to neri keep it steady prek and genti then struggled to roll pia up in a threadbare carpet it wasnt easy in the rocking and swaying van neris hands were shaking and it was all he could do to stop himself from throwing up the mark had looked right at him neri blinked rapidly and concentrated so he wouldnt drive right off the road and neri prek said what good job on a quiet side street just north of the george washington bridge neri pulled over behind the waiting dark blue van and the men quickly transferred their cargo with that done prek returned to the drivers seat with genti riding shotgun neri was told to keep a watch on pia abandoning the white van prek drove ahead to where he could get on the henry hudson parkway to loop around and get onto the george washington bridge heading over to new jersey as they expected the bridge was chockablock with rushhour traffic but the crew didnt mind in the slightest the hitandsnatch had been flawless and they were giddy with their success it was as prek said a tribute to the albanian mob tradition i even got this prek said proudly as he pulled neris bullet casing from his pocket and held it up are we good or what he then handed his cell to genti and told him to text buda that the operation went smooth as silk belmont section of the bronx new york city march pm aleksander buda had been happy to get the text from prek hed been mildly concerned about the operation even though it was a relatively simple job but he knew from sore experience that shit could happen be that as it may the pesky girl was unconscious in the back of the van and they were on their way to the agreedupon location budas summer home and the boyfriend was dead the white van they had used had been abandoned now the only suspense that remained was the fate of the girl buda was confident pia grazdani wasnt connected with any of the prominent albanian mafia crews in the immediate area he would have heard the name which he knew was undoubtedly albanian the problem was that if she was related to anyone in a crew anywhere up and down the east coast and as far west as detroit custom dictated that she be accorded a degree of protection even so buda had debated with himself whether or not he would have been justified in simply disposing of the girl at the same time as her friend it would have been neat and efficient shed certainly become a serious pain in the ass especially having somehow on her own figured out the polonium issue but albanian mob bloodbaths had been fought over even less of a provocation buda had decided he had to be sure a cautious man buda had made it a point to investigate pia grazdani in a discreet manner he was known to the fbi of course and he knew how the fbi loved patterns and didnt believe in coincidences if the head of one albanian crew like himself suddenly called all the other local heads in quick succession buda knew there was a good chance the feds would find out about it and come snooping around so buda had sent live emissaries to crews in queens and staten island and asked one associate to call a crew in pennsylvania just in case manhattan and brooklyn had also been dealt with and since he controlled the bronx that was covered hed received negative reports all the way around even from detroit there was no connected grazdani the future was not looking promising for the girl but there was one unit left unchecked berti ristanis crew based in weehawken new jersey ristani was a particularly nasty customer willing to do just about anything to make a name for himself buda realized he hadnt seen the guy in a year he thought it wouldnt be a bad idea to make the visit himself for political reasons in addition to providing an alibi for tonight just in case buda grabbed his car keys and set out for weehawken he knew he didnt need to call ahead ristani could always be found in the same place columbia university medical center new york city march pm detective captain lou soldano was frustrated he was standing inside the tapedoff area of the street that marked the mckinley crime scene a full crimescene unit had combed the area for clues but none were to be found they hadnt even found the shell casing from the gun that was used to shoot the student all they had was a shopping bag with a device one of the techs identified as a geiger counter that the woman had been carrying when she was abducted officers were taking statements from witnesses hoping to get information on the perpetrators and on the van they had used the reports hed heard were wildly contradictory from the mens heights to their clothing one witness swore that only two men had been involved while all the others claimed three the one thing they agreed on was that all the men had been wearing ski masks the van was described consistently as dirty white but they had nothing on the make or license plate george wilson had given the most detailed account and even told lou something important and most likely related he said that pia had been assaulted in her dorm room the previous night and threatened with violence which now had come to pass when asked why she didnt report the incident george said she was afraid of the police because of her childhood experiences he said that he had encouraged her to go to the police on multiple occasions when asked why he didnt report it himself george said because he respected her wishes and privacy and she had asked him not to lous frustration was not only over the paucity of evidence at the scene he was also frustrated that the local precinct of the nypd hadnt blanketed the area with personnel after lou had specifically sent out a message to do so he had given them the description of pia from jack and laurie with the added information that she was carrying an umbrella and a canvas shopping bag he had hoped that the police or the columbia hospital security would have been able to pick her up he had wanted to detain pia not just to learn exactly what she knew but also for her protection and now the bad guys had beat him to the punch if the local boys had done what he had asked the snatchandkilling might have been avoided the only part of the operation that seemed to be going right was the radiation angle lou knew that the mes office had notified the relevant authorities about the possibility of alpha radiation at four sites in new york city columbia university medical center the ocme itself and the two funeral homes where the bodies of dr rothman and dr yamamoto were taken but the me wasnt able to mobilize law enforcement soldano had had to do that and his task force was still more on paper than in the field one of the other things that had frustrated lou was how long it had taken to get a photo of the grazdani woman lou himself had called columbia hospital security to confirm that pia was indeed a medical student lou had also asked for pias details as well as a recent photo which the hospital security had trouble getting because it was locked up in the office of the dean of students and the dean was unavailable so it wasnt until after the abduction that the photo was sent out to law enforcement that was akin to locking the barn door after the horses were stolen god damn it lou said out loud for the umpteenth time nothing about the case seemed to be going well the sole positive development was that a white van had been located that was believed to be the vehicle involved in the abduction at that moment another team of forensic experts was going over it lou had no idea if it would lead to any clues but he was hopeful meanwhile an apb had been put out in new york connecticut and new jersey lou was hoping theyd get lucky but he doubted that would be the case lous intuition was telling him that organized crime was involved bigtime he knew for sure that this wasnt a kidnapping for moneymeaning he feared for pias life all of a sudden several news vans showed up and parked just beyond the crimescene tape as their antennae rose their doors burst open and a bevy of cameramen and journalists alighted lou groaned he knew this was going to be a media circus and he wondered how long it was going to take before the mayor got involved first will mckinley was unluckytwice in factand then he got lucky twice will was unlucky to have been involved in the rothman case to begin withto be found on the street with pia and mistaken for george resulting in his being dealt with as an annoying tagalong who knew too much will was also unlucky that neri krasnigis gun had fired at all when neri had cleaned and loaded his gun earlier that day he hadnt been as careful as he thought a few sizable pieces of grit had been stuck to the first bullet he loaded and lodged inside the chamber under different circumstances or if the pieces of grit had been just slightly bigger perhaps the gun would have blown up in neris face rather than misfiring slightly and dispatching the bullet at perhaps fifty percent of usual velocity that was lucky will was lucky again if someone shot in the head can be said to be lucky will had turned his head so that he was hit in the temple not the forehead meaning the bullet made a complete transit through his frontal lobe a kind of injury that had seen miraculous recoveries in the past it might also be considered fortuitous that hed been shot a hundred yards from a major trauma center where expert help was immediately available a superb team of doctors had treated will within minutes of his being shot and continued to monitor him closely he was now in a medically induced coma hooked up to an array of monitors and lifegiving machinery everyone was hoping wills luck would not run out green pond new jersey march pm prek drove carefully into green pond a private summer lake community in morris county in northern new jersey what could have been an hours drive had taken nearly two partly because of traffic partly because prek kept the van well under the speed limit even on the open stretches of road some of the items in the van would have taken a lot of explaining if the vehicle was involved in a traffic stop the green pond that lent its name to the town was actually a lake this night its surface was dark as the moon had yet to rise prek navigated the twisting hilly eastern shore road where the few homes sitting at the end of long driveways were mostly hidden by dense leafless hardwood forest there were just a handful of homes on the cliffs on the western side which could be reached only by boat the village itself lay to the north after a mile or so the road wound closer to the lake and to the dwellings along the shore some of the homes belonged to yearround residents and their windows glowed with warm incandescent light and the occasional flash and flicker of the ubiquitous bigscreen tvs at the southern end of the lake were a number of summer cottages and they were dark with their docks stacked in neat piles and their boats under tarps prek pulled into the driveway of aleksanders waterfront cottage which was situated on a peninsula at the very southern end of the lake facing out onto a cove a couple of hundred yards in diameter aleksander had been drawn to the house by its private location on a spit of land he had been delighted to find out that for seven or eight months of the year the houses and cottages on either side of his on the eastern cove were dark and deserted with their heating systems off and pipes drained there were only two houses on the western side of the peninsula and they were also empty except during the summer months buda loved the place because of its serenity particularly in the winter when the lake froze up solid prek parked in back of the house facing the road found his key and opened up turning on the lights and the oilfired heat honey im home prek called out laughing the closer they had got to this sanctuary the brighter the mood in the van had become prek was positively gleeful that everything had gone so well the boss was sure to be very pleased the three men unloaded the rolledup carpet that contained pia and brought it quickly inside the front door opened directly into the living area where there were two leather couches one black one brown facing each other in the center of the room in front of a fieldstone fireplace prek moved a low coffee table scattered with automobile magazines to the side so that genti and neri could set down the carpet roll containing pia they then unrolled her until she lay sprawled facedown on the rooms massive fake oriental prek called buda he wanted to tell his boss that theyd arrived and all was well he also hoped to get the okay to finish up with pia it was a perfect night quiet and dark to dump a body in the large swamp that extended for almost a mile from the southern end of the lake into a protected virgin forest surrounding a government arsenal called picatinny it was the kind of wilderness whose remoteness would come as a surprise to most residents of new york city it had certainly proved useful to the buda crew on more than one occasion to preks irritation buda didnt pick up prek didnt leave a message buda would see the missed call and know prek was trying to reach him preks annoyance was exacerbated when it dawned on him that despite all their planning theyd forgotten to bring any food there was a store up the road about five miles north but prek didnt think it was a good idea for any of them to show their faces in a public spot not when they were going to be disposing of a body prek went into the kitchen such as it was and looked in the fridge there was one carton of milk with a pastdue date the cupboards were even more depressing there was an open box of cold cereal but one corner was chewed off and mouse droppings could be seen discouraged prek reentered the living room there was a sudden silence prek could tell genti and neri had been talking about something and had stopped abruptly what is it prek asked the two men were looking at pia there had been a disagreement how long before she wakes up neri said shes got ten milligrams of valium in her so shes going to be sleeping it off awhile prek said shell start to wake up but shell be very groggy we can always give her another shot if need be buda didnt answer his phone shes beautiful said neri our young friend here was just telling me what hed like to do to her said genti i suppose we could all take turns maybe even be interesting to watch what do you think prek we should have done it when we were in her room last night i like my girlfriends to participate prek said and anyway were not doing anything till i hear from buda that shes safe to get rid of remember shes got an albanian name we got to be sure we wouldnt be stepping on someones honor if you know what im saying oh come on prek genti said what are the odds of that theres two hundred fifty thousand albanians in the area and this is one girl ive never seen anyone that goodlooking related to any of us she sure doesnt look like your sister genti and neri laughed prek didnt he had a premonition there was going to be trouble after everything had been going so smoothly neri and genti were sitting on separate couches neri looked like a dog in heat practically panting while adjusting himself he was looking alternately at the supine pia and at genti who he believed was in his corner as far as having sex with the woman was concerned genti hajdini had come up through the crews ranks at the same time as prek but buda entrusted prek with more responsibility and bigger jobs as a consequence prek made more money than genti and when buda wasnt around prek called the shots he knew this was something genti resented but it rarely was an open problem between them prek knew that genti was still miffed about not being allowed to have his way with pia the previous night the boy did good tonight genti said pointing at neri and making a shooting sound genti and neri laughed again then stopped and genti looked at prek maybe we should reward him maybe we should reward all of us there was a heavy silence in the air who made you the boss anyway neri said quietly prek looked from neri to genti and back again neri was still wearing the black jacket hed had on when he shot the boy in the street and prek assumed he still had the gun in an inside pocket genti might be armed too for all he knew his own gun was in the glove compartment of the van did he really think neri and genti would gang up on him and take him out in this crew as prek and genti both knew very well stranger things had happened turning his attention back to neri prek held his frankly impertinent gaze buda said im the boss when hes not around pia let out a groan listen you assholes buda told me we wait until hes sure there is no family connected with this woman you go and mess with this woman and buda finds out shes someones daughter or niece and you two havent been able to keep it in your pants the uncle or father whoever he is is not going to be happy hes going to be unhappy with buda and that means buda is going to be very unhappy with you shes unconscious neri said out of it she wont even know at least not for sure its such a waste like its a crime shell know you asshole you not interested in girls anymore prek now it was time to stare down genti prek knew that gentis comment was meant to rile him but he decided to ignore it shes a pretty girl sure but there are a lot of pretty girls i dont see any others in the room neri said he was looking at genti hoping for support you dont want to be the reason for a blood feud trust me unfortunately hes right genti said he got up from the couch and stepped over to prek he draped an arm around preks shoulder and jostled him were just screwing with you if we get the allclear neri gets his okay i might take a turn why not genti stepped over to pias body and with his forefinger lifted her skirt not bad not bad at all whaddaya say i say we dont touch her until we get the green light to whack her when that happens you two can do what you like for the time being help me put her on the bed to get her out of sight you two are like teenagers prek went over to pia and grabbed both ankles come on give me a hand with genti and neri taking an arm each they carried pia into the bedroom there they tossed her onto the bed now leave her be prek said motioning his two colleagues to precede him back into the living room as prek followed them he wondered what the hell was keeping buda weehawken new jersey march pm so berti what about this grazdani girl buda asked anybody in your organization might be related to her ive been told shes in her midtolate twenties and gorgeous a real looker berti ristani was sitting behind a desk in his office in a small industrial building in weehawken bertis office looked for all the world like the workplace of a reputable building contractor supply catalogs were piled on the desk the room was ringed with file cabinets and a storage chest for architectural plans stood in the back of the room ristani was a contractor buda knew but not all his contracts involved construction berti leaned back in his office chair his huge body causing the frame to complain bitterly bertis florid face tracked with broken blood vessels creased a little as he pondered budas question ah yes the business you came for but i never see you aleksander do we need to talk business how about a drink its a loose end berti its something i need to take care of soon and im trying to do the right thing i cant leave the situation as it is for too long berti ristani had no business agenda he wanted to bring up with buda and he was mildly offended that buda kept bringing up this grazdani issue hed been enjoying talking to buda about old times when they both first arrived from albania back in those days it was no easy thing getting to america both had been lucky on top of a common past aleksander buda was one of the crew leaders berti respected and hed been pleasantly surprised when buda showed up unannounced okay lets find out i know no one by that name specifically but i do have two of my best guys with a similar name but its not albanian its italian anyway i might complain but i appreciate your concern like this theres been far too many blood feuds thanks for coming to talk to me its nothing berti it would be foolish to act any other way ristani shifted his weight forward and the chair complained again he placed his fleshy arms on the table and punched a button on an intercom drilon can you come in the office for a second ristani looked at buda drilon one of my most loyal guys he and his brother whos out on a job anything special not really he runs a bunch of books in south jersey down to philly friday nights he likes to collect hes smarter than a whip in contrast to drilon who as the saying goes is not the sharpest knife in the drawer oh drilon come in here drilon was used to being called into his bosss office from his perch near the building entrance numerous times each evening he was on duty usually ristani wanted something to eat and this was what drilon expected on this occasion he walked into the office and saw the back of a figure seated in front of ristanis desk drilon mr buda has a question buda had drilon heard correctly the man twisted in his seat and drilon saw the scar on his forehead it was aleksander buda a serious dude what did he want simple question buda said without emotion do you know anyone named pia grazdani say that again drilon said he thought he was hallucinating pia grazdani hed heard correctly the name triggered a movie that played in fastforward in drilons head twenty or so years ago at least drilon had been drinking drinking a lot he goes home where he lives with his brother burim and his brothers wife pia and theres pia looking as hot as you like almost without a stitch on and burims out of the apartment running some errands like he was always doing trying to rise up in the rudaj organization one of the most notorious early albanian mafias but the bitch rebuffs his advances even though she was asking for it and digs her nails into his chest like deep and drilon sees red goes berserk what happens next he certainly didnt plan he grabs his gun in a rage and shoots her in the forehead blam storys over but her kids therelittle pia he considers shooting her too except he can suddenly hear people next door so instead he hits her in the head with his gun trashes the apartment and takes the stash that the brothers had hidden in the stove he goes back to the bar where he was drinking drinks more stays until it closes sleeps an hour on a park bench and goes home to raise the alarm that his sisterinlaw was murdered by intruders the fallout turned out to be a breeze burim accepted the intruder story as he was happy enough to be done with his wife and had been thinking seriously of dumping her and the rudaj organization and crew took care of everything there was no investigation no nothing as far as anyone was concerned pia had just disappeared leaving her daughter behind did buda mean either of those pias so buda said hed noticed drilons pause and blank expression do you know a pia grazdani drilon felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up his face flushed he could feel it three questions immediately crossed his mind one was he talking about afrodita his little niece or pia his sisterinlaw drilon hadnt given either of them a thought in more than twenty years but one was dead and the other who knows two had buda asked burim the same question and three what the fuck was the correct answer er i dont think so drilon said why do you ask drilon had spoken to buda but it was berti ristani who spoke up hes asking because he wants to know im asking you too drilon i havent called your brother because hes busy at the moment i assume youd know if either you or your brother is related to this girl the surname is pretty similar let me think we got a big family drilon said so burim didnt knowthat was to his advantage and perhaps it wasnt her at all but drilon feared it was the girlwhose mother he murdered a secret hed managed to keep all this time but if aleksander buda was asking about her she probably was halfway in the ground already drilon could see no reason to rock the boat there surely couldnt be anything connecting him to the girl i dont think ive ever heard the name you certain about that drilon you took long enough thinking about it you know me boss im not the brightest guy like i said we got a real big family but mostly back in the old country so ive heard ristani said conversationally thats right boss whats your family name buda said the expression on his face had changed not at all the whole time graziani drilon said it had been burims idea to drop grazdani after the rudaj crew had been broken up and many of its members sent to jail graziani was the name burim came up with when he asked ristani for work years back it was the surname of one of his favorite italian soccer players and he always liked the fact that it was close to his name too off by only a single letter its close but different italian instead of albanian berti said close but no cigar thank you drilon drilon left the room he was sweating and the color had faded from his face he wanted to hide as far away from buda as possible until the man left anyone else you need to ask buda said no i know all the other guys families and have never heard of a grazdani the men hugged briefly buda having difficulty getting his arms around berti lets not be strangers berti said waving buda got in his car but before he drove away he called fatos toptani his most trusted man back in the bronx in the buda organization fatos was number two its me i need to get hold of someone right now name is burim graziani one of ristanis crew hes working down in south jersey no no nothing heavy i just need to ask him a question yeah something aint right here from his office ristani waited a couple of minutes till he thought buda had left the premises then made a phone call of his own green pond new jersey march pm prek was pleased to leave the tense atmosphere of the house even to undertake the menial task of cleaning out the van something neri should be doing prek was going crazy just sitting around waiting for buda to call to give either a thumbsup or a thumbsdown the other two numskulls could not stop talking about sex and who was going to be first even though the woman was no longer in their sight in a closet in the house he found a mop and bucket and an inventory of cleaning supplies including a batteryoperated hand vacuum mounted on the wall prek filled the bucket with water and poured in a generous quantity of pinesol loaded up the gear and walked out to the van in the morning they would take it to a car wash and take care of the outside of the vehicle for now prek wanted to make sure the interior was free of any trace of the girl he vacuumed the cab and washed down all the surfaces with windex when he was finished he moved to the back to continue his work when his cell phone rang at last he thought neri krasnigi got up from the couch in the living room went to the window and watched prek get in the back of the van with his wet mop theres prek doing womens work he thought to himself it seemed appropriate he hadnt been able to get pia out of his mind and he also felt slighted by preks attitude toward him through the whole job prek had ordered him around throwing stuff at him in the van giving him the toughest part of the mission but showing him no respect at all even when prek told him he did a good job it was in the tone of voice youd use with a puppy who was taking a piss outside neri had forgotten the initial terror hed felt after he shot the student now he was feeling bold accomplished entitledfeelings that had heightened when he chugged down the last of the red bull perhaps he had a chance to show up prek and have some fun in the process even if it would have to be a private triumph neri went to check on genti whod fallen asleep on one of the sofas with prek out of the house and busy and genti asleep neri thought he could risk a quickie after all what could prek do neri slipped a hand into his jacket to briefly fondle his gun it gave him courage he was his own boss being careful not to make a sound that might wake genti neri slipped into the master bedroom and went over to the bed took a good look at pia she was again supine clearly breathing but she looked as dead to the world as she had when theyd first brought her into the house tiptoeing he went back to see what prek was doing and when he walked to the kitchen window he could see the vans doors were open with someone inside with prek attending to his housekeeping duties neri thought he was safe for at least ten or fifteen minutes with mounting excitement neri went to the front door and threw the dead bolt then he quickly tiptoed back into the master bedroom literally shaking with excitement he closed the door so what does that mean for us prek asked buda he wasnt sure he understood what his boss was trying to tell him it means we dont do anything with the girl till i figure out whats going on with this moron drilon youre sure he was lying prek couldnt understand why someone might lie when asked a direct simple question about whether someone was related to them or not im pretty sure everything about his behavior told me he was lying when i asked him a direct question he hesitated and then started stammering that he didnt know if he was related or not it was obvious to me he knows the name and its practically his name if youre gonna change your name change your name and his boss didnt say anything prek asked meaning berti ristani nothing either he didnt notice or he didnt want to say anything with me sitting there i bet its the latter because hes not stupid its this drilon guy whos stupid why would he lie about something like that he must know what the implications are i would assume as much buda said this of course was the question that was nagging at him if drilon graziani was lying it meant whatever he was trying to conceal from his boss was more important to him than this girls life even if she was a relative paradoxically that fact made the girl suddenly more valuable to buda even if he didnt know why this was the reason it was so important for him to talk to burim graziani if that was actually his name buda figured that ristani had also realized drilon was lying which had an entirely separate set of consequences buda himself didnt appreciate being lied to especially by a subordinate and he wouldnt want to be in drilons shoes if buda was right about his supposition it also put buda in a tricky position his visit was probably now the cause of a problem within the ristani crew he hoped berti didnt blame him for that i dont want to talk about it anymore buda said meaning that he wasnt comfortable having even this guarded a conversation over a cell phone line im coming up there to the summer house just make sure our guest is treated as a guest until this is cleared up buda said will do prek said ending the call hed left genti in charge in the house and he trusted him for the most part but he thought hed better check immediately after talking with prek buda got another call on his headset aleksander its berti sorry to bother you no bother berti buda said i talked with burim berti said i asked him about pia grazdani wondering if hed ever heard the name and you know what he said he did can you believe that no said buda but he could then burim called back and said one of your guys tried to call him berti said nothing more and left the statement hanging in the air buda thought hed better play it straight i did have one of my guys call burim buda admitted you know as well as i do berti drilon acted strangely to my question my sense was that he was lying i figure thats your business him lying to you but he lied to me too if i could ask the brother maybe i wouldnt have to bother you directly but i have to find out so i can deal with the woman im holding without starting a blood feud i appreciate that aleksander of course none of us want another blood feud albanian brother against albanian brother of course i noticed drilon was lying and i called him back after you left and asked him again i said no fucking around and he said yeah well maybe he did know a pia grazdani he tried to say hed forgotten because he hasnt heard the name or seen the girl for twentysomeodd years buda was relieved that berti was seeing it his way so what do we do berti you hold on i can conference you through to burim i need to make another quick call first buda said okay do what you need to do then call me right back buda was navigating a complicated course but calmly made his call to prek when prek picked up buda spoke and didnt give prek a chance to respond he told prek that he had to talk to a man named burim graziani before he could say yea or nay about pia grazdani he said he was about to talk with him so hed be getting back to prek straightaway with a final answer hold the course with our guest for another halfhour or so buda said i thought id also let you know im only about a halfhour away im in wayne on route ill be back to you shortly as soon as prek hung up from buda the second time after being told to hold the course he jumped out of the van for a moment he stood and listened he had expected to hear muffled conversation from his two sexstarved underlings but he heard nothing which was disturbing a halfhour earlier the men had been unable to stop talking with gathering urgency prek headed for the front door hearing in his mind buda telling him the woman was to be treated as a guest with his intuition setting off alarm bells prek reproached himself he should not have left the two alone no matter how much he had wanted to get out of the house he went to open the front door and found it locked what the he said he ran around the corner of the house directly to the window of the master bedroom neri hadnt even bothered to close the drapes prek banged twice on the window then ran back to the van grabbed his gun from the glove compartment ran back to the window and smashed it with the butt of the gun he was furious reaching in awkwardly he fired off a single round turnoff on route wayne new jersey march pm i understand youre trying to reach me burim graziani said berti are you still on the line buda questioned im getting off you two men talk there was a click when berti hung up yes i need to talk to you buda said to burim we havent met each other right no i dont believe so but i know who you are of course in their line of work everyone knew aleksander buda this was going to be a complicated conversation buda could tell he wanted to make sure it wasnt also too compromising cell phones could be hacked even new cell phones like the one buda was currently using for that reason we need to be careful i understand neither of them was willing to start burim had been shocked to get ristanis call he had been in his car driving back to weehawken from south jersey where hed concluded his business early ristanis question had shaken him so much he nearly rearended the truck in front of him pia grazdani hed repeated out loud and he thought of his wife not his daughter he remembered her fiery personality the fights how pia stayed out all night to party leaving him alone with the baby his sudden fury meant he wasnt listening properly to what berti was asking him shes about twentyfive berti had said apparently quite beautiful burim shit can you hear me the connection had not been good going in and out it was at that point that burim realized berti wasnt talking about his late wife but rather about his daughter afrodita pia grazdani buda cleared his throat berti told me you recognize the name pia grazdani is there any relation i remember her by a different name burim said afrodita which is what i called her her middle name was pia like her mother she was my daughter afrodita the kid had been a pain in the ass almost as much as the mother since shed inherited her mothers personality drilon had been the only one who got along with her a miserable little thing very demanding at a time when burim had been too busy trying to make the grade in the rudaj organization hed had no time for a kid after shed been taken away by city services burim told himself that hed go and get her back when he was legal in the country but when he got his green card he decided he was happier as a man without the burden of responsibility then he had to drop out of sight as burim graziani and he never got around to establishing his new identity beyond getting a drivers license in case there was ever a traffic stop he imagined hed now have to explain all this to berti ristani something that was a bigger issue to him than the fate of his daughter so you think this girl might be your daughter buda asked not wanting to believe this was happening its possible for sure its hardly a common name and the age is about right midtolate twenties try as he might burim couldnt remember afroditas birthdayneither the day nor the year whats the story with the change of the family name burim related that issue since buda like all albanian mafia knew the details of the rudaj debacle he understood when the fbi came bursting in lots of people had to go underground so you lost touch with your daughter a long time ago yes you know how it is in this business having been at the time a gofer in a neighborhood crew that was heavily involved in the drug business didnt make him ideal parent material buda and burim both understood burim didnt think it was necessary to fill in the details that the cops had come and taken the kid away and put her in foster care that he hadnt bothered to stay in contact was all understood burim went quiet again you think shed remember you she was six i believe when she went away and i guess a kid can remember back that far burim couldnt help wondering why a man like buda cared about this woman who might possibly be his daughter so how did this pia grazdani show up how did she get involved with you shes associated with a job i was asked to do buda said vaguely shes a medical student at columbia university doing work with some researcher who had an accident and died burim was shocked once again could his daughter be a medical student and at such a famous university it seemed incredible if pressed he would have thought the girl would end up on a similar path as her mother would have been with a guy like him or maybe even out on the street a medical student he was surprised to feel something like pride and is she pretty like berti said i havent seen her but im told she is quite beautiful and er scrappy you mean she likes a fight you could say that that sounds right burim said ruefully her mother was a tigress so what is this about where are you buda asked with this development we need to talk in person it turned out that burim was only about fifteen miles from where buda was parked near the lincoln tunnel exit on the new jersey turnpike do you know the swiss house inn burim asked and buda did the restaurant was just off route convenient for burim and buda and not far as it happened from green pond either i want my brother to come burim said okay buda said curious the two brothers seemed to be like night and day why hed want his moron brother there buda couldnt imagine but he didnt care it was after all a family affair i will have an associate with me as well buda said thinking of fatos toptani if he could get fatos toptani to get there in time he thought about thirty minutes buda said and rang off he wasnt happy that the call had taken so long but his hand had been forced somewhat what were the odds that bertis guy burim was this pias father from that perspective he was very glad hed thought to look into the issue killing the daughter of a connected man even a longlost daughter even a daughter the father was ambivalent about would have been a serious matter especially for a man associated with the ristani crew more than any other crew buda knew they were addicted to violence for them it was like a sport buda quickly phoned berti back and gave him a synopsis of the conversation as strange as it may seem this pia grazdani may be burims longlost daughter berti was as surprised as anyone were getting together in person buda added good berti replied i appreciate the care you are taking with this i wouldnt want anything to come between our organizations nor would i buda responded and meant it buda then made one more call before heading off to the restaurant rendezvous with burim he called prek it was now more important than ever that pia be treated with kid gloves her fate was going to have to be in burims hands green pond new jersey march pm preks phone rang again again it was buda just as he expected he took the news saying little until buda had finished he then reassured buda that everything was fine at the cottage and before he rang off he asked buda to bring them some takeout if it was convenient buda agreed saying hed bring it from the swiss house what is it genti said after prek had disconnected the buda is on his way with fatos to a restaurant not far from here to meet with two of berti ristanis guys who are brothers it appears likely that the girl is related to themthe daughter of one and niece of the other if it turns out to be true my guess is theyre going to talk for a while and figure out how they will vouch for her silence just like we vouched for her safety then theyre going to drive here and find out that our promise was worth nothing then theyre going to shoot neri in the head and you in the legs if youre lucky prek indicated first neri and then genti neri had crammed his body into the corner of the couch his hands were thrust down between his knees and his body was slumped forward although his head was up and he was looking at prek his eye where prek had smashed him in the face with the pistol was a livid red it would turn into a big black shiner if he lived that long genti was sitting at the other end of the couch he wanted to be sitting up with prek who was perched on the back of the couch opposite with his feet on the seat cushion but he understood the symbolism he was in the doghouse almost as much as neri was you fucking idiot prek said to genti hey i trusted him too genti said i trusted you and you egged him on with all your sex talk well you didnt say im going out to the van now genti you make sure that neri keeps his pants on you said the boss says he doesnt know yet leave the girl alone and you said it to both of us i figured he heard it as good as i did so you went off and took a nap you were right outside prek if you were so worried about her why didnt you stay in here its as much your fault as it is mine my fault okay prek not your fault but i didnt touch her what about this little fucker genti waved his hand in the direction of neri i never did nothing neri said very quietly what did you say prek said he said he never did anything genti said he said you stopped him before he got anywhere he said that already didnt look that way to me me i tend to believe the guy i would if someone near shot my head off like you did then hit me in the face with a gun this guy i tell him the truth listen prek the girl aint gonna remember anything either way thats not the point prek was yelling now hes saying he didnt do anything and im saying that is not what i saw which part prek which part what what did you see what prek had seen through the window was neri with his pants off lying on top of piathere was no other conclusion he was raping her when prek smashed the window and fired the gun it was with the intention of scaring neri but the shot had been too close passing barely three inches above the young mans head and slamming through a cheap wardrobe into the brick wall behind but it had the desired effect the shot awoke genti who let the apoplectic prek in the front door prek immediately went to neri and hit him in the face as he stood there his pants around his ankles neri was thoroughly humiliated and more than a little scared he was telling the truth he didnt rape the girl but it wasnt for lack of trying hed found he had the same issue with a sleeping beauty as he did with any hookerhe couldnt get an erection hed wanted to prove something to himself but hed failed and right now that wasnt the worst of it the girl had squirmed pretty good underneath him he was worried that she wasnt nearly as out of it as she looked pia gradually felt more and more awake her head was pounding but she remembered a few things she remembered being at the subway station near the hospital and she remembered george was coming to get her and will was there something had happened to will she remembered that the street was wet because it was raining shed hurt her knee a little when shed fallen why had she fallen the room she was in was a mess of shapes she was having trouble deciphering she was lying on a bed she could feel that she could hear voices from a room nearby who did the voices belong to she shook her head thats right she was in a car no a van and someone stuck a needle in her thigh ouch she listened the voices belonged to the men who had stuck her with a needle they were the voices of the men who had attacked her in her dorm room they were the men who had done something to will and one of them was just doing something to me i have to get out of here she thought to herself pia could move her arms and legs she was surprised to discover she wasnt tied up she looked around the room and saw a closed door on one side and a broken window on the other there had also been a really loud noise and a man on top of her something in pias brain kicked in she had to get out of that room even if it was just to the other side of that door or out the windoweither would be better than in there the mens voices were loud again and they were coming from the other side of the door the window then pia swung her legs over the side of the bed and tried to stand but she flopped down onto her knees and then her hands avoiding shards of glass she crawled to the window and pulled herself upright the oldstyle window had a handle that pia held on to as she turned the handle the empty sash flew open and she fell halfway out of the frame it took some effort to reach down until her hands were on the earth in front of the window and she walked herself forward using them until she could lift one leg then the other out and over the sill she collapsed on the ground pia assumed shed made so much noise whoever was shouting in the other room would have heard but she could still hear the voices fainter but still there still raised in disagreement so what are you going to tell buda genti said he was now scared what do you think i should tell him tell him nothing happened look him in the eye and tell him nothing happened i dont want to lie to buda why should i lie its you guys who are at fault neri looked over at the door to the bedroom where pia was sleeping she better not remember anything he thought or im dead now sitting on her haunches pia resisted the urge to close her eyes lie down and go back to sleep although every bone in her body was telling her to do it not for the first time in her life an adrenaline rush drove her on she looked over at the van but she realized it was probably directly in the line of sight of where the voices were coming from and she was in no state to drive shed crash into the first tree she came across pia had no idea where she was so she tried to size up the situation she was cold she knew that she had been in a house and she couldnt see any other houses around or any lights she stared into the dark in front of the house was that water yes a river a lake was it the ocean she had no idea she saw the light of a midsize moon mostly obscured by clouds but she couldnt tell if it was rising or setting pia kept low but started to move to her right away from the van she could see better now and on the other side of the body of water she saw a single house showing one light there were other homes but those that she could see both across the water and the immediate neighbors were just dark geometric shapes leading away from the house in a curve was a pea stone driveway and pia walked unsteadily along its edge trying to keep off the stones she felt like she was getting her legs beneath her now reaching a stretch of pavement she didnt know which way to go left or right she noticed she was somewhere out in the country with forest all around pia made an arbitrary decision and turned right on the pavement she tried to up her speed to a jog but she staggered along like a drunk pia guessed shed been given some drug again she remembered the stabbing pain in her thigh the road was flat and straight and pia passed driveways on her right but none on the left the trees kept the road dark there were no lights on in any of the houses she passed pia listened intently for the sound of the van back at the house starting up suddenly the road stopped and split into a starburst of driveways leading off into the darkness shafts of moonlight had broken through the clouds and in a gap in the trees pia could make out water to her left water on her left water on her right she got the uncomfortable feeling she was heading down to the end of a peninsula pia turned and retraced her steps but then to her dismay the quiet of the woods was shattered by the raucous sound of an automobile engine starting it was coming from outside the house shed escaped from the light from the headlights bounced as the van made its way quickly down the driveway if the van turned right she was a sitting duck pia swung around and ran down a driveway to her left trying to make as little noise as possible on the gravel reaching the house pia made a detour on flagstones set into grass around the house quickly coming upon a small sandy beach now she could see she was at the edge of a circular two or threehundredyardlong cove with its relatively narrow neck to her left leading out to a large lake at this point the opposite shore was just a couple of hundred feet away and along the shore was the house with the light on pia weighed her options if she yelled pia knew the men in the van were more likely to hear her than anyone else she could hide but she would have to move eventually and when it got light for all she knew shed be plainly visible to the men who had taken her noticing a pile of rocks breaching the waters surface in the middle of the narrow expanse between where she was standing and the opposite shore pia wondered if the water might be shallow all the way across although she knew the water would undoubtedly be freezing she thought that crossing the cove represented her best chance pia took off her shoes and her shirt and bunched them against her chest and stepped into the water as she had expected the water was numbingly cold and pia breathed in sharply she looked behind her but there was no sign of the van lights there was sand on the bottom of the cove then a slick mud and the occasional rock as the water came up to her waist there were mostly rocks and pia slipped exposing more of her skin to water regaining her balance she continued forward suddenly the headlights flashed across the water in front of her then again twenty feet to her right pia slowed as she reached the rock pile her legs and feet were totally numb and felt more like stilts than legs skirting the rocks she had only fifty feet or so to go without warning the bottom dropped away and pias feet slid down an underwater slope covered with slimy silt in the next instant she was trying to tread water using one hand holding her shoes and clothes over her head with the other she tried to swim holding her breath in the icy water almost immediately she felt her muscles begin to lose some of their function she gasped for breath now she was numb all over except for her face pia gave up holding her clothes over her head she dropped her shoes and tried to swim a few strokes she was able to move forward a little faster even though she felt like she was barely moving eventually her right foot touched a sandy bottom she stood up with the water up to her neck and pushed toward the shore she was shivering so much it was hard to hold her soaked clothes within a few feet the water was back to waistdeep the lighted house was about a hundred feet to her left she tried to call out but the loudest sound she could make was a whisper she staggered her legs werent hers finally she was out of the water on a kind of point with the shoreline falling off on both the lake side and the cove side but the route to the lighted house along the edge of the lake was blocked by large boulders underbrush and numerous trees shed have to reach the house via the road pia found a path of sorts through the uneven ground and she saw there was a long dark driveway from the road down to the house she made her way toward the driveway so she could reach the road there were sharp stones under her still totally numb feet and she was carrying her dripping wet clothes what would these people think she reached the pavement and turned left walking was difficult but the house was getting closer then behind her she heard an approaching vehicle how far away she couldnt tell with mounting panic she looked behind her into the darkness and she could see the glow of approaching headlights she had no time to hide and she knew she wasnt able to run she tried to call out but the feeble noise was drowned out as she was bathed in bright light maybe it was someone else part of her brain was telling her shielding her darkadapted squinting eyes with her free hand pia stared back the vehicle braked and came to a halt within inches of her nearnaked shivering body please please please pias heart sank it was a van a blue van swiss house inn new jersey march pm aleksander buda waited in the parking lot of the swiss house inn for fatos to arrive it was a standing joke among the crew that the thinnest guy they knew was fatos although no one ever said it to his face more than once fatos was slender and wiry as a greyhound with quick hands that made him very proficient with a knife he was rarely seen without his baseball hat worn jauntily backward like a hiphop devotee when buda wanted backup like he wanted that evening he always called fatos as dependable as ever five minutes after buda arrived fatos pulled his black cadillac sedan into an empty space next to budas both cars were off by themselves at the back of the lot neither man got out buda barely acknowledged fatos with a nod they didnt need to talk a lot budas eyes swept around the halffull parking lot a guy he thought might be burim was sitting in a new chevy camaro in a slot facing out no more than twenty yards to his right the driver sitting behind the wheel fastidiously ignored buda then another car drove up an escalade and buda recognized drilon riding high at the wheel drilon flashed his lights at the camaro gangs all here buda said to himself drilon parked and first burim then buda then the other two men got out of their cars met in the middle and exchanged greetings lets get something to eat buda said im starved the restaurant and bar was situated in a rather ordinarylooking twostory woodframe house painted a deep green with white trim except for the lighted sign announcing swiss house inn in front of the building next to the road the structure didnt look much like a restaurant more like another house along the road only in better shape the parking lot was fairly full so it was obviously a popular place on a friday night burim walked in the door first and the lady at the door made a fuss of him asking after his health and saying his table was ready buda guessed hed called ahead and was a frequent patron other diners who had been waiting to be seated took one look at the group and to a man and woman decided not to make an issue with the men who jumped the line they were all in oversized leather jackets the accepted attire of the albanian mafia in the back of the busy restaurant was a single booth situated partway between the kitchen and the main room the only traffic was from staff coming out of the kitchen several of whom made a point of saying hello to burim so they know you in here buda said he was mildly disappointed if hed known burim was a regular he wouldnt have agreed to the location im a big tipper burim said winking at drilon across the table buda studied the two men drilon was sweating and looked distinctly uncomfortable burim was relaxed and exuded calm confidence burim got the looks and the brains buda thought what can i get you guys it was the hostess doing double duty they ordered four beers and the special schnitzel all around so heres the deal gentlemen buda said he dove right in dispensing with small talk im doing a job for someone and halfway through theres a problem the problem is this girl who is sticking her nose in investigating a situation and making things very difficult for me we tried to dissuade her but it didnt work the sensible course is to eliminate the problem so i clear it with my client who is willing to pay a hundred grand for the extra work meaning to take care of the meddling bitch buda paused to take a sip of water and he glanced at fatos fatos knew the contract was for but there was no reason these guys had to know if as might be the case this girl is your daughter then you have to take responsibility for her and you and me well share the money but that means its your responsibility to make absolutely sure she desists from investigating this case from poking around from talking to people from thinking about it from dreaming about it and if she isnt your daughter then we will fulfill the contract and you must promise not to mention anything about what we have done in that case you get a quarter of the money for your inconvenience where is she right now burim asked at that point he was anticipating meeting her not far from here shes perfectly safe and what was she sticking her nose into as you put it id rather not say ah our food already the steaming plates of schnitzel and noodles arrived remembering preks request buda ordered four more to go the key point is buda said poised with a forkful of veal that she stops doing what shes doing i have to tell you shes making things very dangerous for me it would be good if she went on a long vacation im sure we can arrange that burim said he had no reason to believe he could make that happen but he liked the idea that there was to be a payday in this for him right drilon sure drilon was facing his own set of demons but he had little choice but to play along he pushed a noodle around the edge of his plate with his fork were happy to help you mr buda but we are incurring some more expenses here burim said dont worry buda said well take care of dinner no really your money is no good here there will be other expenses for the girl burim had already decided the girl had to be his missing daughter the coincidences were too extraordinary and if the girls personality resembled that of his late wife he was going to need some cash to even hope to control her of course buda said he had been expecting this i think ten thousand is a fair amount for the girl for her inconvenience burim said buda nodded at fatos who leaned back and shuffled some bills under the table and presented burim with a thick wad folded in half either way buda said daughter or no daughter if she is not your daughter you can keep the cash for your expenses you have been very thoughtful burim said and you have been very cooperative buda said buda and burim shook hands across the table and in turn all four men shook hands making the agreement as binding as any legal document in albanian tradition and logic the men finished their meal quickly and with the takeout in hand they left burim having left three twenties on the table as a tip was detailed to follow buda who would lead the way in a motorcade of sorts as burim walked out of the restaurant he patted his pocket with the fresh bulge of cash and smiled thinking it was going to be an interesting and profitable evening green pond new jersey march pm there was nothing the occupants of the summer house could do but wait prek sat next to neri on one couch with genti and pia sitting opposite he had thought about tying her up as he should have done before but he didnt want to make a worse impression than he had to besides the girl wasnt going anywhere prek had found an old tshirt in a closet and gave it to pia to wear along with one of his own new york jets sweatshirts he kept at the house the jersey came halfway down her thighs she also wore a pair of soccer socks pulled up to her knees she had draped a towel over her shoulders but she was still shivering pia sat and glared at neri that was the guy who had touched her she was sure of it she stole glances at the other guys toothe one who seemed to be in charge with the thick scar on his upper lip and the guy with the dominating nose she wasnt entirely certain but believed they were the men who had attacked her the night before she recognized their voices prek cradled a gun in his hand he wondered if he would have to use it that night and if so who would be the target he could make a case for any of them neri for brazenly disobeying an order and genti for failing to stop him the only person prek wasnt mad at was pia he admired her for trying to escape and for getting as far as she had if he had to shoot her it would not be emotional it would just be business at least the fiasco was going to have a conclusion soon thought prek as he heard a group of cars pull into the driveway one after the other a moment later they heard car doors opening and then slamming shut in quick succession go wait in the bedroom prek said to pia as soon as buda fatos burim and drilon walked into the house they could all tell that something was wrong the atmosphere among the three men inside was clearly strained neri was sitting on the couch staring at the floor and didnt stand up genti wouldnt make eye contact and prek acted fit to be tied buda had to find out what had happened and fast gentlemen he said turning to burim and drilon i left the food we picked up in the back of my car would you mind id just like to have a quick word with my guys burim and drilon left the room and closed the door buda lit into prek what the fuck is going on here stand up neri genti look at me when im talking wheres the girl shes in the bedroom prek said she got out the window jumped in the lake and swam off what are you serious yes but we found her right away did anyone see her no im certain theres no one here but us you quite sure about that yes budas three men were standing like guilty schoolboys in front of the principal what happened to you buda asked neri whose eye was closing rapidly neri didnt speak but looked across at prek did she do that no prek said i did what for buda leaned forward his hands on his hips fatos was standing by the door with his arms crossed the message was clear no one out or in prek buda said you better tell me what happened right now or were going to have a major problem he attacked the girl prek said neris face fell hed hoped prek would make up some story on his behalf was that before or after she escaped before and where were you he asked genti silence all right ill deal with this later it all depends on whether or not this girl is the daughter lets hope for you she isnt fatos letem in burim drilon said buda in as friendly a tone as he could manage what happened here is that the girl tried to escape but she didnt succeed my men are very embarrassed as they should be burim looked at neri but no explanation was forthcoming regarding his injury my wife was certainly a tigress he said perhaps this woman is too mr buda i am ready to meet her buda showed burim into the bedroom and left pia was sitting on the bed facing the window shivering afrodita pia burim said is it really you i am burim burim grazdani i think im your father pia look at me please pia sat for a second and then turned glowering at the man her face clouded with unadulterated fury and loathing burims expression went from disbelief to pure amazement oh god he said youre exactly your mothers image burim knew the look she had on her face from the first pia a beautiful woman full of hatred burim had feelings hed never experienced and couldnt come close to articulating im told youre a student at columbia medical school thats amazing you must be very intelligent pia had turned around again and burim continued talking to her back you look like your mother you know that probably you dont the same hair the same eyes its amazing pia said nothing could it possibly be him i feel this is a miracle our meeting pia please say something silence your uncle drilon is here now pia reacted she hacked up some spittle and spat loudly on the floor by the bed burim was disconsolate pia im sorry i never came for you i was young and stupid i meant to come so many times but i knew that if i came forward they would find out i was illegal in this country and send me home and then i would never have a chance of seeing you i was working with these guys the rudaj group you know and the organization fell apart and drilon and i had to go underground then when we started working for ristani we had to change our names and leave our pasts behind i wish we didnt have to do it but we did pia please as soon as pia saw burims face she knew who he was this was the man she had waited years for the man who put her through torments while she fervently hoped that hed come back to save her he never did now he was showing up and for what and he had brought that monster with him what were they going to do kill her at this point pia barely cared listen i know i abandoned you but suddenly now that i see you its important to me that you are my daughter and that youre safe safe do you have any idea what it was like for me in foster care pia snarled burim was startled by the sound of her voice do you but youre going to be a doctor look how it all ended up this is how it ended up you moron guns gangsters murderers thats what i remember from being a kid and my mom was there and then she wasnt what happened to her i dont know youre a liar pia turned and screamed the words buda opened the doorhe must have been standing right outside everything okay leave us please burim said silent tears were tracking down pias face she turned back around and faced the wall pia couldnt make sense of what was happening how was her father involved with the people who murdered rothman yamamoto and will mckinley they had been waiting for him to show up which meant that he might be able to stop them killing her too when she spoke again pias voice was quieter thats all i know about you that youre a liar im here now are you here to finish the job they started i understand why you say these things but you have to believe me i am here to save you you and your white horse what whatever what i am telling you is no lie those guys in the other room they have been paid money to stop you because you were looking into some deaths and they want you to stop looking pia said nothing they know you have an albanian name and they asked around if anyone knows you and i said yes maybe its the case that albanian cannot kill albanian not in our business unless the killer wants to die too if you werent albanian if you werent my daughter you would be dead already do you understand thats very nice of them actually it is yes they murdered my teacher and another doctor by giving them typhoid fever and a massive dose of polonium tonight they murdered my friend by shooting him in the head because he was helping me i should be grateful to them because theyre sparing me i cant do anything about the other people what i can do is save you and how will you do that i guarantee them that you will give up your investigation and that you wont mention their involvement to the authorities take a vacation something we can work it out you you havent seen me since i was six theyll take your word if i give it yes i have shaken their hand and my family honor is at stake or theyll kill me or theyll kill you and youll take my word that ill give up if you give me your word yes pia snorted it seemed that the only person who could save her was her father the least likely person on the planet the person she trusted the least and hated the most the man who was the cause of all her travails in a situation that defied comprehension pia tried to think dispassionately the drug wasnt completely out of her system she could tell she was more fatigued than she could ever remember being and frightened and upset and angry yet she had to think in order to live pia would have to promise to stop investigating but could she do that there was very little left to investigate at the ocme she had proved that polonium was involved in rothmans and yamamotos deaths and she was certain the mes would be looking into what she had found the police would surely be all over columbia searching for wills killers and her kidnappers there was nothing more she could contribute to the investigation other than providing evidence and he hadnt mentioned anything about that her work was finished as if you care about family honor she said i do but if you dont believe it take my word that i care about my honor and thats all i have to do stop investigating but you really have to stopmaybe go away for a while you have to believe me they will kill you otherwise whatever you think of me you have to look at the alternative you have to stay as quiet as you can if you lead the police to buda theres no chance that you would ever testify against him pia realized she had no choice but perhaps there was something her father could do for her and right some of the wrongs she had suffered pia turned to face him okay but you should know not all these men have been exactly honorable with me im glad you agree pia but what do you mean when i got here i was drugged but i remember one of them at least forced himself on me the young one for sure maybe all of them burim reacted the way pia had hoped he looked at her for a beat with his face empurpling then leaped up and threw open the door mr buda i need to talk to you buda could see burim was spoiling for a fight flashing angry looks at neri the girl must have told him what had happened in the house everyone in the room stood and the tension was immediate buda took burim by the arm into the kitchen the packages of takeout sat unopened on the stovetop burim spoke quietly but with suppressed fury she is indeed my daughter and she says she was raped by the youngest one for certain maybe more of them did you know about this listen i was told that one man did lose control of himself briefly but there was no sex but i understand this is shocking to you all of this but there was so little chance she was your daughter that is no excuse perhaps it is better if she was killed rather than be shamed like this i gave my handshake but perhaps i have to take it back buda looked burim in the eye was he serious or was he just shaking him down for more money ten minutes ago the guy didnt even know he had a daughter and now he was concerned about her honor some of these guys really were peasants i will punish the men you can be assured of that burim shook his head and pulled back his jacket exposing his shoulder holster it can only be put right if i get to do the punishing do you want me to call berti no of course not the reason i called you was to avoid this kind of situation a killing will only lead to more killingthat is always the way punishment yes killing no i will apologize to her myself i doubt she is going to accept any apology thats how i knew it was her she has the same temper as her mother listen i will apologize i will pay money to her and to you money i will take from the three men in there but i will not have a blood feud over this it shouldnt have happened i regret the situation ultimately i am to blame but i need you burim to live up to your handshake and for her to give up her investigation burim paused to think buda wouldnt allow a man from another crew to punish his own men a blood feud was in no ones best interests and he didnt want to be the cause of a dispute between aleksander buda and berti ristani okay let me talk to her burim went back to the bedroom pia knew she had to accept burims help however distasteful it was to her now she wanted more than anything to get out of there to go and find george burim closed the door and relayed what buda had said would she be willing to forgo the revenge she was entitled to pia knew justice was being twice deniedshe was being prevented from implicating rothmans killers and also from seeing some street retribution brought down on the person who attacked her if thats the way it has to be i want to talk to those men outside pia said okay burim said but i want to shake on our agreement an albanian shake burim thrust out his hand pia eyed it she didnt care she shook hands and her skin crawled when she touched his they walked into the living room where everyone was still standing although in slightly more relaxed poses i am going to accept the offer she said to buda i will do what you ask and drop the investigation but i have a couple of things to say pia walked over to neri and stood right in front of him neri started to shake looking first at prek then at buda then at burim you are a piece of trash i swear i didnt do anything i cant its impossible pia jabbed neri hard in the sternum with her forefinger youre not so tough when the girl is awake are you huh you know what my father is going to do with you hes going to cut off your tiny little prick and shove it up your ass no no i didnt im sorry pia jabbed neri again he was crying now great shuddering torrents of tears pouring out of his eyes he held his hands together pleading with pia you see how much stronger than you i am youre a pathetic little boy pia poked him once more and neri collapsed backward onto the couch where he sat whimpering and you pia addressed drilon you will never speak to me or ever come near me again drilon looked at burim and raised his hands as if to say i dont understand quickly pia went on now i have a question for you pia looked at buda who raised his eyebrows me some men paid you money to frighten me yes some men paid you money to kill me yes are these the same men who asked you to kill dr rothman and dr yamamoto buda paused yes why did they do it when i realized the deaths werent accidental i couldnt figure out why anyone would want to go to such lengths to kill two medical researchers the work they were doingthey were about to change the world buda looked at burim was it possible to control this woman at all some people had investments that were threatened by the research investments you mean they did this for money i guess buda said why does anyone do anything he thought pia was incredulous she thought back to her hearttoheart talk with rothman and how it had seemed to be the start of something meaningful in her life the father she never had she recalled yamamotos kindnesses small and large and will his life snuffed out too then she remembered standing in the bluelit room looking at the pulsating baths of artificial organs and the enormous excitement she had felt and the even greater joy she experienced at the aweinspiring sight of the artificial pancreas now it was very likely those two rooms were being closed up and put in mothballs the research would continue but not at columbia and not with her pia felt empty and bereft it was likely that rothman and yamamotos killers were in this room pia couldnt touch them she knew that her life depended on their getting away with murder but she wasnt completely powerless in that case theres something i want you to do and then i promise i will stay off the trail and hold my tongue pia told the men her idea buda liked itthis job had far too many loose ends burim agreed that it would satisfy his daughters honor the men shook hands again and then each in turn shook hands with pia buda was happy with the resolution although he was left with more work to do and hed have to decide what to do with his men especially neri who seemed to have fallen to pieces completely prek and genti were eating the lukewarm takeout but neri was still cowering on the couch buda found an old pair of his wifes sneakers which were too large for pia but would work for now he took them into the bedroom where she was resting what will you do now you think im going to tell you she said listen im sorry it happened this way its a bit late for that please leave me alone when pia came back into the room it was filled with cigarette smoke the men were standing around talking and a couple of them were laughing pia went over to buda wheres my cell phone buda looked at prek who shrugged may as well let her have it just dont turn it on till were done here i wont prek took pias cell phone student id and wallet she used for her credit card and cash out of his jacket and gave them back to her ill be outside pia said it stinks in here without another word she went outside slamming the door behind her hard enough to shake the house burim shook his head she is her mother exactly we should go out thereshe might call someone prek said she wont buda said shes albanian she promised shes half albanian burim said and half italian i better go the men laughed standing on the other side of the van pia had turned on the phone and it flooded with messages and emails and texts she saw there was a text from lesley wong god bless you it read praying for wills recovery pia it was burim she shut off the phone and emerged from behind the van were leaving burim said pia had but one thought recovery could will possibly be alive green pond new jersey march am buda gave his men their marching orders he would drive back to the bronx with prek and genti while neri would remain at the house and clean it and the van thoroughly to erase all traces of pias stay buda was quite specific about what products neri would use and how long he should spend on each part of the task buda emphasized what a good job he wanted neri to do and that it would take him the entire weekend to complete that would give buda time to figure out what to do with neri before he left the house he put the vans keys in his pocket fatos had to drive drilon back to the parking lot at the restaurant to pick up his car because pia flatly refused to get into a car with drilon she wasnt about to explain why pia sat in the front seat of burims vehicle and stared straight ahead as the men said their goodbyes in the driveway burim and pia set off heading for weehawken burim turned up the heat for pias benefit whats your problem with drilon im not going to talk about it pia said i hope you will later so tonight well go to my house is he kidding thought pia she was desperate to get away from this man no i want to go back to the hospital i cant let you do that burim said sure you can pia said i promised not to meddle any more and im not going to youll have to trust me its the same tonight as it will be in a week in a month i have to check on something the place will be swarming with cops ill have to talk to them eventually or do you think ill move in with you and live in new jersey and play happy family because thats not happening you cant just walk back into my life dont you understand that we have an arrangement thats all you have to trust me i have to trust you we shook hands remember you cant tell the cops anything obviously you know that anything about buda or his men or about seeing me and drilon dont worry it wont be difficult to forget you burim ignored the barb so we have to come up with a story for what happened to you he said the police will know as much as i do about the polonium but i dont know who did the killing i just know the why the less i know the better too theyll find my system was full of drugs i imagine pia said so ill say i was drugged then i was held in a house outside the city but i escaped so how did you get back to new york okay i woke up in new york and i dont know where ive been where did you get the clothes i dont remember where i got the clothes and thats the truth so its this you were out of it drugged some guys drove you around but you never saw their faces then they stopped in a house somewhere and you were given different clothes then they drove again and let you off in manhattan i cant drive to the hospital myself i cant risk being seen you better get in the back stay out of sight of the cameras on the bridge ill drop you at the top of manhattan on broadway somewhere you can take a cab from there all right pia climbed into the backseat and curled up she was exhausted and still shivering pia we have to stay in touch whats your cell phone number pia figured he could find out if he wanted to so she told him and burim said he would remember it he didnt bother telling pia his number burim continued to talk telling her little anecdotes about times he remembered from when pia was a child burim convinced himself that his memory was correct that these things had happened the way he remembered them he concentrated on the road and he knew pia probably wasnt listening he would try to reach out to her but he wasnt confident shed respond after a while he stopped talking and they rode in silence after forty minutes burim reached broadway at the very tip of manhattan in the middle of a quiet block he slowed down and pia hopped out of the car without saying a word and didnt look back burim stopped the car and watched as pia walked to an intersection and held out her hand to hail a taxi a gypsy cab pulled over and pia leaned toward the window and told the driver something before she got in the car burim thought she looked small and vulnerable in her crazy mismatched outfit but he had a feeling shed be okay columbia university medical center new york city march am pia asked the car to drop her off as close as he could get to her dorm building on haven avenue there was still a police presence with artificial lighting at this location of the abduction and shooting the fare was and she gave the driver the twenty burim had given her and didnt stop for change on the ride down pia had concentrated her thoughts on will ignoring her father who was jabbering away in the front seat she tried not to think about her ordeal at least she was safe now pia had no thought about whether or not she was going to try to establish a connection with her father but she did know shed have nothing at all to do with drilon the few things she remembered about him were all painful pia focused she wasnt worried about talking to the policeafter all it wouldnt be the first time shed build a wall around what happened at the house and not recount any of it in all other aspects she could be truthful and there were some truths she was still determined that everyone know there would be no possibility of a coverup pia walked up to the front desk in the dorm there were two uniformed cops by the elevator but pia hoped that her strange garb and the fact that shed bunched her hair up under a baseball cap would throw off a casual onlooker despite the late hour students were coming in from studying at the health science center or from a night out a few others were on their way out having been called to the hospital for emergencies pia knew the person staffing the front desk and asked him about will mckinley pia is that you the young man said cops are looking for you they said you got kidnapped or something crazy no im fine willtell me about will pia gestured with her index finger over her lips to silence the man from calling attention to her presence oh man i heard he got shot in the head but he survived he was taken over to the neurological institute and he had surgery one of the other fourthyears said hes in intensive care without another word pia turned and walked away from the desk and made her way over to neurosurgical intensive care she saw plenty of cops and security guards but they were on the lookout for a woman with long black hair not someone wearing a new york jets sweatshirt to midthigh soccer socks and a baseball cap she looked like a cheerleader at the doors of intensive care there were more police pia was stopped by the nurses who eyed her less than appropriate clothes and the bruise on her jawline pia explained she was a medical student and flashed her student identification with her finger over her name she hoped that everyone there had been on duty the whole night and hadnt seen or heard the news the head nurse said she wouldnt let pia into the intensive care unit but she paged the resident when the resident arrived he looked quizzically at pia still he was considerate after hearing that she was a medical student interested in the case he assumed she was a girlfriend of the young man mr mckinley is being maintained in an induced coma postsurgery the resident dr hill said he received a gunshot to the head but the bullet made a complete transit through the frontal lobe its an injury that people have recovered from in the past but i would emphasize that anyone suffering this kind of injury may not be exactly the same person he was before being shot and having brain surgery hes a friend of mine pia said i was there when he was shot so its very important that you understand he will be different even if there is a seemingly complete recovery different how it would take too long to go into now look up the case of phineas gage from which involved much more severe trauma to the frontal lobe it was the first recorded case about how penetrating head trauma can affect personality can i see him i dont see why not his family is on the way you have to wear a gown and so on of course pia went off to don her protective garb only then did dr hill remember something about being on the lookout for a young woman in will mckinleys room pia found george standing by wills bed pia my god george said and grasped her in an embrace are you okay what happened to you im fine ill tell you later will how is he doing no one knows i have to go back and talk to some more cops but i wanted to see him i saw the whole thing i saw him get shot and you taken i cant believe hes alive and you too thank god what happened george stared at pia as if she were an apparition but she turned to look at will his breathing was being handled by a machine there were tangles of wires and tubes enveloping him and he was surrounded by banks of devices with illuminated readouts wills face looked calm and peaceful and his color was normal except for all the medical equipment and the beeping and clicking he might have simply been sleeping a nurse hovered nearby pia looked around the room and caught her reflection in the units large window she looked terrible like something the cat dragged in she turned her attention back to george george im so sorry i got you into this please forgive me she said if i had listened to you then this would have turned out differently i know that pia i feel as terrible as you do about this i was sleeping while you were waiting for me at the station i slept through your calls i should have come to you it should be me lying there that doesnt make me feel any better will had no idea what was going on and i didnt say anything i dont know whats going to happen to me so theres a couple of things i want to say while i have the chance i want to say thank you for going out of your way to help me i dont really understand why youd do that for someone without her asking and without her appreciating what youre doing but there are a lot of things i dont understand i guess the main thing i dont understand is myself i think you do know yourself which is why youre able to say you love someone like you did to me and im sorry for not listening then either im jealous that you can do that and i wonder why i cant i think theres something broken in me or something that was never there and its taken until now for me to see that for a lot of reasons i find it very difficult to trust people as if i need to tell you that but i dont know how to love someone either or how to accept their love its a big responsibility being loved and you should think hard before rejecting someones love but youve made me want to learn more about myself to see if i cant fix that broken part i think we studied that course together in firstyear psych the part about people with personality issues who never accept that theyre the ones who are different so if theyre marching if they lead with their right foot while everyone else uses their left they say with unshakable belief that its everyone else whos out of step not them i think im like that pia looked around she hadnt realized the nurse had left nor had she seen or heard the man enter the room he was stocky in a cap and gown just like she and george were wearing over his streetclothes he was standing at the back of the room as she stood with george by wills bed the man waved his hand as if to say dont mind me go on i never understood peoples feelings george i sneered at people who said they were in love because i never knew what that meant i dont know if i can change and i dont know if someone can be taught how to love but i do know i want to try to change pia reached out and touched georges cheek with one fingertip please try to forgive me george closed his eyes pia theres nothing to forgive im just so happy youre safe pia stepped back and studied wills peaceful face then turned toward the visitor she sensed he was there to talk to her miss im detective captain lou soldano youre pia grazdani i assume yes you have to come with me now i understand do you mind if i use the bathroom first of course not lou said after pia told george shed see him later she and lou walked out of the intensive care unit im glad to see you lou said are you okay im fine pia said before disappearing into the womens room near the elevators after locking the door she took out her smartphone quickly she tapped out an email forwarding a sizable message shed already written after making certain it had gone she used the toilet she then looked at herself in the mirror over the sink and said now the shit hits the fan taking a deep breath she composed herself to go out and meet detective lou soldano who represented her old nemesis the city of new york east tenth street new york city march am the man was aware of the buzzing of a phone right next to his ear he went immediately from deep sleep to partial consciousness but it took him a few beats to realize where he was he picked up the phone saw his device didnt recognize the number but accepted the call just to stop the noise mcgovern this better be good whoever you are is this chet mcgovern a female voice said i believe so ask me tomorrow what time is it anyway about twofifteen sorry about that do i know you my name is jemima meads im calling from the new york post the post the mention of

the woman ended the call and chet lay back in bed what was that about click here for more books by this author epilogue greenwich connecticut march am even though it was saturday russell lefevre had set his alarm for he clamped down on the buzzer before it woke his wife lefevre padded into the bathroom and then downstairs to make coffee and to check on events on the internet as the coffee was brewing lefevre scanned the online headlines of the new york times the wall street journal and the washington post russell had always been fastidious about keeping up with the news but in the past few weeks hed become obsessed especially since edmund had become less and less communicative even though russell had asked him numerous times edmund had never told him what he and jerry trotter had talked about at edmunds house a few weeks before even though edmund had looked thoroughly shaken afterward a week or so later jerry trotter disappeared when russell called max higgins max said jerry had gone on a factfinding trip to asia and he had no idea when hed be back edmund had nothing to say about that then russell read about gloria croft being attacked while out running one morning in central park and edmund told russell he had no idea what had happened then either two days earlier all the newspapers carried the story about rothman and yamamoto first about their being sick then they reported that the pair had died in a tragic accident in the lab russell didnt know what to feel or what to think first jerry disappeared then gloria was attacked then rothman and yamamoto died on its own each of the latter two events was a piece of good fortune but together they were surely more than a coincidence did edmund have anything to do with it could these events have been what he and jerry talked about it seemed impossible to comprehend that edmund was involved but russell couldnt bring himself to confront his partner russell made coffee and looked for the new york post when he saw the newly updated headline on the home page he nearly choked columbia meds in kgb copycat slay under jemima meadss byline was an exclusive about rothman and yamamoto hedged with allegedly and reportedly the story said that acting on an anonymous tip the reporter had contacted members of the new york office of the chief medical examiner who were working on the theory that the exotic radioactive agent polonium was involved in the deaths of the two prominent columbia university researchers the find was made by the husbandandwife team of drs jack stapleton and laurie montgomery who having been reached by the reporter at their upper west side town house refused to confirm or deny the story referring the reporter to the ocmes public relations department the discovery was immediately reported to the fbi the cia homeland security and the nypd joint organized crime task force because of its significant implications and similarities to the murder in london of a defected russian fbs agent by the russian fbs the current incarnation of the soviet kgb polonium the article said is a remarkably poisonous compound millions of times more deadly than cyanide if swallowed or respired its also extraordinarily difficult to come by because of its association with triggering nuclear weapons and is thought to be available only in russia pakistan and north korea at this time it wasnt known if the deaths were connected to a shooting reported outside the columbia medical center that evening russell dashed to the phone and fumbled to call edmund he knew he was waking him as the phone rang for the sixth time russell what the hell his voice was thick with sleep edmund go online look at the post it says the researchers were murdered with some nuclear poison oh my god edmund all right russell calm down you better get over here edmund hung up russell wanted to throw up but he composed himself went back upstairs and got dressed he started driving toward edmunds house his mind racing trying to make connections thinking about the coincidences and how they now looked like something so much more like murder as he drove russell failed to see that a beatup old toyota corolla had pulled out and was following him through the twisty greenwich back roads edmund had opened his gates and russell drove directly into the walled courtyard in front of the waterfront mansion he leaped from the car and bounded up the front steps and impatiently leaned on the doorbell whose muffled chords he could just make out coming through the massive door where was edmund he rang the bell again the only other sound he could hear was the gentle cacophony of songbirds at last russell heard a bolt being drawn back on the heavy door then another sound of a car coming quickly up the drive he turned and watched bemused as a tan sedan skidded to a halt inches from his own vehicle and two figures jumped out and ran toward him they were wearing hoods and holding guns the door opened and russell twisted his head back and said one word edmund they sold us out edmund said then the men opened fire both with pistols muffled with silencers russell fell forward the way he was facing across the threshold of edmunds house edmund had no time to process what he was seeing that there were two men firing weapons at him that hed gambled on this venture and this was how he lost he fell backward propelled by three bullets in the chest he fell straight back only the soles of his most comfortable pair of slippers visible the first man walked up the stairs looked at edmund leveled his gun and shot him once more in the forehead the second man kicked over russells body and did the same to him the men looked at each other and nodded they found the spent cartridge cases and picked them up then walked back to the car got in and removed their balaclavas before driving off at the wheel prek vllasi navigated the drive out of the gate and turned onto the road prek turned to genti hajdini and banged once on the steering wheel both men smiled
