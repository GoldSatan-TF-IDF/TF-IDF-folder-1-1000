exceedingly tired i hasten to write a line to inform you of my wellbeing i am now making for home as fast as possible and i have now nothing to detain me since i wrote to you last i have been again in quarantine for two days and a half at trieste but i am glad to say that i shall no longer be detained on that account i was obliged to go to trieste though it was much out of my way otherwise i must have remained i know not how long in corfu waiting for a direct conveyance after my liberation i only stopped a day at corfu in order that i might lose no more time though i really wished to tarry there a little longer the people were so kind on the day of my liberation i had four invitations to dinner from the officers i however made the most of my time and escorted by one captain northcott of the rifles went over the fortifications which are most magnificent i saw everything that i well could and shall never forget the kindness with which i was treated the next day i went for trieste in a steamer down the whole length of the adriatic i was horribly unwell for the adriatic is a bad sea and very dangerous the weather was also very rough after stopping at trieste a day besides the quarantine i left for venice and here i am and hope to be on my route again the day after tomorrow i shall now hurry through italy by way of ancona rome and civita vecchia to marseilles in france and from marseilles to london in not more than six days journey oh i shall be so glad to get back to you and my mother i hope she is alive and well and hen i am glad to hear that we are not to have a war with those silly people the french the idea made me very uneasy for i thought how near oulton lay to the coast you cannot imagine what a magnificent old town venice isit is clearly the finest in italy although in decay it stands upon islands in the sea and in many places is intersected with canals the grand canal is four miles long lined with palaces on either side i however shall be glad to leave it for there is no place to me like oulton where live two of my dear ones i have told you that i am very tired so that i cannot write much more and i am presently going to bed but i am sure that you will be glad to hear from me however little i may write i think i told you in my last letter that i had been to the top of mount olympus in thessaly tell hen that i saw a whole herd of wild deer bounding down the cliffs the noise they made was like thunder i also saw an enormous eagleone of jupiters birds his real eagles for according to the grecian mythology olympus was his favourite haunt i dont know what it was then but at present it is the most wild savage place i ever saw an immense way up i came to a forest of pines half of them were broken by thunderbolts snapped in the middle and the ruins lying around in the most hideous confusion some had been blasted from top to bottom and stood naked black and charred in indescribable horridness jupiter was the god of thunder and he still seems to haunt olympus the worst is there is little water so that a person might almost perish there of thirst the snowwater however when it runs into the hollows is the most delicious beverage ever tastedthe snow however is very high up my next letter i hope will be from marseilles and i hope to be there in a very few days now god bless you my dearest write to my mother and kiss hen and remember

by there is now a claimant to the title a descendant of old frasers elder brother who committed a murder in the year and on that account fled to south wales the present family are rather uneasy and so are their friends of whom they have a great number for though they are flaming papists they are very free of their money i have told several of their cousins that the claimant has not a chance as the present family have been so long in possession they almost blessed me for saying so there however can be very little doubt that the title and estate more than a million acres belong to the claimant by strict law old frasers brother was called black john of the tasser the man whom he killed was a piper who sang an insulting song to him at a wedding i have heard the words and have translated them he was dressed very finely and the piper sang youre dressed in highland robes o john but ropes of straw would become ye better youve silver buckles your shoes upon but leather thongs for them were fitter

to my middle in snow as soon as i had passed it i was on badenoch the road on the farther side was horrible and i was obliged to wade several rivulets one of which was very boisterous and nearly threw me down i wandered through a wonderful country and picked up a great many strange legends from the people i met but they were very few the country being almost a desert chiefly inhabited by deer when amidst the lower mountains i frequently heard them blaring in the woods above me the people at the inn here are by far the nicest i have met they are kind and honourable to a degree god bless you and hen george borrow dont write again if you have written letter ix inverness november th dear carreta after i wrote to you i walked round mull and through it over benmore i likewise went to icolmkill and passed twentyfour hours there i saw the wonderful ruin and crossed the island i suffered a great deal from hunger but what i saw amply repaid me on my return to tobermory i was rather unwell but got better i was disappointed in a passage to thurso by sea so i was obliged to return to this place by train on tuesday dv i shall set out on foot and hope to find your letter awaiting me at the post office at thurso on coming hither by train i nearly lost my things i was told at huntly that the train stopped ten minutes and meanwhile the train drove off purposely i telegraphed to keith in order that my things might be secured describing where they were under the seat the reply was that there was nothing of the kind there i instantly said that i would bring an action against the company and walked off to the town where i stated the facts to a magistrate and gave him my name and address he advised me to bring my action i went back and found the people frightened they telegraphed againand the reply was that the things were safe there is nothing like setting oneself up sometimes i was terribly afraid i shouldnever again find my books and things i however got them and my old umbrella too i was sent on by the mail train but lost four hours besides undergoing a great deal of misery and excitement when i have been to thurso and kirkwall i shall return as quick as possible and shall be glad to get out of the country as i am here however i wish to see all i can for i never wish to return whilst in mull i lived very cheaplyit is not costing me more than seven shillings a day the

that i have some moss for her from benmorealso some seaweed from the farther shore of icolmrill god bless you george borrow letter x thurso november st my dear carreta i reached this place on friday night and was glad enough to get your kind letter i shall be so glad to get home to you since my last letter to you i have walked nearly miles i was terribly taken in with respect to distanceshowever i managed to make my way i have been to johnny groats house which is about twentytwo miles from this place i had tolerably fine weather all the way but within two or three miles of that place a terrible storm arose the next day the country was covered with ice and snow there is at present here a kind of greenland winter colder almost than i ever knew the winter in russia the streets are so covered with ice that it is dangerous to step out tomorrow d and i pass over into orkney and we shall take the first steamer to aberdeen and inverness from whence i shall make the best of my way to england it is well that i have no farther to walk for walking now is almost impossiblethe last twenty miles were terrible and the weather is worse than it was then i was terribly deceived with respect to steamboats i was told that one passed over to orkney every day and i have now been waiting two days and there is not yet one i have had quite enough of scotland when i was at johnny groats i got a shell for dear hen which i hope i shall be able to bring or send to her i am glad to hear that you have got out the money on mortgage so satisfactorily one of the greatest blessings in this world is to be independent my spirits of late have been rather bad owing principally to my dear mothers death i always knew that we should miss her i dreamt about her at fort augustus though i have walked so much i have suffered very little from fatigue and have got over the ground with surprising facility but i have not enjoyed the country so much as wales i wish that you would order a hat for me against i come home the one i am wearing is very shabby having been so frequently drenched with rain and stormbeaten i cannot say the exact day that i shall be home but you may be expecting me the worst is that there is no depending on the steamers for there is scarcely any traffic in scotland in winter my appetite of late has been very poorly chiefly i believe owing to badness of food and want of regular meals glad enough i repeat shall i be to get home to you and hen george borrow letter xi kirkwall orkney november th saturday dear carreta i am as you see in orkney and i expect every minute the steamer which will take me to shetland and aberdeen from which last place i go by train to inverness where my things are and thence home i had a stormy passage to stromness from whence i took a boat to the isle of hoy where i saw the wonderful dwarfs house hollowed out of the stone from stromness i walked here i have seen the old norwegian cathedral it is of red sandstone and looks as if cut out of rock it is different from almost everything of the kind i ever saw it is stern and grand to a degree i have also seen the ruins of the old norwegian bishops palace in which king hacon died also the ruins of the palace of patrick earl of orkney i have been treated here with every kindness and civility as soon as the people knew who i was they could scarcely make enough of me the sheriff mr robertson a great gaelic scholar said he was proud to see me in his house and a young gentleman of the name of petrie clerk of supply has done nothing but go about with me to show me the wonders of the place mr robertson wished to give me letters to some gentleman at edinburgh i however begged leave to be excused saying that i wished to get home as indeed i do for my mind iswearied by seeing so many strange places on my way to kirkwall i saw the stones of stennisimmense blocks of stone standing up like those of salisbury plain all the country is full of druidical and pictish remains it is however very barren and scarcely a tree is to be seen only a few dwarf ones orkney consists of a multitude of small islands the principal of which is pomona in which kirkwall is the currents between them are terrible i hope to be home a few days after you receive these lines either by rail or steamer this is a fine day but there has been dreadful weather here i hope we shall have a prosperous passage i have purchased a little kirkwall newspaper which i send you with this letter i shall perhaps post both at lerwick or aberdeen i sent you a johnny groats newspaper which i hope you got dont tear either up for they are curious god bless you and hen george borrow letter xii stirling december th dear carreta i write a line to tell you that i am well and that i am on my way to england but i am stopped here for a day for there is no conveyance wherever i can walk i get on very wellbut if you depend on coaches or any means of conveyance in this country you are sure to be disappointed this place is but thirtyfive miles from edinburgh yet i am detained for a day there is no train the waste of that day will prevent me getting to yarmouth from hull by the steamer were it not for my baggage i would walk to edinburgh i got to aberdeen where i posted a letter for you i was then obliged to return to inverness for my luggage miles rather than return again to aberdeen i sent on my things to dunkeld and walked the miles through the highlands when i got here i walked to loch lomond and loch katrine thirtyeight miles over horrible roads i then got back here i have now seen the whole of scotland that is worth seeing and have walked miles i shall be glad to be out of the country a person here must depend entirely upon himself and his own legs i have not spent much moneymy expenses during my wanderings averaged a shilling a day as i was walking through strathspey singularly enough i met two or three of the phillips i did not know them but a child came running after me to ask me my name it was miss p and two of the children i hope to get to you in two or three days after you get this god bless you and dear hen george borrow
