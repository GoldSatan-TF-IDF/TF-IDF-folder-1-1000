sara paretsky blood shot the fifth book in the vi warshawski series toxic shock for dominick acknowledgments a writer working on a project that includes much technical material incurs many debts as with the bill of rights the enumeration of some does not mean that others are not considered equally important judy freeman and rennie heath environmental specialists with the south chicago development commission gave freely of their time and expertise on both the geography and the economic issues facing south chicago jeffrey s brown environmental manager of velsicol corporation and john thompson executive director of the central states education center both provided valuable insights into the corporate and technical problems that might arise in the situation i envisioned doctors sarah neely and susan s riter were most helpful in diagnosing the problems besetting louisa djiak and sergeant michael black of the matteson police department has been unfailingly helpful throughout vis career with advice on police procedure handgun use and other matters because this is a work of fiction all companies persons chemicals manufacturing processes medical side effects and political or community organizations are totally the creation of my unaidedand unfetteredimagination while some major corporations are mentioned by name it is only where their plants form a wellknown part of the chicago landscapeto omit them would mean too much tampering with geography for the same reason existing ward boundaries were used without in any way referring to real politicians who serve the citizens of those wards for those who are fanatics about geographical details some minor ones have been deliberately altered to facilitate the story however south chicago does contain some of illinois s last wetlands for migratory birds and a part of that marsh is really known as dead stick pond highway revisited i had forgotten the smell even with the south works on strike and wisconsin steel padlocked and rusting away a pungent mix of chemicals streamed in through the engine vents i turned off the car heater but the stenchyou couldnt call it airslid through minute cracks in the chevys windows burning my eyes and sinuses i followed route south a couple of miles back it had been lake shore drive with lake michigan spewing foam against the rocks on my left expensive high rises haughtily looking on from the right at seventyninth street the lake disappeared abruptly the weedchoked yards surrounding the giant usx south works stretched away to the east filling the mile or so of land between road and water in the distance pylons gantries and towers loomed through the smokehung february air not the land of high rises and beaches anymore but landfill and wornout factories decaying bungalows looked on the south works from the right side of the street some were missing pieces of siding or shamefacedly showing stretches of peeling paint in others the concrete in the front steps cracked and sagged but the windows were all whole tightly sealed and not a scrap of debris lay in the yards poverty might have overtaken the area but my old neighbors gallantly refused to give in to it i could remember when eighteen thousand men poured from those tidy little homes every day into the south works wisconsin steel the ford assembly plant or the xerxes solvent factory i remembered when each piece of trim was painted fresh every second spring and new buicks or oldsmobiles were an autumn commonplace but that was in a different life for me as well as south chicago at eightyninth street i turned west flipping down the sun visor to shield my eyes from the waning winter sun beyond the tangle of deadwood rusty cars and collapsed houses on my left lay the calumet river my friends and i used to flout our parents by swimming there my stomach turned now at the thought of sticking my face into the filthy water the high school stood across from the river it was an enormous structure sprawling over several acres but its dark red brick somehow looked homey like a nineteenthcentury girls college light pouring from the windows and streams of young people going through the vast double doors on the west end added to the effect of quaintness i turned off the engine reached for my gym bag and joined the crowd the high vaulted ceilings were built when heat was cheap and education respected enough for people to want schools to look like cathedrals the cavernous hallways served as perfect echo chambers for the laughing shouting crowd noise hurled from the ceiling the walls and the metal lockers i wondered why i never noticed the din when i was a student they say you dont forget the things you learn young id last been here twenty years ago but at the gym entrance i turned left without thinking to follow the hall down to the womens locker room caroline djiak was waiting at the door clipboard in hand vic i thought maybe youd chickened out everyone else got here half an hour ago theyre suited up at least the ones who can still get into their uniforms you did bring yours didnt you joan laceys here from the heraldstar and shed like to talk to you after all you were tournament mvp werent you caroline hadnt changed the copper pigtails were cut into a curly halo around her freckled face but that seemed to be the only difference she was still short energetic and tactless i followed her into the locker room the din there rivaled the noise level in the hall outside ten young women in various stages of undress were screaming at each otherfor a nail file a tampon who stole my fucking deodorant in bras and panties they looked muscular and trim much fitter than my friends and i had been at that age certainly fitter than we were now in a corner of the locker room making almost as much noise were seven of the ten lady tigers with whom id won the state class aa championship twenty years ago five of the seven had on their old blackandgold uniforms on some the tshirts stretched tight across their breasts and the shorts looked as though they might split if the wearer tried a fast breakaway the one packed tightest into her uniform might have been lily goldring our leading freethrow shooter but the permed hair and extra chin made it hard to be sure i thought alma lowell was the black woman who had spread far beyond the capacity of her uniform and had her letter jacket perched uneasily on her massive shoulders the only two i recognized for certain were diane logan and nancy cleghorn dianes strong slender legs could still do for a vogue cover shed been our star forward cocaptain honors student caroline had told me diane now ran a successful loop pr agency specializing in promoting black companies and personalities nancy cleghorn and i had stayed in touch through college even so her strong square face and frizzy blond hair were so unchanged i would have known her anyplace she was responsible for my being here tonight she directed environmental affairs for scrapthe south chicago reawakening project where caroline djiak was the deputy director when the two of them realized the lady tigers were going into the regional championships for the first time in twenty years they decided to get the old team together for a pregame ceremony publicity for the neighborhood publicity for scrap support for the teamgood for everyone nancy grinned when she saw me yo warshawskiget your ass moving we gotta be on the floor in ten minutes hi nancy i ought to have my head examined for letting you get me down here dont you know you cant go home again i found four square inches of bench to dump my gym bag on and quickly stripped stuffing my jeans into the bag and putting on my faded uniform i adjusted the socks and tied the highlacing shoes diane put an arm around me youre looking good whitey like you still could move around if you had to we looked into the mirror while some of the current tigers topped six feet at fiveeight id been the tallest one on our team dianes afro was about level with my nose black and white wed both wanted to play basketball when race fights were a daily disruption in hall and locker room we hadnt liked each other but junior year wed forced a truce on the rest of the team and the next february wed taken them to the first statewide girls tournament she grinned sharing the memory all that garbage we used to put ourselves through seems mighty trivial now warshawski come over and meet the reporter say something nice about the old neighborhood the heraldstars joan lacey was the citys only woman sports columnist when i said i read her stuff regularly she smiled with pleasure tell my editor better still write a letter so how do you feel putting on your uniform after all these years like an idiot i havent held a basketball since i left college id gone to the university of chicago on an athletic scholarship the u of c offered them long before the rest of the country knew that women played sports we talked for a few minutes about the past about aging athletes about the fifty percent unemployed in the neighborhood about the current teams prospects were rooting for them of course i said im anxious to see them on the court in here they look as though they take conditioning much more seriously than we did twenty years ago yeah they keep hoping the womens pro league will revive therere some topnotch women players in high school and college with no place to go joan put her notebook away and told a photographer to get us out on the court for some shots we eight oldtimers straggled out to the gym floor caroline worrying around us like an overzealous terrier diane picked up a ball and dribbled it behind her under her legs then bounced it to me i turned and shot the ball caromed from the backboard and i ran in to get it and dunk it my old teammates gave me a ragged hand the photographer took some pictures of us together then of diane and me playing oneonone under the net the crowd got into it a little but their real interest was on the current team when the lady tigers took the floor in their warmup suits they got a big round we worked out a little with them but turned the floor over to them as soon as possible this was their big night when the girls from visiting st sophia came out in their redandwhite sweats i slid back to the locker room and started to change back to my civvies caroline found me as i finished tying my neck scarf vic where are you going you know you promised to come over to see ma after the game i said id try if i could stay down here shes counting on seeing you she can hardly get out of bed shes in such bad shape this really matters to her in the mirror i could see her face flush and her blue eyes darken with the same hurt look she used to give me when she was five and i wouldnt let her tag along with my friends i felt my temper rise with twentyyearold irritation did you arrange this basketball farce to manipulate me into visiting louisa or did that only come to you later the flush deepened to scarlet what do you mean farce im trying to do something for this community im not a ladida snot going off to the north side and abandoning people to their fate what you think if id stayed down here i couldve saved wisconsin steel or stopped the assholes at usx from striking one of the last operating plants around here i grabbed my peajacket from the bench and angrily thrust my arms into it vic where are you going home i have a dinner date i want to change clothes you cant i need you she wailed loudly the big eyes were swimming with tears now a prelude to a squawk to her mother or mine that i was being mean to her it brought back all the times gabriella had come to the doorsaying what difference can it make to you victoria take the child with youso forcibly it was all i could do not to slap carolines wide trembling mouth what do you need me for to make good on a promise you made without consulting me ma isnt going to live much longer she shouted isnt that more important than some stupidass date certainly if this were a social occasion i would call and say excuse me the little brat next door committed me to something i cant get out of but this is dinner with a client hes temperamental but he pays on time and i like to keep him happy tears were streaming across the freckles now vic you never take me seriously i told you when we were discussing this how important it would be for ma if you came to visit and you completely forgot you still think im five years old and nothing i say or think matters that shut me up she had a point and if louisa was that sick i really ought to see her oh all right ill phone and change my plans one last time the tears disappeared instantly thanks vic i wont forget it i knew i could count on you you mean you knew you could make another end run around me i said disagreeably she laughed let me show you where the phones are im not senile yeti can still find them and no i wont sneak off while youre not looking i added seeing her uneasy look she grinned as god is your witness it was an old pledge picked up from her mothers drunk uncle stan who used it to prove he was sober as god is my witness i agreed solemnly i just hope grahams feelings arent so hurt he decides not to pay his bill i found the pay phones near the front entrance and wasted several quarters before running darrough graham down at the fortynine club he wasnt happyhe had made reservations at the filagreebut i managed to end the conversation on a friendly note slinging my bag over my shoulder i made my way back to the gym bringing up baby st sophia gave the lady tigers a tough ride leading through much of the second half the play was intense much faster paced than in my basketball years two starters for the lady tigers fouled out with seven minutes left and things looked bad then the toughest saint guard went out with three minutes left the tigers star forward whod been penned in all evening came to life scoring eight unanswered points the home team won i found myself cheering as eagerly as anyone i even felt a nostalgic warmth for my own high school team which surprised me my adolescent memories are so dominated by my mothers illness and death i guess ive forgotten having any good times nancy cleghorn had left to attend a meeting but diane logan and i joined the rest of our old team in the locker room to congratulate our successors and wish them well in the regional semifinals we didnt stay long they clearly thought we were too old to understand basketball let alone have played it diane came over to say goodbye to me you couldnt pay me enough to relive my adolescence she said brushing my cheek with her own im going back to the gold coast and im definitely staying there take it easy warshawski she was gone in a shimmer of silver fox and opium caroline hovered anxiously around the lockerroom door worried i would leave without her she was so tense i began to feel uneasy about what i was going to find at her house shed acted just this way when shed dragged me home from college one weekend ostensibly because louisa had hurt her back and needed help replacing a broken window after i got there i found she expected me to explain why shed given louisas little pearl ring to the st wenceslaus lenten fund drive is louisa really sick i demanded as we finally left the locker room she looked at me soberly very sick vic youre not going to like seeing her whats the rest of your agenda then the ready color flooded her cheeks i dont know what youre talking about she flounced out the school door i followed slowly in time to see her get into a battered car parked with its nose well into the street she rolled down the window as i walked by to yell that shed see me at the house and took off in a squeal of rubber my shoulders were sagging a little as i unlocked the chevy door and slid in my gloom increased when i made the turn onto houston street id last been on the block in when my father died and i came back down to sell the house id seen louisa then and caroline who was fourteen and following determinedly in my stepsshe even tried playing basketball but at five feet even her tireless energy couldnt get her onto the first squad that was the last time i had talked to any of the other neighbors who had known my parents there was genuine grief for my gentle goodhumored father grudging respect for gabriella dead ten years at the time after all the other women on the block had shared her scraping saving cutting each penny five ways to feed and shelter their families now she was dead they glossed over the eccentricities that used to make them shake their headstaking the girl to the opera with an extra ten dollars instead of buying her a new winter coat not baptizing her or giving her to the sisters at st wenceslaus for schooling that disturbed them enough that they sent the principal mother joseph something around one day for a memorable confrontation maybe the biggest folly of all to them was her insisting on college for me and demanding that it be the university of chicago only the best did for gabriella and shed decided that was chicagos best when i was two not perhaps comparing in her mind with the university of pisa just as the shoes she bought herself at callabranos on morgan street didnt compare to milan but one did what one could so two years after my mothers death id left on a scholarship for what my neighbors called red university half scared half excited to meet the demons up there and after that id never really gone home again louisa djiak was the one woman on the block who always stood up for gabriella dead or alive but then she owed gabriella and me too i thought with a flash of bitterness that startled me i realized i was still pissed at spending all those glorious summer days babysitting at doing my homework with louisas baby howling in the background well the baby was grown up now but she was still howling exigently in my ear i pulled up behind her capri and turned off the engine the house was smaller than i remembered and dingier louisa wasnt well enough to wash and starch the curtains every six months and caroline belonged to a generation that emphatically avoided such tasks i should knowi was part of it myself caroline was waiting in the doorway for me still edgy she gave a brief tense smile mas really excited youre here vic shes waited all day to have her coffee so she could drink it with you she took me through the small cluttered dining room to the kitchen saying over her shoulder shes not supposed to drink coffee anymore but it was too hard for her to give it upalong with everything else thats changed for her so we compromise on one cup a day she busied herself at the stove tackling the coffee with energetic inefficiency despite a trail of spilled water and coffee grounds on the stove she carefully arranged a tv tray with china cloth napkins and a geranium cut from a coffee can in the window finally she set out a little dish of ice cream with a geranium leaf in it when she picked up the tray i stood up from my perch on the kitchen stool to follow her louisas bedroom lay to the right of the dining room as soon as caroline opened the door the smell of sickness hit me like a physical force bringing back the odor of medicine and decaying flesh that had hung around gabriella the last year of her life i dug the nails into the palm of my right hand and willed myself into the room my first reaction was shock even though i thought id prepared myself louisa sat propped in bed her face gaunt and tinged a queer greenish gray under her wispy hair her twisted hands emerged from the loose sleeves of a worn pink cardigan when she held them out to me with a smile though i caught a glimpse of the beautiful young woman whod rented the house next to ours when she was pregnant with caroline good to see you victoria knew youd come by youre like your ma that way look like her too even though you have your daddys gray eyes i knelt by the bed and hugged her underneath the cardigan her bones felt tiny and brittle she gave a racking cough that shook her frame excuse me too many damned cigarettes for too many years little missy here hides em from meas if they could hurt me any worse now caroline bit her lips and moved over next to the bed i brought you your coffee ma maybe itll take your mind off your cigs yeah my one cup damned doctors first they pump you so full of shit you dont know whether youre coming or going then when they got you tied by the hind legs they take away anything thatd make the time pass easier im telling you girl dont ever get yourself in this spot i took the thick china mug from caroline and handed it to louisa her hands shook slightly and she pressed the mug against her breast to steady it i slid off my heels into a straightbacked chair near the bed you want to spend some time alone with vic ma caroline asked yeah sure you go on girl i know you got work to do when the door shut behind caroline i said im really sorry to see you like this she made a throwaway gesture ahwhat the hell im sick of thinking about it and i talk about it to the damned docs often enough i want to hear about you i follow all your cases when they make it to the papers your mad be real proud of you i laughed im not so sure she hoped id be a concert singer or maybe a highpriced lawyer i can just imagine her if she saw the way i live louisa laid a bony hand on my arm dont you think so victoria dont you think so for one minute you know gabriellashed of gave her last shirt to a beggar look how she stood up for me when people came by and threw eggs and shit at my windows no maybe shed of liked to see you living better than you do heckfeel that way about caroline her brains her education and all she could do better than hanging around this dump but im real proud of her shes honest and hardworking and she sticks up for what she believes in and youre just the same no sir gabriella could see you now shed be as proud as can be well we couldnt have managed without your help when she was so sick i muttered uncomfortable oh shit girl my one chance to pay her back for everything she did i can still see her when the righteous ladies from st wenceslaus were out parading around my front door gabriella come out with a head of steam that damn near drove em into the calumet she gave a shout of hoarse laughter that changed to a coughing fit which left her breathless and slightly purple she lay quietly for a few minutes panting in short gasping breaths hard to believe folks cared so much about one pregnant unmarried teenager aint it she said finally here we got half the people outa work in the communitythats life and death girl but back then i guess it seemed like the end of the world to folks i mean my own ma and pa even throwing me out like they did her face worked for a minute like it was all my fault or something your ma was the only one stood up for me even when my folks come around and decided to admit caroline was alive they never really forgave her for being born or me for doing it gabriella never did anything by half measures i helped her look after the baby so louisa could work the night shift at xerxes the days when i had to take caroline to her grandparents were my worst torment rigid humorless they wouldnt let me into the house unless i took my shoes off a couple of times they even bathed caroline outside before theyd admit her to their pristine portals louisas parents were only in their sixtiessame age as gabriella and tony would be if they were still alive because louisa had a baby and lived by herself id always thought of her as part of my parents generation but she was only five or six years older than me when did you stop working i asked i called louisa occasionally when my guilty imagination conjured up gabriellas image but it had been awhile south chicago hovered too uneasily at the base of my mind for me to willingly court its return to my life and it had been over two years since id spoken to louisa she hadnt said anything then about feeling bad oh it got so i couldnt stand anymore aboutmust be just over a year so they put me on disability then its only been the last six months or so i couldnt get around at all she flicked the covers back from her legs they were twigs thin bones a bird might use but mottled greenygray like her face livid patches on her feet and ankles showed where her veins had given up carting blood around its my kidneys she said darned things dont want me to pee properly caroline takes me over two three times a week and they stick me on that damned machine supposed to clean me out but between you and me girl id just as soon theyd let me go in peace she held up a thin hand dont you go telling caroline that nowshes doing everything to see i get the best and the company pays for it so its not like i feel shes digging into her own savings i dont want her to think i aint grateful no no i said soothingly pulling the cover up gently she reverted to the old days on the block to the days when her legs were slim and muscular when she used to go dancing after getting off work at midnight to steve ferraro who wanted to marry her and joey pankowski who didnt and how if she had to do it over shed do it the same because she had caroline but for caroline she wanted something different something better than staying on in south chicago working herself to an early old age at last i took the bony fingers and squeezed them gently ive got to go louisaits twenty miles to my place but ill come back well its been real good to see you again girl she cocked her head on one side and gave a naughty smile dont suppose you could find a way to slip me a pack of cigarettes do you i laughed im not touching that with a barge pole louisayou work it out with caroline i shook out her pillows and turned on the tv for her before going off to find caroline louisa had never been much given to kissing but she squeezed my hand tightly for a few seconds my sisters keeper caroline was sitting at the diningroom table eating fried chicken and making notes on a colored graph chaotic stacks of paperreports magazines flyerscovered all of the small surface a large pile near her left elbow teetered uncertainly on the table edge she put down her pencil when she heard me come into the room i went out for some kentucky fried while you were in with ma want some what did you thinkkind of a shock huh i shook my head in dismay its terrible to see her like this how are you holding up she grimaced it wasnt so bad until her legs wouldnt support her anymore she show em to you i knew she would its really tough on her not being able to get around the hard part for me was realizing how long shed been sick before i noticed anything you know mashed never complain in a million years especially about anything as private as her kidneys she rubbed a greasy hand through her unruly curls it was only three years ago when i suddenly noticed how much weight shed been losing that i even knew anything was wrong then it came out shed been feeling off for a long timedizzy and stuff her feet numbbut she didnt want to say anything that might jeopardize her job the story sounded depressingly familiar people on the hip north side went to the doctor every time they stubbed their toes but in south chicago you expected life to be tough dizziness and weight loss happened to lots of people it was the kind of thing grownups kept to themselves you satisfied with the doctors shes seeing caroline finished gnawing on the chicken thigh and licked her fingers theyre okay we go to help of christians because thats where xerxes has their medical plan and they do as much as anyone could i mean her kidneys just arent working at allthey call it acute renal failureand it looks like she may have some bone marrow problems and may be starting with emphysema thats our only real problemshe keeps going on about her damned cigarettes hell they may have helped get her into this fix to begin with i said awkwardly if shes in that bad shape the cigarettes arent going to make her any worse you know vic you didnt say that to her did you i have to fight her about them ten times a day as it is if she thinks youre backing her up i might as well quit on the spot she slapped the table emphatically the teetering pile of papers flew across the floor i was sure you of all people would support me on this you know how i feel about smoking i said annoyed i expect tony would be alive today if he hadnt had a twopackaday habiti still hear him wheezing and coughing in my nightmares but how much time is smoking going to shave from louisas life at this point shes in there by herself got nothing but the tube to keep her company im just saying itd make her feel better mentally and wont make her any worse physically caroline set her mouth in an uncompromising line no i dont even want to talk about it i sighed and got down on the floor to help her with the loose papers when we had them all collated again i looked at her suspiciously she had reverted to her tense abstracted mood well i think its time for me to push off i hope the lady tigers go all the way again ivic i need to talk to you i need your help caroline i came down and pranced around in my basketball uniform for you i saw louisa not that i grudge the time with her but how many items you got on your agenda tonight i want to hire you professionally i need your help as a detective she said defiantly what for you give scraps money to the church lenten fund and now you want me to find it for you again goddamn you vic could you stop acting like im still five years old and treat me seriously for a minute if you wanted to hire me why couldnt you have said something about it on the phone i asked your stepbystep approach to me isnt exactly designed to make me feel serious about you i wanted you to see ma before i talked to you about it she muttered looking at her graph i thought if you saw how bad off she is youd think it was more important i sat at the end of the table caroline lay it out for me i promise ill listen as seriously to you as to any other potential client but tell me the whole story front middle and end then we can decide if you really need a detective if it should be me and so on she took a breath and said quickly i want you to find my father for me i was quiet for a minute isnt that a job for a detective she demanded do you know who he is i asked gently no thats partly what i need you to find out for me you see how bad ma is vic shes going to die soon she tried to keep her voice matteroffact but it quavered a little her folks always treated me likei dont knownot the same way they are to my cousins secondclass i guess when she dies id like to have some kind of family i mean maybe my old man will turn out to be an asshole jerk the kind of guy who lets a girl go through what ma did when she was pregnant might be but maybe hed have folks whod like me and if he didnt at least id know what does louisa say have you asked her she practically killed me practically killed herselfshe got so upset she almost choked to death screaming how i was ungrateful shed worked herself to the bone for me i never wanted for anything whyd i have to go nosing around in something that wasnt any of my damned business so i knew i couldnt go on about it with her but i have to find out i know you could do it for me caroline maybe youre better off not knowing even if i knew how to go about itmissing persons arent a big part of my businessif its that painful to louisa you might prefer not to find out you know who he is dont you she cried i shook my head i have no idea honestly why did you think i do she looked down im sure she told gabriella i thought maybe gabriella told you i moved over to sit down next to her maybe louisa told my mother but if so it wasnt the kind of thing gabriella thought i ought to know about as god is my witness i dont know she gave a little smile at that so will you find him for me if i hadnt known her all her life it would have been easier to say no i specialize in financial crime missing persons takes a certain kind of skill and certain kinds of contacts ive never bothered cultivating and this guyd been gone more than a quarter of a century but in addition to whining and teasing and tagging along when i didnt want her caroline used to adore me when i went off to college shed race to meet my train if i came home for the weekend copper pigtails flying around her head plump legs pumping as hard as they could she even went out for basketball because i did she almost drowned following me into lake michigan when she was four the memories were endless her blue eyes still looked at me with total trust i didnt want to but i couldnt keep from responding you got any idea where to start this search well you know it had to be someone who lived in east side she never went anyplace else i mean shed never even been to the loop until your mother took us there to look at the christmas decorations when i was three east side was an allwhite neighborhood to the east of south chicago it was cut off from the city by the calumet river and its residents tended to lead parochial inbred lives louisas parents still lived there in the house shed grown up in thats helpful i said encouragingly what do you figure the population was in twenty thousand and only half of them were men and many of those were children you got any other ideas no she said doggedly thats why i need a detective before i could say anything else the doorbell rang caroline looked at her watch that might be aunt connie she sometimes comes this late be back in a minute she trotted out to the entryway while she dealt with the caller i flipped through a magazine devoted to the solidwastedisposal industry wondering if i was really insane enough to look for carolines father i was staring at a picture of a giant incinerator when she came back into the room nancy cleghorn my old basketball pal who now worked for scrap was trailing behind her hi vic sorry to barge in but i wanted to fill caroline in on a problem caroline looked at me apologetically and asked if id mind waiting a few minutes to finish up not at all i said politely wondering if i was doomed to spend the night in south chicago want me to go to the other room nancy shook her head its not private just annoying she sat down and unbuttoned her coat shed changed from her basketball uniform to a tan dress with a red scarf and shed put on makeup but she still managed to appear disheveled i got to the meeting in plenty of time ron was waiting for meron kappelman our lawyershe put in an aside to meand we found we werent on the agenda so ron went up to talk to that fat moron martin ogara saying wed filed our material in plenty of time and talked to the secretary this morning to make sure she included us so ogara makes this big show of not knowing what the hell is going on and calls the board secretary and disappears for a while then he comes back and says there were so many legal problems with our submission theyd decided not to consider it this evening we want to build a solvent recycling plant here caroline explained to me weve got funding we have a site we have specs that have passed every epa test we can think of and we have some customers right on our doorstepxerxes and glowrite it means a good hundred jobs down here and a chance to make a dent in the crap going into the ground she turned back to nancy so what can the problem be what did ron say i was so mad i couldnt speak he was so mad i was afraid hed break ogaras neckif he could find it underneath the fat rolls but he called dan zimring the epa lawyer you know dan said we could come by his place so we went over there and he looked through everything and said it couldnt be in better shape nancy fluffed out her frizzy hair so that it stood up wildly around her head she helped herself absently to a piece of chicken ill tell you what i think the problem is caroline snapped cheeks flushed they probably showed the submission to art jurshakyou know professional courtesy or some shit i think he blocked it art jurshak i echoed is he still alderman down here he must be a hundred and fifty by now no no caroline said impatiently hes only in his sixties somewhere dont you agree nancy i think hes sixtytwo she answered through a mouthful of chicken not about his age caroline said impatiently that jurshak must be trying to block the plant nancy licked her fingers she looked around for a place to put the bone and finally laid it back on the plate with the rest of the chicken i dont see how you figure that caroline there could be a lot of people who dont want to see a recycling center down here caroline looked at her through narrowed eyes what did ogara say i mean he must have given some reason for not giving us a hearing nancy frowned he said we shouldnt try to make proposals like this without community backing i told him the community was a hundred percent behind us and got ready to show him copies of petitions and crap when he gave this jolly laugh and said not a hundred percent hed heard from people who werent behind it at all but why jurshak i asked interested in spite of myself why not xerxes or the mob or some rival solvent recycler just the political tiein caroline answered ogaras chairman of the zoning board because hes good buddies with all the old hack dems but carolinearts got no reason to oppose us our last meeting he even acted like he would support us he never put it in so many words caroline said grimly and all it would take is someone willing to wave a big enough campaign contribution in front of him for him to change his mind i suppose nancy agreed reluctantly i just dont like to think it why are you so pally with jurshak all of a sudden caroline demanded it was nancys turn to flush im not but if hes against us itll be damned near impossible to get ogara to give us a hearing unless we could come up with a bribe big enough to make jurshak respond to us so how do i find whos against the plant vic arent you a detective or something these days i frowned at her and said hurriedly or something trouble is youve got too many possibilities in a political mess like this the mob theyre into a lot of wastedisposal projects in chicago maybe they figure youd be cutting into their turf or return to eden i know theyre supposed to be foursquare for the environment but theyve been raising a lot of money lately based on dramatic gestures theyre making here in south chicago maybe they dont want something that cuts off their fundraising tactics or the sanitary districtmaybe theyre taking kickbacks to look the other way on local pollution and they dont want to lose the revenues or xerxes doesnt enough she protested youre right of course it could be all of them or any of them but in my place where would you look first i dont know i said thoughtfully probably nuzzle up to someone on jurshaks staff see if the pressure came from there to begin with and if it did why itd save you the trouble of making the rounds of an infinite number of possibilities plus you wouldnt rub against someone who might want to put you in cement booties just for asking you know some of the people who work for art dont you caroline asked nancy yes yes i do she fiddled with another piece of chicken its just i havent wanted oh well anything for the cause of right and justice i guess she picked up her coat and headed for the door she stood looking at us for a moment then set her lips firmly and left i thought you might want to help her find out whos against the plant caroline said i know you did sweet pea and even though it would be lots of fun working for one poor customer in south chicago is about all my budget can take at a time you mean youll help me youll find my father the blue eyes turned dark with excitement i can pay you vic really im not asking you to do it for nothing ive got a thousand dollars saved my usual rate is twofifty a day plus expenses even with a twenty percent family discount i had a feeling she was going to run out of money before i ran out of detecting but no one had forced me to agree i was a free agent governed only by my own whims and guilt ill send you a contract to sign tomorrow i told her and you cant be on the phone to me every half hour demanding results this is going to take a long time no vic i wont she smiled tremulously i cant tell you how much it means to me to know youre helping me out the old folks at home in my sleep that night i saw caroline again as a baby her face pink and blotchy from crying my mother stood behind me telling me to look after the child when i woke at nine the dream lay heavy in my head cloaking me in lethargy the job id agreed to do filled me with distaste find carolines father for a thousand dollars find carolines father against louisas strongly voiced opposition if she felt that violently about the guy after all this time he was probably better left unfound assuming he was still alive assuming hed lived in chicago and hadnt been an itinerant journeyman amusing himself on his way through town at last i stuck a leaden foot out from under the bedclothes the room was cold wed had such a mild winter id turned off the radiator to keep the place from becoming stuffy but the temperature had apparently dropped during the night i pulled my leg back under the blanket for a minute but moving cracked my shell of indolence i swung the covers back and got up grabbing a sweatshirt from a pile on a chair i trotted into the kitchen to start coffee maybe it was too cold out to go running i parted the curtain overlooking the backyard the sky was gray and an east wind was blowing debris against the back fence i was dropping the curtain when a black nose and two paws appeared against the window followed by a sharp bark it was peppy the golden retriever i shared with my downstairs neighbor i opened the door but she wouldnt come in instead she danced around on the little porch indicating that the weather was perfect for running and would i please get a move on oh all right i grumbled i turned off the water and went into the living room to do my stretches peppy didnt understand why i wasnt limber and ready to go as soon as i got out of bed every few minutes shed give a minatory bark from the back when i finally appeared in my sweats and running shoes she raced down the stairs turning at every half landing to make sure i was still coming she gave little grunts of ecstasy when i opened the gate to the alley even though we make the trip together three or four times a week i like to run about five miles since thats beyond peppys range she stops at the lagoon when we get to the lake she spends the time nosing out ducks and muskrats rolling in mud or rotted fish when she can find them and bounds out at me with her tongue hanging out in a selfsatisfied grin when i make my way back west we do the last mile home at a mild jog and i hand her over to my downstairs neighbor mr contreras shakes his head chews us both out for letting her get dirty then spends a pleasurable half hour grooming her coat back to its gleaming goldenred he was waiting as usual this morning when we got back you two have a good run doll you keep the dog out of the water i hope this cold weather it isnt good for her to get wet you know he hung in the doorway prepared to talk indefinitely hes a retired machinist and the dog his cooking and i make up the bulk of his entertainment i extricated myself as quickly as i could but it was still close to eleven by the time id showered i ate breakfast in my bedroom while i dressed knowing if i sat down with coffee and the paper i would keep making excuses for lingering leaving the dishes on the dresser i wrapped a wool scarf around my neck picked up my bag and car coat from the hall where id dumped them the night before and headed south the wind was whipping up the lake tenfoot waves crashed against the rocky barrier and spewed fingers of water onto the road the display of nature angry contemptuous made me feel small every detail of decay struck me as the road wound southward the white paint was peeling and the gates sagging at the old south shore country club once a symbol of that areas wealth and exclusivity as a child i used to imagine i would grow up to ride a horse along its private bridle paths the memory of such fantasies embarrasses me slightly now the trappings of caste dont sit well on my adult conscience but i would have wished a better fate for the club than to rot slowly under the hands of the park district its indifferent current masters south chicago itself looked moribund its life frozen somewhere around the time of world war ii when i drove past the main business area i saw that most of the stores had spanish names now other than that they looked much as they had when i was a little girl their grimy concrete walls still framed tawdry window displays of white nylon communion dresses vinyl shoes plastic furniture women wrapped in threadbare wool coats still wore cotton babushkas as they bent their heads into the wind on the corners near the ubiquitous storefront taverns stood vacanteyed shabbily clad men they had always been a presence but the massive unemployment in the mills swelled their numbers now i had forgotten the trick to getting into east side and had to double back to ninetyfifth street where an oldfashioned drawbridge crosses the calumet river if south chicago hadnt changed since east side stuck itself in formaldehyde when woodrow wilson was president five bridges form the neighborhoods only link to the rest of the city its members live in a stubborn isolation trying to recreate the eastern european villages of their grandparents they dont like people from across the river and anyone north of seventyfirst street might as well have rolled in on a soviet tank for the reception they get i drove under the massive concrete legs of the interstate to th street louisas parents lived south of th on ewing i thought her mother would be home and hoped her father wouldnt be hed retired some years ago from the little printshop hed managed but he was active in the knights of columbus and his vfw lodge and he might be out having lunch with the boys the street was crammed with wellkept bungalows set on obsessively tidy lots not a scrap of paper lay on the street art jurshak tended this part of his ward with loving hands streetcleaning and repair crews came through regularly all along the southeast side sidewalks had been built three or four feet above the original ground level south chicago held numerous gaping pits where the newer paving had collapsed but in east side not a crack showed between sidewalk and house as i got out of my car i felt as though i should have undergone a surgical scrubdown before visiting the neighborhood the djiak house lay halfway down the block its curtained front windows gleamed in the dull air and the stoop shone from much scouring i rang the bell trying to build up enough mental energy to talk to louisas parents martha djiak came to the door her square lined face was set in a frown suitable for dismissing doortodoor salesmen after a moment she recognized me and the frown lightened a little she opened the inner door i could see she had an apron covering the crisply ironed front of her dress id never seen her at home without an apron on well victoria its been a long time since you brought little caroline over for a visit hasnt it yeah it has i agreed unenthusiastically louisa would not let caroline go to her grandparents alone if she or gabriella couldnt take her they gave me two quarters for the bus and careful instructions to stay with caroline until it was time to return home again i never understood why mrs djiak couldnt come and fetch caroline herself maybe louisa was afraid her mother would try to keep the baby so she wouldnt grow up with an unwed single parent since youre down here maybe youd like a cup of coffee it wasnt effusive but shed never been demonstrative i accepted with as much good cheer as i could muster and she opened the storm door for me she was careful not to touch the glass panel with her hands i slid through as unobtrusively as i could remembering to take my shoes off in the tiny entryway before following her to the kitchen as id hoped she was alone the ironing board stood open in front of the stove a shirt draped across it she folded the shirt laid it on the clothes basket and collapsed the ironing board with quick silent motions when everything was stowed in the tiny pantry behind the refrigerator she put on water to boil i talked to louisa this morning she said youd been down there yesterday yes i acknowledged its tough to see someone that lively laid up the way she is mrs djiak spooned coffee into the pot lots of people suffer more with less cause and lots of people carry on like attila the hun and never get a pimple it just goes to show doesnt it she took two cups from a shelf and stood them primly on the table i hear youre a detective now doesnt really seem like a womans job does it kind of like caroline working on community development or whatever she calls it i dont know why you two girls couldnt get married settle down raise a family i guess were waiting for men as good as mr djiak to come along i said she looked at me seriously thats the trouble with you girls you think life is romantic like they show in the movies a good steady man who brings his pay home every friday is worth a lot more than fancy dinners and flowers was that louisas problem too i asked gently she set her lips in a thin line and turned back to the coffee louisa had other problems she said shortly like what she carefully took a covered sugar bowl down from the cupboard over the stove and placed it with a little pitcher of cream in the middle of the table she didnt say anything until shed finished pouring the coffee louisas problems are old now and they never were any of your business and what about caroline are they any concern of hers i sipped the rich coffee which louisa still infused in the old european style they dont have anything to do with her shed be a good deal better off if she learned not to poke around in other peoples closets louisas past matters a lot to caroline louisa is dying and caroline is feeling very lonely shed like to know who her father was and thats why you came down here to help her dig up all that trash she should be ashamed she doesnt have any father instead of talking about it with everyone she knows whats she supposed to do i asked impatiently kill herself because louisa never married the man who got her pregnant you act like it was all louisa and carolines fault louisa was sixteen years oldfifteen when she got pregnant dont you think the man had any responsibility in this she clenched the coffee cup so tightly i was afraid the ceramic might shatter menhave difficulty controlling themselves we all know that she said thickly louisa must have led him on but she would never admit it all i want to know is his name i said as quietly as i could i think caroline has a right to know if she really wants to and a right to see if her fathers family would give her a little warmth rights she said bitterly carolines rights louisas what about my right to a life of peace and decency youre as bad as your mother was yeah i said in my book thats a compliment behind me someone turned a key in the back door martha paled slightly and set down her coffee cup you must not mention any of this in front of him she said urgently tell him you were just visiting louisa and stopped by promise victoria i made a sour face yeah sure i suppose as ed djiak came into the room martha said brightly see whos come to visit us youll never recognize her from the little victoria she used to be ed djiak was tall all the lines in his face and body were elongated like a modigliani painting from his long cavernous face to his long dangling fingers caroline and louisa inherited their short square good looks from martha who knows where their lively tempers came from so victoria you went off to the university of chicago and got too good for the old neighborhood huh he grunted and shifted a sack of groceries onto the table i got the apples and pork chops but the beans didnt look right so i didnt buy any martha quickly unpacked the groceries and stowed them and the bag in their appointed cells victoria and i were just having some coffee ed you want a cup you think im some old lady to drink coffee in the middle of the day get me a beer he sat down at the end of the small table martha moved to the refrigerator which stood immediately to his side and took a pabst from the bottom shelf she poured it carefully into a glass mug and put the can in the trash ive been visiting louisa i said to him im sorry shes in such bad shape but her spirits are impressive we suffered for her for twentyfive years now its her turn to suffer a little huh he stared at me with sneering angry eyes spell it out for me mr djiak i said offensively whatd she do to make you suffer so martha made a little noise in her throat victoria is working as a detective now ed isnt that nice he ignored her youre just like your mother you know she used to carry on like louisa was some kind of saint instead of the whore she really was youre just as bad what did she do to me got herself pregnant used my name stayed in the neighborhood flaunting her baby instead of going off to the sisters the way we arranged for her to do louisa got herself pregnant i echoed with a turkey baster in the basement you mean there wasnt a man involved martha sucked in a nervous breath victoria we dont like to talk about these things no we dont ed agreed nastily turning to her your daughter you couldnt control her for twentyfive years the neighbors whispered behind my back and now i have to be insulted in my own house by that italian bitchs daughter my face turned hot youre disgusting djiak youre terrified of women you hate your own wife and daughter no wonder louisa turned to someone else for a little affection who was it to get you so exercised your local priest he sprang up from the table knocking over his beer stein and hit me in the mouth get out of my house you mongrel bitch dont ever come back with your filthy mind your vile tongue i got up slowly and went over to stand in front of him my face close enough to smell the beer on his breath you may not insult my mother djiak any other garbage from the cesspool you call a mind ill tolerate but you ever insult my mother again in my hearing i will break your neck i stared at him fiercely until he turned his head uneasily away goodbye mrs djiak thanks for the coffee she was on her knees mopping the floor by the time i got to the kitchen door the beer had soaked through my socks in the entry way i paused to take them off slipping my bare feet into my running shoes mrs djiak came up behind me cleaning my beery footprints i begged you not to talk to him about it victoria mrs djiak all i want is carolines fathers name tell me and i wont bother you anymore you mustnt come back he will call the police or perhaps even shoot you himself yeah well ill bring my gun the next time i come i fished a card from my handbag call me if you change your mind she didnt say anything but she took the card and tucked it into her apron pocket i pulled the gleaming door open and left her frowning in the entryway the simple joys of childhood i sat in the car for a long time before my anger cooled and my breathing returned to normal how she made us suffer i mimicked savagely poor scared spunky teenager what courage it must have taken even to tell the djiaks she was pregnant let alone not to go to the home for unwed mothers theyd picked out for her girls in my high school class who hadnt been as resilient returned with horrifying tales of backbreaking work spartan rooms poor nourishment as a ninemonth punishment meted out by the nuns i felt fiercely proud of my mother for standing up to her righteous neighbors i remembered the night they marched in front of louisas house throwing eggs and yelling insults gabriella came out on the front stoop and stared them down yes you are christians arent you she told them in her heavily accented english your christ will be very proud of you tonight my bare feet were beginning to freeze inside my shoes the cold slowly brought me back to myself i started the car and turned on the heater when my toes were warm again i drove down to th street and turned west to avenue l louisas sister connie lived there with her husband mike and their five children while i was churning up the south side i might as well include her connie was five years older than louisa but shed still been living at home when her sister got pregnant on the south side you lived with your parents until you got married yourself in connies case she lived with her parents even after she married while she and her husband saved money for a house of their own when they finally bought their threebedroom place she quit her job to become a motheranother south side tradition compared to her mother connie was quite a slattern a basketball lay on the tiny front lawn and even my untutored eye could tell that no one had washed the front stoop in recent memory the glass in the storm door and front windows gleamed without a streak however and no fingerprints marred the wood on the frame connie came to the door when i rang the bell she smiled when she saw me but nervously as if her parents had called to warn her i would be stopping by oh oh its you vic ii was just going to the store actually her long bony face wasnt suited to lying the skin pink and freckled like her nieces turned crimson as she spoke what a pity i said dryly its been over ten years since we last saw each other i was hoping to catch up on the kids and mike and so on she stood with the door open oh youve been to see louisa havent you mama told me shes not very well louisas in terrible shape i gather from caroline theres nothing they can do for her except try to keep her comfortable i wish someone had told me soonerid have been down months ago im sorrywe didnt thinklouisa didnt want to bother you and ma didnt wantdidnt think she broke off blushing more furiously than ever your mother didnt want me coming down here and stirring the pot i understand but here i am and im doing it anyway so why dont you put off your trip to the store for five minutes and talk to me i pulled the storm door toward me as i spoke and moved closer to her in what i hoped was a nonthreatening persuasive manner she backed away uncertainly i followed her into the house iuh would you like a cup of coffee she stood twisting her hands like a schoolgirl in front of a hostile teacher not a woman pushing fifty with a life of her own coffee would be great i said bravely hoping my kidneys could handle another cup the house is really a mess connie said apologetically picking up a pair of gym shoes that stood in the little entryway i never say that to visitorsits obvious that i havent hung up my clothes or carried out the papers or vacuumed in two weeks in connies case it was hard to see anything she might be talking about other than the gym shoes the floors were scoured chairs stood at right angles to each other and not a book or paper marred the shelves or tables as we went through the living room into the back of the house i sat at the green formica table while she filled an electric coffee maker this small deviation from her mother cheered me slightly if she could make the switch from boiling water to percolator who knows how far she might go you and louisa were never much alike were you i asked abruptly she blushed again she was always the pretty one people dont expect so much of you if youre pretty the poignant gaucherie of her reply seemed almost unbearable what didnt your mother expect her to help out around the house well she was younger you knowshe didnt have to do as much as i did but you know ma everything got cleaned every day whether youd used it or not when she got mad at us we had to scrub the underside of the sinks and the toilets i swore my girls would never do any of that kind of thing her mouth set in the hard line of remembered grievance it sounds rough i said appalled do you feel louisa left you holding the bag too often she shook her head it wasnt really her fault as much as the way they treated her i can see that now you know louisa could talk back and pad think it was kind of cute at least when she was little he wouldnt take it even from her when she got older and mas brother liked louisa to sing and dance for him when he came over she was so little and pretty you know it was like having a doll around then when she got older it was too late of course too late to discipline her i mean seems like they did a pretty good job i commented throwing her out of the house and all that must have been scary for you too oh it was she was rubbing her hands over and over in the towel shed taken out to wipe up a little spot of water left from filling the coffeepot they didnt even tell me what was going on at first you mean you didnt know she was pregnant i asked incredulous she turned so red i thought blood might actually start oozing through her skin i know you wont understand she said in a voice that was little more than a whisper you led such a different life you had boyfriends before you got married i know mama kind of follows your life but when mike and i were married i didnt even know i didnt knowithe nuns never talked about things like that at school ma of course she couldntcouldnt begin to say anything if louisa was missing herher periodshe wouldnt have said anything to me she probably didnt know what it meant anyway tears spurted from her eyes against her will her shoulders shook as she tried controlling her sobbing she wound the towel so tightly around her hands that the veins in her arms stood out i got up from my chair to put a hand on one heaving shoulder she didnt move or say anything but after a few minutes the spasms calmed down and her breathing grew more normal so louisa got pregnant because she didnt know what she was doing or that she might start a baby she nodded mutely her eyes on the floor do you know who the father might have been i asked gently keeping my hand on her shoulder she shook her head papa wouldnt let us date he said he hadnt paid all that money to send us to catholic school to seesee us chasing after boys of course lots of boys liked louisa but sheshe wouldnt have been going out with any of them can you remember any of their names she shook her head again not after all this time i know the boy at the grocery store used to buy her pop when shed go in i think his name was ralph ralph sowsomething sower or sowling or something she turned to the coffeepot vic the terrible thing isi was so jealous of her at first i was glad to see her in trouble god connie i hope so if i had a sister who everyone said was prettier than me and was petted and fussed over while they sent me off to mass id put an ax through her head instead of waiting for her to get pregnant and be kicked out of the house she turned to look up at me astonished but vic youre soso cool nothing ever bothered you not even when you were fifteen years old when your mother died ma said god gave you a stone instead of a heart you were so cool she put her hand over her mouth mortified and started to protest well i was fucked if i was going to sob in public in front of all those women like your mother who never had a good word to say about gabriella i said stung but youd better believe i cried plenty in private and anyway connie thats the whole point my parents loved me they thought i could succeed at anything i wanted to do so even though i lose my temper a hundred times a week or so its not like i had to spend my life listening to my folks tell me how my baby sister was wonderful and i was garbage loosen up connie give yourself a break she looked at me doubtfully do you really mean it after what i said and everything i took her shoulders between my hands and turned her to face me i really mean it connie now how about some coffee after that we talked about mike and his job at the wastemanagement plant and young mike and his football playing and her three daughters and her youngest who was eight and so bright she really thought theyd have to try to get him to go to college although mike was nervous he thought it gave people ideas that they were better than their parents or their neighborhood the last comment made me grin to myselfi could hear ed djiak warning connie you dont want the kid turning out like victoria do youbut i listened patiently for fortyfive minutes before moving my chair back and getting to my feet it was really good to see you again vic iim glad you came by she said at the door thanks connie take it easy and say hi to mike for me i walked slowly back to my car the heel of my left shoe was rubbing on the back of my foot i savored the pain the way you do when youre feeling like crap a little pain the gods letting you expiate the damage you caused how had i learned the facts of life a little in the locker room a little from gabriella a little from our basketball coach a relaxed sensible woman except on the court how could connie have made it through junior high without one of her friends tipping her off i pictured her at fourteen tall gawky timid maybe she hadnt had any friends it was only two oclock i felt as though i had spent a whole day loading bales on the levee instead of a few hours drinking coffee with the old folks at home i felt as though id already earned a thousand dollars and i didnt even know where to start looking i put the car into gear and headed back to the mainland my socks were still damp they filled the car with the smell of beer and sweat but when i opened a window the cold air was too much for my bare toes my irritation rose with my discomfort i wanted to stop at a service station and call caroline at scrap to tell her the deal was off whatever her mother had done a quarter century ago should decently be left to rest there unfortunately i found myself making the turn to houston street when i should have been heading north to lake shore drive and freedom the block looked worse in daylight than it had at night cars were parked at all angles one was abandoned in the street black showing around the hood and windshield where a fire had burned the engine block i left the chevy in front of a hydrant if the traffic patrols were as assiduous down here as the street cleaners i could probably stay until labor day without getting a ticket i went around to the back where louisa always used to leave a spare key on the ledge above the little porch it was still there as i let myself in a curtain twitched in the house next door within minutes everyone on the block would know a strange woman was going into the djiaks i heard voices inside the house and called out to let people know i was there when i got to louisas bedroom i realized she had the television on at top volumewhat i thought were visitors was only general hospital i knocked as hard as i could the volume went down and her scratchy voice called out that you connie i opened the door me louisa howre you doing her thin face lighted in a smile well well girl come right in make yourself at home hows it going i pulled the straightbacked chair next to the bed i just went down to see connie and your folks did you now she looked at me warily ma never was one of your biggest fans whatre you up to young warshawski spreading joy and truth why did your mother hate gabriella so much louisa she shrugged bony shoulders under her cardigan gabriella never went in much for hypocrisy she didnt keep to herself how she felt about ma and pa kicking me out why did they i asked were they mad at you just for getting pregnant or did they have something special against the boythe father she didnt say anything for a few minutes but lay with her eyes on the television finally she turned back to me i could kick your ass right out the back door for poking around in this her voice was calm but i know what happened i know caroline and how she always twisted you around her little finger she called you down here didnt she wants to know who her old man was spoiled stubborn little bitch when i blew up at her she called you in isnt that right my face was hot with embarrassment but i said gently dont you think she has a right to know her mouth set in a tight line twentysix years ago a goddamn bastard tried to ruin my life i dont want caroline anywhere near him and if youre your mas daughter victoria youll do your best to keep caroline from prying into it instead of helping her out tears smarted in her eyes i love that girl youd think i was trying to beat her or kick her out on the street instead of protecting her i did my best to see she got a different shot at life than i did and im not watching that go down a sewer now you did a great job louisa but shes grown up now she doesnt need protecting cant you let her make her own decision on this goddamn you no victoria and if youre going to keep on about it get your ass out of here and dont come back her face turned red under its greenish sheen and she started coughing i was batting a thousand with the djiak women today getting them furious in descending order of age all i needed to do was tell caroline i was quitting and i could make it four for four i waited for the paroxysm to subside then led the conversation gently back to topics louisa enjoyed to her young days after caroline was born after talking to connie i could see why louisa had relished that time as one of freedom and gaiety i finally left around four all during the long drive home through the evening rush hour i listened to carolines and louisas voices debating in my head i could understand louisas strong wish to protect her privacy she was dying too which gave her desires more weight at the same time i could empathize with carolines fear of isolation and loneliness and after seeing the djiaks close up i understood why shed like to find other relatives even if her father turned out to be a real jerk he couldnt have a crazier family than the one she already knew about in the end i decided to look for the two men louisa had talked about last night and this afternoonsteve ferraro and joey pankowski theyd worked together at the xerxes plant and it was possible shed gotten the job through her lover id also try to track down the grocery clerk connie had mentionedron sowling or whoever east side was such a stable unchanging neighborhood it was possible that the same people still owned the store and that they would remember ron and louisa if ed djiak had come around playing the heavy father it might have made an indelible memory making a decision even one to compromise brings a certain amount of relief i called up an old friend and spent a pleasant evening on lincoln avenue the blister on my left heel didnt stop my dancing until past midnight the mill on the calumet in the morning i was ready early at least early for me by nine i had done my exercises skipping a run i dressed for the corporate world in a tailored navy suit that was supposed to make me look imposing and competent i steeled my heart against peppys importunate cries and headed for the south side for the third day in a row instead of following the lake down this morning i went west to an expressway that would spew me into the heart of the calumet industrial district its been over a century since the army corps of engineers and george pullman decided to turn the sprawling marshes between lake calumet and lake michigan into an industrial center it wasnt just pullman of courseandrew carnegie judge gary and a host of lesser barons all played a part working on it for sixty or seventy years they took an area about four miles square and filled it with dirt with clay dredged from lake calumet with phenols oils ferrous sulfide and thousands of other substances you not only never heard of you never want to when i got off the expressway at a rd street i had the familiar sensation of landing on the moon or returning to earth after a nuclear decimation life probably exists in the oily mud around lake calumet its just not anything youd recognize outside a microscope or a steven spielberg movie you dont see trees or grass or birds only the occasional feral dog ribs protruding eyes red with madness and hunger the xerxes plant lay in the heart of the exswamp at th street east of torrence the building was an old one put up in the early fifties from the road i could see their sign xerxes king of solvents the royal purple had faded to an indeterminate pink while the logo a crown with double xs in it had almost disappeared made of concrete blocks the plant was shaped like a giant u whose arms backed onto the calumet river that way the solvents manufactured there could flow easily onto barges and the waste products into the river they dont dump into the river anymore of coursewhen the clean water act was passed xerxes built giant lagoons to hold their wastes with clay walls providing a precarious barrier between the river and the toxins i parked my car in the gravel yard and gingerly picked my way through the oily ruts to a side entrance the strong smell reminiscent of a darkroom hadnt changed from the times i used to drive down with my dad to drop off louisa if shed missed her bus i had never been inside the plant instead of the crowded noisy cauldron of my imagination i found myself in an empty hall it was long and dimly lit with a concrete floor and cinderblock walls that went the height of the building making me feel as though i were at the bottom of a mine shaft following the arm of the u in the direction of the river i came at length to a series of cubbyholes cut into the interior wall their walls were made of that grainy glass used for shower doors i could see light and movement through them but couldnt distinguish shapes i knocked at the middle door when no one answered i turned the knob and went in i entered a time warp a long narrow room whose furnishings apparently hadnt changed since the building had gone up thirtyfive years ago olivedrab filing cabinets and gunmetal desks lined the wall across from the doors fluorescent lights hung from an old acoustictile ceiling the outer doors all opened into the room but two had been blocked shut by filing cabinets four middleaged women in purple smocks sat at the row of desks they were working on vast bales of paper with sisyphuslike doggedness making entries shifting invoices using oldfashioned adding machines with experienced stubby fingers two were smoking the smell of cigarettes mingled with the darkroom chemical scent in acrid harmony sorry to interrupt i said i was trying to find the personnel office the woman nearest the door turned heavy uninterested eyes to me theyre not hiring she went back to her papers im not looking for a job i said patiently i just want to talk to the personnel manager all four of them looked up at that weighing my suit my relative youth trying to decide if i was osha or epa state or federal the woman whod spoken jerked her faded brown hair toward a door facing the one id entered by across the plant she said laconically can i get there from inside or should i go around one of the smokers reluctantly put down her cigarette and got up ill take her she said hoarsely the others looked at the oldfashioned electric clock over their desks you going on break then a flabby woman in the back asked my guide shrugged might as well the others looked chagrined shed been faster than they to think how to squeeze five extra minutes from the system one of them pushed her chair back in a hopeful way but the first speaker said sternly ones enough to go and the wouldbe rebel scooted back to her station my guide took me out the far door beyond it lay the inferno id been expecting when i first entered the plant we were in a dimly lit room that stretched the length of the building stainlesssteel pipes ran along the ceiling and at intervals below so that you felt suspended in a steel maze that had flipped up on its side steam hissed from the overhead pipes in little puffs filling the maze with vapor large red no smoking signs hung every thirty feet along the walls enormous cauldrons were hooked to the pipes at intervals huge vats designed for a coven of giant witches the whitesuited figures tending the place might have been their familiars although the air in here actually smelled better than it did outside a number of the workers wore respirators i wondered about the majority who didnt as well as how smart it was for my guide and me to be taking the shortcut through the plant i tried asking her over the hissing and clatter of the pipes but she apparently had decided i must be an osha spy or something and refused to answer when an overhead valve let out a belch so loud that i jumped she gave a small smile but said nothing skirting the maze expertly she led me to a door diagonally across the plant from the one wed entered by we were in another narrow cinderblock hallway this one forming the base of the u she took me down it turning left to follow the second arm toward the river halfway along she stopped at a door labeled canteenemployees only mr joiners on down therethird door on your right door marked administration well thanks for your help i said but she had already disappeared into the canteen the door marked administration was also made of grainy glass but the rooms beyond it looked a little classier than the tartarus where id visited the four clerks carpeting not linoleum covered the concrete floor wallboard ceiling and wall covering created an illusion of an intimate space within the cinderblock tunnel a woman in street clothes sat behind a desk with a modern phone bank and a notsomodern electric typewriter like the clerks id stumbled on she was middleaged but her skin was firm under a generous layer of makeup and shed dressed with care if not style in a crisp pink shirtwaist with large plastic pearls at her neck and clipped to her ears you need something honey she asked id like to see mr joiner i dont have an appointment but it shouldnt take more than five minutes i dug in my handbag for a business card and handed it to her she gave a little laugh ooh honey dont expect me to pronounce that one this wasnt a loop office where receptionists give you a kgbstyle interrogation before grudgingly agreeing to find out if mr soandso can see you she picked up a phone and told mr joiner there was a girl out here asking for him she gave another little laugh and said she didnt know and hung up hes back there she said brightly pointing over her shoulder middle door three little offices were carved into the wall behind her each about eight feet square the door to the first one was open and i glanced in curiously no one was there but an array of papers and a wall covered with production charts showed it was a working office a little sign next to the open middle door announced it was home to gary joiner accounting safety and personnel i knocked briefly and went in joiner was a young man maybe thirty years old with sandy hair cut so short it merged with his pink skin he was frowning over a stack of ledger printouts but looked up when i came in his face was blotchy and he smiled at me with worried innocent eyes thanks for taking the time to see me i said briskly shaking his hand i explained who i was for personal reasonsnothing to do with xerxesim trying to find two men who worked here in the early sixties i pulled a slip of paper with joey pankowski and steve ferraros names on it from my purse and handed it to him i had a story about why i wanted to find them something dull about being witnesses to an accident but i didnt want to volunteer a reason unless he asked for it unlike goebbelss belief in the big lie i believe in the dull liemake your story boring enough and no one will question it joiner studied the paper i dont think those guys work here we only employ a hundred and twenty people so id know their names but ive only been here two years so if they go back to the sixties he turned to a filing cabinet and riffled through some files i was struck suddenly by the absence of any computer terminals either here or elsewhere in the plant most personnel or accounting officers would be able to look up employees on a screen nope of course you can see we barely have room for current files he swept an arm in an arc that knocked part of the ledger sheets to the floor he blushed vividly as he bent to pick them up if someone leaves or retires or whatever and we dont have activity on themyou know like an ongoing comp claimwe ship the files out to our warehouse in stickney want me to check for you thatd be great i got up when can i call back monday too soon he assured me monday would be finehe lived out west and could stop off at the warehouse on his way home tonight he conscientiously scribbled a note in his pocket diary inserting the scrap of paper with the names on it by the time i left the room he had already returned to his printouts the boys in the back room id had enough of the city of pollution and cramped painful lives when i got home i changed into jeans packed an overnight bag and took off with the dog to spend the weekend in michigan although the water was too cold and wild for swimming we spent two invigorating days on the beach running chasing sticks or reading depending on individual temperament when i got back to chicago late sunday i felt as though my head had been thoroughly aired out i turned the dog over to a jealous mr contreras and headed upstairs to bed id told the personnel guy at xerxes id call him in the morning but when i woke up i decided to go visit him in person if he had addresses for pankowski and ferraro i could go see them and maybe get the whole mess cleared up in one morning and if hed forgotten to stop at the stickney warehouse a personal visit would make him more responsive than a phone call it had rained overnight turning xerxess gravel yard into an oily mud puddle i parked as close to the side entrance as i could and picked my way through the sludge inside the cavernous hallway was cold i was shivering slightly by the time i reached the pebbly glass entrance to the administrative suite joiner wasnt in his office but the incurious secretary cheerfully directed me to a loading bay where he was managing a shipment i followed the hall down to the river end of the long building heavy steel doors difficult to open led to the bay beyond lay a world of dirt and clamor sliding steel doors enclosing the loading bay had been rolled open on two sides at the far end facing me the calumet lapped against the walls its brackish waters green and roiling from the downpour a cement barge lay motionless in the turbulent water a gang of dockhands was removing large barrels from it rolling them along the concrete floor with a clatter echoed and intensified by the steel walls the other door opened on a truck bay a phalanx of silver tankers was lined up there looking like menacing cows attached to a hightech milking machine as they received solvents from an overhead pipe rack their diesels vibrated filling the air with an urgent racket making it impossible to understand the shouts of the men who were moving around them i spied a group in conference around a man with a clipboard the light was too dim to make out faces but i assumed the man was joiner and headed toward him someone darted from behind a vat and seized my arm hardhat area he bellowed in my ear what are you doing here gary joiner i bawled back at him i need to talk to him he escorted me back to the entrance to wait i watched him go over to the confabbing group and tap one of the figures on the arm he jerked his head to where i was standing joiner stuck his clipboard on a barrel and trotted over to me oh he said its you yeah i agreed i was in the neighborhood and thought id stop by instead of phoning i can tell this is a bad time to talk to youwant me to wait in your office no no iuh i couldnt find anything about those men i dont think they ever worked here even in the dim light i could tell his splotchy skin was flushing i bet that warehouse is a mess i said sympathetically no one has time to look after records when youre running a manufacturing plant yes he agreed eagerly yes thats for sure im a trained investigator if you gave me some kind of authorization i could have a look through there you know see if their records were misplaced or something he flickered his eyes nervously around the room no no things arent that big a mess the guys never worked here i gotta go now he hurried away before i could say anything else i started after him but even if i could get past the foreman i couldnt think of a way to get joiner to tell me the truth i didnt know him didnt know the plant didnt have a clue as to why he would lie to me i walked slowly back down the long hall to my car absentmindedly stepping in an oozy patch that plastered sludge firmly to my right shoe i cursed loudlyid paid over a hundred dollars for those pumps as i sat in the car trying to scrape it clean i got oily sludge on my skirt feeling outraged with the world i threw the shoe petulantly into the backseat and changed back into my running gear even though caroline hadnt sent me to the plant i blamed my problems on her as i drove up torrence passing rustedout factories that looked dingier than ever from the rain i wondered if louisa had called joiner asking him not to help me if i turned up i didnt think her mind worked that way though shed told me to mind my own business and as far as she was concerned i was doing just that maybe the djiaks had fumed selfrighteously to xerxes but i thought they were too myopic to analyze how i might conduct an investigation they could only see how louisa had hurt them on the other hand if joiner didnt want to talk to me about the men because of some problem the company was having with themsay a lawsuithe would have known when i came in on friday but the first time i spoke to him hed obviously never heard of them i couldnt figure it out but the thought of lawsuits made me realize another place to look for the men neither pankowski nor ferraro was in the phone book but the old ward voter registration records might still be around i turned right on ninetyfifth street and headed into east side the ward offices were still in the tidy brick twoflat on avenue m a variety of errands may take you to your committeemans office from help with parking tickets to ways of getting on the city payroll the local cops are in and out a lot what with one thing and another and even though my dads beat had been north milwaukee avenue id come here with him more than once the sign proclaiming art jurshak alderman and freddy parma ward committeeman which covered all of the buildings exposed north wall hadnt changed and the storefront next door still housed the insurance agency that had given art his toehold in the community i knocked most of the sludge from my right shoe and put my pumps back on brushing my skirt as best i could with a kleenex i went into the building i didnt recognize any of the men lounging in the firstfloor office but judging from their age and their air of being as one with the furnishings i thought they probably went back to my childhood there were three of them one a graying man smoking the fat little cigar that used to be a democratic pols badge of office was huddled in the sports pages the other two one baldheaded the other with a white tip oneillstyle mop were talking earnestly despite their differing hairdos they looked remarkably alike their shaved faces red and jowly their forty extra pounds hanging casually over the belts of their shiny pants they glanced sidelong at me when i came in but didnt say anything i was a woman and a stranger if i was from the mayors office it would do me good to cool my heels if i was anyone else i couldnt do anything for them the two speakers were going over the rival merits of their pickup trucks chevy versus ford no one down here buys foreignbad form with three quarters of the steel industry unemployed hi i said loudly they looked up reluctantly the newspaper reader didnt stir but i saw him move the pages expectantly i pulled up a rollaway chair im a lawyer i said taking a business card from my purse im looking for two men who used to live down here maybe twenty years ago you oughta try the police cookiethis isnt the lostandfound the baldheaded one said the newspaper rattled appreciatively i slapped my forehead damn youre so right when i lived down here art used to like to help out the community shows you how times have changed i guess yeah aint nothing like it used to be baldy seemed to be the designated spokesman except the money it takes to run a campaign i said mournfully thats still pretty expensive what i hear baldy and whitey exchanged wary glances was i trying to do the honorable thing and slip them a little cash or was i part of the latest round of federal entrapment artists hoping to catch jurshak putting the squeeze on the citizenry whitey nodded fractionally baldy spoke why you looking for these guys i shrugged the usual old car accident they were in in finally settled its not a lot of money twentyfive hundred each is all not worth a lot of effort to hunt them down and if theyre retired theyve got pensions anyway i stood up but i could see the little calculators moving in their brains the newspaper reader had let michael jordans exploits drop to his knees to join in the telepathic exercise if they arranged a meeting how much could they reasonably skim make it six hundred and thatd be two apiece the other two nodded and baldy spoke again what did you say their names were i didnt and youre probably righti should have taken this to the cops to begin with i started slowly for the door hey just a minute sister cant you take a little kidding i turned around and looked uncertain well if youre sure its joey pankowski and steve ferraro whitey got up and ambled over to a row of filing cabinets he asked me to spell the names letter by painful letter moving his lips as he read the names on old voter registration forms he finally brightened here we are was the last year pankowski was registered for ferraro why dont you bring their drafts in here we can get them cashed through arts agency and see that the boys get their money we should get em to reregister and itd save you another trip down here gee thanks i said earnestly trouble is i have to get them to personally sign a release i thought for a minute and smiled tell you whatgive me their addresses and ill go see them this afternoon make sure they still live down here then next month when the claim drafts are issued i can just mail them both to you here they thought it over slowly they finally agreed again silently that there was nothing wrong with the idea whitey wrote pankowskis and ferraros addresses down in a large round hand i thanked him graciously and headed for the door again just as i was opening it a young man came in hesitantly as if unsure of his welcome he had curly auburn hair and wore a navy wool suit that enhanced the staggering beauty of his pale face i couldnt remember ever seeing a man with such perfect good lookshe might have posed for michelangelos david when he gave a diffident smile it made him look vaguely familiar hiya art baldy said your old mans downtown young art jurshak big art had never looked this good but the smile must have made the kid resemble his old mans campaign posters he flushed thats okay i just wanted to look at some ward files you dont mind do you baldy hunched an impatient shoulder youre a partner in the old mans firm you do what you want art think im going for a bite anyway coming fred the whitehaired man and the newspaper reader both got up food sounded like a swell idea to me even a detective looking at a meager fee has to eat some of the time the four of us left young art alone in the middle of the room fratesis restaurant was still where i remembered it on the corner of ninetyseventh and ewing gabriella had disapproved of them because they cooked southern italian instead of her familiar dishes of the piedmont but the food was good and it used to be a place to go for special occasions today there wasnt much of a lunchtime crowd the decorations around the fountain in the middle of the floor which used to enchant me as a child had been allowed to decay i recognized old mrs fratesi behind the counter but felt the place had grown too sad for me to identify myself to her i ate a salad made of iceberg lettuce and an old tomato and a frittata that was surprisingly light and carefully seasoned in the little ladies room at the back i got the most noticeable chunks of dirt off my skirt i didnt look fabulous but maybe that suited the neighborhood better i paid the tab a modest four dollars and left i didnt know you could get bread and butter in chicago for under four dollars anymore all during lunch id turned over various approaches to pankowski and ferraro in my mind if they were married wives at home children they wouldnt want to hear about louisa djiak or maybe they would maybe it would bring back the happy days of yore i finally decided id have to play it by ear steve ferraros home was nearer to the restaurant so i went there first it was another of the endless array of east side bungalows but a little seedier than most of its neighbors the porch hadnt been swept recently my critical housekeeping eye noted and the glass on the storm door could have done with a washing a long interval passed after i rang the bell i pushed it again and was about to leave when i heard the inner door being unlocked an old woman stood there short wispyhaired and menacing yes she said in one harsh heavily accented syllable scusi i said cerco il signor ferraro her face lightened marginally and she answered in italian what did i want him for an old lawsuit that might finally be going to pay out to him only or to his heirs to him only i said firmly in italian but my heart sank her next words confirmed my misgivings il signor ferraro was her son her only child and he had died in no he had never married he had talked once about a girl in the place where he worked but madre de dio the girl already had a baby she was relieved when nothing came of it i gave her my card with a request to call me if she thought of anything else and set out for green bay avenue without any high expectations again a woman answered the door a younger one this time perhaps even my age but too heavy and worn out for me to be certain she gave me the cold fish eye reserved for life insurance salesmen and jehovahs witnesses and prepared to shut the door on me im a lawyer i said quickly im looking for joey pankowski some lawyer she said contemptuously youd better ask in queen of angels cemeterythats where hes spent the last two years at least thats his story knowing that bastard he probably pretended to die so he could go off with his latest little chickadee i blinked a little under her fire im sorry mrs pankowski its an old case thats been settled rather slowly a matter of some twentyfive hundred dollars not really worth bothering you about her blue eyes almost disappeared into her cheeks not so fast lady you got twentyfive hundred i deserve that money i suffered enough with that bastard god knows and then when he died there wasnt even any insurance i dont know i said fussily his oldest child little joey she said promptly born august in the army now i could hold it for him till he gets home next january i was told there was another child a girl born in know anything about her that bastard she screamed that lying cheating bastard he screwed me when he was alive and now hes dead hes screwing me still so you know about the girl i asked startled at the thought that my search might be over so easily she shook her head i know joey though he could of had a dozen kids before he got me pregnant with little joey if this girl thinks shes the first all i can say is you better run an ad in the little calumet times i took a twenty from my purse and held it casually we could probably advance something from the settlement do you know anyone who could tell me for certain if he had any children before little joey a brother maybe or his priest priest she cackled i had to pay extra just to get his bones into queen of angels she was thinking hard though trying not to look directly at the money at last she said you know who might know doc at the plant he talked to them every spring took their blood their histories knew more about them than god joey once said she couldnt tell me his name if joey ever mentioned it she couldnt be expected to remember it after all this time could she but she took the money with dignity and told me to come back if i was in the neighborhood i dont expect to see any more of it she added with unexpected cheerfulness not from what i know of that bastard if my old man hadnt made him he wouldnt of married me and between you and me id of been better off the good doctor louisa and caroline were returning from the dialysis center when i stopped by i helped caroline maneuver louisa into a wheelchair for the short ride up the front walk getting her up the five steep steps took ten minutes of patient labor while she leaned heavily on my shoulder to hoist herself up each rise then rested until she had enough wind for the next one by the time we had her settled in her bed her breathing had turned to shallow stertorous gasps i panicked a little at the sound and at the purplish tinge beneath her waxy green skin but caroline treated her with cheerful efficiency giving her oxygen and massaging her bony shoulders until she could breathe on her own again however much caroline might irritate me i could only admire her unflagging goodwill in looking after her mother she left me alone with louisa while she went off to make herself a snack louisa was drifting into sleep but she remembered the xerxes doctor with a hoarse little chuckle chigwell they called him chigwell the chigger because he was always sucking their blood i waited until she was sleeping soundly before releasing my hand from the grasp of her bony fingers caroline was hovering in the dining room her little body vibrating with anxiety ive wanted to call you every day but ive forced myself not to especially last week when ma told me youd been by and shed ordered you not to look for him she was eating a peanutbutter sandwich and the words came through thickly have you found out anything i shook my head i tracked down the two guys she remembers best but theyre both dead its possible one of them might have been your father but i dont have any real way of knowing my only hope is the company doctor he apparently used to compile copious records on the employees and people tell their doctor things they might not say to anyone else theres also a clerk who worked at the corner grocery twentyfive years ago but connie couldnt remember his name she caught my doubtful tone you dont think any of these guys might have been the one i pursed my lips trying to put my doubts into words steve ferraro had wanted to marry louisa baby and all that sounded as though he knew her after carolines birth not before joey pankowski did seem like the kind of person who could have gotten louisa pregnant and gone off unconcerned which would fit that repressive household connies and her total ignorance of sexshe might well have turned to some happygolucky type but in that case why be so upset about it now unless shed absorbed so much of the djiaks fundamental fear of sex that the very memory of it terrified her but that didnt fit my memories of louisa as a young woman i dont know i finally said helplessly it just has the wrong kind of feel to it i debated with myself a minute then added i think you need to prepare yourself for failure my failure i mean if i cant learn anything from the doctor or track down this clerk im going to have to throw it in she scowled fiercely im counting on you vic lets not play that record again right now caroline im beat ill call you in a day or two and well take it from there it was almost four time for the evening rush hour to congeal the traffic it was close to fivethirty before id oozed the twentysome miles home when i got there mr contreras stopped me to ask about the burrs id allowed the sacred dog to collect in her golden tail the dog herself came out and expressed herself ready for a run i listened to both with such patience as i could muster but after five minutes of his nonstop flow i left abruptly in midsentence and headed for my place on the third floor i took off my suit and left it on the entryway floor where id be sure to remember it for the cleaners in the morning i didnt know what to do about the shoe so i left it with the suitmaybe the cleaners would know a place that could resurrect it while i ran a bath i pulled my stack of city and suburban directories from the floor under the piano no chigwell was listed in the metropolitan area naturally hed probably died himself or retired to majorca i poured an inch of whiskey and stomped into the bathroom while lying half submerged in the oldfashioned tub it occurred to me that he might be in the medical directories i hoisted myself out of the tub and went into the bedroom to call lotty herschel she was just getting ready to leave the clinic she runs near the corner of irving park and damen cant it wait until the morning victoria yeah it can wait i just want to get this monster out of my life as fast as possible i sketched caroline and louisas story as quickly as i could if i can run this chigwell down i only have one other lead i need to look into and then i can get back to the real world wherever that is she said dryly you dont know this mans first name or his speciality do you of course not industrial medicine probably hmm i could hear her rustling through the pages of a book chan chessick childress no chigwell i dont have a complete directory though max probably doeswhy dont you give him a call and why do you let this caroline run you through hoops you are manipulated by people only when you allow yourself to be my dear on that cheering note she hung up i tried max loewenthal who was executive director of beth israel hospital but he had gone home for the day as any rational person would have only lotty stayed at her clinic until six and of course a detectives work is never done even if youre only willingly responding to the manipulations of an old neighbor i poured the rest of the whiskey down the sink and changed into my sweats when im in a febrile mood the best thing to do is exercise i picked up peppy from mr contrerasneither he nor the dog was capable of harboring a grievance by the time peppy and i returned home panting id run the discontent out of my system the old man fried some pork chops for me and we sat drinking his foul grappa and talking until eleven i reached max easily in the morning he listened with his usual courteous urbanity to my saga put me on hold for five minutes and came back with the news that chigwell was retired but living in suburban hinsdale max even had his address and his first name which was curtis hes seventynine vi if he doesnt talk willingly go easy on him he finished only half joking thanks a whole bunch max ill try to restrain my more animal impulses but old men and children generally bring out the worst in me he laughed and hung up hinsdale is an old town about twenty miles west of the loop whose tall oaks and gracious homes were gradually being accreted by urban sprawl its not chicagolands trendiest address but theres an aura of established selfassurance about the place hoping to fit into its genteel atmosphere i put on a black dress with a full skirt and gold buttons a leather portfolio completed the ensemble i looked at my navy suit on the entryway floor as i left but decided it would keep another day when you go from the city to the north or west suburbs the first thing you notice is the quiet cleanness after a day in south chicago i felt id stepped into paradise even though the trees were barren of leaves and the grass matted and brown everything was raked and tidied for spring i had total faith that the brown mats would turn to green but couldnt imagine what it would take to create life in the sludge around the xerxes plant chigwell lived on an older street near the center of town the house was a twostory neogeorgian structure whose wood siding gleamed white in the dull day its wellkept yellow shutters and a sprinkling of old trees and bushes created an air of stately harmony a screened porch faced the street i followed flagstones through the shrubs around the side to the entrance and rang the bell after a few minutes the door opened thats the second thing you notice in the burbswhen you ring the bell people open the doors they dont peer through peepholes and undo bolts an old woman in a severe navy dress stood frowning in the doorway the scowl seemed to be a habitual expression not aimed at me personally i gave a brisk nononsense smile mrs chigwell miss chigwell do i know you no maam im a professional investigator and id like to speak with dr chigwell he didnt tell me he was expecting anyone well maam we like to make our inquiries unannounced if people have too much time to think about them their answers often seem forced i took a card from my bag and handed it to her moving forward a few steps v i warshawski financial investigative services just tell the doctor im here i wont keep him more than half an hour she didnt invite me in but grudgingly took the card and moved off into the interior of the house i looked around at the blankwindowed houses next door and across the street the third thing you notice in the suburbs is you might as well be on the moon in a city or smalltown neighborhood curtains would flutter as the neighbors tried to see what strange woman was visiting the chigwells then telephone calls or exchanges in the laundromat yes their niece you know the one whose mother moved to arizona all those years ago here not a curtain stirred no shrill voices betokened preschoolers recreating war and peace i had an uneasy feeling that with all its noise and grime i preferred city life miss chigwell rematerialized in the doorway dr chigwell has gone out thats very sudden isnt it when do you expect him back ihe didnt say it will be a long while then ill wait a long while i said peaceably would you like to invite me inside or would you prefer me to wait in my car you should leave she said her frown deepening he doesnt want to talk to you how can you know that maam if hes away you havent spoken to him about me i know who my brother does and does not wish to see and he would have told me if he wanted to see you she shut the door as forcefully as she could given both their ages and the thick carpeting underneath i returned to my car and moved it to where it was clearly visible from the front door wniv was playing a cycle of hugo wolf songs i leaned back in the seat my eyes half closed listening to kathleen battles golden voice wondering what there was about talking to an investigator that would fluster curtis chigwell in the half hour i waited i saw one person go down the street i began feeling as though i were on a movie set not part of a human community at all when miss chigwell appeared on the flagstone walk she moved determinedly to the car her thin body as rigid as an umbrella frame and as bony i courteously got out i must ask you to leave young woman i shook my head public property maam theres no law against my being here im not playing loud music or selling dope or doing anything else that the law might construe as a nuisance if you dont drive away now im going to call the police as soon as im back inside i admired her courage to be seventysomething and confront a young stranger takes a lot of guts i could see the fear mingling with the determination in her pale eyes im an officer of the court maam i would be happy to explain to the police why i want to speak to yourbrother is it that was only partially true any licensed attorney is an officer of the court but i much prefer never talking to the police especially suburban cops who hate urban detectives on principle fortunately miss chigwell impressed i hoped by my professional demeanor didnt demand a badge or a certificate she compressed her lips until they almost disappeared into her angular face and went back to the house i had barely settled back in my car when she returned to the walk and beckoned me vigorously when i joined her at the side of the house she said abruptly hell see you he was here all along of course i dont like telling his lies for him but after all these years its hard to start saying no hes my brother my twin so i got into too many bad habits too long ago but you dont want to hear all that my admiration for her increased but i didnt know how to express it without sounding patronizing i followed her silently into the house we went through a passageway that looked onto the garage a dinghy was leaned neatly on its side next to the open door beyond it was a tidy array of gardening tools ms chigwell whisked me along to the living room it was not large but gracefully proportioned with chintz furniture facing a rosemarble fireplace while she went for her brother i prowled around a bit a handsome old clock stood in the center of the mantel the kind that has an enamel face and brass pendulum on either side of it were porcelain figures shepherd girls lute players a few old family photos stood in the recessed shelves in the comer one showing a little girl in a starched sailor dress standing proudly with her father in front of a sailboat when ms chigwell returned with her brother it was obvious theyd been arguing his cheeks softer than her angular face were flushed and his lips were compressed she started to introduce me but he cut her off sharply i dont need you to oversee my affairs clio im perfectly able to look after myself id like to see you do so then she said bitterly if youre in some kind of trouble with the law i want to hear what it is now not next month or whenever you feel brave enough to tell me about it im sorry i said i seem to have caused a problem most inadvertently theres no trouble with the law that i know of miss chigwell merely i need some information on some people who used to work at the xerxes plant in south chicago i turned to her brother my name is v i warshawski dr chigwell im a lawyer and a private investigator and ive been retained as the result of a lawsuit whose settlement leaves some money to the estate of joey pankowski when he ignored my outstretched hand i looked around and chose a comfortable armchair to sit in dr chigwell remained standing in his ramrod posture he resembled his sister joey pankowski used to work at the xerxes plant i continued but he died in now theres some question that louisa djiak who also worked there has a child whose father he may have been that child is also entitled to a share of the settlement but ms djiak is very ill and her mind wanderswe cant get a clear answer from her as to who the father is i cant help you young lady i have no recollection of any of these names well i understand you took blood and medical histories from all the employees every spring for a number of years if you would just go back and look at your records you might find that he cut me off with a violence that surprised me i dont know who youve been talking to but thats an absolute lie i wont stand to be harassed and harangued in my own house now you get out right now or ill call the police and if youre an officer of the court you can explain that to them in jail he turned without waiting for a reply and marched from the room clio chigwell watched him leave her scowl deeper than ever youll have to go he did the tests i said why is he so upset i dont know anything about it but you cant ask him to violate his patients confidentiality now youd better leave unless you do want to speak with the police i got up as nonchalantly as i could under the circumstances you have my card i said to her at the door if something occurs to you give me a call lifestyles of the rich and famous a light drizzle had started to fall i sat in the car staring at the windshield watching the rain break up on the greasy glass after a while i turned on the engine hoping to coax a little heat from the noisy motor was it the pankowski name that had rattled chigwell so or was it me had joiner phoned him telling him to beware polish detectives and the questions they bring no that couldnt be right if that was the case chigwell would never have agreed to see me at all and anyway joiner wouldnt know chigwell the doctor was almost eighty he must have been long retired when joiner started at the plant two years ago so it had to have been the mention either of pankowski or louisa but why i wondered with growing uneasiness what caroline knew that she hadnt bothered to tell me i remembered in vivid detail the winter she had asked me to fight an eviction notice served on louisa after a week of running between courts and landlord i saw an article in the suntimes on teens who make a difference it featured a glowing sixteenyearold caroline and the soup kitchen shed used the rent money to set up that was the last cry for help id answered from her for ten years and i was beginning to think i should have let it go for twenty i fished around on the backseat for a kleenex and found a towel id used at the beach last summer after wiping a peephole in the windshield i finally put the car into gear and headed for the expressway i was torn between calling caroline to tell her the deal was off and the elephant childs satiable curiosity to find out what had rattled chigwell so badly in the end i did nothing when i had fought my way through the noontime loop traffic to my office messages from several clients awaited meinquiries id let slide while i mucked around in carolines problem one was from an old customer who wanted help with computer security i referred him to a friend of mine whos a computer expert and tackled the other two these were routine financial investigations my bread and butter it felt good to work on something where i could identify both problem and solution and i spent the afternoon burrowing through files in the state of illinois building i returned to my office around seven to type the reports they were worth five hundred dollars to me since both clients paid promptly i wanted to get the invoices into the mail i was rattling along on my old standard olympia when the phone rang i looked at my watch almost eight wrong number caroline maybe lotty i picked up the phone on the third ring right before the answering service kicked in ms warshawski it was an old mans voice fragile and quavering yes i said i want to speak to ms warshawski please for all its quavering the voice was confident used to managing people on the phone speaking i said as patiently as i could i had missed lunch and was dreaming of a steak and whiskey mr gustav humboldt would like to see you when would it be convenient to schedule an appointment can you tell me what he wants to see me about i backspaced and used whiteout to cover a typo its getting harder to find correction fluid and typewriter ribbons in these days of word processors so i capped the bottle carefully to save it i understand its a confidential matter miss if youre free this evening he could see you now or tomorrow afternoon at three just a minute while i check my schedule i put the phone down and got whos who in chicago commerce from the top of my filing cabinet gustav humboldts listing covered a column and a half of sixpoint type born in bremerhaven in emigrated in chairman and chief stockholder of humboldt chemical founded in with plants in forty countries sales of billion assets of billion director of this member of that headquarters in chicago of course id passed the humboldt building a million times walking down madison street an old nononsense structure without the attentiongetting lobbies of the modem giants i picked up the phone i could make it around ninethirty tonight i offered that will be fine ms warshawski the address is the roanoke building twelfth floor ill tell the doorman to look out for your car the roanoke was an old dowager on oak street one of six or seven buildings bordering the strip between the lake and michigan avenue all had gone up in the early decades of this century providing housing for the mccormicks and swifts and other riffraff nowadays if you had a million dollars to invest in housing and were related to the british royal family they might let you in after a year or two of intensive checking i set a speed record for twofinger typing and got reports and invoices into their envelopes by eightthirty id have to forgo whiskey and steaki didnt want to be logy for an encounter with someone who could set me up for lifebut there was time for soup and a salad at the little italian restaurant up wabash from my office especially if i didnt have to worry about parking at the other end in the restaurant bathroom i saw that my hair was frizzing around my head from this mornings drizzle but at least the black dress still looked tidy and professional i put on a little light makeup and retrieved my car from the underground garage it was just ninethirty when i pulled into the semicircle under the roanokes green awning the doorman resplendent in matching green livery bent his head courteously while i gave him my name ah yes ms warshawski his voice was fruity his tone avuncular mr humboldt is expecting you if youll just give me your keys he led me into the lobby most modem buildings going up for the rich these days feature glass and chrome lobbies with monstrous plants and hangings but the roanoke had been built when labor was cheaper and more skillful the floor was an intricate mosaic of geometric shapes and the woodpaneled walls were festooned with egyptian figurines an old man also in green livery was sitting on a chair next to some wooden double doors he got up when the doorman and i came in young lady for mr humboldt fred ill let them know shes here if youll take her on up fred unlocked the doorno remotecontrol clicks hereand took me to the elevator at a stately tread i followed him into a roomy cage with a floral carpet on the floor and a plushupholstered bench against the back wall i sat casually on the bench crossing my legs as though personal elevator service were an everyday occurrence with me the elevator opened onto what might have been the foyer of a mansion graywhite marble tiles showing streaks of pink were covered here and there by throw rugs that had probably been made in persia when the ayatollahs grandfather was a baby the hall seemed to form an atrium with the elevator at its center but before i could tiptoe down to a marble statue in the left corner to explore the carved wooden door in front of me opened an old man stood there in morning dress his scalp showed pink through wisps of fine white hair he inclined his head briefly a token bow but his blue eyes were frosty and remote rising to the solemnity of the occasion i fished in my bag and handed him a card without speaking very good miss mr humboldt will see you now if youll follow me he walked slowly either from age or from some concept of a butlers proper gait giving me time to gawk in what i trusted was a discreet fashion about halfway along the length of the building he opened a door on the left and held it for me to enter looking at the books lining three walls and the opulent redleather furniture in front of a fireplace in the fourth my keen intuition told me we were in the library a florid man heavy without being corpulent sat in front of the fire with a newspaper as the door opened he put the paper down and got to his feet ms warshawski how good of you to come on such short notice he held out a firm hand not at all mr humboldt he motioned me to a leather armchair on the other side of the fire from him i knew from the whos who entry that he was eightyfour but he could have said sixty without anyone raising an eyebrow his thick hair still showed a touch of pale yellow and his blue eyes were sharp and clear in a face almost free of wrinkles anton bring us some cognacyou drink cognac ms warshawskiand then well be fine on our own the butler disappeared for perhaps two minutes during which my host courteously made sure the fire wasnt too hot for me anton returned with a decanter and snifters poured carefully placed the decanter in the center of a small table at humboldts right hand fiddled with the fire tongs i realized he was as curious as i about what humboldt wanted and was trying to think of ways to linger but humboldt dismissed him briskly ms warshawski i have an awkward matter to discuss and i beg your indulgence if i dont do so with maximum grace im an industrialist after all an engineer more at home with chemicals than beautiful young women he had come to america as a grown man even after close to sixty years a mild accent remained i smiled sardonically when the owner of a tenbilliondollar empire starts apologizing for his style its time to hold tightly to your purse and count all your fingers im sure you underestimate yourself sir he gave me a quick sidelong glance and decided that warranted a barking laugh i see you are a careful woman ms warshawski i sipped the cognac it was staggeringly smooth please let him call me for frequent consultations i begged the golden liquid i can be reckless when i have to mr humboldt good thats very good so youre a private investigator and do you find it a job that allows you to be both careful and reckless i like being my own boss and i dont have the desire to do it on the scale youve achieved your clients speak very highly of you i was talking to gordon firth just today and he mentioned how grateful the ajax board was for your efforts there im delighted to hear it i said sinking back in the chair and sipping some more gordon does a lot of my insurance of course of course gustav calls gordon and tells him he needs a thousand tons of insurance and gordon says sure and thirty young men and women work eightyhour weeks for a month putting it all together and then the two shake hands genially at the standard club and thank each other for their trouble so i thought i might be able to help you out with one of your inquiries after listening to gordons glowing report i knew you were intelligent and discreet and not likely to abuse information given you in confidence with enormous effort i kept myself from bolting up in the chair and spilling cognac all over my skirt its hard for me to imagine where our spheres of activity intersect sir by the way this is most excellent cognac its like drinking a fine single malt at that humboldt roared with genuine laughter beautiful my dear ms warshawski beautiful to take my news so calmly and then praise my liquor with the most subtle of insults i wish i could persuade you to cease being your own boss i smiled and put the snifter down i love compliments as much as the next person and its been a tough dayi can use them but im beginning to wonder who is meant to be helping whom not that it wouldnt be a privilege to be of service to you he nodded i think we can be of service to each other you asked where our spheres of activity intersecta fine expression and the answer lies in south chicago i thought for a minute of course i should have known xerxes had to be part of humboldt chemical it was just being so used to thinking of it as part of my childhoods landscape that i hadnt made the connection when anton phoned i casually mentioned it and humboldt nodded again very good ms warshawski the chemical industry made a great contribution to the war effort the second world war im talking about of course and the war effort in turn prompted research and development on a grand scale many of the products that all of usi mean dow ciba imperial chemical all of usmake our bread and butter on today can be traced to research we did then xerxine was one of humboldts great discoveries one of the dichlorethanes the last one i was able to devote time to myself he stopped himself with a turnedup hand youre not a chemist that wont be of interest to you but we called the product xerxes because of the xerxine of course and opened the south chicago plant in my wife was an artist she designed the logo the crown on the purple background he stopped to offer me the decanter i didnt want to appear greedy on the other hand to refuse might have seemed rude well that south chicago plant was the start of humboldts international expansion and its always meant a great deal to me so even though i no longer concern myself with the daytoday running of the companyi have grandchildren ms warshawski and an old man fancies himself reliving his youth with young children but my people know i care about that plant so when a beautiful young detective begins poking around asking questions they naturally tell me i shook my head im sorry if they needlessly alarmed you sir im not poking around in the plant merely trying to trace some men as part of a personal inquiry for some reason your mr joinerthe personnel managerwanted me to believe they never worked for you so you found dr chigwell his deep voice had sunk to a rumbling murmur difficult to make out who was even more electrified by my questions than young joiner i couldnt help wondering if he had a personal agenda of his own some transactions of his youth that weigh on his oldage conscience humboldt held his snifter so that he could look through it toward the fire how people rush to protect you when you are old and they want you to know they care about your interests he spoke to the glass and what problems they needlessly cause its a constant issue with my daughter one of natures worriers he turned back to me we had a problem with these men with pankowski and ferraro enough of a problem that i even know their names you see out of fiftysome thousand employees worldwide they engaged in an attempted sabotage of the plant of the product actually changing the balance in the mixture so that we had highly unstable vapor and a residue that stopped up the flow pipes we had to shut the plant down three times in to clean everything it took a year of investigation to find out who lay behind it they and two other men were fired and they then sued us for wrongful dismissal the whole thing was a nightmare a terrible nightmare he grimaced and drained his glass so when you came around my people naturally assumed you were egged on by some unscrupulous lawyer trying to open these old wounds but i knew from my friend gordon firth that that could not be so so i have taken a risk invited you here explained the whole story to you and i hope i am right that you are not going to run back to some lawyer saying i tried to suborn you or whatever the expression is suborn will do admirably i said finishing my own glass and shaking my head at the proffered decanter and i can safely assure you that my inquiries have nothing to do with any suit these men might have been involved in it is a purely personal matter well if it involves xerxes employees i can see that you get whatever assistance you need i dont like revealing my clients business especially not to strangers but in the end i decided to tell himit was the easiest way to get help not the whole story of course not gabriella and the babysitting and carolines insistent manipulativeness and the angry djiaks but louisa dying and caroline wanting to find out who her father was and louisa not wanting to tell im european and oldfashioned he said when i finished i dont like the girl not wanting to respect her mothers wishes but if you are committed you are committed and you think she might have said something to chigwell because he was the plant doctor ill call and ask him he probably wont want to talk to you himself but my secretary will phone you in a few days with the information that was a dismissal i slid forward to the edge of the chair so that i could stand without bracing my arms on the sides and was pleased to find that i moved smoothly without the brandy affecting me if i could make it out the front door without bumping into a priceless art object i could easily handle the drive home i thanked humboldt for the brandy and his help he turned it aside with another chuckle its a pleasure for me ms warshawski to talk to an attractive young woman and one who is brave enough to stand her ground with an old lion you must come again when you are in the neighborhood anton was hovering outside the library to escort me to the door im sorry i said when we reached the entryway i promised not to tell he stiffly pretended not to hear me and summoned the elevator with frigid aloofness i wasnt sure what to do about the doorman and my car but when i tentatively displayed a fivedollar bill he caused it to vanish while tenderly helping me into the chevy i devoted the drive home to thinking of reasons why i was better off as a pi than a billionaire chemist the list was much shorter than the drive fire when ready i was drowning in a sea of thick gray xerxine i was choking while gustav humboldt and caroline stood talking earnestly on the shore ignoring my cries for help i woke up at fourthirty sweaty and panting too roused by the dream to go back to sleep i finally got out of bed when it started to get light it wasnt cold in the bedroom but i was shivering i pulled a sweatshirt from the pile next to my bed and wandered around the apartment trying to find something to turn my mind to i picked out a scale on the piano but stopped after one it would be unfair to the neighbors to work on my rusty voice at this hour of the morning i moved to the kitchen to make coffee but lost interest after washing out the pot my four rooms normally seem open and spacious to me but now they were making me feel cramped the jumble of books papers and clothes which usually looks homelike began to appear shameful and squalid dont tell me youve been infected by djiakism i scolded myself crossly next thing youll be on your hands and knees in the lobby scrubbing the floor every morning finally i pulled on jeans and my running shoes and went out the dog recognized my step behind the locked firstfloor door and let out a little yelping bark i would have liked her company but i didnt have a key to mr contrerass place i walked over to the lake alone unable to work up energy for running it was another gray day i could tell the sun was rising only by a change in the intensity behind the clouds on the eastern horizon under the sullen sky the lake resembled the thick gray liquid of my nightmare i stared at it trying to reason away my lingering unease trying to lose myself in the changing patterns and colors of the water early as it was joggers were already on the lake path getting in their miles before putting on pinstripe and panty hose for the day they looked like the hollow men each wrapped in a cocoon of sound from his private radio their faces blank their isolation chilling i dug my hands deep into my pockets shivering and turned toward home i stopped on the way for breakfast at the chesterton hotel its a residential hotel for wellheeled widows the little hungarian restaurant where you can get cappuccino and croissants caters to their slower pace and better manners as i stirred the foam in my second cappuccino i kept wondering why gustav humboldt had summoned me to his presence yes he didnt want me nosing around in his plant no executive likes that and yes he had the inside dope on pankowski and ferraro but the chairman of the board calling in the lowly detective to tell her in person despite all his talk of gordon firth id never even seen the ajax chairman in the course of three investigations involving the insurance company heads of multinational corporations even if theyre eightyfour and dote on their grandchildren have layers and layers of underlings to do that kind of job for them last night my vanity had been tickled the invitation alone was exciting let alone the rarefied surroundings and incredible brandy i hadnt stopped to wonder about his comradely flow of information but maybe i should and what of little caroline what did she know that she hadnt been telling me that louisas two pals had been fired perhaps that louisa herself had been involved in the efforts to sabotage the plant maybe gustav humboldt had been her lover long ago and had stepped in to protect her now it would explain his personal involvement maybe he was carolines father and she was due a gigantic inheritance out of which a modest fee to me would be eminently feasible as my speculations grew more ludicrous my mood lightened i headed home much faster than id left passing the secondfloor tenants on their way to work with a good morning almost cheery enough for a flight attendant i was getting really sick of panty hose and pumps but i put them on again so as to make a favorable impression at the department of labor a friend of mine from law school worked for their chicago office he might be able to tell me about the sabotage and if the men really had been suing humboldt for wrongful dismissal my red shoes were still in the front hallway with my navy suit if eventually why not eventually i scooped them up and took off by the time i found a place to park near the federal building it was after ten the loop has been attacked by a development fervor the last few years that has turned the business district into a jammed honking copy of new york many of the public garages have been scrapped to make way for skyscrapers taller than city code permits so we have four times the traffic we used to vying for half as much parking my temper wasnt the best by the time i made it to the sixteenth floor of the dirksen building it wasnt helped by the attitude of the receptionist who looked briefly my way before returning to her typing with the curt announcement that jonathan michaels wasnt available is he dead i snapped out of town under indictment she looked at me coldly i said hes not available and thats all you need to know the door leading to the offices was kept locked the receptionist or someone on the other side could buzz you in but this woman clearly wasnt going to let me wander back among the cubicles to find jonathan i sat in one of the plastic straightbacked chairs and told her id wait suit yourself she snapped typing furiously when a businesssuited black man came in she made a big play of friendliness with him cooing over him and flirting a little she flashed him a sugary smile and a wish for a nice day while releasing the lock when i went in behind him she was too taken aback even to squawk my escort raised his brows at me you belong in here yeah i said i pay your salary and im here to talk to jonathan michaels about it he looked momentarily startled trying to figure out which washington bureaucrat i might be then my meaning dawned on him and he said well maybe youd better wait outside until gloria tells you to go in since she never bothered to find out my name or my business i cant imagine her interest in serving the taxpaying public is enormous i knew where jonathans office was and quickened my pace to move ahead of my attendant i could hear him speeding up on the carpet behind me calling missuh miss as i opened the comer door jonathan was standing in the outer office next to his secretarys desk when he saw me his rosy face lightened into a smile oh its you vic i grinned at him gloria call to tell you the weather underground was heading in to smash up your office and tear your golden hair out by the roots whats left of it he said plaintively he had gone partly bald which made him look like a youthful father william jonathan michaels had been a quiet idealist in my law school class while students like melocked in our liberal straitjackets as one conservative jd put itrushed off to become public defenders jonathan had surveyed social issues quietly he had clerked in a federal circuit court for two years and then moved to the department of labor he was now senior counsel for the chicago district he took me into his office and shut the door ive got a dozen attorneys from st louis in the conference room can you do your business in thirty seconds i explained fast i want to know if theres any trailthrough osha the nlrb the contract compliance people or maybe justiceof ferraro and pankowski the sabotage and the suit i wrote their names on one of his yellow pads and added louisa djiak she might have been a party i dont want to tell you the whole story nowthere isnt timebut i had the news personally from gustav humboldt hes not anxious to have it made public jonathan picked up his phone while i was still talking myra get dutton over here will you ive got a research job he spelled it out in a few words and hung up vic next time do me a big favor and do what the ad saysphone first i kissed his cheek i will jonathan but only if i can afford to spend two days playing phone tag before i talk to you ciao ciao bambino he was back in the conference room before i had made it out the outer door when gloria saw me return to the reception area she started typing furiously again in a spirit of malice i waited outside for a minute then peered around the door she had picked up the heraldstar get busy i said sternly the taxpayers expect value for their money she gave me a glance of loathing i went to the elevator laughing lightly to myself i hope someday to outgrow such juvenile pleasures i walked the four blocks to my office when i checked in with my answering service i learned that nancy cleghorn had been trying to reach me once early this morning when i was out feeling sorry for myself along the lakefront and again ten minutes ago in the tiresome way that people have she hadnt bothered to leave a phone number i sighed aggrievedly and pulled my city directory from under a stack of papers on the windowsill the wabash el runs under my windows and the directory had a fine layer of soot on it which i smeared on the front of my green wool dress nancy was the environmental affairs director for carolines community development group i looked up scrap which was a waste of time since of course it was under south chicago reawakening project and that was a waste of time because nancy wasnt in she hadnt been in all day and they didnt know when to expect her and no they wouldnt give me her home phone number especially if i said i was her sister because everyone knew she had four brothers and if i didnt stop harassing them theyd get the police can you at least take a message without bringing the police into it i mean i spelled my name slowly twice not that it would make any differenceit would still probably come out as watchski or some other hideous mutation the secretary said shed see nancy got the message in that tone that tells you theyre trashing the paper as soon as you hang up i turned back to the directory nancy wasnt listed but ellen cleghorn was still living on muskegon talking to nancys mother made a welcome change to the way id been greeted today she remembered me perfectly loved reading about me when my cases made the papers wished id come down and have dinner with them sometime when i was in the neighborhood nancy bought herself a place in south shore one of those huge old mansions thats falling to bits shes fixing it up on her own kind of a big place for a single woman but she likes it she gave me the number and hung up with repeated dinner invitations nancy wasnt home i gave it up if she wanted me that badly shed call again i looked at the dirt on the front of my dress my suit was still in the car if i drove home now i could change into jeans dump the lot at the cleaners and spend the rest of the afternoon on myself it was close to fiveas i was happily working my way through the syncope of in dem schatten meiner locken without kathleen battles voicewhen the phone rang i left the piano unwillingly and was even sorrier as soon as i picked up the receiver it was caroline vic i need to talk to you talk away i said resignedly in person i mean her husky voice was urgent but it always was you want to drive up to lake view be my guest but i aint trekking down to south chicago this afternoon oh fuck you vic can you ever talk to me without being a total snot can it caroline you want to talk to me speak otherwise im going back to what i was doing when you interrupted there was a pause during which i could picture her gentian eyes smoldering then she said so quickly i almost didnt understand i want you to stop i was confused for a minute caroline if you ever realized how upsetting i find it to have you spin me around in circles you might understand why i sound like a snot to you not that she said impatiently stop trying to find my father i mean what i shouted two days ago you were batting your baby blues and telling me pathetically you counted on me that was then i didnt see theni didnt knowanyway thats why i need to see you in person you cant possibly understand over the phone if youre going to get so honked off just dont do any more looking until i can talk to you in person for gods sake there was no denying the thread of panic in her voice i pulled a string from the fringe where my left knee was poking through the denim she knew about pankowski and the plant sabotage i pulled another she didnt know youre too late babe i finally said you mean youve found him nope i mean the investigation is beyond your power to stop vic i hired you i can fire you she said with terrifying ferocity nope i repeated steadily you could have last week but the investigation has moved into a new phase you cant fire me i dont mean that you can fire me of course you just have what i mean is you may choose not to pay me but you cant stop my inquiries now and the top one first on the list is why you didnt tell me about ferraro and pankowski i dont even know who they are she shouted ma never talks about her old lovers to me shes like youshe thinks im a fucking baby not about their being her lovers about the sabotage and their getting fired and the lawsuit i dont know what in hell youre talking about v i knowitall warshawski and i dont have to listen to it as far as im concerned vi stands for vicious insect which i would use raid on if i had any she slammed the phone in my ear it was the childish insult she ended on that convinced me she really didnt know about the two men i also realized suddenly that i had no idea why she was firing me i scowled and rang up scrap but she refused to come to the phone ah screw you you little brat i muttered slamming down the phone myself i tried returning to hugo wolf but my enthusiasm was gone i wandered to the livingroom window and watched the ninetofivers returning home suppose my speculations this morning hadnt been so far out after all suppose louisa djiak had been involved in the plant sabotage and humboldt was protecting her maybe hed called caroline and pushed her into firing me although caroline was not the kind that pushed easily if someone humboldts size came for her shed be more inclined to sink her teeth into his calf and hang on until he got sick of the pain it occurred to me that whatever nancy wanted to talk to me about might shed some light on the general problem i tried her number again but she still didnt answer come on cleghorn i muttered you wanted me bad enough to leave two messages you get run over by a train or something i finally got fed up with my futile churning and called lotty herschel she was free for dinner and glad to have company we went to the gypsy and shared a roast duck then back to her place where she beat me five times in a row at gin the brats tale i was skimming the paper while i made coffee the next morning when nancy cleghorns name leapt out at me the story was on the front page of chicagobeat it explained why she hadnt been around to answer her phone yesterday her body had been found around eight last evening by two young boys whod ignored both the government and their parents and gone into the posted area around dead stick pond a small section of the original marsh remained as illinoiss last wetland for migratory birds dead stick pond had once been a great feeding and resting ground but was now so full of pcbs that little could survive there even so in the middle of the dead mills you could find herons and other unusual birds and the occasional beaver or muskrat the two boys had come on a muskrat there once and hoped to see it again at the waters edge they stumbled over a discarded boot since there were fifty of those for every animaland it was darkit had taken them a few minutes to realize it still had a body connected to it nancy had been hit on the back of the head the internal injury would have killed her eventually but she apparently drowned when her body was dumped in the pond the police knew of no one with a reason to kill her she was well respected her work at scrap had earned her a lot of kudos in the environmentally troubled community and so on she was survived by her mother and four brothers i slowly finished making the coffee and took the paper out to the living room where i reread the story six or seven times i didnt learn anything new nancy my snappish thought last night maybe shed fallen under a train made the little hairs prickle on the sides of my face my thinking hadnt caused her death my mind knew that but my body didnt if only i hadnt taken that hike to the lake yesterday morningi broke off the thought when i realized how stupid it was if i stayed chained to my phone twentyfour hours a day id be at home to needy friends or telemarketers and would have no other life but nancy id known her since i was six years old in my mind i thought we were still young togetherthat because wed been young together we would protect each other from ever getting old i wandered to the window and stared out it was raining hard again in thick sheets that made it impossible to see the street i squinted at the water moving my head to make patterns with it wondering what to do it was only eightthirtytoo early to call my friends at the papers to see if they had news that hadnt made it to the morning edition people who go to bed at three or four in the morning are more cooperative if you let them sleep in shed been found in the fourth police district i didnt know anyone theremy dad had worked the loop and northwest sides not his own neighborhood besides thats been over ten years ago i was chewing on my fingertip trying to decide whom to call when the doorbell rang i figured it was mr contreras trying to get me to come down to take the dog out in the downpour and scowled at the foggy window without moving the third time the bell clamored i reluctantly left my hideout cup in hand i unbolted the outer door and padded barefoot down the three flights two bulky figures stood in the outer hallway rain glistened on their shaved faces and dripped from their navy slickers to form dirty pools on the tiled floor when i opened the door the older one said with heavy sarcasm good morning sunshine i hope we didnt interrupt your beauty sleep not at all bobby i said heartily ive been up for an hour at least i just hoped it was a wrong number hi sergeant i added to the younger man you guys want some coffee as they came past me into the stairwell cold water from their slickers dripped onto my bare toes if it had just been bobby mallory i would have thought it deliberate but sergeant mcgonnigal was always scrupulously polite to me never participating in his lieutenants hostility the truth of the matter was that bobby had been my fathers closest friend both on and off the force his feelings toward me were compounded of guilt at flourishing when my father had stayed in beat patrol at living while tony had diedand frustration at my being grown up and a professional investigator instead of a little girl he could dandle on his knee he looked around in the little entryway of my apartment for a place to put his dripping raincoat finally sticking it on the floor outside the door his wife was a meticulous housekeeper and he had been well trained sergeant mcgonnigal followed suit running his fingers through his thick curly hair to squeeze some of the excess water out i solemnly took them into the living room and brought coffee in mugs remembering extra sugar for bobby its good to see you i said politely when they were seated on the couch especially on such a rotten day how are you bobby looked at me sternly quickly glancing away when he saw i didnt have a bra on under my tshirt i didnt want to come here the captain thought someone should talk to you and since i know you he thought it should be me i didnt agree but hes the captain if youll answer my questions seriously and try not to be a wisenheimer the whole thingll go faster and well both be happy and i thought you were being social i said mournfully no no sorry bad start im serious asas a traffic court judge ask me anything nancy cleghorn bobby said flatly thats not a question and i dont have an answer i just read in this mornings paper that she was killed yesterday i expect you know a lot more about it than i do oh yes he agreed heavily we know a great dealthat she died around six pm from the amount of internal bleeding the me says she was probably hit around four we know she was thirtysix years old and had been pregnant at least once that she ate too much highfat food and broke her right leg as an adult i know that a man or a woman with size thirteen shoes and a fortyinch stride dragged her in a green blanket to the south end of dead stick pond the blanket was sold at a sears store somewhere in the united states sometime between when they started making them and when they discontinued that brand someone else presumably also a man came along for the stroll but didnt help with the dragging or dumping the lab worked overtime last night i didnt think they did that for your average dead citizen bobby refused to let me ride him theres also a little bit i dont know but its the part that counts i dont have any idea who wanted her to die but i understand you two grew up together and used to be pretty good friends and you want me to find her murderer i would have thought you guys had the machinery to do that easier than me his look would have made an academy recruit faint i want you to tell me i dont know thats not what i hear he glared at a point somewhere over my head i couldnt imagine what he was talking about then the messages id left for nancy at scrap and with her mother came back to me those seemed like mighty small straws to build a house from let me guess i said brightly its not even business hours and youve already rounded up everyone at scrap and talked to them mcgonnigal shifted uneasily and looked at mallory the lieutenant nodded briefly mcgonnigal said i talked with a ms caroline djiak late last night she said you advised cleghorn on how to investigate a problem they were having with a zoning permit for a recycling plant she said you would know who the deceased spoke to about it i stared at him speechlessly finally i choked out are those her exact words mcgonnigal fished in his breast pocket for a notebook he flipped through the pages squinting at his notes i didnt take it down word for word but thats pretty much it he said at last i wouldnt call caroline djiak a pathological liar i remarked conversationally just a manipulative little squirt but even though im mad enough at her to go down and personally break in the back of her head it doesnt cheer me any you coming at me this way i mean we go through this every time you think im involved in a crime dont we lieutenant you make a frontal assault that takes my guilty knowledge for granted you couldve started by telling me about carolines neverneverland remarks and asking me if they were true then i wouldve told you everything that happened which was about five minutes of conversation in carolines dining room and you could have taken off with one loose end tied up i got up from the floor and headed for the kitchen bobby came in as i was poking around the refrigerator to see if there was anything edible i might use for breakfast the yogurt had changed to mold and sour milk there wasnt any fruit and the only bread i had left was hard enough to use for ammo bobby unconsciously wrinkled his nose at the dirty dishes but heroically refrained from commenting on them instead he said seeing you near a murder always gets me in the gut you know that it was as close as he was going to get to an apology im not near this one i said impatiently i dont know why caroline wants me there she dragged me down to south chicago last week to a basketballteam reunion then she manipulated me into helping her with a personal problem then she called to tell me to bug out of her life now she wants me back or maybe shes just trying to punish me i dug some crackers out of a cupboard and spread them with peanut butter while we were eating fried chicken nancy cleghorn came by to talk about a zoning problem this would have been just a week ago caroline thought jurshakthe alderman down therewas blocking the permit she asked me what id do if i were investigating i said the easiest thing to do was talk to a friend on jurshaks staff if she or nancy had one nancy left the total of my involvement i poured some more coffee angry enough that my hand shook and i spilled it across the stove despite your little dig we hadnt seen each other for more than ten years i didnt know who her friends or enemies were now caroline makes it sound as though jurshak killed nancy for which there isnt an atom of evidence and she wants to make out that i egged him on to do it hell bobby flinched dont talk dirty vicki it doesnt help anything what are you working on for the djiak girl woman i said automatically through a mouthful of peanut butter or maybe brat ill tell you for nothing even though its none of your business her mother was one of gabriellas charities now shes dying very unpleasantly caroline wanted me to find some people her mother used to work with in the hopes theyd come see her but as she probably told you she fired me two days ago bobbys blue eyes narrowed to slits in his ruddy face theres some truth there i just wish i knew how much i should have known better than to speak frankly with you i said bitterly especially when you opened the conversation with an accusation oh keep your shirt on vicki bobby said he blushed suddenly as the image hit home with him and clean up your kitchen more than once a year place looks like the projects when he had stomped away with mcgonnigal i went to my bedroom to change as i scrambled back into the black dress i looked out the windowthe water was forming little rivers on the walk below i put on running shoes and carried a pair of black pumps in my bag even with an extrawide umbrella my legs and feet got soaked on my dash to the car most februaries though this would be snow a foot or two deep so i tried not to complain too bitterly the little chevys defroster couldnt make much headway on the fogged windshield but at least the car hadnt died the fate of a number of others i passed the storm and the stalls made for a slow trek south it was close to ten by the time i turned from route onto ninetysecond street by the time i found a parking space near the corner of commercial the rain was finally liftingit was clear enough for me to change into my pumps scraps offices were in the second story of a block of little shops i trotted around the corner to the business entrancemy dentist used to have his office here and the opening on commercial remained an indelible memory i stopped at the top of the uncarpeted stairs reading the wall directory while combing my hair and straightening my skirt dr zdunek wasnt there anymore neither were a lot of the other tenants i passed half a dozen or so empty offices on my way down the hall at the far end i walked into a room that had the unmistakable air of a poor notforprofit agency the scarred metal furniture and newspaper articles taped to the walls wavered under a badly winking fluorescent bulb papers and phone books were stacked on the floor and the electric typewriters were models ibm had abandoned when i was still in college a young black woman was typing while talking on the phone she smiled at me but held up a finger to ask me to wait i could hear voices from an open conference room ignoring the receptionists urgent hissing i went to the door to look in a group of five four women and a man sat at a rickety deal table caroline was in the middle talking heatedly when she saw me at the door she broke off and flushed to the roots of her coppery hair vic im in a meeting cant you wait all day if its for you my sweet we need a têteàtête about john mcgonnigalhe visited me first thing this morning john mcgonnigal her little nose wrinkled questioningly sergeant mcgonnigal chicago police i said helpfully she turned even redder oh him maybe wed better talk now will you all excuse me she got up and took me to a cubbyhole next to the conference room the chaos there compounded of books papers graphs old newspapers and candy wrappers made my office look like a convent cell caroline dumped a phone directory from a folding chair for me and seated herself in the rickety swivel chair behind her desk she gripped her hands together in front of her but stared at me defiantly caroline ive known you twentysix years and youve pulled tricks that would shame oliver north but this one has got to head the list after whining and snuffling you got me to agree to look for your old man then you called me off without any reason now to top it all off you lied to the police about my involvement with nancy you want to explain why without resorting to hans christian andersen i was having trouble keeping my voice below a shout what are you on your high horse about she said belligerently you did give nancy advice about shut up i snapped youre not talking to the cops sweetie pie i can just picture you blushing and winking away your tears with sergeant mcgonnigal but i know what i told nancy that night as well as you do so cut the crap and tell me why you lied about me to the police i didnt you try and prove it nancy did come by that night you did tell her to talk to someone in jurshaks office and shes dead now i shook my head like a wet dog trying to clear my brain could we start this at the beginning why did you tell me to stop hunting for your old man she looked at the desktop i decided it wasnt fair to ma going behind her back when it upset her so much whew boy i said hold it there let me get onto cardinal bernardin and the pope to start beatification proceedings when did you ever put louisa or anyone else ahead of what you wanted stop it she shouted bursting into tears believe me or not i dont care i love my mother and i dont want anyone hurting her no matter what you may think i looked at her warily caroline might bat a few tears around as part of her tragic orphan routine but she wasnt prone to sobbing fits okay i said slowly i take it back that was cruel is that why you sicced the cops on me to punish me for saying i was continuing the investigation she blew her nose noisily it wasnt like that what was it like then she caught her lower lip in her teeth nancy called me tuesday morning she said shed gotten threatening phone calls and she thought someone was following her what were they threatening her about the plant of course caroline i want you to be absolutely clear on this did she specifically say the calls were about the plant she opened her mouth then took a breath no she finally muttered i just assumed they were because it was the last thing she and i had been talking about but you went ahead and told the police that she was killed because of the recycling plant and that i told her who to talk to do you understand how outrageous that is but vic its not just a wild guess i mean you mean shit my anger returned making my voice husky cant you tell the difference between your head games and reality nancy was killed murdered instead of helping the police find the murderer you slandered me and got them on my butt they dont care about nancy anyway they dont care about any of us down here she got to her feet her eyes flashing they respond to political pressure and as far as jurshak is concerned south chicago might as well be the south pole you know that as well as i do you know the last time he got a street repaired down hereit sure as hell was before you left the neighborhood bobby mallory is a good honest thorough cop i said doggedly just because jurshak is twenty kinds of asshole doesnt change that yeah you dont care either you proved that pretty good when you moved away from here and never came back until i pushed you into it the pulse beside my right temple started throbbing i pounded the desk hard enough to knock some of the papers to the floor i busted my ass for a week trying to find your old man for you your grandparents insulted me louisa blew up at me and you you couldnt be content with manipulating me into going to look for the guy and then spinning me around a few times you had to lie to the police about me and i thought youd give a fuck she yelled i thought if you didnt care about me youd at least do something for nancy because you played on the same team together i guess that proves how wrong i was she started for the door i caught her arm and forced her to face me caroline im mad enough to beat the shit out of you but im not so mad i cant think you fingered me to the cops because theres something you know that youre scared to talk about i want to know what that is she looked at me fiercely i dont know anything just that someone had started following nancy around over the weekend and she called the police and reported it or you did no she talked to the states attorney and they said theyd open a file i guess they have something to put in it now she gave the smile of a triumphant martyr i forced myself to speak calmly to her after a few minutes she reluctantly agreed to sit back down and tell me what she knew if she was telling the trutha big ifit wasnt much she didnt know whom nancy had seen at the states attorneys office but she thought it could have been hugh mcinerney he was the person they dealt with on other issues under further probing she admitted that mcinerney had taken statements from them eighteen months ago about their problems with steve dresberg a local mob figure involved in garbage disposal i vaguely remembered the trial over dresbergs pcb incinerator and his alleged sweetheart deal with the sanitary district but didnt realize she and nancy had been involved when i demanded to know what role the two had played she scowled but said she and nancy had testified to receiving death threats for their opposition to the incinerator obviously dresberg knew who to pay off at the sanitary district it didnt matter what we said i guess he figured scrap was too puny to listen to so he didnt have to make good his threats and you didnt tell the cops that i rubbed my hands tiredly across my face caroline you need to call mcgonnigal and make an amended statement you need to get them looking at people you know threatened nancy in the past im going to phone the sergeant myself as soon as i get home to tell him about this conversation and if youre thinking of lying to him a second time think againhes known me professionally for years he may not like me but he knows he can believe what i tell him she looked at me furiously im not five years old anymore i dont have to do what you say i went to the door just do me a favor carolinethe next time youre in trouble dial like the rest of the citizenry or talk to a shrink dont come hounding me common sense i dragged my feet back to the chevy feeling as though i were a hundred years old i was disgusted with caroline with myself for being stupid enough to get caught in her net once again with gabriella for ever befriending louisa djiak if my mother had known what louisas damned baby would get me into i could hear gabriellas golden voice in response to the same plaint twentytwo years ago of her i expect nothing but trouble cara but of you i expect rationality not because you are older but because it is your nature i made a bitter face at the memory and started the car sometimes the burden of being rational and responsible while everyone around me was howling was more than i liked even so instead of washing my hands of carolines problems and heading north toward home i found myself driving west toward nancys childhood house on muskegon but it wasnt to help out caroline that i was making the trek i didnt care that id told nancy to talk to someone at jurshaks office or even that wed shared the old school towel i was hoping to assuage my own feeling of guilt for not having been there when nancy called me of course she might have been phoning to condole about the lady tigersour successors had been eliminated in the state quarterfinals but i didnt think so despite my bravura performance with caroline i sort of thought she was right nancy had learned something about the recycling plant that she needed my help to deal with i didnt have any trouble finding nancys mothers place which didnt exactly cheer me up i thought id left the south side behind but it seemed my unconscious had perfect recall of every house i used to spend time in down here three cars were crowded into the short driveway the curb in front was filled too and i had to go some way down the street before i found a parking space i fiddled with my car keys for a moment before starting up the walkperhaps i should postpone my visit until her mourning callers had gone but even if it was my nature to be rational patience isnt my leading virtue i stuck the keys into my skirt pocket and headed up the walk the door was opened by a strange young woman of thirty or so wearing jeans and a sweatshirt she looked at me questioningly without saying anything when a minute had stretched by without her speaking i finally gave her my name im an old friend of nancys id like to talk to mrs cleghorn for a few minutes if shes up to seeing me ill go ask she muttered she came back again hunched a shoulder told me i could go on in and returned to whatever shed been doing when i rang the bell i was startled by the clamor when i got into the little foyerit was more like the noisy house of nancys and my childhood than a place of mourning as i followed the sound toward the living room two small boys erupted from it chasing each other with sweet rolls they were using as guns the lead one caromed into me and bounced off without apology i sidestepped the other and looked cautiously around the doorway before entering the long homey room was packed with people i didnt recognize any of them but assumed the men were nancys four brothers grown to adulthood the three young women were presumably their wives what looked like a nursery school in full session was crammed around the edges with children jabbing each other scuffling giggling ignoring adult admonitions for silence no one paid any attention to me but i finally spied ellen cleghorn at the far end of the room holding a howling baby without much enthusiasm when she saw me she struggled to her feet and gave the baby to one of the young women she picked her way through her swarming grandchildren to me im so sorry about nancy i said squeezing her hand and im sorry to bother you at a time like this im glad you came dear she said giving a warm smile and kissing my cheek the boys mean wellthey all took the day off and thought it would cheer up grandma to see the kiddiesbut the chaos is too much for me lets go into the dining room theres cake in there and one of the girls is making coffee ellen cleghorn had aged well she was a plumper edition of nancy with the same frizzy blond hair it had darkened with time rather than graying and her skin was still soft and clear she had been divorced for many years ever since her husband ran off with another woman shed never gotten child support or alimony and had raised her large family on her meager earnings as a librarian always making room for me at the dinner table after basketball practice ellen had been unique on the south side in her indifference to housekeeping the disarray in the dining room was much as i remembered it with dust balls in the comers and books and papers shoved to one side to make room for the food even so the house had always seemed romantic to me when i was young it was one of a handful of big homes in the neighborhoodmr cleghorn had been a grade school principal before he decampedand all five children had their own bedrooms unheardof luxury on the south side nancys even had a little turreted window where we acted out bluebeard mrs cleghorn sat down behind a stack of newspapers at the head of the table and gestured me to the chair cattycorner to her i fiddled with the pages of the book in front of me then said abruptly nancy was trying to get in touch with me yesterday i guess i told you that when you gave me her number do you know what she wanted she shook her head i hadnt talked to her for several weeks i know its rotten of me to bug you about it today buti keep thinking it had something to do withwith what happened to her i mean we hadnt seen each other for so long and when we did talk it was about my being a detective and what i would do in her situation so she would have thought of me in that context you knowsomething came up that she thought my special experience might help her with i just dont know dear her voice trembled and she struggled to control it dont let it worry you you couldnt have done anything to help her im sure i wish i could agree with you look im not trying to be a ghoul or pressure you when youre so upset but i feel responsible im an experienced investigator i might have been able to help her if id been home when she called the only thing i can do to assuage my conscience is try to find who killed her vic i know you and nancy were friends and im sure you think youre helping by getting involved but cant you just leave it to the police i dont want to have to talk about it or think about it anymore its bad enough having to get ready for her funeral with all these children screaming through the house if i have to worry aboutabout why someone wanted to kill heri keep thinking of her in that marsh we used to go birdwatching there when she was in girl scouts and she was always so scared of the water i keep thinking of her in there being alone and afraid she broke off and struggled against her tears i knew nancy was afraid of water she had never joined our surreptitious swims in the calumet and she had to get a written statement from a doctor to excuse her from the swimming requirement in college i didnt want to think of her last minutes in the marsh maybe shed never regained consciousness it was the best i could hope for thats why it matters to me to find out who put her through such torment it makes me feel that she was a little less helpless if i can go to bat for her now can you understand that and tell me who nancy mightve talked to if not to you i mean she and nancy had always had a kind of careless camaraderie which id envied even though i loved my mother she was too intense for an easy relationship if nancy hadnt told ellen cleghorn what was going on with the recycling center shed certainly have talked to her about friends and lovers and after a few more minutes of coaxing mrs cleghorn started speaking about them nancy had been in love been pregnant had an abortion since she and charles broke up five years ago there hadnt been any special men in her life and no close women friends down here either it wasnt really a good place for her to meet people i hoped maybe after she bought that housesouth shore is a little livelier neighborhood and lots of university people live down there now but there wasnt anyone in this area she wouldve been close enough to talk to except maybe caroline djiak and nancy thought she was such a hothead she wouldnt have told her anything she wasnt dead certain about the unconscious phrase made her wince i rubbed my eyes she talked to one of the states attorneys if it had something to do with scrap she mightve talked to their lawyer too whats his name she mentioned it that night she came by carolines and i cant remember it i guess that would be ron kappelman vic she went out with him a few times but they didnt really click together when was that i asked suddenly alert maybe it was a crime of passion after all it must have been two years ago i guess when he first started working with scrap maybe not who waits two years to revenge himself on love gone sour outside agatha christie that is mrs cleghorn couldnt tell me anything else other than the date of the funeral set for monday at mount of olives methodist church i told her id be there and left her to the ministrations of her grandchildren back at the car i slumped dejectedly against the steering wheel except for the financial searches id done on tuesday i hadnt had a paying customer for three weeks and now if i was really going to look into nancys death id have to talk to the states attorney see if nancy had revealed anything when she told him she was being followed talk to ron kappelman see whether he mightve felt like a man scorned or failing that if he knew what shed been up to the last few days i rubbed my head tiredly maybe i was getting too old for gestures of bravado maybe i should just call john mcgonnigal tell him about my conversation with caroline and go back to what i know how to doinvestigate industrial fraud on that sensible even rational note i started the car and took off not toward lake shore drive and common sense but to the south where nancy cleghorn had died dead stick pond dead stick pond lay deep in the labyrinth of marsh landfill and factories id been there only once as part of the girl scout birdwatching expedition and wasnt sure i could find it again at rd street i headed west to stony island the street that threads the maze north of rd its a major thoroughfare but down here it turns into a gravel track of indeterminate width worn to potholes by the giant semis chewing their way in and out of the factories the heavy rain had turned the track to a muddy glaze the chevy bounced and slid uneasily in the ruts between the high marsh grasses passing trucks splattered the windshield with mud when i swerved to miss them the chevy bucked dangerously and headed for the drainage ditches lining the road my arms were sore from wrestling with the steering when i finally saw the pond to my left parking on a patch of high ground next to the road i donned my running shoes for my expedition i followed the road to a posted track on the east rim of the pond then picked my way gingerly through the marshy ground and dead grasses mud squelched up under my feet and slid inside my running shoes the pond was part of an overflow of the calumet river it wasnt very deep but its murky waters covered a vast expanse of the marsh close up i read conflicting signs tacked to the trees one proclaiming the area a federal cleanwater project the other warning trespassers of hazardous wastes some oversighted agency had made a haphazard attempt to enclose the pond but the low wire fence had fallen down in a number of places making it easy to breach gathering my skirt in one hand i stepped over one of these collapsed sections to the waters edge dead stick pond used to be a great feeding area for migrating birds now the water was a dull black with stark tree stumps poking surreal fingers through its surface fish have been returning to the calumet river and its tributaries since the passage of the clean water act but the ones that make their way into the pond show up with massive tumors and rotted fins even so i passed a fishing couple trying to find dinner in the dirty water the two were shapeless ageless sexless in their layers of worn garments i could feel them watching me until i disappeared around a curve in the marsh grasses i followed a track to the south end of the pond where the papers said nancy had died i found the spot easily enough it was still marked with yellow police tape and the big yellow signs declaring the area off limits as the site of a police investigation they hadnt bothered to leave a patrolmanwho would have agreed to such a posting anyway the rain had doubtless washed away anything the evidence team hadnt picked up last night i ducked under the yellow tape the killers had parked where i left my car or near there they had dragged her along the path i had just traversed in broad daylight theyd gone past the fishing couple or past the place where the two stood just lucky that no one had seen them or relying on the furtive lives of those who frequent the swamps to protect them from idle curiosity the rain had washed away any signs of nancys body but the police had marked an outline with stones i squatted next to them she had been dumped from the blanket and landed on her right side head partly in the water and had lain there in the oily water until she drowned i shivered in the damp air and finally pushed myself back to my feet there was nothing to be seen here no trace of life or death i headed slowly back down the path stopping every few feet to inspect the bushes and grasses it was a futile gesture sherlock holmes would no doubt have spotted the telltale cigarette butt the gravel from another county that didnt belong here the fragment of a missing envelope all i saw was the endless array of bottles potatochip bags old shoes coats proving that nancy was only one of many discarded bundles in the swamp the fishing couple were standing exactly as they had on my way in on impulse i started toward them to see if theyd been here yesterday if theyd noticed anything but when i stepped off the path a gaunt german shepherd got to its feet glaring at me with wild red eyes it braced its forelegs and bared its teeth i muttered nice doggie and returned to the trail let the police interrogate the couplethey were being paid for the work and i wasnt back at the road i hunted around for the place where the killers had carried her over the fence i finally found a few green threads snagged on the wire about twenty feet from where id left the car i could see where last years grasses still lay broken under the weight of her assailants feet the area was relatively untrampled though so i didnt think the police had bothered with a search at this end i moved carefully through the undergrowth inspecting every piece of litter i cut my hands parting the dead grasses the skirt of my black dress grew stiff with mud and my fingers and toes were frozen when i finally decided there was nothing i could accomplish here i turned the chevy around and headed north to try to find nancys man in the states attorneys office with my bedraggled dress and mudstreaked legs i wasnt dressed for success or even for making a good impression on public servants it was getting close to three though if i went home to change id never get back to twentysixth and california before the end of the business day id spent my years on the county payroll as a public defender not only did that put me on the other side of the bench from the states attorneys it left me with a permanent suspicion of them we all worked for the cook county board but they earned fifty percent more than we did and if a hot case made it to the papers the prosecutors always got mentioned by name we never did even if our brilliant defense made them look like dog food of course id cultivated my share of prosecutors working out plea bargains and other deals but there wasnt anyone on richie daleys staff whod be glad to give me information for old times sake id have to do my dick butkus imitation and bull my way through the middle of the line the bailiff who searched me at the entrance remembered me she was inclined to chaff me about my bedraggled appearance but at least she didnt try to stop me as a dangerous abettor of criminals i stopped in the ladies room to wash the mud from my legs nothing could be done about the dress at this point other than burning it but with a little makeup and my hair combed i at least didnt look like someone whod broken out of custody i went up to the third floor and looked sternly at the receptionist my names warshawski im a detective i said harshly i want to talk to hugh mcinerney about the cleghorn case police and sheriffs deputies are a dime a dozen at the criminal courts i figured they didnt flash a badge every time they wanted to see someone so why should i the receptionist responded to my bullying tone by quickly punching numbers on the house phone even though she was a patronage employee like everyone else in the building it didnt help to get a black mark with a detective states attorneys are young men and women en route to big law firms or good political appointments you never see any old people on the left side of the benchi dont know where they ship the ones who dont move on naturally hugh mcinerney looked to be in his late twenties he was tall with thick blond hair and the kind of trim muscularity that comes from a lot of racquetball what can i do for you detective his deep voice matching his build was tailormade for the courtroom nancy cleghorn i said briskly can we talk in private he led me through the inner door to a conference room with the bare walls and scuffed furniture i remembered from my own county days he left me alone for a minute to get his file on nancy you know shes dead i said when he got back i saw it in the morning paper ive been kind of waiting for you guys to get here you didnt think of using some initiative and calling us yourself i raised my eyebrows haughtily he hunched a shoulder i didnt have anything concrete to tell you she came to see me tuesday because she thought someone was following her she have any idea who he shook his head believe me detective if id had a name in here id have been on the phone first thing this morning you didnt think about steve dresberg he shifted uncomfortably iuh i talked to dresbergs attorney leon haas heuh he thought dresberg was pretty happy with the situation down there these days yeah he should be i said nastily he made you guys look like cole slaw in court didnt he on that incinerator deal you ask haas how dresberg felt about the recycling plant cleghorn was working on if he issued death threats over an incinerator im not sure hed jump for joy over a recycling center or did you decide that cleghorn was imagining things mr mcinerney hey detectivelay off were on the same side on this you find who killed the cleghorn woman and ill prosecute hell out of him i promise you that i dont think it was steve dresberg but hey ill call haas and feel him out i grinned savagely and stood up better leave that for the police mr mcinerney let them investigate and find someone for you to prosecute hell out of i strode arrogantly from the office but once i got on the elevator my shoulders sagged i didnt want to mess with steve dresberg if half the things they said about him were true he could get you into the chicago river faster than you could change your socks but he hadnt done anything to nancy or caroline over the incinerator or maybe he figured the first time around you got a warning the second time meant sudden death i soberly merged the chevy with the rushhour jam on the kennedy and headed for home muddy waters when i got home mr contreras was in front of the building with the dog she was gnawing on a large stick while he cleaned debris from the little patch of front yard peppy jumped up when she saw me but sank back down when she realized i didnt have my running clothes on mr contreras sketched a wave hiya doll you get caught in the rain this morning he straightened and looked at me my my youre certainly a sight look like youve been wading through a mud puddle that came up to your waist yeah ive been down in the south chicago swamp it kind of stays with you oh yeah didnt even know there was a south chicago swamp well there is i said shortly pushing the dog away impatiently he looked at me closely you need a bath hot bath and a drink doll you go on up and rest ill look after her royal highness here she dont need to go to the lake every day of her life you know yeah right i collected my mail and moved slowly up the stairs to the third floor when i saw myself in the fulllength mirror on the bathroom door i couldnt believe id gotten mcinerney to talk to me without a struggle i looked as though i belonged with the fishing couple out at dead stick pond my panty hose were in shreds and my legs were streaked with black where id tried washing the mud off down at the county building the hem of my dress was heavy with caked dirt even my black pumps had gotten dusty from the dirt on my legs i kicked the shoes off outside the bathroom door and threw out the panty hose while turning on the bath water i hoped the cleaners could rescue the dressi didnt want to sacrifice my entire wardrobe to the old neighborhood i took the portable phone from the bedroom into the bath with me once i was in the tub with whiskey at close reach i checked in with the answering service jonathan michaels had tried to reach me hed left his office number but the switchboard was closed for the day and i didnt have his unlisted home number i stuck the phone up on the sink and leaned back in the tub with my eyes closed steve dresberg also known as the garbage king not because of his character but because if you wanted to bury burn or ship refuse in the chicago area you had to cut him in on the action some people say that two independent haulers who disappeared after refusing to deal with him are rotting in the cid landfill others think the arson in a waste storage shed that caused the evacuation of six square blocks on the south side last summer could be traced to his doorif you had enough people with paidup life insurance to do the tracing dresberg was definitely police business if not fbi and since the odds were against carolines phoning mcgonnigal with an amended statement that meant i should play cindy citizen and tell him myself holding my breath i slid down so that the water covered my head suppose dresberg wasnt involved at all though if i pointed the cops toward him it would only divert their attention from more promising lines of inquiry i sat up and started rubbing shampoo into my hair the water around me was turning black i opened the drain and turned on the hotwater tap all i had to do was find someone on jurshaks staff who would talk to me with the same frankness hed used with nancy then when sinister figures began following me i would take out my trusty smith wesson and blow them away preferably before they could bonk me on the head and dump me in the swamp i wrapped myself in a terrycloth robe and went into the kitchen to forage the maid hadnt been shopping for some time and pickings were slim i took the jar of peanut butter and the bottle of black label and went back into the living room with them i was on my second whiskey and my fourth spoonful of peanut butter when i heard a tentative knock on the door i groaned in resignation it was mr contreras with a laden tv tray the dog was at his heels hope you dont mind me barging up like this doll but i could see you was all in and i thought you might like some supper did me a little barbecue chicken in the kitchen and even without the charcoal it tastes pretty good if i say so i know you try to eat healthy so i made you a big salad now you want to be alone you just say the word and peppy and mell head back down wont hurt my feelings any but you cant live on that stuff youre drinking and peanut butter scotch and peanut butter no way doll youre too busy to buy food you just let me know no trouble for me to pick up something extra when im buying for myself you know that i thanked him lamely and invited him in just let me put on some clothes i guess i should have sent him back downstairsi didnt want it to become a habit with him thinking he could come up whenever he felt like it but the chicken smelled good and the salad looked healthy and the peanut butter was lying kind of heavily on my stomach i ended up telling him about nancys death and my trek to dead stick pond hed never been below the field museum and had no inkling of life on the south side i got out my city map and showed him houston street where id grown up and then the route down to the cal industrial district and the wetlands where nancy had been found he shook his head dead stick pond huh guess the name says it all its rough losing a friend that way one you played basketball with and all i never even knew you was on a team but i mighta guessed it the way you run but you want to be careful doll if this dresburg guy is the one behind all this hes an awful lot bigger than you you know me ive never backed away from a fight but i know better than to go in singlehanded against a tank division too he was going into an elaborate illustration based on his experiences at anzio when jonathan michaels phoned i excused myself and took the call on the bedroom extension i wanted to get you before i leave town in the morning jonathan spoke without preamble i had one of my staff people look up your two guyspankowski and ferraro they did sue humboldt apparently not over wrongful dismissal but whether they could get workers comp it looks as though they quit due to illness and were trying to prove it was job related they didnt get anywhere with the suitthe thing came to trial here and humboldt didnt have any trouble winning and then the two died and the lawyer didnt seem to want to follow up on appeal i dont know how far you want to follow this but the lawyer who handled it was a frederick manheim he cut short my thanks with a crisp gotta run i was hanging up when he came back on the line you still there good i almost forgotwe didnt see anything about sabotage but humboldt could have kept that quietnot wanting the idea to get popular you know after he hung up i sat on the bed looking at the phone i felt so overloaded with unconnected information that i couldnt think at all my professional curiosity had been piqued by the reaction id gotten first from the xerxes personnel manager and then the doctor id wanted to find out what lay behind their jumpy behavior then humboldt seemed to have a glib explanation and nancys death had made me shift my priorities anyway i couldnt untangle the whole universe and finding her killers seemed more urgent than scratching the xerxes itch now the wheel seemed to turn the other way up again why had humboldt gone out of his way to lie to me or had he maybe theyd sued for workers comp but had lost because theyd been fired for sabotage nancy humboldt caroline louisa chigwell the images spun uselessly through my mind you all right in there doll it was mr contreras hovering anxiously in the hall yeah im okay i guess i got to my feet and went back out to him with what i hoped was a reassuring smile i just need to spend some time alone okay yeah sure fine he was a little hurt but worked valiantly to keep it from showing he collected the dirty dishes waving off my offers of help and took the tray and the dog back downstairs once hed gone i wandered moodily around the apartment caroline had asked me to stop looking for her father there wasnt any reason to push matters with humboldt but when a tenbilliondollar man undertakes to run me through hoops it gets my hackles up i hunted around for the phone book it had somehow gotten buried under a stack of music on the piano naturally enough humboldts number wasnt listed frederick manheim attorney had an office at ninetyfifth and halsted and a home in neighboring beverly lawyers with large incomes or criminal practices dont give their home numbers nor do they usually hide out on the southwest side away from the courts and the major action i was restless enough to want to move now call manheim get the story from him and gallop down to oak street to confront humboldt festina lente i muttered to myself get the facts then shoot it would be better to wait until morning and make the trek down south to see the guy in person which meant yet another day in nylons which meant id better get my black pumps clean i foraged in the hall closet for shoe polish and finally found a tin of black under a sleeping bag i was carefully cleaning the shoes when bobby mallory called i cradled the phone under my ear and started buffing the left shoe evening lieutenant what can i do for you you can give me a good reason for not running you in he spoke in the pleasant conversational tone that meant his temper was on a tight rein for what i asked its considered a crime to impersonate a police officer by everyone but you i believe not guilty i looked at the shoe it was never going to recover the smooth finish it had when it left florence but it wasnt too bad you arent the womantall thirtyish short curly hairwho told hugh mcinerney you were with the police i told him i was a detective and when i spoke of the police i carefully used thirdnot firstperson pronouns as far as i know that is not a crime but maybe the city council blew one by me i picked up the right shoe you dont think you could leave the investigation of the cleghorn womans death to the police do you oh i dont know you think steve dresberg killed her if i told you yes would you drop out of sight and go do the stuff youre qualified to work on if you have a warrant with the guys name on it i might without arguing over what im qualified to do i capped the polish tin and laid it and the rag on a newspaper vicki look youre a cops daughter you should know better than to go stirring around in a police investigation when you talk to someone like mcinerney without telling us it just makes our job a hundred times harder okay yeah okay i guess i said grudgingly i wont talk to the states attorney again without clearing it with you or mcgonnigal or anyone else give me a break bobby if it says police business in all caps ill leave it to you thats the best youre going to get from me we hung up in mutual irritation i spent the rest of the evening in front of the tube watching a badly cut version of rebel without a cause it did nothing to abate my ill humor chemistry lesson manheims office lay between a beauty parlor and a florist among the little storefronts crowding ninetyfifth street he had put his name on the plate glass in those blackandgold transfers that are supposed to look oldfashioned and discreetfrederick manheim attorneyatlaw the front of the place the part the little shops used as their sales floors had been turned into a reception area it held a couple of vinyl chairs and a desk with a typewriter and an african violet set on it a few old copies of sports illustrated sat on a pressedwood table in front of the vinyl chairs i flipped through one for a few minutes to give the help a chance to make an appearance when no one showed up i tapped on the door at the back of the room and turned the knob the door opened on a tiny hallway a few pieces of wallboard had been stuck in the area where the stores held their excess inventory to create an office and a little bathroom i knocked on the door that had manheims name on itthis time in solid black gothicand got a thick just a minute paper rustled a drawer slammed and manheim opened the door still chewing wiping his mouth on the back of his hand he was a young man with rosy cheeks and thick fair hair that hung over the tops of heavy glasses oh hi annie didnt tell me i had an appointment this morning come on in i shook his proffered hand and told him my name i dont have an appointment im sorry to just come barging in but i was in the area and hoped you might have a minute or two he waved me in sure sure no problem sorry i cant offer you any coffeei get mine from the dunkin donuts on the way over hed crammed a couple of visitors chairs in between his desk and the door if you leaned back in the one on the left you ran into the filing cabinet the one on the right was jammed against the wall a line of gray scuff marks showed where people had rubbed too hard against the pasteboard i felt kind of bad about not being able to infuse a little cash into the operation hed taken out a pad of legal paper carefully setting the dunkin donuts coffee to one side can you spell your name for me please i spelled it out im a lawyer mr manheim but these days i work primarily as a private investigator a case im involved in has brought me to two clients of yours former clients i guess joey pankowski and steve ferraro hed been looking at me courteously through his thick lenses his hands clasped loosely around his pen at the mention of pankowski and ferraro he let the pen drop and looked as troubled as a man with rosy cherubs cheeks could pankowski and ferraro im not sure employees at humboldt chemicals xerxes plant in south chicago died two or three years ago oh yes i remember now they needed some legal advice but im afraid i couldnt do much for them he blinked unhappily behind his glasses i know you dont want to talk about your clients i dont like talking about mine either but if i explain whats gotten me interested in pankowski and ferraro will you answer a couple of questions about them for me he looked down at the desktop and fiddled with his pen ii really cant what is going on with these two guys every time i mention their names grown men tremble in their shoes he looked up at me who are you working for myself myself myself it is enough or so medea said youre not working for a company you mean like humboldt chemical no i was hired originally by the young woman who used to live next door to me to find out who her father was it seemed remotely possible that one of those twomost likely pankowskicould have been the guy and i started poking around trying to find someone at xerxes who knew him this woman fired me on wednesday but ive gotten piqued by the way people are reacting to me lying to me basically about what went on between pankowski and ferraro and xerxes and then a guy i know at the department of labor told me you used to represent them so here i am he smiled unhappily i dont suppose theres any reason the company would send someone around after all this time but its kind of hard for me to believe youre on your own too many people got too excited over that case and now you come in out of the blue its tootoo strange too pat i rubbed my forehead trying to coax some ideas into my brain finally i said im going to do something ive never done in my whole history as an investigator im going to tell you exactly what happened if after that you still feel you cant trust me so be it i started at the very beginning with louisa showing up pregnant in the house next door a few months before my eleventh birthday with gabriella and her quixotic impulses with carolines exuberant philanthropy at other peoples expense and the nagging feeling i still had of being her older sister and somehow responsible for her i didnt tell him about nancy ending up in dead stick pond but i described everything that had happened at xerxes my conversation with dr chigwell and finally humboldts intervention that was the only episode i muted i couldnt bring myself to tell him the owner of the company had had me in for brandyi felt embarrassed because id let myself be gulled by the trappings of wealth so i mumbled that id had a call from one of the companys senior officers after i finished manheim took off his glasses and went through an elaborate cleaning ritual involving his necktie it was clearly a habitual gesture of nervousness but his eyes looked so naked without their protective lenses that i glanced away at last he put the glasses back on and picked up his pen again im not a bad lawyer im really a pretty decent lawyer just not very ambitious i grew up on the south side and i like it down here i help a lot of the businesses on the street with leasing problems employment issues that kind of thing so when those two guys came to me maybe i should have sent them someplace else but i thought i could handle the caseive done some comp claimsand it made a nice change pankowskis sister owns the flower shop next doorthats why they picked meshe told them id done a good job for her he started for the filing cabinet and changed his mind i dont know why i want the foldernervous habit i guess i mean i know the whole damned case by heart even after all this time he stopped but i didnt prompt him whatever he said now would be to himself more than to me and i didnt want to intrude on the flow after a few minutes he went on its xerxine you know the way they used to make it it left these toxic residues in the air do you know any chemistry i dont either but i made quite a study of this at the time xerxine is a chlorinated hydrocarbonthey add chlorine to ethylene gas usually and get a solvent you know the kind of thing you might clean oil from sheet metal with or paint or anything well if you breathe the vapors while theyre manufacturing it it doesnt do you a whole lot of good affects the liver and kidneys and central nervous system and all those good things when humboldt first started making xerxine back in the fifties no one knew anything about that stuff you know they didnt run the plants to kill the employees but they werent very careful about controlling how much of the chlorinated vapors got into the air now that he was into his story his manner had changed he seemed selfconfident and knowledgeable his claim to being a good lawyer didnt seem at all farfetched then in the sixties and seventies when people started thinking seriously about the environment guys like irving selikoff began looking at industrial pollution and worker health and they started finding that chemicals like xerxine could be toxic at pretty low concentrationsyou know a hundred molecules per million molecules of air what they call parts per million so xerxes put in air scrubbers and closed up their pipes better and got their ppm down to federal standards that would have been in the late seventies when the epa issued a standard on xerxine fifty parts per million he smiled apologetically sorry to be so technical i cant think about this case in simple terms anymore anyway pankowski and ferraro came to me early in they were both sick as hell one with liver cancer the other with aplastic anemia theyd worked at humboldt for a long time since for ferraro and for pankowskibut theyd quit when they got too sick to work that would have been two years earlier so they couldnt collect disability i dont think they were told it was an option i nodded in agreement companies dont willingly offer information on benefits that will add to their insurance premiums especially looking at a case like louisas where she was getting major medical payments besides her disability check but what about their union i asked wouldnt the shop steward have notified them he shook his head its a singleshop union and its pretty much a mouthpiece for the company especially now theres so much unemployment in the neighborhood they dont want to rock the boat unlike the steelworkers i interjected dryly he grinned for the first time looking even younger than before well you cant blame them the xerxes union i mean but anyway the two guys had read someplace that xerxine could cause these health problems and since they were both up against it financially they thought maybe they could at least collect workers comp for not being able to work you know jobrelated condition and all that i see so you went to humboldt and tried to work something out or you went directly to litigation i had to work fastit wasnt clear how long either of them would live i went to the company first but when they didnt want to play ball i didnt fool aroundi filed a suit of course if wed won after they died their families would have been entitled to an indemnity payment and that would make quite a difference to them financially but you like your clients to be alive to see their victories i nodded it would have made a big difference especially to mrs pankowski with all her children illinois insurers pay a quarter of a million to families of workers who die on the job so it was worth the effort so what happened well i saw right away the company was going to stonewall so we sued then we got an early docket even being stuck down on the south side ive got a few connections he smiled to himself but declined to share the joke trouble was both guys smoked pankowski was a heavy drinker and theyd both lived all their lives in south chicago i guess if you grew up there i dont have to tell you what the air was like so humboldt socked us they said on the one hand that there wasnt any way to prove xerxine had made these guys sick instead of their cigarettes or the general shit in the air and they also pointed out that both of them had been working there before anyone knew how toxic the stuff was so even if xerxine did make them sick it didnt countyou know they operated the plant based on current medical knowledge so we lost handily i talked to a really good appellate lawyer and he felt there just wasnt anything to go on with end of story i thought about it for a minute yeah but if thats all that happened why is xerxes jumping like a nervous rabbit when it hears those guys names he shrugged probably same reason i didnt want to talk to you to begin with they dont believe youre on your own they dont think youre looking for a longlost father they think youre trying to stir the pot up again youve got to admit your story looks pretty farfetched reluctantly i looked at it from his point of view given all this history i hadnt known about i could understand sort of i still couldnt figure out why humboldt felt he had to intervene if his company had won the case fair and square what difference did it make if his subordinates talked to me about pankowski and ferraro and also i added aloud why are you so upset do you think they were wrong i mean do you think the trial was rigged somehow he shook his head unhappily no based on the evidence i dont think we could have won i think we should have i mean i think these guys deserved something for putting twenty years of their lives into the company especially since its probable that working there killed them i mean look at your friends mother shes dying too kidney failure did you say but the law spells it out or the precedents doyou cant fault the company for operating under the best knowledge they had available at the time so thats it you just dont like to talk about it because you feel bad that you couldnt win for them he communed again with his glasses and his tie oh that would get me down no one likes losing and god you couldnt help wanting these guys to win but then you know the company could see that plant go bellyup if we set a successful precedent everyone whod ever been sick or died there coming back for these big settlements he stopped i made myself sit very quietly at last he said no its just that i got a threatening phone call after the case when we were considering the appeal that would be grounds for overturning the verdict i burst out didnt you go to the states attorney he shook his head i just got the one phone call and whoever called didnt mention the case by namejust a generic reference to the dangers of using the appellate system im not very tough physically but im not a coward either the call made me angry angrier than ive ever been and i pushed and prodded every way after that to build an appeal there just wasnt any way to they didnt call you later to congratulate you for following their advice i never heard from the guy again but when you showed up out of nowhere i laughed glad to know i could be mistaken for muscle i may need it before the day is over he blushed no no you dont looki dont meani mean youre a very attractive lady but you never know these days i wish i could tell you something about your friends father but we never talked about anything like that my clients and i no i can see you wouldnt have i thanked him for his frankness and got up if you come across anything else you think i could help you with let me know he said shaking my hand especially if it might give me some grounds for a writ of certiorari i assured him i would and left i was wiser than id been when i came in but no less confused house call it was well past noon by the time manheim and i finished talking i headed for the loop and picked up a diet coke and a sandwichcorned beef which i reserve for occasions when i need special nourishmentand took them to my office i could see manheims point sort of if humboldt lost a suit like that it could spell disaster the kind of problem that drove johnsmanville to seek bankruptcy protection but manvilles situation had been different they had known asbestos was toxic and covered up their knowledge so when the ugly truth came out workers sued for punitive damages all humboldt would have faced was a series of comp claims even so that might be sticky say theyd had a thousand workers at the plant over a tenyear period and they all died at a quarter of a million a pop even if ajax was paying for it that was a lot of balloons i licked mustard from my fingers maybe i was looking at it wrongmaybe it was ajax not wanting to make the payoutgordon firth telling his good buddy gustav humboldt to cool out any attempts to reopen the case but firth couldnt have known i was involvedthe word wouldnt have run around chicago that fast or maybe it would youve never seen gossip and rumor mills until youve spent a week in a large corporation and then why had someone threatened manheim about the appeal if humboldt was dead to rights on the legal issues there wasnt any percentage in going after manheim it would just cause a judge to vacate the decree so it couldnt have been the company trying to brush him back or maybe it was some very junior person someone who thought he could make a name for himself in the company by putting a little muscle on the plaintiffs that wasnt a totally improbable scenario you get a corporate atmosphere where ethics are a little loose and subordinates think that the way to managements heart is across their opponents bodies but that still didnt explain why humboldt had lied about the suit why dump a charge of sabotage on the poor bastards when all they wanted was some workers comp money i wondered if it would be worthwhile to try to speak to humboldt again i visualized his full jovial face with the cold blue eyes you have to swim carefully when your waters are shared by a great shark i wasnt sure i wanted to go to the big man just yet i groaned to myself the problem was spreading out in front of me like ripples in a pond i was the stone dropped in the middle and the lines were moving farther and farther away from me i just couldnt handle so many intangible waves on my own i tried to turn my attention to some problems that had come in the mail including a notice of insufficient funds to cover the check of a small hardware store whose pilfering problems id solved a few weeks ago i made a call that brought me no satisfaction and decided to pack it in for the day id just slung my mail into the wastebasket when the phone rang an efficient alto told me she was clarissa hollingsworth mr humboldts personal secretary i sat up in my chair time to be alert i wasnt ready to go to him but the shark wanted to swim to me yes ms hollingsworth what can i do for mr humboldt i dont believe he wants you to do anything she said coolly he just asked me to pass on some information to you about someone nameduhlouisa djiak she stumbled over the nameshe should have practiced pronouncing it before phoning i repeated louisas name correctly yes mr humboldt says he talked to dr chigwell about her and that it is probable that joey pankowski was the childs father she had trouble with pankowski too i expected better from humboldts private secretary i took the receiver away from my ear and looked at it as though i could see ms hollingsworths face in it or humboldts at last i held it back to my mouth and asked do you know who did the investigation for mr humboldt i believe he interested himself directly in the matter she said primly i said slowly i think dr chigwell may have misled mr humboldt its important that i see him to discuss the matter with him i doubt that very much ms warshawski mr humboldt and the doctor have worked together a long time if he gave mr humboldt the information you may certainly depend on it perhaps so i tried to make my tone conciliatory but mr humboldt told me himself that his staff sometimes try to protect him from unfortunate events i suspect something like that may have been going on in this case really she said huffily you may work in an environment where people cant trust each other but dr chigwell has been a most reliable associate of mr humboldts for fifty years maybe someone like you cant appreciate it but the idea of dr chigwell lying to mr humboldt is totally ludicrous just one thing before you hang up in righteous indignation someone misled mr humboldt terribly about the true nature of the suit pankowski and ferraro brought against xerxes thats why im not too confident about this last bit of news there was a pause then she said grudgingly ill mention the matter to mr humboldt but i doubt very much that hell want to talk to you that was the best i could get from her i frowned at the phone some more wondering what i would say to humboldt if i saw him fruitless i locked up the office and drove up to the little hardware store on diversey they hadnt wanted to talk to me on the phone but when they saw i was prepared to be vocal in front of their customers they took me into the back and reluctantly wrote out another check plus the ten dollars handling for the bad one i paid it directly into my bank and went home slipping in through the back entrance i managed to sidestep mr contreras and the dog i stopped in the kitchen to inspect the food supply still grim i fixed a bowl of popcorn and took it into the living room with me popcorn and corned beefumum good fourthirty is a terrible time to find anything on tvi flipped through game shows sesame street and the beaming face of the frugal gourmet i finally turned off the set in disgust and reached for the phone the chigwells were listed under clios name she answered on the third ring her voice distant unyielding yes she remembered who i was she didnt think her brother would want to speak to me but she went to see anyway he didnt look ms chigwell i hate having to be such a pest but theres something i want to know has gustav humboldt called him in the last few days she was surprised how did you know i didnt his secretary passed on some information that humboldt supposedly got from your brother i wondered if humboldt made it up what did he say curtis told him that joey pankowski was caroline djiaks father she asked me to explain who they were then went off to confront her brother she was gone for a quarter of an hour i finished the popcorn and did some leg raises lying with the phone near my ear so i could hear her return she came back on the line abruptly he says he knew about the man that the girls mother had told him all about it back when they hired her i see i said weakly the trouble is you cant spend your whole life with someone without knowing when theyre lying i dont know what part of it curtis is making up but one thing i can tell youhed say anything gustav humboldt told him to while i struggled to add this news to my pickled brain something else struck me why are you telling me this ms chigwell i dont know she said surprised maybe after seventynine years im tired of having curtis hide behind me goodbye she hung up with an abrupt click i spent saturday stewing about humboldt and chigwell unable to think of any reason why they would concoct a story about louisa and joey unable to think of a way to get a handle on them when murray ryerson head of the heraldstar s crime bureau called me on sunday because one of his gofers had dug up the news that nancy cleghorn and i went to high school together i even agreed to talk to him murray follows de paul basketball or slobbers over it although i liveand diewith the cubs every year and maintain a wistful love for the bears otis wilson i dont really care whether the blue demons ever score another basket in chicago thats extreme heresyequivalent to saying you hate st patricks day parades so i agreed to truck out to the horizon and watch them scrap around with indiana or loyola or whoever anyway murray said you can sit there remembering how you and nancy handled the same shots only better it will give a more intense flavor to your memories de paul lost a squeaker with murray commenting libelously on young joey meyer and the entire offense during the hour wait to move from the parking lot back to the tollway it was only when we were in ethels a lithuanian restaurant on the northwest side filling murrays sixfour frame with a few dozen sweetandsour cabbage rolls that he got down to the real business of the afternoon so whats your interest in cleghorns death he asked casually family call you in to investigate the cops got a tip that i sent her to her death i calmly ate another fluffy dumpling id have to run ten miles in the morning to work off all this come on i mustve heard a dozen people say youve been nosing around down there whats going on i shook my head i told you im clearing my name yeah and im the ayatollah of detroit i love it when im telling murray the truth and hes convinced its a big coverupit gives me terrific leverage unfortunately there wasnt much to pry out of him the police had called on steve dresberg on dresbergs mouthpiece leon haas on a few dozen other upstanding south chicagoansincluding some old lovers of nancysand didnt have anything they considered a real lead murray finally got tired of the game i guess theres enough that we could do a little humaninterest story of nancy and you in college living on table scraps and studying the classics in between creaming the best womens teams in the region i hate giving you print space when youre not earning it but itll help keep her name in front of the states attorney thanks a whole bunch murray when he dropped me at my place on racine i got in my car and headed for hinsdale seeing him had given me a nasty little idea on a way to pressure chigwell it was close to seven when i rang the bell at the side door not the ideal time for paying house calls when ms chigwell answered my ring i tried to make myself look earnest and trustworthy her stern features didnt give me any clue as to whether i was succeeding curtis wont talk to you she said in her abrupt way showing no surprise at my appearance try this on him i suggested in an earnest trustworthy manner his picture on the front page of the heraldstar and some heartwarming stories on his medical career she looked at me grimly why she didnt just shut the door in my face i didnt understand and why she went off to deliver the message puzzled me still further it reminded me of some elderly cousins of my beloved exhusband dick two brothers and a sister who lived together the brothers had quarreled some thirteen years previously and refused to speak so they would ask the sister to pass them salt marmalade and tea and she obligingly did so however dr chigwell came to the door in person this time not trusting his sister with the marmalade with his thin neck bobbing forward he looked like a harassed turkey listen here young lady i dont have to take these threats if youre not away from this door in thirty seconds im calling the police and you can explain to them why youve started a persecution campaign he had me i could just imagine trying to tell a suburban copor even bobby mallorythat one of chicagos ten wealthiest men was lying to me and getting his old plant doctor to collude i bowed my head in resignation consider me gone the reporter wholl be calling you in the morning is named murray ryerson ill explain to him about your old medical cases and so on get out of here his voice had turned to a hiss that chilled my blood i left tombstone blues nancys funeral was scheduled for eleven monday morning in the methodist church she had attended as a child i seem to spend too much time at the funerals of friendsi have a navy suit associated so strongly with them that i cant bring myself to wear it anywhere else i dawdled around in panty hose and a blouse unable to shake a superstitious dread that putting on the suit would make nancys death final i couldnt set my mind to anything to chigwell or humboldt to organizing a plan to beat the police to nancys killer or even to organizing the spreading papers in my living room that was where i had started the morning thinking with a few hours on my hands i could get things put away i was too fragmented to create order suddenly at ten of ten still in my underwear i looked up the number for humboldts corporate offices and phoned an indifferent operator switched me through to his office where i reached not clarissa hollingsworth but her assistant when i asked for mr humboldt after a certain amount of dickering i got ms hollingsworth the cool alto greeted me patronizingly i havent had a chance to speak to mr humboldt about seeing you ms warshawski ill make sure that he gets the message but he doesnt come in every day anymore yeah i dont suppose you call him at home for consultations either in case you do you might add to my other message that i saw dr chigwell last night she finished the conversation with a condescending speed that left me shouting into a dead phone i finished dressing as easily as i could with my hands shaking and headed south once more mount of olives methodist dated to the turn of the century its highbacked dark pews and giant rose window evoking a time when it was filled with women in long dresses and children in highbuttoned shoes todays congregation couldnt afford to keep up the stainedglass windows showing jesus in calvary places where jesuss brooding ascetic face had been broken were filled in with wired burglar glass making him look like a sufferer from an acute skin disease while nancys four brothers served as ushers their children sat in the front pews shoving and poking at each other despite the near presence of their aunts draped casket their harshly whispered insults could be heard throughout the nave until drowned by some melancholy bars from the organ i went up to the front to let mrs cleghorn know i was there she smiled at me with tremulous warmth come over to the house after the service she whispered well have coffee and a chance to talk she invited me to sit with her glancing distastefully at her grandchildren i disengaged myself gentlyi didnt want to be a buffer between her and the wrestling monsters besides i wanted to go to the back so i could see who showed upits a cliché but murderers often cant resist going to their victims funerals maybe part of a primitive superstition trying to make sure the person is really dead that she gets truly buried so her ghost doesnt walk after id settled myself near the entrance diane logan swept in resplendent in her silver fox she brushed my cheek and squeezed my hand before moving up the aisle who was that a voice muttered in my ear i gave a start and turned around it was sergeant mcgonnigal trying to look mournful in a dark suit so the police were also hopeful she used to play basketball with nancy and me she owns a gold coast pr firm nowadays i muttered back i dont think she slugged nancyshe could outplay her twenty years ago today too come to think of it i dont know everyones nametell me which one the killer is he smiled a little when i saw you sitting here i thought my worries were overlittle polish detective is going to nab the murderer in front of the altar methodist church i muttered i dont think they call it an altar caroline clattered in with the group of people id seen in the scrap office with her they had the preternatural earnestness of those who dont often find themselves at solemn functions carolines copper curls were brushed into a semblance of tidiness she wore a black suit designed for a much taller womanthe bunched clumps of material at the bottom showed where shed hemmed it with her usual impatient inefficiency if she saw me she gave no sign moving with the scrap contingent to a pew about halfway up the aisle behind them came a handful of older women perhaps mrs cleghorns pals at the local branch of the library when theyd passed i saw a thin young man standing in their wake the dim light picked out his angular silhouette he looked around uncertainly saw me staring at him and looked away the selfdeprecating embarrassment with which he turned his head brought back to me who he was young art jurshak hed made just such an effacing move in talking to the old ward heelers at his fathers office in the halflight from the windows i couldnt make out his beautifully chiseled features he sidled into a seat toward the back mcgonnigal tapped me on the shoulder whos that alfalfa sprout he growled i smiled seraphically and put a finger to my lipsthe organ had begun to play loudly signaling the arrival of the minister we went through abide with me at such a slow pace that i kept bracing myself for each succeeding chord the minister was a short plump man whose remaining black hair was combed in two neat rows on either side of a wrinkled dome he looked like the kind of tv preacher who makes your stomach turn but as he spoke i realized id made the dread mistake of judging by appearances he clearly had known nancy well and spoke of her with eloquent forcefulness i felt my throat tighten again and leaned back in the pew to inspect the ceiling beams the wood had been painted in the blue and orange stencils popular in victorian churches by focusing on the intricate lacy patterns i was able to relax enough to join in the final hymn i kept glancing at young art he spent the service perched on the edge of his pew gripping the back of the bench in front of him when the last chords of in heavenly love abiding had finally been wrenched painfully from the organ he slid out of his seat and headed for the exit i caught up with him on the porch where he was moving nervously from foot to foot unable to free himself from a drunk panhandler when i touched arts arm he jumped i didnt know you and nancy were friends i said she never mentioned you to me he mumbled something that sounded like knew her slightly im v i warshawski nancy and i played high school and college basketball together i saw you at the tenth ward office last week youre art jurshaks son arent you at that his chiseledmarble face turned even whiter i was afraid he might faint even though he was a slender young man i wasnt sure i could break his fall the drunk whod been listening interestedly sidled closer your friend looks pretty sick lady how about fifty cents for coffeecup for him cup for me i turned my back on him firmly and took arts elbow im a private detective and im trying to look into nancys death if you were friends with her id like to talk to you about her connections with your fathers office he shook his head dumbly his blue eyes dark with fear after a long internal debate he seemed to be on the brink of forcing himself to speak unfortunately as he opened his mouth the other mourners began emerging from the church as soon as people started passing us art wrenched himself from my grip and bolted down the street i tried to follow but tripped over the drunk i cursed him roundly as i pulled myself back to my feet he was reviling me in return but broke off suddenly as mcgonnigal appearedyears of living around the police gave him a sixth sense about them even in plainclothes whats the redhead so scared of warshawski the sergeant demanded ignoring the panhandler we watched art get into his car a latemodel chrysler parked at the end of the street and tear off i have that effect on men i said shortly drives them mad you find your murderer i dont know your male model here was the only person acting suspiciously why dont you show what a helpful citizen you are and give me his name i turned to face him its no secretthe name is real well known down in these parts art jurshak mcgonnigals lips tightened just because mallorys my boss doesnt mean you have to jerk me around the way you do him tell me the kids name i held up my right hand scouts honor sergeant jurshaks his old man young art just joined his agency or his office or something if you catch up with him dont use a rubber hosei dont think hes got too much stamina mcgonnigal grinned savagely dont worry warshawski hes got stronger protection than a thick skin i wont mess up his curly locks you going over to the cleghorn place for coffee i heard some of the ladies talking about what they were bringing mind if i slide in with you we little polish detectives live to help the cops come along he grinned and held the car door open for me that get under your skin warshawski my apologiesyoure not all that little a handful of mourners were already at the house on muskegon when we got there mrs cleghorn her makeup streaked with dried tears greeted me warmly and accepted mcgonnigal politely i stood in the little entryway talking with her for a minute while the sergeant wandered into the back of the house kerry took the children to her house so things will be a little calmer today she said maybe when i retire ill move to oregon i hugged her go across the country to avoid being a grandmother maybe you could just change the locksitd be less drastic i guess it proves how upset i am victoria talking like thative never wanted anyone to know how i felt about my sons children she paused a moment then added awkwardly if you want to talk to ron kappelman aboutabout nancy or anything hes in the living room the doorbell rang while she moved to answer it i crossed the little hall to the living room id never seen ron kappelman but i didnt have any trouble recognizing himhe was the only man in the room he was about my age perhaps a bit older stocky with dark brown hair cut close to his head he wore a gray tweed jacket which was frayed at the lapels and cuffs and corduroy pants he was sitting by himself on a round naugahyde hassock flipping idly through the pages of an old national geographic the four women in the room the ones from church id assumed were mrs cleghorns coworkers were murmuring together in the other corner they glanced over at me saw they didnt know me and went back to their gentle buzzing i pulled up a straightbacked chair next to kappelman he glanced at me made a bit of a face then tossed the magazine back to the coffee table i know i said sympathetically its a pain to talk to strangers at an affair like this i wouldnt do it if i didnt think you could help me he raised his eyebrows i doubt it but you can try me my names v i warshawski im an old friend of nancys we played basketball together a while back a long while back i cant get over how fast the years started zipping by after my thirtieth birthday it just didnt seem that long since nancy and i had been in college sure i know who you are nance talked about you a number of timessaid you kept her from going mad when the two of you were in high school im ron kappelman but you seemed to know that when you came in nancy tell you im a private investigator these days well i hadnt seen her for quite some time but we got together for a basketball reunion a week or so ago yeah i know he cut in we went to a meeting together right after she talked about it a swarm of people buzzed into the room even though they were keeping their voices subdued there wasnt enough space to absorb the bodies or the sound someone standing over me lighted a cigarette and i felt hot ash land on the round neck of my bolero jacket could we go somewhere to talk i asked nancys old bedroom or a bar or something im trying to look into her death but i cant seem to get a thread to pull on i was hoping you could tell me something he shook his head believe me if i thought i had any hot dope idve been to the cops like a rocket but id be glad to get out of here we pushed our way through the crowd paying affectionate respects to mrs cleghorn as we left the warmth with which she spoke to kappelman seemed to indicate that he and nancy had remained on good terms i wondered vaguely what had happened to mcgonnigal but he was a big cop he could look after himself outside kappelman said why dont you follow me down to my place in pullman there isnt any coffee shop nearby thats clean and quiet as you surely know i trailed his decrepit rabbit down side streets to th and langley he stopped in front of one of the tidy brick row houses that line pullmans streets houses with sheer fronts and stoops that make you think of pictures of philadelphia when the constitution was signed the neat wellkept exterior didnt really prepare me for the meticulous restoration inside the walls were papered in bright victorian floral designs the paneling refinished to a glow of dark walnut the furniture and rugs beautifully maintained period pieces set on wellfinished hardwood floors this is gorgeous i said overwhelmed did you fix it up yourself he nodded carpentry is kind of my hobbymakes a good switch from mucking about with the stunads i spend my days with the furniture is all stuff i picked up at area flea markets he led me into a little kitchen with italian tile on the floor and countertops and gleaming copperbottomed pots on the walls i perched on a high stool at one side of a tiled island while he made coffee at the burners on the other so who asked you to investigate nancys death her mother not sure the cops will buck the politicos down here and see that justice runs its inexorable course he cocked an eye at me while deftly assembling an infusion pot nope if you know mrs cleghorn at all you must realize her mind doesnt run to vengeance so whos your client he turned to the refrigerator and laid out cream and a plate of muffins i absentmindedly watched the seat of his trousers tighten across his rear while he bent over the seam was fraying a few more deep bends could create an interesting situation i nobly refrained from dropping a plate at his feet but waited to answer until he was facing me again part of what my clients buy when they hire me is confidentiality if i blabbed their secrets to you i could hardly expect you to blab yours to me could i he shook his head i havent got any secrets at least not relating to nancy cleghorn im the counsel for scrap i work for a number of community groupspublic interest laws my specialty nancy was great to work with she was organized clearheaded knew when to fight and when to drop back unlike her boss caroline it was hard to picture caroline djiak as anyones boss so all your dealings with nancy were purely professional he pointed a coffee spoon at me dont try to trip me up warshawski i play ball with the big boys cream you ought to you knowbinds with the caffeine and keeps you from getting stomach cancer he set a heavy porcelain mug in front of me and stuck the plate of muffins into the microwave no nance and i had a brief fling a couple of years back when i started at scrap she was getting over a heavy thing and id been divorced about ten months we cheered each other up but we didnt have anything special to offer each other besides friendship which is special enough that you dont screw it up certainly not by banging your friends on the head and dropping them in a swamp he took the muffins out of the oven and climbed onto a stool at the end of the counter on my left i drank some of the rich coffee and took a blueberry muffin ill let the cops take you through your paces where were you thursday afternoon at two pm and so on what i really want to know though is who nancy thought was following her did she think shed got dresbergs back up or did it really have anything to do with the recycling plant he grimaced little carolines theorywhich makes me want to trash it not a good attitude for her outfits counsel to take truth is i dont know we were both pissed as hell after the hearing two weeks ago when we talked on tuesday nance said shed cover the political angle see if she could find out if and why jurshak was blocking it i was working on the legal stuff wondering if we could finesse the msdmetropolitan sanitary districtto get the permit maybe get the state and us epa departments involved he absentmindedly ate a second muffin and buttered a third his bulging waistline made me shake my head when he offered me the plate so you dont know who she talked to in jurshaks office he shook his head i had the impression nothing concrete to go on but i think she had a lover there someone she was a little ashamed of seeing and didnt want her pals to know about or someone she thought she had to protect he stared into the distance trying to put his feelings into words canceling dinner plans not wanting to go to the hawks games which we shared season tickets to stuff like that so she couldve been getting information from him and not wanting me to know about it the last time we spokea week ago today it must have beenshe said she thought she was onto something but she needed more evidence i never talked to her again he stopped abruptly and busied himself with his coffee well what about dresberg based on what you know of the situation down there would you think he mightve been against this recycling center god i wouldnt think so although with a guy like that you never know look he set down his coffee cup and leaned intently across the counter sketching dresbergs operations with sweeping gestures the garbage empire included hauling incinerating storagecontainer and landfill operations within his domain dresberg was protective of any perceived encroachmentseven any questioning hence the threats a year before when caroline and nancy had tried to oppose a new pcb incinerator that didnt meet code standards but the recycling center didnt have anything to do with any of his operations he finished xerxes and glowrite are just dumping into their own lagoons right now all scrap would do is take the wastes and recycle them i thought about it he could see expansion potential cutting into his business down the road or maybe he wants scrap to use his trucks to do the hauling he shook his head if that was the case hed just be putting an arm on them to use his trucks not offing nancy im not saying its impossible he was involved the plants certainly in his sphere but it doesnt leap out at me on the surface we let the talk drift after that to friends we had in common at the illinois bar to my cousin boomboom whom kappelman used to watch at the stadium when he was with the hawks theres never been another player like him kappelman said regretfully youre telling me i got up and put on my coat so if you come across something strangeanything whether it seems to have a direct bearing on nancys death or notgive me a call okay yeah sure his gaze seemed a little unfocused he seemed about to say something then changed his mind shook my hand and escorted me to the door in his fathers shadow i didnt disbelieve kappelman i didnt believe him either i mean the guy made a living persuading judges and commissioners to support community groups instead of the industrial or political heavyweights they usually favored despite his frayed trousers and jacket i suspected he was pretty convincing and if nancy and he were the good buddies he claimed theyd been was it really credible that she hadnt given him the ghost of an idea about what shed learned from the aldermans office of course it was a little pat on my part looking for dresberg to be the fall guy just because he had made threats in the past and had a lot of muscle and was interested in waste disposal i meandered across side streets and headed into east side to the ward offices on avenue m it was a little after three and the place was hopping i passed a couple of patrol cops coming out when i got into the main office my old pals with the paunches were hard at it with a halfdozen or so favorseekers another couple maybe patronage workers through with street cleaning for the day were playing checkers in the window nobody really looked at me but the conversations quieted down im looking for young art i said amiably in the direction of the bald man whod been the spokesman on my first visit not here he said briefly without looking up when do you expect him the three office workers exchanged the silent communication id observed earlier and agreed that my question warranted a slight chuckle we dont baldy said going back to his client do you know where else i could find him we dont keep tabs on the kid baldy expanded thinking perhaps of the claim drafts they were expecting from me sometimes he shows up in the afternoon sometimes he dont he hasnt been in today so he might turn up you never know i see i picked up the suntimes from his desk and sat in one of the chairs lining the wall it was an old wooden one yellow and scuffed extremely uncomfortable i read sylvia skimmed the sports pages and tried interesting myself in the latest greylord trial shifting my pelvis around on the hard surface in an unsuccessful search for a spot that wouldnt rub against my bones after about half an hour i gave it up and put one of my cards on baldys desk v i warshawski ill try back in a bit tell him to call me if i miss him except for the blueberry muffin ron kappelman had given me i hadnt really eaten today i went down to the comer of ewing where a neighborhood bar advertised submarines and italian beef and had a meatball sub with a draft im not much of a beer drinker but it seemed more suited to the neighborhood than diet soda when i got back to the ward office the visitors had pretty well cleared out except for the checker players in the comer baldy shook his head at me to indicatei thinkthat young art hadnt been in i felt proud of myselfi was beginning to seem like a regular i pulled a little spiral notebook from my bag to entertain myself while i waited i tried calculating the expenses id incurred since starting to look for caroline djiaks old man ive always been a little jealous of kinsey milhones immaculate recordkeeping i didnt even have receipts for meals or gas certainly not for cleaning up the magli pumps which was going to run close to thirty dollars id gotten up to two hundred and fifty when young art came in with his usual diffident step there was something in his face a naked desire for acceptance from the tired old pols in the room that made me flinch they looked at him unblinkingly waiting for him to speak and finally he obliged anyanything for me from my dad he licked his lips reflexively baldy shook his head and returned to his paper lady wants to talk to you he said from the depths of the suntimes art hadnt seen me until thenhed been too intent on the disappointment he felt bound to suffer from the men he looked around the room then and located me he didnt recognize me at first his perfect forehead furrowed in a momentary question it wasnt until hed come over to shake my hand that he remembered where hed seen me and then he didnt think he could flee without achieving total humiliation where can we go to talk i asked briskly taking his hand in a firm grasp in case he decided to chance the indignity he smiled unhappily upstairs i guess ii have an office a small office i followed him up the linoleumcovered stairs to a suite with his fathers name on it a middleaged woman her brown hair neatly coiffed above a wellcut dress was sitting in the outer office her desk was a little jungle of potted plants twined around family photographs behind her were doors to the inner offices one with art srs name repeated on it the other blank your dad isnt here art she said in a motherly way hes been at a council meeting all day i really dont expect him until wednesday he flushed miserably thanks mrs may i just need to use my office for a few minutes of course art you dont need my permission to do that she continued to stare at me hoping to force me to introduce myself it seemed to me it would be a small but important victory for art if she didnt know whom he was seeing i smiled at her without speaking but id underestimated her tenacity im ida maiercyk but everyone calls me mrs may she said as i passed her desk how do you do i continued to smile and went on by to where art was standing miserably in front of his office i hoped she was scowling impotently but didnt turn around to check art flipped on a wall switch and illuminated one of the most barren cubicles id seen outside a monastery it held a plain pressedwood desk and two metal folding chairs nothing else not even a filing cabinet to give the pretense of work a wise alderman knows better than to live above the community thats supporting him especially when half that community is out of work but this was downright insulting even the secretary had more lavish appointments why do you put up with this i demanded with what he said flushing again you knowwith that loathsome woman out there treating you like a submoronic twoyearold with those ward heelers waiting to bait you like a carp why dont you go get a position in someone elses agency he shook his head these things arent as easy as they look to you i just graduated two years ago ifif i can prove to my dad that i can handle some of his workload his voice trailed away if youre hanging around hoping for his approval youll be here the rest of your life i said brutally if he doesnt want to give it to you theres nothing you can do to make him youre better off stopping the effort because youre only making yourself miserable and youre not impressing him he gave an unhappy little smile that made me want to take him by the scruff of the neck and shake him you dont know him and you dont know me so you dont know what youre talking about im justive always beenjust too big a disappointment but its nothing to do with you if youve come around to talk to me about nancy cleghorn i cant help you any more than i could this morning you and she were lovers werent you i wondered if his chiseled good looks could possibly have compensated nancy for his youth and insecurity he shook his head without speaking nancy had a lover here that she didnt want any of her friends to know about it doesnt seem too likely that it was moe curly or larry downstairs or even mrs maynancy had better taste than that and anyway why else would you go to her funeral maybe i just respected the work she was doing here in the community he muttered mrs may opened the door without knocking you two need anything if you dont im going to take off now you want to leave any message for your father about your meeting art he looked helplessly at me for a second then just shook his head again without speaking thanks mrs may i said genially it was good to meet you she shot me a look of venom and snapped the door to i could see her shadow outlined against the glass upper half of the door as she hesitated over a possible retaliatory strike then her silhouette faded as she marched off toward home if you dont want to talk about your relations with nancy maybe you can just give me the same information you gave her about big arts interest in scraps recycling plant he gripped the front of the pressedwood desk and looked at me imploringly i didnt tell her anything i hardly knew her and i dont know what my dad is doing about their recycling plant now can you please go away id be as happy asas anybody if you found her killer but you must see i dont know anything about her i scowled in frustration he was upset but it sure wasnt because of me he had to have been nancys lover had to otherwise he wouldnt have been in church this morning but i couldnt think of any way to get him to trust me enough to talk about it yeah i guess ill go one last question how well do you know leon haas he looked at me blankly i never heard of him steve dresberg his face went totally white and he fainted on me you cant go home again by the time i got home it was past dark i had stayed in south chicago long enough to make sure young art was fit to drive it seemed unnecessarily cruel to turn him over to the ward heelers for comfort but my display of charity didnt make him any more willing to talk frustrated i finally left him at the door of the ward office the drive north brought me no solace i walked wearily up the front walk dropped my keys as i fumbled with the inner lobby door then dropped them again as i was going upstairs bonetired i turned back down the stairs to retrieve them behind mr contrerass door peppy gave a welcoming bark as i headed back up i heard his locks scraping back behind me i stiffened waiting for the flow that you doll you just getting back your friends funeral was today huh you havent been out drinking have you people think its a way to drown their sorrows but believe me it only causes you more grief than you started with i should knowi tried it more than once but then when clara died i took one drink and remembered how it used to get her down me coming home from a funeral with a good one tied on i said i wouldnt do it not for her not after all the times she told me how stupid i was crying over some friend when i was too drunk to get his name out straight no i said forcing a smile holding my hand out for the dog to lick i havent been drinking i had to see a whole bunch of people not a lot of fun well you go on upstairs and take a hot bath doll by the time youve done that and had a chance to rest ill have some dinner ready i have me a nice steak ive been saving for sometime special and thats what you need when youre feeling this low a little red meat get your blood flowing again and lifell look a whole lot better to you thanks i said its very good of you but i really dont nope you think you want to be alone but believe me cookie thats the worst thing for you when youre feeling like this her royal highness and ill get you fed and then if youre ready to be on your own again you say the word and well be back down here on the double i just couldnt bring myself to bring the cloud of hurt to his faded brown eyes by insisting on being alone cursing myself for my soft heart i trudged up the stairs to my apartment despite my neighbors dire words i headed straight for the black label bottle kicking off my pumps and pulling off my panty hose while i unscrewed the cap i drank from the bottle a long swallow that sent a glow of warmth to my weary shoulders filling a glass i took it into the bathroom with me i dumped my funeral suit on the floor and climbed into the tub by the time mr contreras showed up with the steak i was a little drunk and much more relaxed than id have thought possible a half hour before he had already had dinner he brought his grappa bottle to keep me company while i ate after a few bites i grudgingly admittedonly to myselfthat hed been right about the food life did start to look better the steak was done to a turn crisply brown on the outside red within hed cooked up some pan fries with garlic and brought his conscientious nod to my diet a plate of lettuce he was a good plain cook selftaught as a hobby during his widowhoodhed never done more in the kitchen than fetch beer when his wife was still alive i was finishing off the fries with the rest of the meat juice when the phone rang i handed peppy the bone shed been eyeingnot begging for just keeping an eye on in case someone broke in and tried to steal itand went over to the piano where id left the livingroom extension warshawski it was a mans voice cold and harsh not one i knew yes maybe its time you butted out of south chicago warshawski you dont live there anymore you dont have any business there i wished i hadnt had the third whiskey and desperately tried assembling my scrambled brain and you do i asked insolently he ignored me i hear you can swim pretty good warshawski but the swimmer hasnt been born that can float through a swamp you calling on art jurshaks behalf or steve dresbergs it doesnt matter to you warshawski because if youre smart youre butting out and if youre not you wont be around to worry about it he hung up my knees felt slightly weak i sat on the piano bench to steady myself bad news cookie mr contrerass weatherbeaten face showed kindly concern on second thought it wasnt such a bad idea to have him with me tonight just an oldstyle thug reminding me that chicagos the world floatfish capital i tried keeping my tone airy but the words came out heavier than i wanted he threaten you sort of i tried to grin but to my annoyance my lips were trembling the image of the rank marsh grasses the mud the shapeless fishing couple and their wild redeyed dog made me shiver uncontrollably mr contreras hovered over me solicitously shouldnt i get out my smith wesson call the police barricade the doors check into a hotel under an assumed name when i turned down those offers he suggested i call murray ryerson at the heraldstaran act of true nobility because he had a fierce jealousy of murray peppy sensing his tension dropped her bone and came over with a little bark its okay guys i assured them its just talk no ones going to shoot me at least not tonight mr contreras unable to do anything else offered me his grappa bottle i waved it aside the threat had cleared out my brain i didnt see any point in fogging it up again with my neighbors repellent booze on the other hand i wasnt quite ready to be on my own again amid the stack of old notebooks and school papers in the back closet i dug out a worn checker set my dad and bobby mallory used to linger over we played four or five games the dog contentedly returning to her bone in the comer behind the piano mr contreras was just getting reluctantly to his feet when the doorbell rang the dog let out a deep bark the old man became extremely excited urging me to get out my gun to let him go downstairs telling me to go down the back way and summon help oh nonsense i said no ones going to shoot me in my own home two hours after a phone calltheyll at least wait until morning to see if ive listened to them i went to the intercom by the front door vic let me in i need to see you it was caroline djiak i pressed the button releasing the lobby door and went out to wait in the upper hallway for her peppy stood next to me her golden tail lowered and moving gently to show she was on the alert caroline ran up the stairs her feet clattering on the uncarpeted risers like an ancient el rounding the curve at thirtyfifth street vic she shrieked when she saw me what are you doing i thought i told you to stop looking for my father why cant you just once do what i ask you to peppy taking exception to her ferocity began to bark one of the secondfloor tenants came to his door and yelled up at us to shut up some people have to work you know before mr contreras could leap to my defense i took caroline firmly by the arm and dragged her into my apartment mr contreras looked at her critically deciding she wasnt dangerousat least not an immediate physical threat he stuck a calloused hand at her and introduced himself caroline was in no mood for ordinary civility vic im begging you i came all this way since you wouldnt listen to me on the phone youve got to leave my affairs alone caroline djiak i informed mr contreras shes pretty upset maybe you should leave me to talk to her he started getting the dinner dishes together i pulled caroline to the couch what is going on with you caroline what is frightening you so much im not frightened she yelled im angry angry with you for not leaving me alone when i asked you to look kiddo im not a television you turn on and off i could overlook my conversation with your grandparentstheyre so sick nothing i could do would make any difference to them anyway but everyone at humboldt chemical is lying to me about the men your mother used to work with the ones who had the best chance of being your father i just cant let that go and its not trivial what theyre sayingtheyre completely reinventing the last years of these guys lives vic you dont understand she grabbed my right hand in her intensity squeezing it hard you cant keep crossing these people theyre totally ruthless you dont know what they might do such as what she looked wildly around the room seeking inspiration they might kill you vic they might see you end up in the swamp the way nancy did or in the river mr contreras had stopped all pretense of getting ready to leave i removed my hand from carolines grasp and stared at her coldly okay i want the truth now not your embellished version what do you know about the people who killed nancy nothing vic nothing honestly you have to believe me its just just just what i grabbed her shoulders and shook her who threatened nancy youve been saying for the last week that it was art jurshak because he didnt want her starting the recycling plant now you want it to be the people down at xerxes because im hunting for your old man there goddamnit caroline cant you see how important this is cant you see that this is life and death thats what ive been telling you vic she shouted so loudly that the dog started barking again thats why im telling you to mind your own business caroline i felt my voice go into an upper register and tried to get a grip on myself before i broke her neck i moved to the easy chair next to the sofa caroline who called you dr chigwell art jurshak steve dresberg gustav humboldt himself no one vic the gentian eyes were awash with tears no one you just dont understand anything about life in south chicago anymore youve been away so long cant you just take my word for it take my word that you should quit already i ignored her ron kappelman did he call you this afternoon people talk to me she said you know how it is down there at least you would if if i hadnt been a chicken shit and run away i finished for her youve been hearing little rumblings around the office that someoneyou dont know whohas it in for me and youre here to save my butt thanks a bundle youre scared out of your little mind caroline i want to know whos been frightening you and dont tell me its some street snitch with tales of drowning me because i just wont buy it you wouldnt be beside yourself if it was just that lay it out for me now caroline jerked herself to her feet what do i have to do to get you to listen to me she screamed someone called me today from the xerxes plant and said they were sorry id gone to all the expense of hiring you they said that they had proof that joey pankowski was my father they told me to get you to believe me and get off the case and did they offer to show you this remarkable evidence i didnt need to see it im not as untrusting as you are i put a restraining hand on peppy who was starting to growl and did they threaten you with mayhem if you didnt force me to withdraw i wouldnt care what anyone threatened me with cant you believe that i looked at her as calmly as i could she was wild manipulative unscrupulous in getting her own way but i would never in my remotest imagination think of her as a coward i can believe it i said slowly but i want to hear the truth did they really tell you theyd hurt me if i didnt stop looking the gentian eyes turned away yes she muttered not good enough caroline believe what you want to if they kill you dont expect me to show up at your funeral because i wont care she burst into tears and stormed out of the apartment white elephant mr contreras finally left around one i slept fitfully my mind thrashing over carolines visit caroline didnt fear anything thats why she confidently followed me into lake michigans pounding surf when she was four years old even a neardrowning hadnt scared hershed been ready to go right back again when id gotten her lungs cleaned out if someone had told her my life was on the line it mightve made her mad but it wouldnt terrify her someone had called to tell her joey pankowski was her father she couldnt have pulled that out of the blue but had they added a rider about hurting me or was that an inspired guess i hadnt seen her for a decade but you dont forget the mannerisms of the people you grow up with that sidelong glance when i asked her directly made me think she was lying the only reason i believed her at allabout the threat that iswas because id gotten my own call until caroline showed up id been assuming my threat came from art jurshak because id accosted his son or because id talked to ron kappelman but what if it came from humboldt when the orange clock readout glowed threefifteen i turned on the light and sat up in bed to use the phone murray ryerson had left the paper fortyfive minutes earlier he wasnt home yet on the chance i tried the golden glowsal shuts down at four third time lucky vic im overwhelmed you had insomnia and you thought of me i can see the headline nowgirl detective cant sleep for love and i thought it was the onions i had for dinner mustve been what was wrong with me the day i agreed to marry dick you know our little conversation yesterday what little conversation he snorted i told you stuff about nancy cleghorn and you sat with velcro on your mouth something came back to me i said limpidly better make it good warshawski curtis chigwell i said hes a doctor who lives in hinsdale used to work at a plant down in south chicago he killed nancy cleghorn as far as i know he never met nancy cleghorn i felt rather than heard murray sputter its been a tough day vi dont make me play twenty questions with you i reached down next to the bed for a tshirt somehow the night was making me feel too exposed in my nakedness as i leaned over the lamplight highlighted dust in the corner of the bedroom if i lived past next week id vacuum thats what ive got for you i said slowly twenty questions no answers curtis chigwell knows something that he doesnt want to tell twentyfour hours ago i didnt think it had the remotest possible connection to nancy but i got a threatening phone call tonight telling me to bug out of south chicago from chigwell i could almost feel murrays breath through the phone line no i thought it had to come from jurshak or dresberg only thing a couple of hours later i heard the same thing from someone who knows me only through the xerxes side the plant that chigwell used to work for i explained the discrepancies id gotten between manheim and humboldts version of pankowski and ferraros suitwithout telling him about hearing it from gustav humboldt himself chigwell knows what the truth is and why he just doesnt want to say and if the xerxes people are threatening me hell know why murray tried a thousand different ways to get me to tell him more about it i just couldnt give him caroline and louisalouisa didnt deserve to have her unhappy past spinning around the streets of chicago and i didnt know anything else anything about what possible connection there could be between nancys death and joey pankowski murray finally said youre not trying to help me youre getting me to do your legwork i can feel it but its not a bad storyill send someone out to talk to the guy when he hung up i managed to sleep a little but i woke again for good around sixthirty it was another gray february day sharp cold with snow would have been preferable to this unending misty chill i pulled on my sweats did my stretches and ruthlessly roused mr contreras by knocking on his door until the dog barked him awake i took her to the lake and back stopping now and then to tie my shoes to blow my nose to throw her a stickgestures that let me subtly check my rear i didnt think anyone was on it after depositing the dog i went to the comer diner for pancakes back home to change id just about made up my mind to visit louisa see if she could shed any light on carolines panic when ellen cleghorn called she was most upset shed gone over to nancys house in south chicago to collect her financial records and found the place ransacked ransacked i repeated foolishly how do you know the way you always do victoriathe place had been ripped to shreds nancy didnt have much and shed only been able to fix up a couple of rooms the furniture was pulled apart and her papers strewn all over the place i shuddered involuntarily sounds like housebreakers gone mad could you tell if anything was missing i didnt try to see her voice caught a little on a nervous sob i looked at her bedroom and ran out of there as fast as i could ii was hoping you might come down and go through the house with me i cant bear to be alone there with thisthis ravaging of nancy i promised to meet her in front of her house within the hour id wanted to go directly to nancys but mrs cleghorn was too nervous about the intruders to hang around her daughters house even outside i finished pulling on jeans and a sweatshirt and then not too happily went to the little wall safe id built into the bedroom closet and took out the smith wesson i dont make a habit of carrying a gunif you do you get dependent on them and your wits slow down but id been jumpy enough already between nancys murder and the threat to send me into the swamp after her now this housebreaking i supposed it could have been local punks casing the place and seeing that no one was home but tearing the furniture apart it could have been a druggie coked so far out of his mind that hed torn the furniture apart looking for money but it could also have been her killers looking for something she had that might incriminate them so i stuck a second clip into my handbag and pushed the loaded gun into my jeans waistband my wits were not fast enough to stop a speeding bullet the cleghorn house looked remote and bedraggled in the gray mist even the turret that had been nancys bedroom seemed to be drooping a little mrs cleghorn was waiting for me on the front walk her normally pleasant round face gaunt and strained she gave a tremulous smile and climbed into my car ill ride with you if you dont mind im shaking so badly i dont even know how i got home you can just give me her house keys i said you dont need to come along if youd be happier staying here she shook her head if you went by yourself id only spend the time worrying that someone was waiting in ambush for you while i followed her directions for the quickest way up along south chicago to yates i asked if shed called the police i thought id wait wait until you saw what happened thenshe gave a twisted little smilemaybe you could do it for me i think ive done all the talking to police that i can stand not just for now but forever i reached across the gearshift to pat her hand its okay happy to be of service nancys house was up on crandon near seventythird street i could see why mrs cleghorn called it a white elephanta big wooden monster its three full stories filled an outsize lot but i could also see why nancy had bought itthe little cupolas at the comers the stainedglass windows the carved wooden banister on the stairwell inside all evoked the comfort and order of alcott or thackeray it wasnt immediately obvious that someone had been in the house nancy had apparently put everything she had into buying it so the front hallway had no furniture it wasnt until i went up the oak stairs and found the main bedroom that i saw the damage i sympathized fully with mrs cleghorns decision to wait for me in the entryway nancy had apparently made the main bedroom her first rehab project the floor was finished the walls plastered and painted and a working fireplace with a tiled mantel and gleaming brass fittings was set in the wall opposite the bed the effect would have been charming except that the furniture and bedding had been thrown about the room i tiptoed gingerly through the rubble i was violating all possible police rulesnot calling to report the destruction walking through it and disturbing the evidence adding my detritus to that of the vandals but its only in rule books that every crime gets detailed lab inspection in real life i didnt think theyd pay too close attention even though the homeowner had been murdered whatever the vandals had been looking for didnt take up much space not only had they ripped the mattress cover away and slashed through the stuffing but they had taken up the grate in the fireplace and removed several bricks either money if i stayed with the cokedoutaddict theory or papers some kind of evidence nancy had of something so hideous people were willing to kill to keep it a secret i went back downstairs my own hands shaking a little the destruction of a house is such a personal violation if you cant be safe within your home base you feel you have no security anywhere mrs cleghorn was waiting at the bottom she put a motherly arm around my waistseeing me upset helped her gain some composure the dining room is the only other room nancy really had fixed up she was using the builtin cupboards as a little home office until she had the time and the money to fix up the study i suggested that mrs cleghorn continue to stay in the hall if the marauders hadnt found what they were looking for upstairs i had an unwilling vision of what the cupboards might look like the reality was far worse than anything i had brought myself to imagine plates and tableware lay scattered on the floor the seats had been ripped from the chairs all the shelves in the walnut cupboards that formed the far wall of the room were splintered and the papers that made up nancys personal life were strewn about like ticker tape the day after a big parade i compressed my lips tightly trying to hold my feelings in while i picked through the rubble by and by mrs cleghorn called to me from the doorway id been away so long shed gotten worried and braced herself to face the destruction together we culled bank statements picked an address book from the heap and took anything relating to mortgage or insurance for mrs cleghorn to go through later before leaving i poked around in the other rooms here and there a loose floorboard had been pried up the fireplacesthere were six altogetherwere missing their grates the oldfashioned kitchen had come in for its share of damage it probably hadnt looked too good to begin with its fixtures dating from the twenties old sink old icebox and badly peeling walls in typical vandal style the intruders had dumped flour and sugar on the floor and pulled all the food from the refrigerator if the police ever caught up with them id recommend a year spent fixing up the house as the first part of their sentence theyd come in through the back door the lock had been jimmied and they hadnt bothered to shut it properly behind them the backyard was so overgrown no one passing in the alley would be able to see that the place was open mrs cleghorn dug a hammer and nails out of the workshop nancy had set up next to the pantry i hammered a board across the back door to keep it shut there seemed to be nothing further we could do to restore wholeness to the place we left wordlessly back at the house on muskegon i called bobby to tell him what happened he grunted and said hed refer the matter to the third district but for me to stand by in case they wanted to ask me anything yeah sure i muttered ill stick by the phone for the rest of the week if itll keep the police happy perhaps it was just as well that bobby had already hung up mrs cleghorn busied herself with coffee she brought it to me in the dining room with leftover cake and salad what were they looking for victoria she finally asked after her second cup i picked moodily at some spice cake something small flat papers of some kind i suppose i dont think they can have found them or they wouldnt have been prying up the bricks in the other fireplaces so where else would nancy have left something youre sure she didnt drop anything off here mrs cleghorn shook her head she might have come in while i was at work buti dont know do you want to look at her old bedroom she sent me alone up the attic stairs to the old turret where nancy and i had waited for sister anne or battled pirates it was an unbearably sad room the remains of childhood sitting forlornly on the worn furniture i turned over teddy bears and trophies and a worn poster of the early beatles with studied indifference but found nothing the police arrived when i got back downstairs and we spent an hour or so talking to them we told them id gone over with mrs cleghorn to help her find nancys papersthat she didnt want to go alone and i was an old friend and that wed found the chaos and called them we talked to a couple of junior grade detectives who wrote everything down in slow longhand but didnt seem any more concerned about this breakin than that of any other south side householder they left eventually without giving us any special instructions or admonitions i got up to leave shortly after they did i dont want to alarm you but its possible that the people who were looking at nancys place will come here you should consider going to stay with one of your sons however much you may dislike it mrs cleghorn nodded reluctantly the only one of her sons who didnt have children lived in a trailer with his girlfriend not the ideal guesthouse i suppose i should get nancys car put away safely too who knows where these insane creatures will strike next her car i stopped in my tracks where is her car out front shed left it by the scrap offices and one of the women who works there brought it over for me after the funeral i had a spare set of car keys so they must her voice trailed off as she caught my expression of course we ought to look in the car oughtnt we if nancy really did have something aa killer wanted although i cant imagine what it could be shed said the same thing earlier and i repeated my own meaningless reassurances that nancy probably didnt know she had something someone else wanted so badly i went out to nancys skyblue honda with mrs cleghorn and pulled the heap of papers from the backseat nancy had dumped her briefcase there along with a stack of files too big to fit into the case why dont you just take them dear mrs cleghorn smiled tremulously if you can look after them get her work papers back to scrap it would be a big help to me i hoisted the heap under my left arm and put my right arm around her shoulders yeah sure call me if anything else happens or if you need help with the cops it was more work than i wanted but it seemed the least i could do under the circumstances mamas boy i sat in my car with the heater on flipping through nancys files anything that had to do with routine scrap business i put to one side i wanted to drop the lot at the office on commercial before leaving south chicago i was looking for something that would tell me why alderman jurshak was opposing the scrap recycling plant that was what nancy had been trying to find the last time i talked to her if shed been killed because of something hot she knew on the south side i assumed it was in connection with the plant in the end i did find a document with the jurshak name on it but it had nothing to do with the recycling proposalor any other environmental issue it was a photocopy of a letter dated back in to the mariners rest life assurance company explaining that jurshak parma were now fiduciaries for humboldt chemicals xerxes plant attached to it was an actuarial study showing that xerxes losses were in line with those of other comparable companies in the area and asking for the same rate consideration i read the report through three times it made no sense to me that is it made no sense as being the document that could have gotten nancy killed life and health insurance are not my specialty but this looked like perfectly ordinary straightforward insurance stuff it wouldnt even have seemed out of place to me except that it was so old and so unconnected to anything nancy worked on there was one person who could explain the significance to me well more than one but i didnt feel like going to big art with it where did you find this young lady oh blowing around the street you know how these things happen but young art might tell me even though he was clearly on the periphery of his fathers life he might know enough about the insurance side to explain the document or if nancy had found it and it had meant something to her she might have told him in fact she must have that was why he was so nervous he knew why shed been killed and he didnt want to let on that seemed like a good theory how to get art to reveal what he knew was another question altogether i contorted my face in an effort to concentrate when that didnt produce results i tried relaxing all my muscles and hoped that an idea would float to the top of my mind instead i found myself thinking about nancy and our childhood together the first time id gone to her house for dinner in fourth grade when her mother had served canned spaghetti id been afraid to tell gabriella what wed eateni thought she wouldnt let me go back to a house where they didnt make their own pasta it was nancy who got me to try out for the junior high basketball team id always been good at sports but softball was my game when i made the team my dad tacked a hoop to the side of the house and played with nancy and me he used to come to all our games in high school and after our last game in college the one against lake forest hed taken us to the empire room for drinks and dancing hed taught us how to fade how to fake the pass then turn and dunk and id won the game in the last seconds with just that move the fake and the dunk i sat up nancy and i had worked it so many times in the past why not now i didnt have any proof but let young art think i did i pulled nancys most recent diary from the stack on the seat next to me she had entered three phone numbers for him in her crabbed handwriting i made my best guess at deciphering them and went to the public phone outside the beach house the first number turned out to be the ward office where mrs mays syrupy tones denied knowledge of young arts whereabouts while trying to probe me for who i was and what i wanted she even offered me to art sr before i could end the conversation i dialed the second number and got the jurshak parma insurance offices there a nasaltoned receptionist told me at length that she hadnt seen young art since friday and shed like to know since when shed been hired to babysit for him the cops had been around this morning looking for him and she was supposed to get a contract typed by noon and how could she possibly do it if dont let me keep you i said shortly and hung up on her i dug in my pockets for change but id used my last two quarters nancy had penciled an address next to the third number down on avenue g that had to be arts home anyway if i got the kid on the phone hed probably hang up better to confront him in person i got back in the car and drove back down to east side to th and avenue g the house was halfway up the block a new brick place with a high fence around it and an electronic lock on the gate i rang the bell and waited i was just about to ring again when a womans voice came uncertainly through the squawk box im here to see young art i bellowed my name is warshawski there was a long silence and then the lock clicked i pushed the gate open and moved into the estate at least it looked more like an estate than it did your typical east side bungalow if this really was arts home i presumed it was because he still lived with his parents however modestly big art kept his office he hadnt stinted on his home comforts the lot to the right had been annexed and converted into a beautifully landscaped yard at one end stood a glass building that might have housed an indoor swimming pool since a forest preserve ran along the back of the property one had the sensation of being out in the country while only half a mile from some of the worlds busiest manufacturing sites i trotted up the flagstone walk to the entrance a porticoed porch whose columns looked a little incongruous against the modem brick a faded blond woman stood in the doorway the setting had some claim to grandeur but she was pure south side in her crisply ironed print dress and the starched apron covering it she greeted me nervously without trying to invite me in whowho did you say you were i pulled a card from my bag and handed it to her im a friend of young arts i wouldnt be bothering him at home but they havent seen him at the ward offices and its pretty important that i get in touch with him she shook her head blindly a movement that gave her a fleeting resemblance to her son hehes not home i dont think hed mind talking to me honestly mrs jurshak i know the police are trying to get in touch with him but im on his side not theirs or his fathers i added with a flash of inspiration he really isnt home she looked at me wretchedly when sergeant mcgonnigal came around asking for him mr jurshak got really angry but i dont know where he is missuh i havent seen him since breakfast yesterday morning i tried to digest that maybe young art hadnt been fit to drive last night after all but if hed been in an accident his mother would have been the first to know i shook away an unwelcome vision of dead stick pond can you give me the names of any of his friends anyone he trusts enough to spend the night with uninvited sergeant mcgonnigal asked me the same thing butbut he never had any friends i mean i liked him to stay here at night i didnt want him running around the way so many boys do these days getting involved in drugs and gangs and hes my only child its not like there are others if you lose one thats why im so worried now he knows how upset i get if i dont hear from him and yet here he is gone all night i didnt know what to say since none of the comments i wanted to make would have kept her speaking to me i finally asked if it was the first time hed ever stayed away from home oh no she said simply sometimes he has to work all night on important presentations to clients or something hes been doing a lot of those in the last few months but never without calling me i grinned a little to myself the kid was more enterprising than i would have suspected i thought a minute then said carefully im involved in one of those important cases mrs jurshak the clients name is nancy cleghorn art is looking for some papers from her will you tell him that i have them the name didnt seem to mean anything to her at least she didnt turn pale and faint or cower back in alarm instead she asked me if i could write it down since she had a terrible memory and she was so worried about art she didnt think shed get the names straight if she had to i scribbled nancys name and a brief message about having her files on the back of my card if something comes up mrs jurshak you can leave a message for me at that number anytime day or night when i got to the gate she was still standing in the doorway her hands wrapped in her apron i wished id been more persistent with young art last night he was scared he knew whatever it was that nancy knew so either my coming had been the last turn of the screwhed fled to avoid her fate or hed met her fate i should go to mcgonnigal tell him what i knew or rather what i suspected but but i really didnt have anything concrete maybe id give the kid twentyfour hours to show up if he was already dead it wouldnt matter but if he was still alive i should tell mcgonnigal so he could help keep him that way round and round i went with it in the end i postponed a decision by driving back down to south chicago first to drop nancys files at scrap then to visit louisa she was delighted to see me using the remotecontrol button to turn off the tube then gripping my hand with her brittle fingers when i edged the conversation around to pankowski and ferraro and their unsuccessful suit she seemed genuinely surprised i didnt know them two was so sick she said in her raspy voice i saw em both off and on before they died and they never said word one about it didnt know they was suing xerxes companys been real good to memaybe the boys got themselves in some kind of trouble could see it with joeyhe was always a problem for someone usually a girl who didnt have her head screwed on right but old steve he was your original straight arrow if you know what i mean hard to see why he wouldnt get his benefits i told her what i knew about their illnesses and death and about the harried life that mrs pankowski led that brought her coughracked laugh yeah i couldve told her a thing or two about joey we girls on the night shift all could of come to that i didnt even know he was married the first year i was working there when i found that out youd better believe i gave him his walking papers none of that being the other woman for me course there was others who wasnt as picky and he could make you laugh awful to think of him going through what im doing these days we talked until louisa fell into her gasping sleep she clearly knew nothing of carolines worries i had to hand it to the little bratshe did protect her mother the doctors dilemma mr contreras was waiting anxiously on the front walk when i came home the dog picking up his worried state yawned nervously at his feet when they saw me each expressed his joy the dog leapt around me in little circles while the old man scolded me for not leaving him my days route i put an arm around him you arent going to start breathing down my neck are you repeat twenty times a dayshes a big girl she can fall on her butt if she wants to dont joke about it cookie you know i shouldnt say this i shouldnt even think it but youre more family to me than my own family every time i look at ruthie it beats me how clara and i coulda had a kid like that when i see you its like looking at my own flesh and blood i mean that doll you gotta look after yourself for me and her royal highness here i gave a wry smile i guess i take after you thenim real hardheaded and stubborn he thought it over a minute okay doll he agreed reluctantly you gotta do things your way i dont like it but i understand when i went in the front door i heard him saying to the dog takes after me you hear that princess she gets it from me despite my bravado with him id been watching my back off and on all day i also checked my apartment carefully before sitting down with my mail but no one had tried getting past the reinforced steel in the front door or the sliding bars on the back i couldnt face another evening of whiskey and peanut butter nor did i want my downstairs neighbor feeling he had the right to hover over me carefully locking up once more i headed over to the treasure island on broadway to stock up i was sautéeing chicken thighs with garlic and olives when max loewenthal phoned my first thought on hearing from him out of the blue was that something had happened to lotty no no shes fine victoria but this doctor you asked me about two weeks ago this curtis chigwellhe tried to kill himself you didnt know that no i smelled burning olive oil and reached my left hand the length of the cord to turn off the stove what happened how do you know it had been on the six oclock news chigwells sister had found him when she went to the garage for some gardening tools at four victoria i feel most uncomfortable about this most uncomfortable two weeks ago you ask for his address and today he tries to commit suicide what was your role in this i stiffened immediately thanks max i appreciate the compliment most days i dont feel that powerful please dont turn this off with your flippancy you involved me i want to know if i contributed to a mans despair i tried to control my anger you mean did i go throw his ugly past in his face to the point where he couldnt stand it and turned on the monoxide something like that yes max was very grave his strong viennese accent heavier than usual you know victoria in your search for the truth you often force people to face things about themselves they are better off not knowing i can forgive you for doing it with lottyshes tough she can take it and you dont spare yourself but because you are very strong you dont see that other people cannot deal with these truths look maxi dont know why chigwell tried to kill himself i havent seen a medical report so i dont even know that he didmaybe he had a stroke as he was turning on the car engine but if it was because of the questions i was asking i dont feel one minute of remorse hes involved in a coverup for humboldt chemical what or why or how serious i dont know but that has nothing to do with his personal strengths and weaknessesit has to do with the lives of a lot of other people ifand its a mighty big ifif id known two weeks ago that my seeing him would make him turn on the gas youd better believe id do it again by the time i finished speaking i was breathing hard my mouth very tight i do believe you victoria and i have no wish to talk to you in such a mood but i do have one requestthat you not think of me the next time you need help in one of your chases he hung up before i could say anything well damn you anyway you righteous bastard i shouted at the dead phone you think youre my mother or just the scales of justice despite my rage i felt uneasyid sicced murray ryerson on the guy in the middle of the night maybe theyd hounded him and his imagination had converted a minor peccadillo to murder hoping to ease my conscience i tracked the crime editor down at the heraldstars city desk he was indignanthed sent reporters out to question the doctor about pankowski and ferraro but theyd never been allowed in dont give me hounding miss wiseass youre the one who talked to the guy theres something youre not telling me but im not even going to speculate on what it is weve got some gofers down at that xerxes plant and well get on it faster without mixed signals from you were running a lovely humaninterest story on mrs pankowski tomorrow and i expect to have something from that lawyer manheim who represented them murray did finally part grudgingly with more details about chigwells attempted suicide he had disappeared after lunch but his sister didnt miss him since she was busy around the house at four she decided to go to the garage to check over her gardening gear so shed be ready for spring her comments to the press did not include any mention of me or xerxes just that her brother had been troubled the last several days he was prone to depression and she hadnt thought much about it at the time is there any doubt he did it himself you mean did someone come into the garage bind and gag him strap him into the car then undo the ropes when he was unconscious assuming hed die and itd look like suicide give me a break warshawski when i finally finished the conversation i was in a worse mood than id been at the start id made the cardinal sin of giving murray far more information than id received in exchange as a result he knew as much about pankowski and ferraro as i did since he had a staff who could follow a range of inquiries he might well untangle what lay behind humboldts and chigwells lies before i did im as competitive as the next personmore than many of thembut it wasnt just fear of finishing behind murray that upset me it was louisas right to privacyshe didnt deserve the press pawing through her past and it kept bugging meirrationally i agreethat id never been home when nancy tried calling the day she died i looked balefully at the partly cooked chicken the only scrap i hadnt given murray was the letter to mariners rest id found in nancys car and now that young art had gone missing i wasnt sure who i could talk to about it i poured myself a drink one of the ten warning signsdo you turn to alcohol when youre upset or frustrated and went into the living room mariners rest was a large life and health insurer based in boston but they had a big branch office in chicago id seen their tv ads a million times with a confidentlooking sailor leaning against a hammockrest with the mariners and sleep with their peace of mind it would be tricky explaining to a corporate actuary where id gotten the data almost as hard as trying to explain it to big art insurance companies guard their actuarial data with the care usually associated with the holy grail so even if theyd accept my word on having a right to the documents it would be hard to get them to tell me if they meant anythinglike were the data accurate theyd have to get clearance from their home office in boston and that could take a month or more caroline might know what the document meant but she wasnt speaking to me the only other person i could think of to ask was ron kappelman the insurance information didnt look as though it had anything to do with the scrap recycling plant but nancy had liked ron she worked closely with him maybe hed see the same exciting possibilities in the letter that she had by a mercy his home number was listed andgreater miracle stillhe was in when i told him what i had he seemed most interested asking a lot of sharp questions about how id come to have it i responded vaguely that nancy had bequeathed me responsibility for some of her private affairs and i got him to agree to stop by at nine the next morning before he went to work i looked again at the mess in the living room there was no way putting away back issues of the wall street journal would make my place look as good as his gleaming house on langley i stuck the skillet with the chicken into the refrigeratorid lost interest in cooking let alone eating i called an old friend of mine velma riter and went to see the witches of eastwick with her by the time i got home id gotten enough of chigwell and max out of my brain to be able to sleep end run i was in the chigwells garage max had his hand around my wrist in a fierce grip he forced me to go with him to the black sedan where the doctor sat you will kill him now victoria max said i tried fighting him but his grip on my hand was so fierce that he forced my arm up forced me to pull the trigger when i fired chigwells face dissolved turning into the redeyed dog at dead stick pond i was thrashing through the swamp grasses trying to escape but the feral dog hunted me remorselessly i woke up at six drenched with sweat panting fighting an impulse to dissolve into tears the swamp dog in my dream had looked just like peppy despite the early hour i didnt want to stay in bed any longeri would only lie there sweating my head filled with grit i took the sheets off bundled them together with my dirty sweats put on jeans and a tshirt and padded down to the washing machine in the basement if i could find something to run in id be able to take the dog out a run and a cold shower would get my head cleared for ron kappelman after a long search i found my old college warmup pants stuffed in the bottom of a box in the hall closet the elastic was loosethe drawstring would barely keep them onand the maroon had faded to a washedout pink but theyd do for one morning i weighed the gun but my dream was too much with mei couldnt bear to carry it just now no one was going to attack me in front of all the joggers crowding the lakefront especially if a large dog accompanied me i hoped mr contreras had already let peppy out by the time i finished my stretches i met her on the stairs outside my kitchen door and the two of us set off it was another misty morning about forty degrees the skies leaden no matter what the weather the dog was ecstatic to be out in it i left her at the lagoon her tail waving like a golden pennant and headed on to the lake a handful of fishermen stood along the rocks hopeful even in this dreary weather i nodded at a trio of black slickers who were seated on the seawall in front of me and headed out to the harbor entrance i stood at the end of the promontory for a moment watching the sullen water break against the rocks but in the chilly mist my sweaty clothes started clinging to me uncomfortably i retied the loose drawstring on the sweats and turned back the fierce storms earlier in the winter had washed boulders across the seawall all along the edge of the harbor i had to leave the path more than once to keep from tripping on the loose rocks by the time i got back to the land end of the harbor my legs were sore from brokenfield running i slowed to a jog the trio of slickered fishermen had been watching my approach they didnt seem to be doing much fishing in fact they didnt seem to have any gear as i came to the end of the seawall they got up and formed a casual barrier between me and the road a lone jogger passed behind the men hey i called the runner was deep in his sony earphones he paid no heed to us give it up girlie one of the men said were just fishermen stopping a pretty girl for the time i was moving away from them trying frantically to think i could head back up the seawall to the lake and get trapped between boulder and water trying to get past someones walkman for attention maybe if i went sideways a shiny black arm swung out and grabbed my left wrist the time girlie well just look at your watch here i swung quickly in the circle of his arm bringing myself in and chopping hard upward on his elbow he was well padded with slicker and sweater but i got enough on the bone that he grunted and loosed his grip as his fingers slackened slightly i wrenched myself free and tore off across the park yelling for help none of the few people whod ventured out in the mist were close enough to hear me over their earphones i usually just follow the seawall in and out i didnt know this stretch of the park what hiding places it might hold where it would take me i hoped to land at lake shore drive but i might be deadending on a driving range my assailants were weighted down by their heavy clothes despite my fatigue i put some distance between us i could see one of them working his way across to my left the other two were presumably coming around the top trying to set up a pincer it all depended on how fast i could reach the road i put out a burst of energy cutting at an angle to the direction id been going id surprised the man i could seehe gave a shout of warning to the two i couldnt it gave me confidence and i started running all out i was going at top speed when i saw water in front of me the lake it stuck a finger into the park here the end of the inlet lay about thirty yards to my left the man id hit had moved down there blocking my exit on my right i could see the other two slickers moving behind me at a casual jog i waited until they were within fifteen yards getting my breath getting my courage when they were close enough that they could start calling to meits no use runninggive it up girlieno point in fightingi jumped the water was nearly ice i took in a frozen filthy mouthful and spat my lungs and heart banged in protest my bones and head began to ache my ears rang and light spots danced in my eyes yards its only yards you can do it one arm after the other one foot up one down dont worry about the weight of the shoes youre almost across youre almost out theres a boulder slide across it now you can walk now you can climb up this bank the drawstring on my warmup pants gave up completely i wrestled myself free of them and lumbered toward the road the wet cold was making me dizzy inky shapes floated in front of me i couldnt focus couldnt see if the man at the bottom of the inlet had been able to move across the end before id swum over couldnt see the size or shape of my pursuit in my wet shoes with my teeth chattering i could hardly move but help lay ahead i pushed myself doggedly i would have made it if it hadnt been for the goddamn boulders i was just too tired too disoriented to see i tripped over a giant rock and fell heavily i was taking great gasps of air trying to get to my feet and then i was writhing in blackslickered arms kicking flailing even biting when all the floating inky spots gathered into a giant ball and fire exploded in my brain after a time i knew i was very sick i couldnt breathe pneumonia id waited outside in the rain for my daddy he promised to pick me up during a break on his shift and the break didnt comehe never thought id wait that long lie under this tent breathe slowly watch for mama she says everything will be all right and you know she never lies i tried opening my eyes the movement stabbed great fingers of pain into my brain forcing me back into darkness i woke again rocking helplessly back and forth my arms tied a boulder pushing into my side i was wrapped in something heavy something that pushed into my mouth if i threw up id suffocate myself lie as still as possible not the time to struggle i knew who i was this time v i warshawski girl detective idiot extraordinaire the heavy stuff was a blanket i couldnt see but i imagined itgreen standard sears issue i was wedged against the backseat of a car not a boulder but the drive shaft when i got out of here id get city council to make frontwheel drive mandatory for all chicago criminals get stopped with a drive shaft in your car and youd do time like the irs getting al capone when i got out of here my slickered friends were talking but i couldnt make out their words through the buzzing in my ears and the thickness of the blanket i thought at first the buzzing was left over from my coldwater bath but by and by my tired brain sorted it into the sound of wheels on the road coming through the floorboard the rocking and the warmth of my cocoon sent me back to sleep i woke up to feel cold air on my head my arms were numb where theyd been tied behind me my tongue thick with suppressed nausea is she still out i didnt know the voice cold indifferent the voice of the man whod called in the threat only two days ago was that all i couldnt tell either of time or the voice she isnt moving want me to open her up and check a black mans thicker tones leave her as she is the cold voice again an old carpet were dumping you never know who may see you even down here who might remember seeing a face i kept myself as limp as possible i didnt need another blow to the skull i was pulled roughly from the car banging my poor head my aching arms my sore back on the door clenching my numb fingers to keep from crying out someone slung me over his back like an old roll of carpet as though a hundred and forty pounds was nothing to him as though i was nothing more than a light and careless load i could hear twigs snapping underfoot the swishing of the dead grasses what i hadnt noticed on my previous trip here was the smell the rank stench of putrifying grasses mixed with the chemicals that drained into the marsh i tried not to choke tried not to think of the fish with their rotting fins tried to suppress the well of nausea that grew with the pounding in my head as it bounced against my bearers back okay troy x marks the spot troy grunted slid me from his shoulder and dropped me far enough in she isnt going anyplace lets split the rank grasses and soft mud broke my fall i lay against the chill earth the cool mud soaking through the blanket brought a moments relief to my sick head but as i lay there my bodys weight caused water to ooze up through the mud i felt the dampness in my ears and panicked thrashing uselessly alone in this dark cocoon i was going to drown black swamp water in my lungs my heart my brain the blood roared in my head and i cried tears of utter helplessness in grimpen mire i had passed out again when i slowly came to i was wet all through water had oozed into my hair and was tickling my ears my shoulders felt as though someone had stuck iron bars into them to separate them from my breastbone somehow though the sleep and the cold muddy water had healed my head a little i didnt want to thinkit was too scary but minute by minute i could still make it if i used a little sense i rolled to one side the blanket heavy with mud using every ounce of strength i pushed myself to a sitting position my ankles were bound together and my hands were tied behind me at the wristthere was no way i could work them to the front of my body but by pushing them down at my tailbone i could brace myself enough to inch forward with my legs i had to assume theyd taken me down the same track where theyd dumped nancyit was the farthest from the road anyway after some time of trial and error which left me gasping for breath inside my muddy cocoon i reckoned that the water lay to my right i carefully made a onehundredeightydegree turn so that my inching motion would take me back toward the road i tried not to think of the distance tried not to compute my probable speed forced thoughts of food baths bed away and imagined myself on a sunny beach maybe hawaii maybe magnum would appear suddenly and cut me out of my prison my legs and arms were shaking too much exertion too little glucose i had to stop every few pushes and rest the second time i stopped i fell asleep again waking only as i fell over into the grasses after that i forced myself to a counting pattern five shoves count fifteen five shoves count fifteen five shoves count fifteen legs wobbling brain turning fifteen my fifteenth birthday gabriella had died two days before the last breath in tonys arms while i was at the beach maybe there really was a heaven gabriella with her pure voice in the angelic choir waiting for me with wings outstretched her arms opened in boundless love waiting for my contralto to blend with her soprano a dogs bark brought me back to myself the redeyed hound this time i couldnt help it i was sick a little trickle of bile down my front i could hear the dog coming closer breath heaving short sharp barks then a nose pushing into the side of the blanket knocking me over i lay on my side in a helpless tangle of mud and blanket kicking uselessly in the air and felt paws press heavily into my arm i kicked helplessly at the blanket trying to force the hound away little tears of fear slid into my nose all the while on the other side fangs pulled at my head my arms when it had bit through the blanket how would i protect my throat my arms were behind me it wasnt minding my feeble thrashing panic roared in my ears turned my useless legs to water over the roaring i heard a voice with the tiny energy left in me i tried to cry out you got her you found her is that you doll are you in there can you hear me not the hound of hell after all but peppy with mr contreras my euphoria was so great that my sore muscles felt momentarily healed i grunted feebly the old man wrestled feverishly with the knots talking to himself all the while i mighta known to bring a knife instead of this wrench should have guessed that you stupid old man why do you want to go carrying pipe wrenches when a knife is what you need steady in there doll we almost got it dont give up the ship now not when were this close he finally managed to rip the blanket away from my head oh my this is bad lets get you out of here he worked frantically clumsily on the knots behind my back the dog looked at me anxiously then started to lick my facei was her longlost puppy found in the nick of time all the while that mr contreras freed my hands rubbing some semblance of circulation back into my arms she kept washing my face he was shocked to see me in my underwear afraid id been raped could hardly take in my assurances that it was just drowning my assailants had been after leaning heavily on his shoulder i let him guide me half carrying me back to the road i got some young hotshot here some lawyer he says didnt believe you could really be down here so he waited at the car when her royal highness came back from the lake without you i got kinda worried then this snotnose shows up says you was going to meet with him at nine and where was you he cant wait all day i know you dont want me breathing down your neck doll but i was there when the guy called i heard that little friend of yours say they was going to dump you in the marsh so i made him drive us down here me and her highness you know i figured we could find the place after you showed it to me on the map and all he went over and over it on the way to the road ron kappelman stood there leaning on his beatup rabbit whistling lightly looking at nothing when he saw the three of us coming he leapt upright and sprinted across the road he helped mr contreras lift me over the fence and into the backseat of the car peppy gave a little bark and shoved past them to push her heavy body next to mine damn warshawski you miss an appointment you do it in a big way what the hell happened to you you leave her alone young man and dont go talking dirty like that theres plenty other words in the english language without going around swearing all the time i dont know what your mother would think if she could hear you but what we gotta do is get this lady to a doctor get her patched up then you want to butt your nose in and find out how she got where she was maybe shell feel like talking to you kappelman stiffened as if to fight back then realized the futility of it and got into the drivers seat i was unconscious before he had the car turned around i dont remember anything of the rest of the day how kappelman flagged down a state patrol car and got us an eightymileanhour escort to lottys clinic mr contreras stubbornly insisting he wouldnt let them take me to a hospital without her sayso or how lotty taking one look at me in the back of the car summoned an ambulance to take me to beth israel at top speed or even how peppy wouldnt relinquish me to the paramedics she apparently seized a wrist in her strong jaw and refused to let go they tell me they woke me up long enough to make her drop the guys arm but i dont have any memory of it not even as a dream fragment i finally resurfaced around six thursday morning after a few puzzled minutes i realized i was in a hospital bed but i couldnt imagine what i was doing there or how id come to be there as soon as i tried sitting up though my shoulders sent out so severe a message of pain that memory came flooding back dead stick pond that horrible cocoon of death i held my arms out in front of me despite the agony moving them brought my wrists and hands were wrapped in gauze my fingers looked like bright red sausages emerging from the white bandages an iv needle was taped to my left forearm above the gauze i followed it to a series of bags overhead and squinted at the labels dns that told me a lot i touched my fingertips gently together they were swollen but i could feel i lay back again filled with a peaceful satisfaction i had survived my hands were all right they had tried to kill me tried to humiliate me at the moment of my death but i was alive i fell back into sleep when i woke again it was to the full bustle of morning hospital routineblood pressure temperature roundsand no questions answered doctor will tell you after the nurses came a brisk intern who looked at my eyes and stuck pins into my feet the pin seems to be neurosciences most advanced piece of technology another intern was busy with my roommate a woman my age whod just had cosmetic surgery after theyd finished lotty herself swept in dark eyes bright with nonclinical feeling my intern hovered at her elbow anxious to tell her his findings on my body she listened for a minute then dismissed him with an imperious wave im sure your reflexes are all in perfect order but let me see for myself first lets have your chest breathe hold it exhale yes she listened to me fore and aft then had me shut my eyes and touch my hands together get out of beda slow lurching processand walk on my heels then my toes it wasnt much compared to my usual workout but it left me panting you really should have children victoriayou could produce a whole new breed of superheroes why you are even alive at this point is a medical miracle let alone that you can walk thank you lotty im pretty pleased myself tell me how i got here and when i can leave she gave me the details of peppy and the ambulance men and your friend mr contreras is waiting anxiously down the hall he stayed here all night with the dog totally against hospital policy but the two of you are well matched stubborn pigheaded with only one allowable way to do thingsyour own pot calling the kettle black lotty i said unrepentantly lying down and dont tell me the dog didnt stay here with your connivance or at least maxs i frowned and bit off my words remembering my last conversation with the hospitals executive director lotty looked at me sympathetically yes max also wants to talk to you he is feeling a bit remorseful and that is no doubt why the dog spent the night in the hospital but she must go home now so if you will tell your tiresome neighbor youre going to live to tilt at more windmills well get them to leave meanwhile since your brain is no worse than usual ill get someone to take that needle out of you she whirled off at her usual forty knots mr contreras came in a minute or two later his eyes filled with tears his hands shaking a little i swung my feet over the side of the bed and held out my arms to him oh cookie im never gonna forget the way we found you yesterday more dead than alive you was and that young snot not believing you could be down there and me having to practically knock him out before hed drive us and then i couldnt get the nurses here to tell me anything about how you was doing i kept asking and asking and they wouldnt say because i wasnt family me not your family who has more right id like to know i says to them some cousin in melrose park who dont even send her a christmas card or me who saved her life but dr lotty showed up and straightened it all out her and mr loewenthal between them and put me and the dog in an empty room down the hall from you but we had to promise not to disturb you he pulled a giant red handkerchief from a back pocket and blew his nose loudly well alls well that ends well and i gotta take her highness home and feed her but dont go telling me to mind my own business anymore cookie not when you got guys like this on your case i thanked him as best i could giving him a tight hug and a kiss after he left i lay back down again cursing my lack of stamina lotty wanted me to stay here another dayshe said i wouldnt rest if i went off on my own she was right i was already in a pretty fretful state made more irritable by my sore shoulder muscles but shed thrown out all my clothes and wasnt going to bring me any more until friday morning as it turned out most of the people i would have tried to see came to visit me along with a few i could just as well have done without such as the police lieutenant mallory arrived in person a sign not of my importance but of his angry concernangry because i should have stayed clear of police business concern because hed been close to both my parents vicki put yourself in my place for a change one of your oldest friends dies and every time you turn around his only kid is thumbing her nose at you how do you think i feel i know how you feel youve told me six billion times i said churlishly i hate having to talk to people in a hospital gownits like youre a kid in bed and theyre tucking you in for the night if youd been killed i would have carried that responsibility to my grave cant you understand that cant you see when i give you orders its out of concern for your safety because of what i owe tony and gabriella what will it take to pound some sense into you i glowered at the bedclothes im selfemployed just so i dont have to take orders from anyone anyway bobby i did agree not to go to the states attorney about nancy cleghorn and i agreed to tell you if i ran into anything that looked like a lead into her death i didnt you obviously did he shouted pounding the bedside table so hard that the water pitcher fell over that put the cap to his angerhe yelled out the door for an orderly then shouted at the man until the floor was cleaned to his satisfaction my roommate turned off the dating game and scurried out to the lounge when the place was dry again bobby made an effort to smother his anger he took me through the details of the episode waiting patiently at the spots that were hard for me to talk about prompting me professionally when i couldnt remember something the fact that i had a name even just a first name cheered him slightlyif troy was a pro tied to any known organization the police would have a file on him now vickibobby was geniallets get to the heart of the matter if you didnt know anything about cleghorns death why did someone try to kill you in the same manner and in the same place that they murdered her gee bobby the way you put it i guess i must know who killed her or at least why exactly now lets have it i shook my head gingerly since the back was still on the sore side its just the way you put it the way i look at it i mustve talked to someone who thinks i know more than i really do the trouble is ive talked to so many people the last few days and all of them have been so unpleasant that i dont know which id choose as my gradea suspect okay bobby was determinedly patient lets have who youve talked to i looked at the water stains on the ceiling theres young art jurshak you know the aldermans son and curtis chigwell the doctor who tried killing himself in hinsdale the other day and ron kappelmanscraps counsel gustav humboldt of course murray ryerson gustav humboldt bobbys voice went up a register you know the chairman of humboldt chemical i know who you mean he said bitingly you want to share with me why you were talking to him in reference to the cleghorn woman i wasnt really talking to him about the cleghorn woman at all i said earnestly turning to look at bobbys clenched jaw thats what i meanti didnt talk to any of these people about nancy but since they were all more or less unpleasant any of them might have wanted to dump me in the swamp for two cents id get someone to put you back there itd save a lot of time you know something and you think youre going to be a hotshot again go looking without saying squat to me about it they almost got you this time next time they will but until they do i have to waste city money by having someone keep an eye on you his blue eyes glittered eileens all upset about you being in here she wanted to send over flowers she wanted to take you home with her and fuss over you i told her you just aint worth it visiting hours after bobby left i lay back down i tried to sleep but the pain in my shoulders had moved to the foreground of my mind angry tears prickled under my eyes i had almost gotten killed and all he could do was insult me i wasnt worth the bother of looking after just because i wasnt a blabbermouth who would tell him everything i knew id tried mentioning gustav humboldts name and all id gotten for my pains was an incredulous shout i twitched uncomfortably the knot in the hospital gown was digging into my sore neckmuscles of course i could have given him chapter and verse on all my activities for the last week but bobby just wouldnt have believed that a bigshot like gustav humboldt could be involved in bonking young women on the head although maybe if id tried giving it to him straight was he right was i just hotdogging hoping to thumb my nose at him one more time as i lay still letting images flow through my mind i realized that this time at least wanting to give the powersthatbe a bronx cheer wasnt what had kept me quiet i was well and truly scared every time i tried sending my mind back to the three blackslickered men i shied away from the memory like a horse frightened by fire there were a lot of parts of the assault i hadnt told bobby not because i was trying to hold back on him but because i couldnt bear to touch the memories the hope that some forgotten phrase or cadence would give me a lead to who they worked for wasnt enough to force the memory of that terrifying nearsuffocation if i spilled everything i knew to bobby turning the whole tangled mess over to him it was a way of saying it out loud hey guys whoever you are you got me you didnt kill me but you got me so scared that im abdicating responsibility for my life once id let that little piece of selfknowledge float to the top of my mind a terrible rage began to seize hold of me i would not be turned into a eunuch be driven to living my life in the margins designed by someone elses will i didnt know what was going on in south chicago but no one be it steve dresberg gustav humboldt or even caroline djiak was going to keep me from finding out when murray ryerson showed up a little after eleven i was pacing the room in my bare feet my hospital gown flapping around my legs id vaguely seen my roommate stand uncertainly in the door and move away again and i mistook murrays presence for her return until he spoke they told me you were fifteen minutes from death but i knew better than to believe that i jumped murray didnt your mother teach you to knock before barging in on people i tried but you werent anywhere near planet earth he straddled the chair next to my bed you look like that siberian tiger in that great open area at lincoln park zoo vi youre making me nervous sit down and let me have an exclusive on your brush with death who tried to do you in dr chigwells sister the folks down at the xerxes plant or your pal caroline djiak that stopped me i pulled up my roommates chair to face murray i had hoped to keep louisas affairs out of the papers but once murray started digging hed find out pretty much anything whatd little caroline tell youthat id come by my ill deserts honestly carolines a bit confusing to talk to she says you were looking into nancy cleghorns death for scrap although no one else down there seems to know anything about it she claims she knows nothing about pankowski or ferraro although im not sure i believe her murray poured himself a glass of water from the pitcher the orderly had replaced the people at xerxes keep referring us to counsel if we want to hear about those two or about their suicidal doctor and it does always kind of make you wonder when people only talk to you through their lawyers were working on the plant secretary the gal who works for the accountantcumpersonnel administrator and one of my assistants is hanging out at the bar where the shift goes after work so well get something but you could sure make it easier miss marple i slid from the chair back to bed and pulled the covers up to my chin caroline was protecting louisa of course that was what lay behind her song and dance a threat to her mother was the only thing that would scare her the only explanation consistent with her fierce terrier personality she didnt care anything for her own safetyand certainly not enough for mine to grow hysterical over my failure to drop the investigation it was hard to imagine how they could menace a woman in louisas condition maybe blasting the private affairs she so ardently desired to keep secret out into the openperhaps her most important concern in the last months of her life although louisa hadnt seem worried when i saw her on tuesday come on vic give murrays voice had an edge that brought me back to the room murray it wasnt two days ago you were looking haughtily down that elephantchild snout of yours telling me you didnt need anything from me and wouldnt do anything for me so give me a reason why i should suddenly help you out murray waved his hand around the hospital room this baby doll someone wants you dead awful bad the more people who know what you know the less likely theyll be to try to take you out a second time i smiled sweetlyat least that was the goal i talked to the police and told them everything you know that would take more time than lieutenant mallory has i told him who i spoke with the day before thethe assault that included youyou werent very pleasant and he wanted to know about anyone who seemed hostile murrays eyes narrowed above his red beard i came here prepared to be sympathetic maybe even to rub ointment into the sore spots you have a way of destroying peoples tender feelings kiddo i made a sour face funnybobby mallory said much the same thing any reasonable man would okay lets have the assault story all i have is the sketch the hospital reported to the cops you made all four tv news spots last night if that makes you feel more important it didnt it made me feel more exposed whoever had tried to dump me into the south chicago swamp had plenty of access to the news that id managed to crawl away there wasnt any point to asking murray to keep a lid on it i gave him as much as i could bear to reveal about the experience i take it back vi he said when i finished thats a harrowing story even with most of the details missing youre entitled to thrash your tail awhile even so he tried wheedling more information from me stopping only when the lunches were brought in chicken and overcooked peas followed nervously by the woman recovering from plastic surgery i was chewed out rather sternly by the floor head for having visitors who frightened my roommate out of her own bed since murray takes up about as much space as a fullgrown grizzly she devoted enough of her remarks to him that he fled in some embarrassment after lunch a petite asian underling came to inform me that dr herschel had ordered deep heat for me down in physical therapy she found a hospital robe for me even though i was twice her size she helped me solicitously into a wheelchair and pushed me down to the pt unit deep in the bowels of the hospital i spent a pleasant hour getting wet packs deep heat and a massage finishing with ten minutes in the whirlpool by the time my attendant had brought me back to my room i was drowsy and ready for sleep it was not meant to be however i found ron kappelman sitting in the visitors chair he put away a folder of papers when he saw me and offered me a pot of geraniums you sure seem better today than i wouldve believed twentyfour hours ago he said soberly im most sorry i didnt take your neighbor seriouslyi just assumed something important had come up and youd taken off i still cant figure out how he bullied me into driving him all the way down there i slid back into bed and lay down mr contreras is a little excitable at least about my wellbeing but im not exactly in the mood to fight it today you find anything out about that insurance report or why jurshak was appointed the fiduciary you look as though you should be convalescing not worrying about a bunch of old files he said disapprovingly has their status changed tuesday you were pretty excited about them what turned them into old files lying down wasnt a good ideai kept drifting i cranked the bed so i could sit up the way you looked when that old man dragged you up to the fence they didnt seem worth that much trouble i scanned his face for signs of menace or lies or something all he showed was manly concern what did that prove is that why i was dumped into the marsh because of the report to mariners rest he looked startled i guess i assumedbecause wed talked about them and then you didnt show up for our meeting you tell anyone about my having that letter kappelman he leaned forward in his chair his mouth set in a thin line im beginning to dislike the turn this conversation is taking warshawski are you trying to imply that i had anything to do with what happened to you yesterday this made the third wellwisher whose mind id changed within minutes of entering the room im trying to make sure that you didnt look ron all i know about you is that you had a brief fling with an old friend of mine that doesnt tell me anythingi mean i was once married to a guy i wouldnt trust with a kids piggy bank all it proves is that hormones are stronger than brains i talked to you and to one other person about those documents if theyre the reason i was dumped into that swamp yesterdayand thats a big question markbecause i just dont knowit had to be because of one of you guys he made a sour face okay i guess i can buy thatjust i dont know how to convince you i didnt hire those thugs other than on my honor as a boy scout i was one once thirty years ago or so will you take that as evidence of probity ill take it into account i lowered the bed againi was too tired to try to push him any further theyre springing me tomorrow want to try again on these papers he frowned you really are a coldblooded bitch arent you near death one day and hot on the trail the next sherlock holmes didnt have anything on you i guess i still want to see those damned documentsill stop by around six if theyve let you go home he got up and pointed at the geraniums dont eat those theyre just for the spirit try to enjoy them very funny i muttered to his back before hed disappeared i was deep in sleep when i woke again around six max was sitting in the visitors chair he was reading a magazine with peaceful absorption but when he realized i was awake he folded it neatly and stuck it into his attaché case i would have been here much sooner but my day was spent in meetings i fear lotty tells me you are fine that you need nothing but rest to be completely healed i ran a hand through my hair it felt matted and sticky which made me feel at a disadvantage i eyed max warily victoria he took my left hand and held it between his two i hope you can forgive my cold words of a few days ago when lotty told me what had happened to you i felt truly remorseful dont i said awkwardly you werent responsible for anything that happened to me his soft brown eyes looked at me shrewdly nothing is without connection in our lives if i hadnt goaded you about dr chigwell you might not have acted so fiercely as to get yourself into trouble i started to answer him then stopped if he hadnt goaded me i might not have felt so reluctant to take my gun with me on my run yesterday maybe i even exposed myself unconsciously to danger to assuage my guilt but i did have something to feel guilty about i said aloud you werent that far off the mark you knowi only pressured chigwell because he made me angry so maybe i gave the final turn to his screw so maybe we can both learn a little from this to look before we leap max stood up to reveal a magnificent array of flowers in a chinese porcelain bowl i know you leave tomorrow but take these with you for some cheer while your poor muscles heal max was an expert on oriental porcelain the pot looked as though it had come from his personal collection i tried to let him know how much the gesture pleased me he accepted my thanks with his usual cheerful courtesy and left back to home base i had a new roommate in the morning a twentyyearold named jean fishbeck whose lover had shot at her and hit a shoulder before she got him in the stomach the cosmetic surgery patient had moved three rooms down the hall i got the whole shooting story with loudpitched expletives at midnight when ms fishbeck came in from postop at seven when the morning shift came in to see if wed expired in the night she vented her rage at being awakened in the clarion nasal of the northwest side by the time lotty showed up at eightthirty i was ready to go anywhere even the psychiatric wing just to get away from the obscenities and cigarettes i dont care what shape im in i told lotty irritably just sign my discharge and let me out of here ill leave in my nightgown if i have to lotty cocked an eye at the crumpled chewinggum wrappers and cigarette pack on the floor she raised both eyebrows as a stream of profanity poured from behind the closed curtain while an intern tried to conduct an exam the floor head told me youd been rough on your roommate yesterday and that they were giving you someone more suited to your personality did you vent your anger by handing her a few punches she started probing my shoulder muscles ow damn you that hurts and the word you want is throw not hand or land maybe lotty used her ophthalmoscope on my eyes we gave you x rays and a ct scan after we stabilized you on wednesday by some miracle you dont have any cracks or breaks some more physical therapy over the next few days should help your sore muscles but dont expect them to recover overnighttissue tears can take as long as a year to heal if you dont rest the muscles properly and yes you can go homeyou can do the therapy as an outpatient if you give me your keys ill have carol bring you some clothes at lunchtime id tied the keys through the laces of my running shoes before setting out on wednesday lotty had rescued them before giving orders to trash what clothes id still been wearing on arrival at beth israel she stood up and looked at me gravely when she spoke again her viennese accent was pronounced i would ask that you not be reckless victoria i would ask it except that you seem to be in love with danger and death you make life very hard for those who love you i couldnt think of anything to say she stared at me for a long moment her eyes very dark in her angular face then gave her head a little shake and left my twentyfourhour character summary wasnt too appealing a coldhearted bitch in love with death and danger who drove timid cosmetic surgery patients to the nursing staff for refuge when an orderly came by an hour or so later to take me down for physical therapy i went along morosely the normal hospital routine which depersonalizes patients at its expense usually drives me into a frenzy of uncooperative sarcasm today i took it like a good little lump after my physical therapy i myself took refuge from my vituperous roommate waiting in the lounge for my clothes with a stack of old glamours and sports illustrated carol alvarez the nurse and chief backup at lottys clinic arrived a little before two she greeted me warmly with a hug a kiss and little exclamations of horror over my ordeal even mama has been praying to the blessed mother for your safety vic that was something indeedmrs alvarez usually looked on me with silent contempt carol had brought jeans a sweatshirt and a pair of boots the clothes and underwear seemed unnaturally clean id forgotten leaving them in the laundry on wednesday apparently one of my downstairs neighbors had dumped them in a wet heap outside my apartment door with an angry note carol had generously taken the time to run them back through the machine she helped me quickly with the discharge routine since she knew a lot of the nurses on the floor their hostility toward me cooled a little when they saw me with her with me carrying maxs oriental bowl and carol the geraniums we made our way through the long corridors to the staff parking lot behind the hospital my head seemed stuffed with cotton remote not just from my body but from the day around me it had been only two days since my illfated run but i felt as though id been away from the world for months my boots felt new and strange and i couldnt get used to the sensation of the jeans zipped close to my body at that they werent as close as they used to bethe last few days seemed to have taken a good five pounds off me mr contreras was waiting for me when we got to my apartment on racine he had tied a big red ribbon around peppys neck and groomed her auburn hair until it shone in the dull gray day carol turned me over to them with another kiss and left us at the door i would have much preferred to be alone to order my thoughts but he had earned the right to fuss i submitted to his ushering me into the armchair pulling off my boots and tucking a blanket tenderly around my legs and feet hed fixed an elaborate tray of fruit and cheese which he set next to me along with a pot of tea now cookie im leaving her highness here to keep you company you want anything you just call me i printed my number next to the phone so you dont have to look it up and before you go off sticking your head into trouble you let me know i aint gotta hover over youi know you hate thatbut someones gotta know where to come looking for you you promise me that or im going to have to hire me a detective just to follow you around i held out a hand its a deal uncle the honorary title moved him so much that he spoke sternly to the dog outlining her duties to me before slapping me on my sore shoulder and moving off down the stairs im not much of a tea drinker but it was pleasant to stay where id been planted i poured myself a cup mixed it with a lot of heavy cream and alternately fed grapes to myself and the dog she sat on her haunches watching me with unwavering eyes panting slightly taking her guard duties seriously assuring herself that i wasnt going to disappear again without her i forced my weary mind back to the time before my assault only three days earlier but the neurons moved as though theyd been rusted over for years when every muscle aches its hard to remember feeling whole id been warned out of south chicago monday night on wednesday id been dispatched most efficiently that meant something id done tuesday had brought an immediate re action i frowned trying to remember what all happened that day id found jurshaks insurance report and talked to ron kappelman about it id also left a message for young art implying i had the material these were tangible documents and it was tempting to think they showed something so damaging that people would kill to keep them secure it might be difficult to pry the truth from kappelman if he was concealing something but jurshak was such a fragile young man i ought to be able to pound the facts from him if only i could find him if he was still alive still i shouldnt concentrate on those two at the expense of the other people involved curtis chigwell for example early tuesday id sicced murray ryerson on him and twelve hours later hed tried to kill himself and then there was the big shark gustav humboldt himself whatever chigwell knew whatever they were concealing about joey pankowski and steve ferraro gustav humboldt had full knowledge of otherwise he would never have sought me out to try to get me to swallow lies about two insignificant workers in his worldwide empire and the insurance report nancy had found dealt with his company that must mean somethingi just didnt yet know what finally of course there was little caroline now that id worked out that she was protecting louisa i figured i could get her to talk she might even know what nancy had seen in the insurance report she was my best starting point i took the blanket from my legs and got up the dog immediately sprang to her feet waving her tailif i stood up it was clearly time to go running when she saw me just move to the phone she flopped down in depression caroline was in a meeting the scrap receptionist told me she was not to be disturbed just write the following on a note and take in into herlouisas life story on the front page of the heraldstar and add my name i guarantee shell be on the phone within nanoseconds i had to cajole a little more but the woman finally agreed i carried the phone back over to the easy chair peppy eyed me in disgust but i wanted to be sitting down for the coming blast caroline came on the line without preamble i let her rant at me unchecked for some minutes shredding my character expressing remorse that id risen unchastened from the swamp even lamenting that i didnt now lie buried in the mud at that i decided to interrupt caroline that was vile and offensive if you had any imagination or sensitivity you would never have thought such a thing let alone said it she was silent for a minute then said gruffly im sorry vic but you shouldnt have sent me messages threatening ma right kiddo i understand i understand that the only reason youve been behaving more like a horses rear end than usual is because someone was gunning for louisa i need to know who and why how do you know she blurted its your character sweetie it just took me awhile to remember it youre manipulative youll bend the rules any old way to get what you want but youre no chicken youd run scared for only one reason she was silent for another long moment im not going to say if youre right or wrong she finally said i just cant talk about it if youre right you can understand why if youre wrongi guess its because im a horses rear end i tried to will my personality into the phone caroline this is important if someone told you theyd hurt louisa unless you got me to stop hunting for your father i need to know it because it means theres a tiein between nancys death and my looking at joey pankowski and steve ferraro youd have to sell me and i dont think you can she was serious more mature than i was used to hearing her at least let me give it a shot babe come up here some time tomorrow as you can imagine im not too fit right now or id zip down to see you tonight she finally reluctantly agreed to come by in the afternoon we hung up in greater amity than id have thought possible ten minutes earlier the games afoot an annoying lassitude gripped my body even the short conversation with caroline had tired me out i poured some more tea and flicked on the tube with spring training still two weeks away there wasnt much doing during the day i moved from soap to soap to a tearful prayer meetingtammy fayes sobbing successorto sesame street and turned the set off in disgust it was too much to expect me to sort papers or pay bills in my enfeebled state i wrapped myself in my blanket and lay down on the sofa for a nap i woke up about twenty minutes before kappelman was due and stumbled into the bathroom to rinse my face with cold water someone had stolen all the dirty towels scrubbed the sink and bathtub and tidied up odds and ends of toiletries and makeup peeping into my bedroom i was staggered to see the bed made and clothes and shoes put away i hated to admit it but the tidy rooms were cheering to my sore spirits id hidden nancys documents in the stacks of music on the piano the elves had carefully put the music inside the piano bench but the insurance material lay undisturbed between the italienisches liederbuch and mozarts concert arias i was picking my way through che no sei capace whose title line seemed admirably apt in that i understood nothingwhen kappelman rang the bell before i could get to the intercom mr contreras had bounded out to the lobby to inspect him when i opened my door i could hear their voices in the stairwell as they came up togethermr contreras trying to tamp down the suspicions he felt toward any man who visited me kappelman trying to suppress his impatience with the escort my neighbor started talking to me as soon as his head cleared the last turn and he caught sight of me oh hi there cookie you have a good rest im just coming to pick up her highness here get her some air a little food you werent feeding her cheese were you i meant to tell youshe cant tolerate it he came into the room and started inspecting peppy for signs of illness you dont want to go walking her alone now nor going off by yourself on one of your runs and dont let this young guy here keep you going past when youve got yourself worn out and you want any help with anything me and the dogll be at the ready you just give us a holler with this thinly veiled warning he collected peppy he hovered at the door with more admonitions until i finally thrust him gently onto the landing kappelman looked at me sourly if id known the old man was going to investigate my character idve brought my own attorney along id say you were safe if you kept him with youanyone attacks you hell talk them to death he just likes to imagine im sixteen and hes both my parents i said with more indulgence than i felt owing my life to mr contreras didnt keep me from finding him a little wearing i offered kappelman a drink his first choice was beer which i rarely have in the house followed by bourbon i finally unearthed a bottle of that from the back of my liquor cupboard an old south sider like you ought to be ready with a shot and a beer he grumbled i guess its just one more sign of how much ive abandoned my roots i took him into the living room folding up the blanket id left on the couch so he could sit there my place was never going to be the equal of his pullman showcase but at least it was neat i didnt get any compliments but then he couldnt be expected to know how it usually looked after a few polite nothings about my health and his day i handed nancys packet to him he pulled a pair of glasses from the breast pocket of his shabby jacket and carefully went through the document a page at a time i sipped my whiskey and read the days papers trying not to fidget when hed finished he put his glasses away with a little gesture of puzzled helplessness i dont know why nance had these or why she thought they might have been important i gritted my teeth dont tell me theyre completely meaningless i dont know he hunched a shoulder you can see what they are as easily as i can i dont know that much about insurance but it looks as though xerxes might have been paying more than these other guys and jurshak was trying to persuade the companyhe looked at the document searching for the namemariners rest to lower their rates it obviously meant something to nancy but it sure doesnt to me sorry i scowled horribly causing the kind of wrinkles they warn starlets against maybe the point isnt the data but the fact that jurshak handled the insurance maybe still does he wouldnt be my first choice as either an agent or a fiduciary ron smiled a little you can afford to be superioryou arent trying to do business in south chicago maybe humboldt felt it was easier to go with the flow on jurshak than use an independent agent or maybe it was genuine altruism trying to give business to the community where he set up his plant jurshak wasnt very big in south chicago let alone the city back in maybe i swirled my glass watching the golden liquid change to amber as it picked up the lamplight art and gustav doing good for the good of the community as a whole i could see it on a billboard but not so easily in real life but id grown up around art so i followed revelations about himdeals that made him or his partner freddy parma a directorand insurance providerfor a local trucking company a steel firm a rail freight hauler and other outfits campaign contributions flowed from these companies in a most gratifying stream mariners rest assurance company might not know these things but ron kappelman ought to youre looking awfully sinister kappelman interrupted my reverie like you think im an ax murderer just my coldhearted bitch expression i was wondering how much you know about art jurshaks insurance business you mean stuff like midstates rail of course i do why do you he broke off midsentence his eyes widening slightly yes in that light going to jurshak for fiduciary assistance doesnt make much sense you think jurshak has something on humboldt could be the other way around could be humboldt has something to cover up and he figures jurshak is the man to do it for him i wished i knew if i could trust kappelmanhe shouldnt have needed me to spell that out for him i took the documents back and looked at them broodingly after a pause kappelman smiled at me quizzically how about dinner before i head south you fit enough to go out real food i thought i could make the effort just in case kappelman was leading me back to my pals in the black raincoats i went into the bedroom to get my gun and make a call on the extension by my bed young arts mother answered the phone her son still hadnt shown up she told me in a worried whisper mr jurshak didnt know yet that he had disappeared so shed appreciate my keeping it quiet if he shows up or if you hear from him make sure he gets in touch with me i cant tell you how important it is that he do so i hesitated not sure whether melodrama would make her totally nonfunctional or guarantee her giving my message to her son his life may be in danger but if i can talk to him i think i can keep anything from happening to him she was starting to hiss questions at me in a strained whisper but big art cut in behind her wanting to know who she was talking to she hung up hurriedly the longer young art stayed away the less i liked it the kid didnt have any friends and he didnt have any street sense i shook my head uselessly and stuck the smith wesson into the waist of my jeans kappelman was calmly reading the wall street journal when i came back to the living room he didnt look as though hed been monitoring me on the phone but if he was truly an evil creep hed be able to appear innocent i gave up chewing on it i have to tell mr contreras im going outotherwise when he realizes im not up here hes going to call the cops and have you arrested for murdering me he made a fatalistic gesture i thought id left that kind of crap behind when i moved out of my mothers house thats why im in pullmanit was as far as i could reasonably get from highland park as i locked the dead bolt the phone started to ring thinking it might be young art i excused myself to ron and went back into the apartment much to my astonishment it was ms chigwell in extreme distress i braced myself thinking she had called to upbraid me for driving her brother to attempt suicide i tried a few awkward apologies yes yes it was very sad but curtis was never a strong characterit didnt surprise me nor that he wasnt able to do it successfully i suspect he meant to be foundhe left all the lights on in the garage and he knew i would come in to see why after all he believes i drove him to it i blinked a little at the indulgent contempt in her voice she surely wasnt phoning to assuage any putative guilt on my part i asked an exploratory question well really its just somethingsomething very strange happened this afternoon she was suddenly stumbling losing her usual gruff assurance yes i said encouragingly i know its inconsiderate of me to bother you when you just had such a terrible ordeal yourself but you are an investigator and it seemed to me you were a more proper person to go to than the police another long pause i lay down on the couch to ease the soreness between my shoulders itswell its curtis im sure he broke in here this afternoon that was sufficiently startling that i sat up again broke in i thought he lived with you he does of course but well i rushed him to the hospital when i found him on tuesday he wasnt very sick and they released him on wednesday he was terribly embarrassed didnt want to face me over the breakfast table and said he was going to stay with friends and to be frank with you miss warshawski i was just as happy to be rid of him for a few days kappelman came over to where i was sitting he waved a note under my nosehe would be down with mr contreras getting permission for my outing i nodded abstractedly and asked ms chigwell to continue she took a breath audible across the lines fridays are my day at the hospital you know i do volunteer work with elderly ladies who no longerwell you dont want to hear about that now but when i got back i knew the house had been broken into and you called the police and stayed with a friend until they arrived no no i didnt because i realized almost immediately it had to be curtis or that he had let someone in who wouldnt have known the house well enough not to create a disturbance confusion was making me impatient i interrupted to ask if any valuables were gone nothing like that but you see curtiss medical notebooks are missing id hidden them from him after he tried burning them and thats why she broke off im explaining this so badly its why i hoped you would come even though its a great distance and you are most tired yourself i feel sure that whatever curtis was involved with down at the xerxes plant that he didnt want to tell you is in those notebooks which are missing i interjected shortly she gave the ghost of a laugh only his copies i kept the originals i typed his notes up for him over the years thats all thats missing i never told him i kept all the original notebooks you seehe had put the data in fathers old leather diaries the ones he had custombound for himself in london it seemeda kind of desecration to throw them out but i knew curtis would be horribly angry to think i was keeping them out of memory for father so i never told him i felt a little prickling along the base of my neck that primitive adrenaline jolt that lets you know youre getting close to the sabertoothed tiger i told her id be at her house within the hour the golden notebooks kappelman and mr contreras had struck an uneasy truce over the grappa bottle ron got quickly to his feet when i came in putting a stop to a long anecdote about how mr contreras knew when he first saw him what a lightweight one of my old lovers had been i explained glibly that id had an urgent sos from an aunt of mine in the suburbs one i couldnt ignore your aunt doll i thought you and her mr contreras caught the look of steel in my eyes oh your aunt is she in some kind of trouble more just panicking over me i said firmly but shes my mothers only surviving relative shes old and i cant leave her hanging it seemed wrong somehow to confuse the redoubtable ms chigwell with my mothers mad aunt rosa but you have to work with whats at hand kappelman agreed with me politelywhether he believed me was another matter he finished his grappa in a long swallow winced as the raw alcohol hit his esophagus and said hed see me to my car relatives are a trial arent they he added sardonically he waited patiently while i looked around the car for any obvious signs of bombs then shut the door for me with an oldfashioned courtesy at variance with his bedraggled clothes the temperature had dropped some ten degrees just below freezing after the dull fog of the last few weeks the sharper air braced me a few snowflakes drifted into the windshield but the roads were clear and i had a quick run out the eisenhower to york road ms chigwell was waiting for me at the door her gaunt fierce face unchanged for the trying events of the last few days she thanked me unsmilingly for making the trip but i was beginning to know her and could tell her rough manner wasnt meant to be as unfriendly as it appeared im having a cup of tea my brother keeps telling me its a sign of weakness turning to stimulants when one feels troubled but i think ive proved to be tougher than him would you like a cup one serving of tea a day was all the stimulus i could handle declining as politely as i could i followed her into the living room it presented a scene of cozy domesticity worthy of harriet beecher stowe a fire burning cleanly in the grate refracted rich colors in the silver tea service on a low table nearby ms chigwell gestured me to one of the chintz armchairs facing the fireplace in my day young ladies did not have lives of their own outside the household she said abruptly pouring tea into a translucent china cup we were supposed to marry my father was a doctor out here when it was really a separate little town not part of the city at all i used to help him out by the time i was sixteen i couldve set a simple fracture treated a lot of the fevers he saw but when it came time for college and medical training that was curtiss role after father died in curtis tried keeping up the practice he wasnt much good at it though patients kept going elsewhere until finally he had to take a position at that plant she looked at me fiercely i see youre an active young woman you do what you want you dont take no for an answer i wish id had your backbone at your age thats all yes i said gently but i had help my mother ended up on her own in a strange countryshe couldnt speak the language the only thing she could do was sing she almost died as a result so she swore i would never be as helpless and scared as she was believe me that makes a big difference youre asking too much of yourself to think you should have done it all on your own ms chigwell swallowed her tea in large gulps her throat muscles working her left hand clenching and unclenching finally she felt enough in command of herself to speak again well as you can tell i never married my mother died when we were seventeen i kept house for my father and then for curtis i even learned to type so i could help them with their work she smiled mirthlessly i didnt try to follow what curtis did at that company he worked for my father had been a great country doctor a master diagnostician i suspect all curtis did was take peoples temperatures when they felt ill to see if they had a legitimate excuse to leave work early by when he started in with these detailed records of his i no longer knew anything of what went on in the medical worldthe changes were too vast from my childhood days but i still knew how to type so i typed whatever he brought home for me her story made me shiver a little and mutter a little word of thanks to my mothers spirit fierce intense prickly shed been difficult to live with but my earliest memories included her strong belief in me and what i could achieve with my life ms chigwell must have seen some of the thought in my face dont pity me ive had many fine moments in this life of mine and i never indulge in selfpitya far greater weakness than tea and one curtis is most subject to we sat quietly for a while she poured herself a second cup and drank it in slow measured sips staring sightlessly into the fire when she had finished she put the cup down with a decisive snap and moved the tray to one side well i mustnt keep you with my maundering youve come a great distance and i can tell youre in a fair amount of pain even though youre trying to hide it she stood upright with only a slight effort i copied her slowly and stiffly and followed her up the carpeted stairs to the second floor the upper landing was lined with bookshelves clearly a great many of ms chigwells fine moments had come from booksthere were easily a thousand of them all neatly dusted and carefully aligned on their shelves how shed ever known something was amiss among this orderly infantry was amazing it took someone axing my front door to bits for me to know id suffered a home invasion ms chigwell nodded toward an open door on my right curtiss study i came in here last monday evening because i smelled fire he was trying to burn his notebooks in his waste can an appalling idea since the waste can was leather and it too began to burn with a terrible odor i knew then that whatever was bothering him had to do with those records but i thought it would be most wrong of him to back away from the facts by destroying them i felt an uneasy sympathy for curtis chigwell living with this battalion of rectitude it would drive me to stronger stimulants than tea anyway i took them and hid them behind my boating books obviously a foolish mistake since boating has always been my great love it is the first place curtis would have thought to look but i believe he felt so humiliated by my catching him in the act or perhaps so frightened about not being able to get rid of his guilty secret that the next afternoon he tried killing himself i shook my head so max had been right in a way by stirring up the xerxes pot id put so much pressure on chigwell that hed felt he had no options left it made me feel a little seasick i followed ms chigwell quietly down the hall my feet sinking in the soft gray pile a room at the end held a profusion of flowering plants that absorbed the eye this was ms chigwells sitting room with a rocking chair her knitting basket and a serviceable old remington on a small table the books continued in here in shelves that were built only to waist level serving as platforms for the red and yellow and purple flowers she knelt in front of the shelf next to the typewriter and started pulling leatherbound volumes from it they were oldfashioned diaries bound in rich green with horace chigwell md tooled in gold on each cover i hated curtis using fathers personal diaries but there seemed no good reason for him not to of course the warhitlers warput a stop to things like personally bound diaries and curtis never had his own he coveted these terribly there were twelve altogether covering a period of twentyeight years i flipped through them curiously dr chigwell had written in a prim spidery hand it looked neat on the page all the letters carefully aligned but it proved tough to read the books seemed to be an inventory of the medical history of the xerxes employees at least i presumed the names spelled out in the difficult script were the employees sitting in a wicker straightbacked chair i rummaged among the volumes until i found the year louisa had started at humboldt i thumbed slowly through the names they werent presented in alphabetical orderbut didnt see hers in after shed been there a year she showed up near the end of the list as a white female age seventeen address on houston my mothers name leapt out at megabriella warshawski was the person to be notified in case of an emergency nothing about the baby nothing about its father of course that didnt prove chigwell hadnt known about carolinejust that he hadnt put the information in his notebooks the rest of the entry seemed to be a series of notes in medical shorthand bp hgb bun bili cr i assumed bp was blood pressure but couldnt even begin to guess what the other letters meant i asked ms chigwell but she shook her head all this technical medicine is long after my time my father never did any blood workthey didnt even know about typing blood in his day let alone what they can do with it now i suppose i was too bitter about not becoming a doctor to want to know anything i puzzled over the entries a few more minutes but this was work for lotty i stacked the books time for me to do something i could understand i asked her how the intruders had gotten into the house i presume curtis let them in she said stiffly i leaned back in the chair and looked at her thoughtfully maybe no one had been in the house this afternoon maybe she was seizing the opportunity offered by her brothers disappearance to avenge herself for his bungling their fathers practice all these years or perhaps in the confusion of the last few days shed forgotten where shed hidden the typed notes she was after all nearly eighty i tried probing but not very skillfully she frowned ferociously young lady please do not treat me like a senile old woman i am in full possession of my faculties i saw curtis trying to bum his notes five days ago i can even show you the spot where the wastebasket burned through to the carpet why he wanted to destroy them i have no idea nor why he should sneak in here to steal them but both of these things occurred my face felt a little hot i got up and told her id check out the premises she was still a little frosty but she took me on a tour of the house although she said shed tidied any disarray among her books and silver she hadnt vacuumed or dusted after a painstaking search worthy of sherlock holmes i did find traces of dried mud on the stairwell carpeting i wasnt sure what that proved but i could easily believe it wouldnt have come from ms chigwell none of the locks showed any sign of forcing i didnt think she should stay the night here aloneanyone who came in once in such a way could easily return with or without her brother and if they had seen me arrive they might easily come back to demand why in ways that an old ladyhowever tough she might bewould be unable to withstand no one is forcing me from my home i grew up in this house and i am not leaving it now she scowled at me fiercely i tried my best to dissuade her but she was adamant either she was scared and didnt want to admit it or she knew why her brother was so desperate to get his hands on the notebooks but then she wouldnt have given the originals to me i shook my head in irritation i was exhausted my shoulders ached my head was throbbing slightly where id been hit if ms chigwell wasnt telling the truth tonight wasnt the night for me to figure it outi needed to go to bed as i was leaving though something else occurred to me who did your brother go to stay with at that she looked a little embarrassedshe didnt know i was surprised when he said he was going to stay with friends because he doesnt have any he did get a call wednesday afternoon about two hours after he got out of the hospital and it was a little after that that he announced he was going away for a few days but he left when i was doing my volunteer stint at the hospital so i dont have any idea who might have come by for him ms chigwell also had no idea who had called her brother it had been a man because she had picked up an extension at the same time curtis had hearing a man say her brothers name shed immediately hung up it was a pity really that her sense of moral rectitude had been too great for her to eavesdrop on her brother but you cant have everything in an imperfect world it was close to eleven when i finally left looking back i could see her gaunt frame silhouetted in the doorway she lifted a hand in a formal gesture and shut the door night crawlers i hadnt realized how tired i was until i got into my car the pain in my shoulders returned in a wave that swept me back limply in the front seat little tears of hurt and selfpity pricked my eyelids quitters never win and winners never quit i quoted my old basketball coach grimly play through the pain not against it i rolled the car window down my sore arm moving slowly to the commands of my brain i sat for a while watching the chigwell house and the surrounding street dozing a bit finally deciding the indomitable old lady wasnt under surveillance before putting the car into gear and heading for home the eisenhower is never really clear of traffictrucks thunder into the city throughout the night some people are getting off latenight shifts others heading for the action that begins only after dark i joined the sweep of anonymous vehicles at hillside the steady stream of lights red from the cars orange on the sides of the trucks the rows of streetlamps stretching into the distance as far as the eye could see made me feel isolated and alone a little speck in the great universe of lights an atom of dust who could merge with the mud of dead stick pond without leaving a trace behind my fragmented mood stayed with me as i drove slowly along belmont to my apartment on racine i was hoping with the bottom half of my mind that mr contreras and peppy would be up to greet methe top half sternly said i didnt want the old man breathing down my neck all the time that secret yearning may have saved my life i had paused outside mr contrerass groundfloor apartment putting down the diaries to tie my shoes seeing if my presence might rouse the dog so that id have a little companionship before going to bed the silence on the other side of the door told me the apartment was empty peppy certainly would have made herself known when she heard me and the old man would never leave her outside alone this late at night i looked up the stairs foolishly wondering if they might be waiting for me at the top my unconscious mind realized something was wrong i forced myself to stand motionless pushed my tired brain to thought the upper stairwell lay in darkness one landing light might burn out but both in the same evening stretched coincidence too far since the well of the lobby was lighted anyone coming up the steps to the second or third floor would stand well framed in a pool of light from the topmost landing came a faint murmuring not the sound of mr contreras talking to peppy picking up the notebooks i eased my way to the lobby floor i tucked the stack under one arm pulled the gun out flipped the safety off turned to face the street crouching low i opened the outer door and slid into the night no one shot at me the only person on the street was a moodylooking young man who lived down the block he didnt even glance at me as i hurried by him toward belmont i didnt want to take my carif someone was waiting for me outside the apartment they might be keeping an eye on my chevy let them think i was still hanging around if someone was waiting maybe fear and fatigue were making me jump at fantastic interpretations of light and street sounds at belmont i tucked the smith wesson back into my jeans and flagged a cab to lottys apartment it was only a mile or so away but i was in no condition to walk that far tonight i asked the cabby to wait until i knew whether anyone was going to let me in in the helpful style of todays drivers he snarled at me you dont own me i give you ride not my service for life splendid i pulled back the five id been about to hand him then ill pay you after i know whether im spending the night here he started shouting at me but i ignored him and opened the passenger door that prompted him to get physical he turned full around in the seat and swung at me i slammed the stack of journals down on his arm with all the force of the pentup frustrations from the last few days bitch he snarled you leave you get from my cab i dont need your money i slid from the backseat keeping a wary eye on him until he drove off with a great squealing of rubber all i needed now was for lotty to be away at an emergency or sleeping too soundly to hear the bell but the gods had not ordained me to have a total season of disaster this evening after a few minutes while my nervous irritation grew her voice twanged at me through the intercom its me vic can i come up she met me at the door to her apartment wrapped in a bright red dressing gown looking like a little mandarin with her dark eyes blinking away sleep im sorry lottysorry to wake you i had to go out this evening when i got home i thought there might be a reception committee waiting for me if you want me to come with you to blaze away at a few muggers the answer is emphatically no she said sardonically but i am glad to see you had a little more care for your skin than to go after them by yourself i couldnt respond to her breezy mood i want to call the police and i dont want to go back over to racine until theyve had a chance to check the place out very good indeed lotty said amazed i begin even to think you might live to be forty thanks a bunch i muttered at her going to the phone i didnt like turning tail handing my problems over to someone else to solve but refusing to get help just because lotty was being sarcastic seemed stupid bobby mallory was home like lotty he was inclined to taunt me a little over going to him for help but once hed absorbed the facts his professional persona took over he asked me a few crisp questions then assured me hed have a squad car there without lights before he left his house before hanging up though he couldnt keep from rubbing my nose in it you just stay put now vicki i cant believe youre letting the police handle police business but rememberthe last thing we want is for you to come bounding up and get in between us and a couple of hoods right i said sourly ill look at the morning papers to see how things turn out the line went dead in my ear i spent the next hour or so moving restlessly around lottys sitting room she tried at first to talk me into going to sleep in her spare bed preparing hot milk with brandy for me but she finally left me to myself i need my sleep even if you dont victoria im not going to lecture you on rest after your physical ordealif by now you dont know you should no words of mine will have any effect just rememberyour body is an aging organism it will repair itself more and more slowly as time goes by and the less help you give it the less you will be able to rely on it i knew by the tone as much as the words that lotty was truly angry but i was too fragmented still to make any kind of response she loves me she was afraid i would put myself at such risk i would die and abandon her i understood that i just couldnt fix it tonight it was only when shed shut her door with an angry snap that i remembered the chigwell notebooks not the time to knock at her bedroom and ask for help in deciphering his medical shorthand i drank some of the milk and lay down on the daybed with my boots off but i couldnt relax all i could think was that i had run scared from my problems had turned to the police and now i was waiting like some good oldfashioned damsel in distress for rescue it was too much a little after midnight i pulled my boots back on leaving a note on the kitchen table for lotty i crept out of the apartment quietly closing the door behind me i started walking south keeping to the main streets hoping to find a cab my restless energy held my fatigue at bay when i got to belmont i stopped looking for taxis and covered the last half mile at a brisk walk id been imagining the street filled with flashing blueandwhites and uniformed men racing around by the time i got home however any police activity had disappeared without a trace i went cautiously into the lobby crouching a little hugging the walls out of range of the stairwell the upperlanding lights were on again as i climbed the first half flight going sideways with my back sliding along the wall mr contrerass apartment door opened peppy bounded out followed by the old man when he saw me tears started streaming down his cheeks oh doll thank god youre all right the cops was here they wouldnt tell me nothing wouldnt let me into your place or tell me if they knew where you was what happened to you where you been after a few disjointed minutes we got our stories out around tenthirty someone had called him telling him i was down in my office and in bad shape it didnt occur to him to summon help or ask himself who the strange phone caller was instead he bundled peppy up bullied a passing cab into taking both of them and hurled himself downtown hed never been to my office so hed wasted some time finding the place when he saw that the door was locked and the lights out hed been too impatient to find the night watchman hed used his trusty pipe wrench to break the lock im sorry doll he said dolefully ill fix it for you in the morning if id been using my head i guess i wouldve known it was someone trying to get me and the dog out of the way i nodded abstractedly someone was keeping close enough tabs on me to know that my downstairs neighbor would be watching if they set up an ambush ron kappelman who else had seen mr contreras at such close quarters did the police find anyone here i asked abruptly they took a couple of guys away in a paddy wagon but i didnt get any kind of look at them i couldnt even do that for you they came gunning for you and they got me out of the way with a cheap trick that wouldnt of fooled a sixyearold and then me not knowing whered youd gone off to or nothing i knew it couldnt be your aunt not after what you told me about her and your ma but i just didnt have any idea where you could be it took me awhile to get him calmed down enough that he would let me spend the night alone after a few more rehearsals of worry and selfreproach he finally saw me up the stairs to my apartment someone had tried breaking into my apartment but the steellined door id had installed after my last home invasion had held they couldnt cut through it and they hadnt been able to get by my third dead bolt even so i made a thorough tour of the premises with mr contreras and the dog he left her with me waiting outside until he heard the last bolt slide home before going downstairs to his own bed i tried calling bobby at the central district but hed disappearedor didnt want to take my call none of the other officers i knew were in and the ones i didnt know wouldnt tell me anything about the men theyd picked up at my place i had to give it a rest until morning fence mending i was being buried alive an executioner wearing a black plastic hood was pouring dirt on me just tell us the time girlie he said lotty and max loewenthal sat nearby eating asparagus and drinking cognac ignoring my helpless screams i woke from the dream sweating and panting but every time i went back to sleep the nightmare returned when i finally got up for good it was late morning i was stiff and sore my head filled with the cotton wool an uneasy night always leaves behind i moved on thick ungainly legs to the bathroom with peppy watching anxiously from the doorway i soaked in the tub for a long while it had to be kappelman whod arranged for last nights ambush he was the only one who knew i was leaving my apartment the only one who knew the anxious care mr contreras lavished on me but try as i might i couldnt think why hed do it it wasnt beyond belief to think he might have murdered nancy love affairs gone awry bring at least one person a day to twentysixth and california but a crime of passion had nothing to do with me all my machinations about humboldt about why pankowski and ferraro had sued the company about chigwell didnt seem to connect with ron kappelman unless he knew something he was desperate to keep hidden about jurshaks insurance file but what could his involvement have been with them it was easier to think that art jurshak had staged last nights aborted attack after all he could have drawn the old man off without knowing i wasnt at home then decided to lie in wait until i got back my mind churned fruitlessly the water grew cold but i didnt stir until the telephone began to ring it was bobby brighter and more alert than i could tolerate in my febrile state dr herschel says you left her in the middle of the night i thought i told you to stay away from your apartment until we gave you the allclear i didnt want to wait for the second coming of christ who did you find at my place last night watch your language around me young lady bobby said automaticallyhe doesnt think nice girls should talk like hardboiled dicks and even though he knows half the reason i do it is to ride him he cant resist rising to the bait before i could put in my two cents about not being a subaltern he could order aboutthere are baits i also cant resist he hurried on we picked up two guys hanging around your door they say theyd just come upstairs for a smoke but they both had picklocks and guns the states attorney got us twentyfour hours with them on concealed and unregistered felony weapons we want you to come down to a lineupsee if you can identify either of these gents as being involved in wednesdays attack on you yeah i guess i said unenthusiastically they had black slickers on the kind with hoods that cover a lot of the face im not sure id ever recognize them again great bobby ignored my lack of ardor ill have a uniformed man pick you up in half an hourunless thats too early for you like justice i never sleep i said politely and hung up murray phoned next theyd put the morning edition to bed before word of an arrest outside my place had come in from one of his police snitches his boss knowing of our relationship had woken him with the news murray pumped away with tireless energy for several minutes finally i cut him off crossly im going down to look at a lineup if either art jurshak or dr chigwells sister is there ill give you a call back which reminds methe good doctor has gone off with the kind of guys who like to break into other peoples houses i hung up on his squawk the phone rang again as i was stomping into the bedroom to get dressed i chose to ignore itlet murray get his news from public radio or something as i was brushing my hair with surly ill will mr contreras brought breakfast to the door my last nights desire for his companionship had worn off i drank a cup of coffee ungraciously and told him i didnt have time to eat when he started fussing over me i lost my temper and snapped at him a hurt look came into his faded brown eyes he collected the dog with quiet dignity and left i immediately felt ashamed of myself and ran after him hed already reached the lobby though and i didnt have my keys with me i headed back up the stairs while i was gathering my keys and my handbag sticking the smith wesson into my jeans the uniformed man arrived to take me down to the lineup i carefully locked the dead bolt behind mesome days i dont bother with itand ran down the stairs soonest started soonest ended or whatever it was lady macbeth said the uniformed man turned out to be a woman patrol officer mary louise neely she was quiet and serious holding herself ramrod straight in her fiercely pressed navy serge calling me maam in a way that made me acutely aware of the twelve or more years between us she opened the door for me with military crispness and ushered me down the walk to the waiting patrol car mr contreras was out in front with peppy i wanted to make some gesture of reconciliation but officer neelys stern presence robbed me of any words i held out a hand but he nodded stiffly to me calling the dog sharply as she headed down the walk behind me i tried asking the patrolwoman insightful questions about her work and whether the cubs or the sox could worsen their abysmal performance of last season she snubbed me completely though keeping her stem gaze on malefactors on lake shore drive murmuring periodically into her lapel transmitter we covered the six miles to the central district at a good clip she pulled smartly into the police lot about fifteen minutes after leaving my apartment okay it was saturday not much traffic but it was still an impressive performance neely whisked me through the labyrinth of the old building exchanging unsmiling greetings with fellow officers and brought me to an observation room bobby was there with sergeant mcgonnigal and detective finchley neely saluted them so sharply i thought she might keel over backward thanks officer bobby dismissed her genially well carry on from here i found my palms sweating slightly my heart beating a little faster i didnt want to see the men whod bundled me into that blanket on wednesday that was why id fled my place last night they had me well and truly spooked and now i was to perform like an obedient dog under the watchful eyes of the police you got names on the two you picked up i asked keeping my tone cool trying to shade it with a little arrogance yeah bobby grunted joe jones and fred smith theyre almost as funny to deal with as you are and yes weve requested a print check but these things never happen as fast as you hope they will we can make a case on the loitering in a private building and carrying concealed unregistered weapons but you know and i know theyll be on the street monday unless we can back it up with attempted murder so youre to tell me if theyre your pals who sent you swimming on wednesday he nodded to finchley a black plainclothesman id known when he started on patrol the detective went to a door across the room and gave orders to unseen people beyond to start the lineup eyewitness identification is not the great revelation they make of it in courtroom dramas under stress the memory plays tricks on youyoure sure you saw a tall black man in blue jeans and it was really a fat white man in a business suit stuff like that probably a third of my presentations as a public defender had been based on reciting remarkable instances of mistaken identity on the other hand stress can bum some indelible memoriesa gesture a birthmarkthat come back when you see the person again it never hurts to try keeping my hands in my pockets so as to hide their tremor i walked with bobby to the oneway observation window mcgonnigal turned out the lights on our side and the little room beyond sprang into relief weve got two sets for you bobby murmured in my ear you know the routinetake your time ask for any of them to turn around or whatever six men walked in with selfconscious pugnacity they all looked alike to mewhite burly somewhere around forty i tried to imagine them with black hoods the executioner of my nightmare this morning ask them to talk i said abruptly ask them to say just tell us the time girlie and then dump her here troy x marks the spot finchley conveyed the request to the unseen officers running the show one by one the men obediently mumbled their lines i kept watching the second guy from the left he had a kind of secretive smilehe knew theyd never make a serious charge stick his eyes could i remember the eyes of the man whod come up to me at the edge of the lagoon cold flat calculating his words to find my weaknesses but when this man spoke i didnt recognize the voice it was husky with the twang of the south side not the emotionless tones i remembered i shook my head i think its the second guy from the left but i dont recognize the voice and i cant be absolutely certain bobby nodded fractionally and finchley gave orders to dismiss the lineup well i demanded is he the one the lieutenant smiled reluctantly i thought it was a long shot but hes the guy we picked up outside your front door last night i dont know if your id is strong enough for the states attorney but maybe we can find out who puts up bond for him they brought in the second lineup a parade of black men id seen only one of my attackers close up even though i presumed troy was one of the men in front of me i couldnt pick him out even with a voice check bobby was in high good humor with my id of the first man he ran me genially through the paperwork and got officer neely to take me home sending me off with a pat on the arm and a promise of telling me when the first court date would be my own mood wasnt nearly as pleasant when neely had dropped me at my apartment i went up to change into running shoes i wasnt up for a run yet but i needed a long walk to clear my brain before seeing little caroline this afternoon first though i had to mend a few fences mr contreras received me coolly trying to mask his hurt feelings under a veneer of formality but subtlety wasnt really part of his makeup he unbent after a few minutes told me he would never come up to my apartment again without phoning first and fried up some eggs and bacon for lunch i sat talking with him afterward curbing my impatience at the long flow of irrelevant reminiscence anyway the longer he talked the longer i could put off facing a tougher conversation at two though i figured id avoided lotty long enough and set off for sheffield lotty wasnt as easy to kiss and make up with she was home in between her morning clinic hours and an afternoon concert with max we talked in the kitchen while she whipped tiny stitches into the hem of a black skirt at least she didnt slam the door on me i dont know how many times i have patched you up in the last ten years victoria many and almost every time a lifethreatening situation why do you value yourself so little i stared at the floor i dont want anyone solving my problems for me but you came here last night you involved me in your problems and then you disappeared without a word that isnt independencethat is thoughtless cruelty you must make up your mind about what you want with me if it is just to be your doctorthe person who patches you up when youve decided to run your head in front of a bulletfine we will go to such cold encounters but if you want to be friends you cannot behave with such careless disregard for my feelings for you can you understand that i rubbed my head tiredly finally i looked at her lotty im scared ive never been this frightened not since the day my dad told me gabriella was dying and nothing could be done for her i knew then that it was a terrible mistake to depend on someone else to solve my problems for me now i seem to be too terrorized to solve them for myself and im thrashing around but when i ask for help it just drives me wild i know its hard on you im sorry for that but i cant get enough distance right now to do anything about it lotty finished pulling the thread through her hem and put the skirt down she gave a wry little smile yes it is not an easy thing to lose ones mother is it could we make a little compromise my dear i wont demand of you responses you cant make but when you find yourself in this state will you tell me so that i am not making myself so angry with you i nodded a few times my throat too tight for me to speak she came over to me and held me close to her you are the daughter of my heart victoria i know its not the same as having gabriella but the love is there i smiled shakily in your fierceness youre two of a kind after that i told her about the notebooks id left behind she promised to look at them on sunday to see if she could make anything of them and now i must dress my dear but why not come spend the night here maybe well both feel a little better old fireball when i got back to my apartment i stopped to tell mr contreras i was home and let him know caroline would be arriving soon my conversation with lotty had done something to restore my equilibrium i felt calm enough to abandon my plan for a walk in favor of a little housekeeping the partially cooked chicken id stashed in the refrigerator tuesday night had become pretty rank i carried it down to the garbage can in the alley scrubbed the refrigerator with soda to deaden the smell and bundled my newspapers out front for the recycling team to pick up by the time caroline arrived a little after four id paid all my december bills and had organized the receipts for my tax returns i was also feeling all my sore muscles caroline came quietly up the stairs smiling a little nervously she followed me into the living room turning down my offer of refreshments in a soft breathy voice i couldnt remember ever seeing her so ill at ease hows louisa doing i asked she made a throwaway gesture she seems stable right now but kidney failure leaves you pretty depressedit seems dialysis only gets a fraction of impurities out of the system so youre always feeling nightmarish did you tell her about the call you gotabout joey pankowski being your father she shook her head i havent told her anything about your looking for him oror well about anything i had to let her know nancy was dead of courseshe would have seen it on tv or heard it from her sister but she cant take any more upsets like that she played nervously with the fringe on one of the sofa cushions then burst out i wish id never asked you to find my father for me i dont know what magic i thought you could work and i dont know why i thought finding him would alter my life in any way she gave a harsh little laugh what am i saying just having you look for him has changed my life could we talk about that a little i asked gently someone called you two weeks ago and told you to chase me away didnt they that was when you phoned me with that incredible rigmarole about not wanting me to look for your father her head was bent down so far all i could see was her wild copper curls i waited patiently she would not have made the trek up to lakeview if she hadnt decided to tell me the truthit was just taking her some time to give her courage the last screw its the mortgage she finally whispered to her feet we rented for years and years then when i started working we could finally save enough to make a down payment i got a call a mani dont know who he was he saidhe saidhed been looking into our loan he thoughthe told methey would cancel it if i didnt make you stop looking for my fatherstop you from asking all those questions about ferraro and pankowski at last she looked up at me her freckles standing out sharply from the pallor of her face she held out her hands beseechingly and i moved from my chair to put my arms around her for a few minutes she nestled against me trembling as though she were still little caroline and i was the big kid who could save her from any danger did you call the bank i asked her presently see if they knew anything about it i was afraid if they heard me asking questions they might do it you know her voice was muffled against my armpit what bank is it she sat up at that and looked at me in alarm youre not going to go talk to them about it vic you mustnt i may know someone who works there or someone on the board i said patiently if i find i cant ask a few questions very discreetly i promise not to paw up the dirt okay anyway its a pretty good bet that its ironworkers savings loanthats where everyone in the neighborhood has always gone her big eyes searched my face anxiously it is vic but you have to promise really promise you wont do anything that will jeopardize our mortgage it would kill ma if something like that happened now you know it would i nodded solemnly and gave my word i didnt think she was exaggerating the effect on louisa of any kind of major disturbance as i thought about carolines frantic response to the threat on her mother something else occurred to me when nancy was murdered you told the police i knew why shed been killed why did you do that was it because you really wanted me to keep an eye on you and louisa she blushed violently yes but it didnt do me any good her voice was barely a squeak you mean they did it cut off your mortgage worse theythey somehow figured outid gone to you about her murder they called me again at least it was the same man and said if i didnt want to see mas medical benefits cut off id better get you away from south chicago so i was really scared then i tried my best and when this man called me back i told himtold him i couldntcouldnt stop you that you were on your own so they decided to stop me themselves my throat was dry my own voice came out harshly she looked at me fearfully can you forgive me vic when i saw the news saw what happened to you it shattered me but if i had to do it again id have to do it the same way i couldnt let them hurt ma not after everything she went through for me not with all her suffering now i got up and paced angrily to the window didnt it occur to you if you told me i could do something about it protect her and you instead of running blind so that i almost got killed myself i didnt think you could she said simply when i asked you to find my father i was still imagining you were my big sister that you could solve all my problems for me then i saw you werent as powerful as id imagined you to be it was just with ma so sick and everything i needed someone so badly to look after me and i thought maybe youd still be that person her statement dissipated my anger i came back to the couch and smiled wryly at her i think youve finally grown up caroline thats what it is all rightno big people to clean up all the mess around us but even if im not still the kid who could whip the neighborhood to save your butt im not totally ineffective i think its possible to tidy some of the garbage floating around on this one she gave a shaky smile okay vic ill see if i can help you i went to the dining room and pulled a bottle of barolo from the liquor cupboard caroline rarely drank but the heavy wine helped steady her we talked for a while not about our current problems but general thingswhether caroline really wanted a law degree if she didnt have to play catchup with me after a glass or two we both felt able to return to the discussion at hand i told her about pankowski and ferraro and the conflicting reports on their suit against humboldt chemical i dont know what that has to do with nancys death or with the attack on me but it was when i found out about it and started questioning people about them that someone threatened me she listened to a detailed report on my encounters with dr chigwell and his sister but she couldnt shed any light on the blood work hed kept on xerxes employees this is the first i ever heard about it you know the kind of person ma isif they sent her in for a medical exam every year she did it without thinking about it a lot of things people told her to do on the job didnt make any sense to her and this would be one of them i cant believe it has anything to do with nancys death okay lets try another one why did xerxes buy their insurance through art is jurshak still the fiduciary on their lifehealth stuff why was it important enough to nancy that she was carrying it around caroline shrugged art keeps a pretty tight grip on a number of the businesses down there he might have gotten their insurance in exchange for a tax break or something of course when washington was elected art didnt have as many favors to hand out but he still can do a lot for a company if they do something for him i pulled jurshaks report to mariners rest from mozarts concert arias and handed it to caroline she frowned over it for several minutes i dont know anything about insurance she finally said all i can tell you is that mas benefits have been firstclass i dont know about any of these other companies her words triggered an elusive memory something someone had said to me in the last few weeks about xerxes and insurance i frowned trying to drag it the surface but i couldnt get hold of it it meant something to nancy i said impatiently what did she collect data on health and mortality rates for any of these companies maybe she had some way of checking the accuracy of this report maybe the report didnt mean anything but then why had nancy been carrying it around yes she did track all these health statisticsshe was the director of health and environmental services so lets go down to scrap and check her files i got up and started hunting for my boots caroline shook her head nancys files are gone the police impounded what she had in her desk but someone had cleaned out her health files before the cops got them we just assumed shed taken them home with her my anger returned in a rush fueled by disappointment i was sure wed reached a break in the case why the hell didnt you tell the police that two weeks ago or me dont you see caroline whoever killed her took her papers we could have been looking exclusively at people involved in these companies instead of trailing around after vengeful lovers and all that crap she heated up just as fast i told you at the time she was killed because of her work you just were on your usual fucking arrogant head trip and wouldnt pay any attention to me you said it was because of the recycling plant which this has nothing to do with and anyway why didnt you tell me that her files had disappeared we went at it like a couple of sixyearolds both venting our fury over the threats and humiliations of the past few weeks i dont know how we would have extricated ourselves from the escalating insults if we hadnt been interrupted by the buzzer outside my front door i left caroline in the living room and stormed to the entrance mr contreras was standing there i dont mean to be butting in cookie he said apologetically but this young fellas been ringing the lobby bell for the last couple of minutes and you two was so wrapped up i thought maybe you couldnt hear him young art trailed in behind mr contreras his square chiseled face was flushed and his auburn hair disheveled he was biting his lips clenching and unclenching his hands in so much turmoil that his usual beauty was obscured the family resemblance i saw in his distraught face staggered me so much that it muffled my surprise at seeing him i finally said weakly what are you doing here where have you been did your mother send you he cleared his throat trying to speak but he couldnt seem to get any words out mr contreras his promise not to breathe down my neck still present in his mind didnt linger to issue his usual unsubtle threats against my male visitors or maybe hed summed up art and figured he didnt need to worry when the old man had left art finally spoke i need to talk to you itthings are worse than i thought his voice came out in a squawky little whisper caroline came to the livingroom door to see what the uproar was about i turned to her and said as gently as i could this is young art jurshak caroline i dont know if youve ever met but hes the aldermans son hes got something confidential he needs to tell me can you call some of your pals at scrap see if any of them know anything about this report nancy was carrying around with her i was afraid she was going to argue with me but my stunned mood got across to her she asked if i was all right if it was okay to leave me with young art when i reassured her she went back to the living room for her coat she stopped briefly at the door on her way out and said in a small voice i didnt mean all those things i was saying i came here to get back on good terms with you not to shout like that i rubbed her shoulders gently its okay fireballit goes with the territory i said some stupid things myself lets forget it she gave me a quick hug and took off flushed out of the pocket i took art into the living room and poured him a glass of the barolo he gulped it down water would probably have been just as good under the circumstances where have you been hiding do you know every beat cop in chicago is carrying your description or that your mothers going crazy they werent the questions i really wanted to ask but i couldnt figure out how to frame those his lips stretched in a nervous parody of his usual beautiful smile i was at nancys i figured no one would look there hnunh i shook my head youve been gone since monday night and i was at nancys on tuesday with mrs cleghorn i spent monday night in my car then i figured no one would be bothering with nancys house ii could see it had been torn up pretty good its been kind of spooky but i knew id be safe there since theyd already searched it whos they the people who killed nancy and who are they i felt as though i was interrogating a jug of molasses i dont know he muttered looking away but you can guess i prodded tell me about the insurance your father manages for xerxes what was nancys interest in it how did you get those papers he whispered i called my mother this morning i knew shed be worried and she said you had been by mymy old manbig art had found the card you left and really blown sky high she said he was screaming thatthat if he got his hands on me hed see i remembered never to betray him again thats why i came here to see what you know see if you can help me i looked at him sourly ive been trying to get you to tell me a few things for the last two weeks and youve been acting as though english was your second language and you werent too fluent in it he scrunched up his face in misery i know but when nancy died i was so afraid afraid my old man had something to do with it why didnt you run away then why wait until i talked to you he flushed an even deeper red i thought maybe no one would knowknow the connection but if you saw it anyone could like the police you mean or big art when he didnt answer i said with what patience i could muster okay why did you come here today i called my mother this morning i knew my old man would be at a meeting that i could count on him not being home the slatemakers you know he smiled unhappily with washington dead they were all getting together this morning to plan for the election dadartmight miss a council meeting but he wouldnt stay away from that anyway mother told me about you about how youd been around but then youd almost ended up the samethe same way as nancy i couldnt stay in her place forever there was hardly any food anyway and i was scared to turn on the lights at night in case someone saw and came into inspect and if they were going to go after anyone who knew about nancy and the insurance i figured id better get help or id be dead i curbed my impatience as best i could it was going to be a long afternoon getting information from him the questions that were really burning my tongueabout his family would have to wait until i could pry his story from him the first thing i wanted to clear up was his relationship with nancy since he had let himself into her house he couldnt very well keep denying theyd been lovers and the story came out sweet sad and stupid he and nancy had met a year before on a community project she was representing scrap he the aldermans office shed attracted him immediatelyhed always liked older women who had her kind of looks and warmth and hed wanted to go out with her right away but shed put him off with one excuse or another until a few months ago then theyd started dating and had rapidly moved to a fullblown affair hed been deliriously happy she was warm lovingon and on so why didnt anyone know about it if you were both so happy i asked i could just see it barely when he wasnt shredding himself with misery his incredible beauty made you want to touch him maybe it was enough for nancy maybe she thought the aesthetics of it compensated for his immaturity she might have been coldblooded enough to want him as a conduit to the aldermans office but i didnt think so he shifted uncomfortably my dad always raved on so much against scrap i knew hed hate it if i was dating someone who worked there he felt they were trying to take over the ward from him you know always criticizing things like the broken sidewalks in south chicago and the unemployment and stuff its not his fault you know but when washington got in charge you didnt see a penny going to the white ethnic neighborhoods i opened my mouth to argue the point then shut it again south chicago had begun its demise under the late great mayor daley and had been assiduously ignored by bilandic and byrne alike and art sr had been alderman all that time but fighting such a war wasnt going to do me any good this afternoon so you didnt want him to know and nancy didnt want her friends to know about you either same reason he squirmed again i dont think so i thinkshe was a little bit older than me you know only ten years well almost eleven but i think she was afraid people would laugh at her if they knew she was seeing someone so young okay so it was a big secret then she came to you three weeks ago to see if art was opposed to the recycling plant what happened then he reached nervously for the wine bottle and poured the last of the barolo into his glass when hed gulped most of it down he started spitting out the story a bit at a time he knew art was against the recycling plant his dad was working hard to bring new industry to south chicago and he was afraid a recycling plant would put some companies offthat they wouldnt want to operate in a community where they had to go to the extra trouble of putting their wastes in drums for recycling instead of just dumping them into lagoons hed told nancy that and she had insisted on seeing any files about the project apparently like me shed figured it wasnt worth arguing whether art srs professed reasons were the real ones young art hadnt wanted to do it but shed pushed hard they went back to the insurance office late one night and she went through arts desk it was horrible the most horrible night hed ever spent worrying about his father or his fathers secretary coming in on them or one of the beat cops seeing a light and surprising them i understand the first time you break and enter is always the hardest but why did nancy choose this insurance file over something about recycling he shook his head i dont know she was looking for anything with the names of any of the companies involved in the recycling plant on it and then she saw these papers and said she didnt know wemy dads agencyhandled xerxess insurance and then she read through them and said this was hot stuff shed better copy it and take it along so she went down the hall to use the machine and big art came in your father saw her i gasped he nodded miserably he had steve dresberg with him nancy ran but she scattered the originals all over the floor so they knew she was copying them and what did you do his face disappeared into a little ball of such abject shame that i felt almost sorry for him they never knew i was there i hid in my own office with the lights off i didnt know what to say that he could have abandoned nancy to her fate that he knew dresberg had been there with his old man and at the same time the logical part of my mind began worrying about the problem was it the insurance papers or was it the fact that nancy had seen art with dresberg it wasnt surprising that the alderman had ties to the garbage king but it was understandable that he kept them quiet dont you understand i finally cried out my voice close to a howl if youd said something about your father and dresberg last week we might have gotten somewhere in investigating nancys death dont you care anything about finding her killers he stared at me through tragic blue eyes if it was your father would you want to knowreally knowhe was doing that kind of thing anyway he already thinks im such a failure what would he think if i turned him in to the cops hed say i was siding with scrap and the washington faction against him i shook my head to see if that would clear my brain but it didnt seem to help any i tried speaking but every sentence i started ended in a few sputtered words finally i asked weakly what he wanted me to do i need help he muttered you aint kidding boy but i dont know if even a michigan avenue analyst could do anything for you and im damned sure i cant i know im not very tough not like you oror nancy but im not an imbecile either i dont need you making fun of me i cant fix this myself i need help and i thought since youd been a friend of hers you might his voice trailed off rescue you i finished sardonically okay ill help you in exchange for which i want some information about your family he looked wildly at me my family whats that got to do with anything just tell me its got nothing to do with you what was your mothers maiden name my mothers maiden name he repeated stupidly kludka why do you want to know it wasnt djiak you never heard of that djiak of course i know the name my fathers sister married some guy named ed djiak but they moved to canada before i was born ive never met themi wouldnt even have heard of dads sister if i hadnt seen the name on a letter when i joined the agencywhen i asked my father he told me about itsaid theyd never gotten along and shed cut the connection why do you want to know about them i didnt answer him i felt so nauseated that i leaned my head over onto my knees when art had come in with his face all flushed his auburn hair wildly standing around his head his resemblance to caroline had been so strong that they might have been twins hed gotten his red hair from his father caroline took after louisa of course how simple how simple and how horrifying all the same genes all in the same family i just hadnt wanted to begin thinking such a thing when i saw them side by side instead id been trying to work out some way arts wife could be related to caroline my conversation with ed and martha djiak three weeks earlier came back to me in full force and with connie how her uncle liked to come around and have louisa dance for him mrs djiak knew what had she said men have difficulty controlling themselves but that it was louisas fault that shed led him on my gorge rose so violently i thought i would choke blame her blame their fifteenyearold daughter when it was her own brother who got her pregnant my one thought was to get out of here to get down to east side with my gun and beat the djiaks until they admitted the truth i got up but the room swam darkly in front of me i sat back down again steadying myself becoming aware of young art talking frightenedly in the chair across from me i told you what you asked now youve got to help me yeah right ill help you come along with me he started to protest to demand to know what i was going to do but i cut him off sharply just come with me i dont have any more time right now my tone more than my words stopped him he watched silently while i got my coat i tucked my drivers license and money into my jeans pocket so i wouldnt be hampered by a purse he started to stammer some more questionswas i going to shoot his old manwhen he saw me take out the smith wesson and check the clip shoes on the other foot i said curtly your fathers buddies have been gunning for me all week he blushed again with shame and lapsed back into silence i took him down to mr contreras this is art jurshak his papa may have had something to do with nancys death and he isnt feeling too kindly toward his kid right now can you keep him here until i can make some other arrangement for him maybe murray will want to take him the old man preened himself importantly sure thing doll i wont say a word to anybody and you can count on her highness here to do the same no need to go asking that ryerson guy to do anythingim perfectly happy to keep him as long as you want i smiled faintly after a couple of hours with him you may change your mindhes not a lot of fun just dont tell anyone about him that lawyerron kappelmanmay come around say you dont know where ive gone or when ill be back and not a word about your guest where are you going doll i pressed my lips together in a reflex of annoyance then remembered our truce i beckoned him into the hall so i could tell him without arts hearing mr contreras came quickly the dog at his ankles and nodded gravely to show he remembered both name and address ill be here when you come back i wont let anyone lure me away tonight but if youre not back by midnight im calling lieutenant mallory doll the dog padded after me to the door but gave a little sigh of resignation when mr contreras called her back she knew i had my boots on not my running shoesshed just been hoping a family affair i could hear mrs djiaks hurried footsteps after i rang the bell she opened the door drying her hands on her apron victoria she was horrified what are you doing here this late at night i begged you not to come back again mr djiak will be furious if he knows youre here ed djiaks nasal baritone wafted down the hallway demanding of his wife who was at the door justjust one of the neighbor children ed she called back breathlessly to me she said in a hurried undervoice now go quickly before he sees you i shook my head im coming in mrs djiak were going to talk all three of us about the man who got louisa pregnant her eyes dilated in her strained face she grabbed beseechingly at my arm but i was too angry to feel any compassion for her i shook her hand from me ignoring her piteous cries i brushed past her into the house and down the hall i didnt take my boots offnot to add a deliberate insult to her distress but because i wanted to be able to leave quickly if i had to ed djiak was sitting at the table in the immaculate kitchen a little blackandwhite tv in front of him a beer mug in his hand he didnt look up immediately assuming it was just his wife but when he saw me his long dark face turned a deep umber you have no business in this house young woman i wish i could agree with you i said pulling a chair back from the table to face him it nauseates me to be here and i wont prolong the visit i just want to talk about mrs djiaks brother she doesnt have a brother he said harshly dont pretend art jurshak isnt her brother i dont think wed have too much trouble finding mrs djiaks maiden nameid have to wait until monday when i could go down to city hall and check your marriage license but i expect itll say martha jurshak then i could get copies of arts and her birth certificates and thatd probably clinch the matter the umber in his face deepened to mahogany he turned to his wife you damned talkative bitch who have you been telling our private affairs to no one ed really i havent said a word to anyone not once in all these years not even to father stepanek when i begged you he cut her off with a slice of his hand whos been talking to you victoria whos been spreading slander about my family slander implies false report i responded insolently everything youve said since i came into this house confirms that its true that whats true he demanded recovering himself with a strong effort that my wifes maiden name was jurshak what if it was just this that her brother art got your daughter louisa pregnant you told me he wasnt very strong martha did he have a history of liking little girls she was wiping her hands over and over in her apron hehe promised he would never do it again damn you dont say anything to her djiak roared springing from his chair he shoved past me roughly to where mrs djiak stood and slapped her i was on my feet smashing my fist into his face before i realized what i was doing he was thirty years older than me but still very strong it was only because i took him completely by surprise that i managed to hit him full force he recoiled against the refrigerator and stood for a moment shaking his head to recover from the blow then the ugly anger returned and he came for me i was ready as he charged i slid a chair in his path he crashed against it his momentum forcing him and the chair into the table his fall brought down the tv set and the beer in a jumbled mess of glass and fluid he lay sprawled under the table the chair on top of him martha djiak gave a little moan of horror whether over the sight of her husband or the mess on the floor i couldnt know i stood over him panting from fury my gun in my hand barrelfirst ready to smash it into him if he started to get up his face was glazednone of his womenfolk had ever fought back against him mrs djiak screamed suddenly i turned to look at her she couldnt speak only point but i saw a little fire sparkling along the back of the television where something had mixed with the exposed wires maybe a jar of solvent that was kept at the ready for oil stains menacing the kitchen i stuffed the gun back into my jeans waistband and snatched the dish towel from her apron pocket carefully skirting the pool of beer i crawled under the table and unplugged the set baking soda i called sharply to mrs djiak the demand for a commonplace household item helped her regain some balance i watched her feet move to a cupboard she crouched down and handed me the box across her husbands body i dumped the contents on the blue flames flickering around the set and watched the fire go out mr djiak slowly untangled himself from the mess of chair and broken glass he stood for a moment looking at the wreck on the floor at the wet stains on his pants then without saying anything he left the room i could hear his heavy footsteps pass down the hall martha djiak and i listened to the front door slam she was shaking i seated her in one of the plasticcovered chairs and heated water in the teakettle she watched me dumbly while i rummaged through her cupboards looking for tea when i found the lipton bags tucked neatly into a canister i made her a cup mixing it well with sugar and milk she drank it obediently in scalding gulps do you think you can tell me about louisa now i asked when shed turned down a second cup how did you find out her eyes were lifeless her voice little more than a tired thread your brothers son came to visit me this afternoon each time ive seen him i thought he looked familiar but i put it down to years of looking at art on posters or tv but today caroline was with me she and i were in the middle of an argument young art walked in with his face flushed all agitated and suddenly i realized how much he resembled caroline they might almost be twins you knowi just hadnt connected them before because i wasnt expecting it of course hes got that unearthly beauty and shes always so disheveled it wasnt until they were both upset at the same time that you could really see it she listened to my explanation with her face screwed up painfully as if i were lecturing in latin and she was trying to make me think she could follow me when she didnt say anything i prodded her a little why did you throw louisa out of the house when she got pregnant she looked at me directly then some mix of fear and disgust on her face keep her in the house with that shame for all the world to know about it wasnt her shame it was arts your brothers how can you even compare the two she wouldnt have gottengotten in trouble if she hadnt led him on she saw how much he liked her to dance for him and kiss him hehe had a weakness she should have kept away from him my nausea was so acute it took all my will not to jump on her physically to slam her body into the debris under the table if you knew he had a weakness for little girls why the hell did you let him near your daughters hehe said he wouldnt do it again after i saw himplaying withwith connie when she was five i told him i would tell ed about it if he ever did it again he promised he was afraid of ed but louisa was too much for him she was too evilminded she led him on against his own strength when we saw she was going to have a baby she told us how it happened and art explained it to us how she led him on against his own strength so you threw her out into the world if it hadnt been for gabriella who knows what would have happened to her the two of youwhat a couple of sanctimonious righteous bastards you are she took my insults unflinchingly she couldnt understand why i would be angry over such logical parental behavior but shed seen me beat up her husband she wasnt going to risk exciting me was art already married then i asked abruptly no we told him he was going to have to find a wife start a family or wed have to tell father stepanek tell the priest about louisa we promised we wouldnt say anything if she moved away and he started a family i didnt know what to say all i could think of was louisa at sixteen pregnant out on her own the holy ladies of st wenceslaus parading in front of her door and gabriella riding in on her white horse to the rescue all the old insults from the djiaks about gabriellas being a jew came back to me how can you pretend to call yourselves christians my mother was a thousand times the christian you ever were she didnt go around blathering a lot of sanctimonious bullshit she lived charity but you and ed you let your brother seduce your child and you call her wicked if there really was a god he would annihilate you for daring to come to his altar babbling about your righteousness if there is a god my only prayer is that i never have to be within a mile of you again i lurched to my feet my eyes hot with furious tears she shrank back in her chair i wont hit you i said what good would it do either of us before id reached the hall she was already on her hands and knees cleaning up the broken glass bank shot i staggered from the house to the car my stomach heaving my throat tight and tainted with bile all i could think of was to get to lotty not to stop for anything for a toothbrush or a change of underwear just go straight to sanity i made it there on luck a blaring horn at seventyfirst street brought me briefly to myself i skirted my way carefully through jackson park but i almost hit a bicyclist darting across the drive at fiftyninth even after that i kept finding the speedometer needle around seventy max was drinking cognac in lottys sitting room when i got there i smiled jerkily at him with a great effort i remembered the two had gone to a recital together and asked how theyd enjoyed the music superb the cellini quintet we knew them in london when they were just getting started after the war he reminded lotty of an evening in wigmore hall when the power had gone off and how the two of them had stood holding flashlights over the music so their friends could continue the concert lotty laughed and was adding a memoir of her own when she broke off vic i hadnt seen your face in the light when you came up what is the matter i forced my lips to the form of a smile nothing lifethreatening just a strange conversation that ill tell you about sometime i must be off anyway my dear max said rising ive stayed far too long drinking your excellent cognac lotty saw him to the door then hurried back to me what is it liebchen you look like death i tried smiling again to my dismay i found myself sobbing instead lotty i thought id seen every horrible thing people could do to each other in this town men killing each other for a bottle of wine women pouring lye on their lovers why this should upset me so much i dont know here lotty put some brandy to my mouth drink this and settle yourself a bit try to tell me what happened i swallowed some of the cognac it washed the taste of bile from my throat with lotty holding my hand i blurted out the story how id seen the resemblance between young art and caroline and thought his mother must have been related to carolines father only to learn that it was his father who was related to carolines grandmother that part wasnt so awful i gulped i mean of course its awful but what made me so sick is their horrible scrubbed piety and the way they insist louisa was to blame do you know how they raised her how strictly those two sisters were watched no dates no boys no talk about sex and then her mothers brother he molested the one girl and they let him stay around to molest the other and then they punish her my voice was rising i couldnt seem to control it it cant be lotty it shouldnt be i should be able to stop something that vile from going on but i dont have any power lotty took me in her arms and held me without speaking after a time my sobbing dried up but i continued to lie against her shoulder you cant heal the world liebchen i know you know that you can only work with one person at a time in a very small way and over the individuals you help you have much effect its only the megalomaniacs the hitlers and their ilk who think they have the answer for everyones life you are in the world of the sane victoria the world of the limited she took me into the kitchen and fed me the remains of the chicken shed cooked for max she continued to pour brandy into me until i was ready for sleep after that she took me to her spare room and undressed me mr contreras i said thickly i forgot to tell him i was spending the night here can you call him for me otherwise hell have bobby mallory dragging the lake for me certainly my dear ill do it as soon as i see youre sleeping just rest and dont worry when i woke sunday morning i felt lightheaded the result of too much brandy and tears but id had my first thorough sleep since my attack the soreness in my shoulders had diminished to the point where i no longer noticed it every time i moved lotty brought in the new york times with a plate of crisp rolls and jam we spent a leisurely morning over papers and coffee at noon when i wanted to start talking about art jurshakabout some way to get past his ubiquitous bodyguards to speak to himlotty silenced me this will be a day of rest for you victoria were going to the country get fresh air turn the mind off completely from all worries it will make everything seem more possible tomorrow i gave in with as good grace as i could muster but she was right we drove into michigan spent the day walking at the sand dunes letting the cold lake air whip our hair we dawdled around in the little wineries buying a bottle of cherrycranberry wine as a souvenir for max who prided himself on his palate when we finally returned home around ten that night i felt clean throughout it was a good thing id had that day of rest monday turned into a long frustrating day lotty was gone when i woke upshe makes rounds at beth israel before opening her clinic at eightthirty she left me a note saying shed looked at dr chigwells notebooks after i went to bed but didnt feel confident in interpreting the blood values hed been recording she was taking them to a friend who specialized in nephrology for a reading i called mr contreras he reported a quiet night but said that young art was getting restless hed loaned him a razor and a change of underwear but he wasnt sure how long he could keep the boy at the apartment if he wants to leave let him i said hes the one who wanted protection i dont really care too much if he doesnt want to accept it i told him id be by to pack a small suitcase but that i was going to stay with lotty until i felt more secure against midnight marauders he agreed wistfullyhed much rather i sent young art to lotty and stayed with him and peppy after stopping at my place for a shower and a change of clothes i went downstairs to spend a few minutes with peppy and mr contreras the strain of the last few weeks was starting to etch hollow lines in young arts face or maybe it was just thirtysix hours spent with mr contreras do youhave you done anything his uncertain voice had faded to a pathetic whisper i cant do anything until ive talked to your old man you can help make that happen i dont see how i can get past his security guards to see him alone that alarmed himhe didnt want art sr to know hed come to me that would really get him in hot water i reasoned and cajoled to no avail finally getting a little testy i headed for the door ill just have to call your mother and tell her i know where you are im sure shed be glad to set up a meeting between me and your old man in exchange for knowing her precious baby was safe and sound goddamn you warshawski he squeaked you know i dont want you talking to her mr contreras took umbrage at the young mans swearing at me and started to interrupt i held up a hand which mercifully stopped him then help me get in touch with your dad at last fulminating he agreed to call his father to say he needed to talk to him alone and to set up a meeting in front of buckingham fountain i told art to try to set the appointment for two todaythat id call back at eleven to check on the time as i left i could hear mr contreras upbraiding him for talking so rudely to me it sent me southward with my only laugh of the day my parents had banked at ironworkers savings loan my mother had opened my first savings account for me there when i was ten so i could stash stray quarters and babysitting earnings against the college education she long had promised me in my memory it remained an imposing giltcovered palace when i walked up to the grimy stone building at ninetythird and commercial it seemed to have shrunk so with the years that i checked the name over the entrance to make sure i was at the right place the vaulted ceiling which had awed me as a child now seemed merely grubby instead of having to stand on tiptoe to peer into the tellers cage i towered over the acned young woman behind the counter she didnt know anything about the banks annual report but she directed me indifferently to an officer in the back the glib story id prepared to explain why i wanted it proved unnecessary the middleaged man who spoke to me was only too glad to find someone interested in a decaying savings and loan he talked to me at length about the strong ethical values of the community where people did everything to keep their little homes in order and how the bank itself renegotiated loans for its longtime customers when hard times hit them we dont have an annual report of the kind youre used to examining since were privately owned he concluded but you can look at our yearend statements if you want its really the names of your board id like to see i told him of course he rummaged in a drawer and pulled out a stack of papers youre sure you dont want to inspect the statements if you were thinking of investing i can assure you we are in extremely sound condition despite the death of the mills down here if id had a few thousand to spare i would have felt obligated to give it to the bank to cover my embarrassment as it was i muttered something noncommittal and took the directors list from him it held thirteen names but i knew only one of them gustav humboldt oh yes my informant told me proudly mr humboldt had agreed to become a director back in the forties when he first started doing business down here even now that his company had become one of the largest in the world and he was a director of a dozen fortune companies he still stayed on the ironworkers board mr humboldt has missed only eight meetings in the last fifteen years he finished i murmured something that could be taken for extravagant awe at the great mans dedication the picture was becoming tolerably clear to me there was some problem with the insurance on the work force at the xerxes plant that humboldt was determined not come to light i couldnt see what that had to do with the lawsuit or the deaths of ferraro and pankowski but maybe chigwell knew what the actuarial data id found meantperhaps that was what his medical notebooks would reveal that part didnt bother me too much it was humboldts personal role that both scared and angered me i was tired of being jerked around by him it was time to beard him directly i extricated myself from the ironworkers hopeful officer and headed for the loop i wasnt in the mood to waste time hunting out cheap parking i pulled into the lot next to the humboldt building on madison stopping just long enough to comb my hair in the rearview mirror i headed into the sharks cove the humboldt building housed the companys corporate offices like most manufacturing conglomerates the real business went on in the plants spread across the globe so i wasnt surprised that their headquarters could be squeezed into twentyfive stories it was a strictly functional building with no trees or sculptures in the lobby the floor was covered with the utilitarian tile you used to see in all skyscrapers before helmut jahn and his pals started filling them with marblelined atria the oldfashioned black notice board in the hallway didnt list gustav humboldt but it told me the corporate offices were on twentytwo i summoned one of the bronzedoored elevators and made my slow way up the hall that i entered from the elevator was austere but the tone had changed subtly the lower half of the walls was paneled in a dark wood that also showed on either side of the pale green carpet framed prints of medieval alchemists with retorts toads and bats hung above the paneling i headed down the green pile to an open door on my right the green carpeting continued past the door where it spread into a large pool the dark wood was picked up in a polished desk behind it sat a woman with a phone bank and a word processor she was impeccably polished herself her dark hair pulled back in a smooth chignon to show the large pearls in her shellshaped ears she turned from the word processor to greet me with practiced courtesy im here to see gustav humboldt i said trying to sound authoritative t see may i have your name please i handed her a card and she turned with it to the phones when shed finished she smiled apologetically you dont seem to be in the appointment calendar ms warshawski is mr humboldt expecting you yes hes been leaving messages for me all over town this is just my first opportunity to get back to him she returned to the phones this time when she finished she asked me to take a seat i lowered myself into an overstuffed armchair and flipped through a copy of the annual report thoughtfully placed next to it humboldts brazil operations had shown a staggering growth last year accounting for sixty percent of overseas profits their capital investment of million in the amazon river project was now paying handsome dividends i couldnt help wondering how much capital development it would take before the amazon looked like the calumet i was studying the breakdown of profits by product line feeling a proprietary pleasure in the good performance of xerxine when the polished receptionist summoned memr redwick would see me i followed her to the third in a series of doors in a little hallway behind her desk she knocked and opened the door then returned to her station mr redwick got up from his desk to hold out a hand to me he was a tall wellgroomed man about my own age with remote gray eyes he studied me unsmilingly while we shook hands and uttered conventional greetings then gestured me to a small sofa set against one wall i understand you think mr humboldt wishes to see you i know mr humboldt wishes to see me i corrected him you wouldnt be talking to me if that werent the case what is it you think he wants to see you about he pressed his fingertips together hes left a couple of messages for me one at the insurance offices of art jurshak the other at the ironworkers bank in south chicago both messages were most urgent thats why i came here in person why dont you tell me what he said and then i can evaluate whether he needs to talk to you himself or whether i can handle the matter i smiled either you are totally in mr humboldts confidence in which case you know what he said or youre notin which case he would much prefer that you not find it out the remote eyes grew colder you can safely assume that im in mr humboldts confidenceim his executive assistant i yawned and got up to study a print on the wall across from the sofa it was a nast cartoon of the oil trust and as nearly as my inexpert eye could tell it seemed to be an original if you arent willing to talk to me youre going to have to leave redwick said sharply i didnt turn around why dont you just check with the big guylet him know im here and getting restless he knows youre here and he asked me to meet with you how hard it is when strongwilled people disagree so vehemently i said mournfully and left the room i walked fast trying each of the doors i came to surprising a succession of hardworking assistants the door on the end opened to the great mans cove a secretary presumably ms hollingsworth looked up in surprise at my entrance before she could utter a protest id gone into the inner chamber redwick was on my heels grabbing at my arms behind the mahogany door in the midst of a collection of antique office furnishings sat gustav humboldt a document unopened on his knees he looked beyond me to his executive assistant redwick i thought i made it clear this woman was not to disturb me have you come to think that my decisions no longer carry authority with a considerable diminution in his cool poise redwick tried explaining what had happened he really did do his best i chimed in helpfully but i knew that deep down you would be sorry forever if you didnt talk to me you see i just came from the ironworkers savings and loan so i know youre the person who pressured caroline djiak into firing me and then theres the matter of the life and health insurance that art jurshaks been handling for you not my idea of a proper fiduciary a man who pals around with guys like steve dresberg and the state insurance commissioner would probably agree with me i was on thin ice there since i wasnt sure what the report meant obviously it had rung a thousand bells with nancy but i could only guess at why i danced my way through possibilities throwing in references to joey pankowski and steve ferraro but humboldt refused to rise to the bait he strode to his desk and picked up the phone why did you lie to me about that lawsuit i continued conversationally when he had hung up i know a big ego is a sine qua non for success on the scale youve achieved but you must really be myopic if you thought id take your unsupported word on that suit too many things had been happening in south chicago for me not to be suspicious of a highpowered ceo who i was interrupted by some new arrivalsthree security guards i couldnt help being flattered that humboldt thought it would take so many men to get me out of his buildingone of that size and apparent conditioning would have done the trick given the shape i was in i didnt feel up to a bravado display so i went along without a fuss as they ushered me from the roomwith more force than was really necessaryi called over my shoulder you gotta get better help gustav the guys who dumped me in dead stick pond are in custody and its only a matter of time before they cop a plea by telling the police who hired them he didnt answer me as redwick shut the door behind us though i heard humboldt say someone has got to shut that meddlesome bitch up for me alas this seemed to put paid to the idea of my ever drinking his remarkable brandy again changing words at buckingham fountain it was a little after eleven when the great apes finished escorting me from the zoo time for me to check in with young art i was within walking distance of my office but i wanted to get clean away from the humboldt building i paid my eight dollars for the privilege of parking next to it for an hour and moved the car to the underground garage id forgotten mr contrerass forcible entry to my office friday night hed done a thorough job on the door first hed smashed in the glass in the hopes of being able to reach in and turn the lock when hed found it was a keyoperated dead bolt hed methodically broken all the wood around it and pulled it from the frame i ground my teeth at the sight but didnt see any point in mentioning it when i called the old man it would be easier to arrange for someone else to repair it than to go through his long string of remorseand far easier to get outside help than to go through the agony of watching mr contreras fix it art came uneasily to the phone he had spoken with his dad but he wanted me to know that i really owed him it had been pure hell having to negotiate with big art oh yes hed gotten the old man to agree to come to the fountain although he said he couldnt make it before twothirty it had taken a lot of cajoling his father had pressured him unbelievably to be told where he was staying if i had any idea how hard it was to stand up to big art i might treat him with a little more respect and cant you think of someplace better for me than here this old man cant leave me alone he treats me like im some kind of child i replied more soothingly than i felt and if you really want to go someplace else i dont have any objection ill see if i can arrange something with murray ryerson at the heraldstar when i talk to him this afternoon of course hell want some kind of story in exchange i hung up on his shrieking that i had to promise not to go to the papers about him but i did forbear to mention his name to murray when i called you know warshawski youre a fucking pain in the ass he greeted me dont you ever check in with your answering service i left about ten messages for you over the weekend what did you do to the chigwell woman hypnotize her she wont talk to the pressshe says you can handle any queries we have about her brother its a course i took by mail i said surprised and pleased you send in all these matchbooks and they ship you a set of lessons on how to make yourself invisible how to enter the thoughts of another personall that kind of stuff i just never had a chance to try it before right wiseass he said resignedly are you now prepared to reveal all to the people of chicago you told me you didnt need methat you were getting all your info direct from the people at xerxes i want to talk to you about something much more excitingmy life or its possible termination thats old news we already covered it last week youll have to go all the way this time for us to get excited about it well stay tunedyou may get your wish ive got some heavy guys gunning for me i watched a handful of pigeons vying for space on the windowsill tough dirty urban birds better decor for my office than original prints by nast or daumier why are you telling me this now he demanded suspiciously a train rattled by on the wabash el tracks the pigeons fluttered momentarily as the vibrations shook the window then settled back on the sill in case i dont live through the night i want someone wholl follow my trail to know where its been taking me id like that person to be you since youre better able to think ill of the gods than the cops are but the hitch is i need to talk to you before onethirty what happens at onethirty i strap on my sixguns and walk alone down main street after some more poking to see if matters were as urgent as i claimed murray agreed to meet me near the newspaper for a sandwich at noon before leaving the pulteney i sorted my mail tossed everything but a check from one of the clients id done a financial search for then called a friend to replace my office door he said hed get to it by wednesday afternoon since it was close to twelve already i headed north to the river the air had thickened to a light drizzle despite lottys dire words my shoulders felt pretty good another couple of daysif i stayed a jump ahead of gustav humboldt and i could start running again the heraldstar faces the suntimes from the south side of the chicago river a lot of that area is getting trendy with racquet courts and chichi little restaurants springing up but carls still serves a nononsense sandwich to the newspaper people its scarred booths and deal tables are packed into a dingy stone building on wacker where it runs under the main road next to the river murray swept into the tavern a few minutes after me raindrops making his red hair glint under the dim lights lucy moynihan carls daughter who took over the place when he died likes murray she let us jump the crowd to take a booth at the back and stayed for a few minutes to kid with murray about the money hed lost to her in last weeks basketball pool over a hamburger i told him much of what id been doing the last three weeks for all his flamboyance and conceit murray is an intent listener absorbing information through every pore they say you remember only thirty percent of what anyone tells you but ive never had to repeat a story to murray when id finished he said okay you got a mess you have your old childhood brat wanting you to find who croaked your teammate an indigestible young jurshak and a strangely behaving chemical company and maybe the garbage king you be careful if steve dresberg is really involved that boy plays very much for keeps i can see him being tied in with jurshak but whats humboldt got to do with it i wish i knew jurshak handles his insurance which isnt a crime as much as a misdemeanor but i cant help wondering what jurshaks doing for humboldt in return the elusive memory id been trying to force since saturday swam across the surface of my mind again and disappeared what murray demanded suspiciously nothing i thought i remembered something but i cant quite get it but i wish i knew why humboldt is lying about joey pankowski and steve ferraro its got to be something really important because when i went to his office today to ask him about it i got hefted out by some enormous security apes maybe he just doesnt like you buzzing around him murray said maliciously there are times when i wish i had security apes to kick you out too i faked a punch at him but he took hold of my hand and held it for a minute give warshawski theres no story here yet just speculations that i cant put in print why are we having lunch together i pulled my hand away im doing some research when i have some results i may have a better idea of why humboldts lying but right now im off to meet with art jurshak ive got a major club to use on him so i hope hell cough up what he knows so thats what i want from you if i somehow die talk to lotty to caroline djiak and to jurshak those three are the key how serious are you about being in danger i watched murray drain his stein and signal for a third he weighs twoforty maybe twofiftyhe can absorb it i stuck with coffeei wanted my head as clear as possible for jurshak more than i like someone left me for dead five days ago two of the same hoods were waiting outside my apartment on friday and today gustav humboldt sounded strangely like peter otoole trying to get his barons to do in becket its pretty real of course murray wanted to know the club i had on jurshak but i was absolutely determined not to let that get public we fought about it until onefifteen when i got up and laid a five on the table and headed out murray hollered after me but i hoped to be on a southbound bus before he could extricate himself and follow a bus was just closing its doors as i reached the top of the stairs the driver a rare humanitarian opened them again when he saw me running for the curb art had said twothirty instead of twoi just wanted to make sure he didnt show up early with some kind of armed escort i hardly knew young art and i sure didnt trust himhe might have lied to me about fooling his father or maybe big art didnt trust his kid either and discounted the story just in case i wanted to get there ahead of a trap i rode down to jackson and walked the three blocks east to the fountain in the summer buckingham fountain is the showpiece of the lakefront then its shrouded by trees and crowded with tourists in the winter with the foliage dead and the water turned off it makes a good spot to talk few people visit it and those who do can be seen a good way off today grant park was desolate under the dull winter sky empty potatochip bags and whiskey bottles mixed in with the dead leaves provided the only signs of human presence in the area i retreated to the rose garden on the fountains south side and perched on the base of one of the statues at its comers i stuck the smith wesson in my jacket pocket with my thumb resting on the safety a light drizzle kept up intermittently during the afternoon despite the relative warmth of the winter air i was chilled through from sitting still in the damp i hadnt worn gloves so that i could handle the gun more readily but by the time jurshak showed up my fingers were so numb im not sure i could have fired around a quarter to three a limo stopped on lake shore drive to deposit the alderman and a companion the limo moved on up the drive to monroe where it circled and came to a halt about a quarter mile from the fountain when i was sure no one was getting out to take a bead i scrambled down from my perch and made my way back to the park jurshak was looking around trying to find his son he paid only passing attention to me until he realized i was planning to talk to him art wont be able to make it mr jurshakhe sent me instead im v i warshawski i think youve heard my name from your wife or from gustav humboldt jurshak was wearing a black cashmere coat that buttoned up to his chin with his face set off by the black collar i could see an overwhelming resemblance to carolinethe same high round cheeks short nose long upper lip even his eyes were the same gentian a bit faded with age but that true blue that you rarely see in fact he looked more obviously like her than he did young art what have you done with my son where are you holding him he demanded in a forceful husky voice i shook my head he came to me on saturday afraid for his lifesaid youd told his mother he was as good as dead for letting me get that report you filed for xerxes with mariners rest hes someplace safe i dont want to talk to you about your son but your daughter you may want to ask your friend to step aside while we speak what are you talking about arts my only child i demand that you take me to him at once or ill get the police along quicker than you can blink his mouth set in the angry stubborn line id seen on carolines face a thousand times art had been a power in chicago since before id started college even without his clique controlling the city council there were plenty of police who owed jurshak favors and would be happy to run me in if he wanted them to think back a quarter century i said softly trying not to let anger turn my voice ragged your sisters daughters those luxurious afternoons when your niece danced for you while your brotherinlaw was away at work you cant have forgotten how important you were in the lives of those two girls his expression as mobile as carolines changed from rage to fear the wind had whipped color into his cheeks but beneath the red his face looked gray take a walk manny he said to the stocky man at his side go wait in the car ill be over in a couple of minutes if shes threatening you art i oughta stay jurshak shook his head just some old family problems i thought this was going to be business when i asked you and the boys to come along go aheadone of us oughta stay warm the stocky man looked at me narrowly he apparently decided the bulge in my pocket must be gloves or a notebook and headed back to the limo okay warshawski what do you want jurshak hissed a whole bunch of answers in exchange for answers i will not let the fact that you are a child molester with a daughter who is also your greatniece get into the papers you cant prove anything he sounded mean but he didnt try moving away screw that i said impatiently ed and martha told me the whole story the other night and your daughter looks so much like you itd be an easy make murray ryerson at the heraldstar would be on it in a minute if i asked him or edie gibson at the trib i moved to one of the metal benches at the edge of the paving around the fountain weve got a lot to say so you might as well make yourself comfortable i saw him looking over at the limo dont even think it ive got a gun i know how to use it and even if your boys finished me off murray ryerson knows im meeting with you come sit down and get it over with he came over his head down his hands jammed into his pockets im not admitting anything i think youre full of hot air but once the press got their teeth into a story like that theyd ruin me just with the innuendoes i gave what was meant to be an engaging smile all youd have to do is say im blackmailing you of course id run carolines photo and theyd interview her mother and all that stuff but you could give it a shot now lets seeweve got so much old family business to talk about i dont even know where to begin with louisa djiaks mortgage or me in the mud at dead stick pond or nancy cleghorn i spoke musingly watching him out of the comer of my eye he seemed a little jumpier at nancys name than louisas i know that report you sent to mariners rest for xerxes youre running a fiddle on the insurance arent you what are they doingpaying a higher rate than theyre charged so you can pocket the difference and what difference does it make if someone finds out it aint exactly going to ruin you in the neighborhood youve been charged with worse and been reelected suddenly the memory that had been eluding me since i talked to caroline on saturday popped to the surface mrs pankowski standing in her doorway telling me her financial woes saying joey didnt leave her any insurance maybe he hadnt signed up for the group plan but that was a xerxes benefit i thought noncontributory life insurance only maybe it was term since he hadnt been with the company when he died he wouldnt be covered still it was worth asking when joey pankowski died why didnt he get any life insurance i dont know what the hell youre talking about joey pankowski he used to work at xerxes youre the fiduciary on their lhp business so you must know why an employee doesnt collect life insurance when he dies he looked suddenly as though hed collapsed through the middle i thought frantically trying to follow up my advantage with piercing questions but he was an old hand at taking the heat and he could tell i didnt really have anything he recovered enough poise to keep up a front of stubborn denial okay let it go i can figure it out fast enough when i talk to the carrier or some other employees lets go back to nancy cleghorn she saw you and dresberg together at your office and you know as well as i do that no insurance commissioner will let you keep your license if you hang around with the mob oh knock it off warshawski i dont know who this cleghorn girl is other than reading in the papers that she got herself killed i may talk to dresberg from time to time he does a lot of business in my ward and im the alderman for the whole ward i cant afford to be a dainty lady holding her nose when she smells garbage the insurance commissioner isnt going to think once about it let alone twice so it wouldnt bother you to let it be known that you and dresberg met in your office late at night prove it i yawned how do you think i even heard about it there was a witness of course one whos still alive even that didnt shake him enough for me to be able to pry anything from him when the conversation ended i not only felt frustrated but too young for the job art just had too much more experience than i i felt like grinding my teeth and saying just you wait black jack ill get you in the end instead i told him id be in touch i walked away from him toward lake shore drive sprinting across in front of the traffic i watched him from the far side he stood for a long moment looking at nothing then shook himself and headed back toward his limo bad blood i retrieved my car and headed back to lottys all id really gotten from seeing jurshak was information that hed been working some kind of fraud with the xerxes insurance and something major based on his expression but i didnt know what it was and i needed to find out quickly before all the people who were mad at me converged once and for all and sent me to my permanent rest the urgency tightened my stomach and congealed my brain rushhour traffic was already thickening the main streets downtown the menace in humboldts voice this morning lingered in my ears i drove cautiously through the february twilight trying to make sure no one was tailing me i drove all the way up to montrose and exited at the park doubling around twice before figuring i was in the clear and heading back to lottys it didnt surprise me that i got there before she didto accommodate working mothers lotty keeps the clinic open until six most evenings i went out for some foodthe least i could do in thanks for her hospitality was to have dinner ready i started again on the chicken with garlic and olives id been trying to make the night before my attack hoping that if i kept the front of my mind occupied the back would begin to sprout ideas this time i prepared the whole dish without interruption and set it to simmer over a low flame by then it was close to seventhirty and lotty still hadnt returned i began to get worried wondering whether i should check the clinic or with max a late emergency might have detained her either at the clinic or hospital but shed also be an easy target for anyone bent on getting revenge on me at eightthirty when id tried both clinic and hospital without results i headed out to search for her her car pulled up in front of the building just as i was locking the lobby door lotty i was getting worried i cried dashing over to meet her she followed me back into the building her pace lagging most unlike her usual brisk trot were you my dear she asked tiredly i should have remembered how nervous youve been the last few days its not like you to be in such a fret over a few hours she was right another sign that i had moved beyond any semblance of rationality in dealing with the issues at hand she moved slowly into her apartment taking off her coat with careful movements and stowing it methodically inside a carved walnut wardrobe standing in the hallway i led her to an armchair in her sitting room she let me pour her a small brandythe only alcohol she drinks and then only when under severe strain thank you my dear thats most helpful she slipped her shoes off i found her slippers laid neatly next to her bed and brought them out for her i spent the last two hours with dr christophersen shes the nephrologist i mentioned showing your chemical company notebooks to she finished the brandy but shook her head when i offered her the bottle i suspected something when i looked at the records but i wanted a specialist to do a thorough interpretation she opened her briefcase and pulled out a few pages of photocopies i left the notebooks locked in maxs safe at beth israel they are tootoo frightening to be floating around the city streets where anyone could lay hands on them this is a summary of annsdr christophersensnotes she says she can do a thorough analysis if its needed i took the pages from her and looked at dr christophersens square tiny writing she was citing the blood work reported in the pages of chigwells notebooks using louisa djiaks and steve ferraros records as an example the blood chemistry details made no sense to me but the summary at the bottom of the page was in plain english and appallingly clear these records show blood history for ms louisa djiak white unmarried female one parturition from to the last year for which data were taken and for mr steve ferraro white unmarried male from to records also exist for approximately five hundred other employees at humboldt chemicals xerxes plant covering the period to these records show changes in the values of creatine blood urea nitrogen bilirubin hematocrit and hemoglobin and white blood count consistent with the development of renal liver and bone marrow dysfunction conversation with dr daniel peters ms djiaks attending physician confirm that the patient first came to him in only at her daughters insistence at that time he diagnosed chronic renal failure which has now progressed to an acute stage other complications kept ms djiak from being a good candidate for transplant the blood work indicates that noticeable renal damage occurred as early as cr bun and severe damage by cr bun the patient herself began experiencing typical diffuse symptoms itching fatigue headachesaround but thought perhaps she was experiencing change of life and did not deem it necessary to consult a physician the report went on to give a similar summary of steve ferraro ending with his death from aplastic anemia in the rest of the precise script detailed the toxic properties of xerxine and showed that the changes in blood chemistry were consistent with exposure to xerxine i read the document through twice before putting it down to stare appalled at lotty dr christophersen did a lot of work calling louisas and steve ferraros doctors and doing all that checking was the only comment i could get out at first she was horrifiedmost horrifiedat what she was seeing i gave her the names of two patients i knew could be checked on and she did the followup this afternoon at least in the case of your friend and mr ferraro it seems abundantly clear that they had no idea what was happening to them i nodded it makes a hideous kind of sense louisa starts having vague symptoms that she thinks are menopauseat thirtyfourbut then she never had any sex education to speak of maybe its not so incredible anyway she wouldnt blab it around the plant a lot of them come from the kind of background she didwhere anything having to do with private body functions was shameful and never to be discussed but victoria lotty burst out what is the sense of all this who besides a mengele is so cold so calculating in keeping these kinds of records and saying nothing not one word to the people involved i rubbed my head the spot where id been hit was pretty well healed but now that my brain was so stressed out the injury was throbbing in a dull way the pounding drum in the jungle of my mind i dont know lottys enervated state had infected me i can see why they dont want any of it coming out now lotty shook her head impatiently not so i explain victoria damages pankowski and ferraro sued for indemnity payments they believed were rightfully theirsthey tried to build a case saying their illnesses were the result of exposure to xerxine humboldt defended himself successfully according to the lawyer who handled their suit the company had two workable defensesthe first was that these guys both smoked and drank heavily so no one could prove that xerxine had poisoned them and the second which seemed to do the trick was that their exposure had taken place before xerxines toxicity was known so that my voice trailed off the problem with jurshaks report to mariners rest became staggeringly clear to me he was helping humboldt hide the high mortality and illness rates at xerxes to get favorable rate consideration from the insurance carrier i could imagine a couple of different ways they could work it but the likeliest seemed to be that theyd buy a better package from mariners rest than they offered the employees employees would be told that they didnt have coverage for certain tests or certain amounts of hospital stay then when the bills came in theyd go through the fiduciary and hed fix them before sending them to the insurance company i thought about it from several different angles and it still looked good i got up and headed for the phone extension in the kitchen so that what vic lotty called impatiently behind me what are you doing turning off the chicken for starters id forgotten the dinner id left simmering happily on the back of the stove the olives were little charred lumps while the chicken seemed to have welded itself to the bottom of the pan definitely not the most successful recipe in my repertoire i tried scraping the mess into the garbage can oh never mind the dinner lotty said irritably just put it in the sink and tell me the rest of your thinking the company argued that they couldnt be responsible for the illness of anyone who worked for them if it took place before when xerxines toxicity was established by cibageigy is that it yeah except i didnt know about cibageigy or that was the critical year and my bet is that they claimed to have lowered their ppm of xerxine to whatever the decreed standard was and that thats what their reports to washington show the ones that jurshak sent out for humboldt but that the analysis scrap did at the plant shows much higher levels i need to call caroline djiak and find out but vic lotty said absently scraping charred chicken from the skillet you still dont explain why they wouldnt tell their workers their bodies were being damaged if the standard wasnt set until what difference did it make before then insurance i said shortly trying to find louisas number in the directory she wasnt listed snarling i went back to the spare room to dig my address book out of my suitcase i returned to the kitchen and started dialing the only person who might tell us definitely is dr chigwell and hes missing right now im not sure i could make him talk even if i could find himhumboldt scares him much more than i do caroline answered the phone on the fifth ring vic hi i was just putting ma to bed can you hold or should i call back i told her id wait but you see i added to lotty those notebooks mean bankruptcy now not for the whole company necessarily but certainly for the xerxes operation a good lawyer gets hold of that stuff contacts the employees or their families and really goes to town theyve got all those manville settlements to use by way of precedent no wonder humboldt had been desperate enough to seek me out personally his little empire was being threatened by the turks frederick manheim had been rightit must have seemed incredible to all of them that a detective could start nosing around pankowski and ferraro and not be looking for evidence of the blood work why had chigwell tried to kill himself overcome by remorse or did someone threaten him with a fate worse than death if he told murray or me anything the people hed pranced off to on friday might well have killed him by now if they thought he was going to crack on them i didnt think id ever find out exactly what happened nor did i see a way of bringing nancys death back to the great shark the only hope would be if the two thugs bobby had in custody spilled their guts and somehow managed to implicate humboldt but i didnt pin much hope on that even if they did talk someone like humboldt knew too many ways of insulating himself from the direct consequences of his actions just like henry ii i shivered when caroline came back on the line i asked her if louisa had a brochure describing her xerxes benefits christ vic i dont know she said impatiently what difference does it make a lot i answered shortly it could explain why nancy was killed and a whole lot of other unpleasant stuff caroline gave an exaggerated sigh she said shed ask louisa and put the phone down nancy would have known about xerxess real loss experience because she was monitoring that as scraps environment and health director so when shed seen the letter to mariners rest and found the companys rate structure shed seen at once that jurshak was handling some kind of fiddle for them but who had taken her files out of her office at scrap or maybe shed had them on her preparing for a confrontation with jurshak and hed seen they were found and destroyed but shed left the other stuff in her car and he hadnt looked there when caroline came back on the line she told me that louisa thought shed brought a flyer home with her but it would be buried in her papers did i want to wait while she looked i asked her just to find it and leave it out for me to pick up in the morning she began a barrage of questions i couldnt deal with the insistent pressure in her voice give my love to louisa i interrupted tiredly and hung up on her indignant squawks lotty and i went out for a sober supper at the dortmunder both of us felt too overwhelmed by the enormity revealed by the chigwell notebooks to have much appetite or to want to talk when we got home i checked in with mr contreras young arthur had taken off the old man had locked front and back doors when he took peppy out for her evening walk but art had opened a window and jumped out mr contreras was miserablehe felt hed let me down the one time id actively sought his help dont worry about it i said earnestly you couldnt possibly watch him twentyfour hours a day he came to us for protectionif he doesnt want it its his neck after all you and i cant spend our lives looking around for scissors if he wants to keep sticking his head into nooses that cheered him slightly although he apologized several times more he was able to talk about something elselike how lonely peppy was with me away yeah i miss both of you i said even your hot breath down my neck when i want to be alone he laughed delightedly at that and hung up much happier than i was although i really didnt give a damn what happened to young art i wasnt sure how much hed learned of what i was figuring out i didnt relish the thought of his taking any of it back to his father my answering service told me murray had been trying to reach me i tracked him down and told him nothing had jelled yet he didnt really believe me but he didnt have any way to prove i was wrong the shark puts out bait my brain was in that numbed feverish state where you sleep as though you are druggedheavily but without getting any rest the tragedy of louisas life kept playing itself out in my dreams with gabriella scolding me harshly in italian for not having taken better care of our neighbor i woke for good at five and paced restlessly around lottys kitchen wishing i had the dog with me wishing i could get some exercise wishing i could think of a way to force gustav humboldt to listen to me lotty joined me in the kitchen a little before six her drawn face told the tale of her own sleepless night she put a strong hand on my shoulder and squeezed it gently then went wordlessly to make coffee after lotty had taken off for her early morning rounds at beth israel i headed south once more to see louisa she was glad to see me as always but seemed tireder than the previous times id been there i questioned her as gently and subtly as i knew how about the onset of her illness when shed first started feeling bad you know those blood tests they used to takeold chigwell the chigger she gave a scratchy laugh oh my yes i saw where the old chigger tried to kill himself it was on all the tv stations last week he always was a weak little man scared of his own shadow didnt surprise me he wasnt married no woman wants a little shrimp like that who cant stand up for himself what did he tell you when he took your blood one of our benefits they called it getting a physical every year like that with the blood work and everything not the kind of thing i would of thought of doing didnt know people went in for that sort of thing but it was okay with the head of the union and the rest of us didnt care got us off the floor with pay one morning every year you know they never gave you any results or sent them to a doctor for you go on girl louisa flapped her hand and coughed loudly if theyd a gave us results we wouldnt of known what they meant anyway dr chigwell showed me my chart once and im telling you it was like arab scrawl as far as i was concernedyou know those wiggly lines they put on their banners and all thats about what medical tests look like to me i forced myself to laugh a little with her and sat talking awhile she wore out quickly though and fell asleep in the middle of a sentence i stayed with her while she slept haunted by gabriellas accusations in my dreams what a life growing up in that soulkilling house raped by her own uncle poisoned by her employer and dying slowly and painfully yet she wasnt an unhappy person when shed moved next door she was frightened but not angry shed raised caroline with joy and had taken pleasure in the freedom to lead her own life away from her parents so maybe my pity was not only misplaced but condescending while i watched louisas chest rise and fall with her stertorous breath i wondered what i should tell caroline about her father not telling her was a form of control a seizing of power in her life i had no right to but telling her seemed unreasonably cruel did she deserve so heavy a knowledge i was still chewing it over in my mind when she dashed in at noon to fix louisas lunch a light little meal with no salt and precious little food caroline was glad to see me but in a hurry racing between meetings did you find the flyer i left it by the coffeepot i wish youd tell me why youre so excited about itif it concerns ma i have a right to know if i knew exactly how it concerned her id tell you in a flashim just picking my way through the forest right now i found the flyer and studied it while she took louisas lunch in to her it left me more baffled than id been originally all kinds of benefits louisa got regularly were excluded outpatient care dialysis home oxygen when caroline came in i asked her who paid for all those things wondering if she was somehow scraping the money together she shook her head xerxes has been real good to ma they pay all these bills without asking if you cant tell me whats going on with my own mother im heading back to the office and maybe i can find someone there wholl tell me maybe ill hire my own investigator she stuck out her tongue at me try it bratall the pis in town have been informed that youre a bad risk she laughed and left i stayed until louisa had eaten her meager lunch and fallen asleep once more leaving the television on as white noise i tiptoed out and returned the spare key to the ledge over the back porch i wished i understood the point of doing all that blood work years before anyone was interested in suing the company presumably it tied in with the insurance fiddle but i couldnt see the exact connection i didnt know anyone at xerxes who might talk to me ms chigwell might but her connection had been tenuous and not exactly sympathetic she was all i had though so i made the long drive to hinsdale ms chigwell was in the garage painting her dinghy she greeted me with her usual abrupt gruffness but since she invited me in for tea i presumed she was glad to see me she had no idea why they had started doing the blood work down at the xerxes plant i just remember that curtis was in a flurry about it because they had to send all those specimens to some lab and then keep separate records of them giving the employees numbers and so on thats why he kept his own notebooks so he could follow them by name and not have to worry about the numbering scheme i sat in the chintz armchair for over an hour eating a large pile of cookies while she discussed what she would do if she couldnt find her brother i always wanted to go to florence she said but im too old now i guess ive never been able to get curtis to agree to travel outside the country he always suspects hell get some terrible disease from the food or the water or that foreigners will cheat him ive always wanted to go to florence toomy mother came from a little town in southeastern tuscany my excuse is i never have enough money together to pay for the airfare i leaned forward and added persuasively you gave your brother most of your life you dont have to spend the rest of it waiting at the window with a candle burning if i was seventynine and in good health and had some money id be at ohare with a suitcase and a passport in time for tonights flight you probably would she agreed youre a brave girl i left soon after and headed back to chicago my shoulders aching again talking to ms chigwell had been a long shot i couldve done it by phone if i didnt enjoy seeing her but the fruitless errand at the end of a long week left me worn out maybe it was time to give the police what i had i tried imagining how id tell bobby my story you see theyd been doing all these blood tests on their employees and now theyre afraid someone will find out and sue them for suppressing evidence of how toxic xerxine really was and bobby smiling indulgently and saying i know you took a liking to the old lady but its obvious she had a grudge against her brother all these years i wouldnt take her reports at face value how do you even know those notebooks were his she has some medical trainingshe might have faked them just to get him in hot water then he disappears and she wants to unload them hellno bobby wouldnt use bad language in front of meheck vicki maybe they had one fight too many and she popped him on the head and then panicked and buried his body in salt creek then she calls you to say hes disappeared youre high on the lady youll believe the story the way she wants to tell it and who was to say it hadnt happened that way at any rate i was pretty sure that bobby would look at it like that before hed go after someone as important in chicago as gustav humboldt i could give murray the whole story but far from sharing bobbys reluctance to go after humboldt murray would leave a swath like general shermans through the lives of the people involved i just didnt want to give him anything that would make him go after louisa i stopped at my own apartment to cheer mr contreras up over the loss of young art and to see the dog it was too dark for me to feel comfortable about going out with her but she was clearly developing the restlessness an active animal feels when she doesnt get enough exercise another reason to get humboldt off my backso i could run the dog once more i checked the roads around me but my tail still seemed clear in a way this made me less cheerful rather than more maybe my pals were just waiting for troy and wally to make bail but maybe theyd decided that an ordinary hit wouldnt do and were looking for something more decisively spectacular like a bomb in my car or at lottys apartment just in case i parked some distance from her building and rode the bus back down irving park i made a frittata for dinner a greater success than the chicken since it wasnt scorched but whether it had any taste i couldnt have said i told lotty my various dilemmas about how to bring matters home to jurshak and humboldt and about whether to tell caroline id found her father she pursed her lips i cant advise you about mr humboldt you will have to think of a plan but about carolines father i must tell you that in my experience it is always better for people to know you say it is horrible news and it is but she is not a weakling and you cannot decide for her what she can know what she is better off not learning for one thing she may discover it in a more terrible way from someone else and for another she can easily imagine things that seem more hideous to her so in your place i would tell her it was a more articulate way of stating my own thoughts i nodded thanks lotty we spent the rest of the evening silently lotty was going through the mornings papers the light making little prisms on the halfglasses she wore for reading i did nothing i felt as though my mind were encased in lead shieldingprotective covering to keep any ideas from entering the residue of my fear i kept nipping at the big shark but i was afraid to find a harpoon and attack him directly i hated knowing hed been able to intimidate me but knowing it didnt make a stream of ideas gush forth the phone startled me from my somber reverie around nine one of the house staff at beth israel wasnt sure what to do with a patient of lottys she talked to him for a while then decided shed better handle the delivery herself and left id bought a bottle of whiskey yesterday along with the groceries after lotty had been gone half an hour or so i poured myself a drink and tried to get interested in john waynes televised antics when the phone rang again around ten i turned off the set thinking the caller might be one of lottys patients dr herschels residence im looking for a woman named warshawski it was a mans voice cold uninterested the last time id heard it it had told me that the person hadnt been born who could swim in a swamp if i see her ill be glad to give her a message i said with what coolness i could muster you can ask her if she knows louisa djiak the cold voice went on flatly and if she does my voice wobbled despite every effort i put into controlling it louisa djiak doesnt have much longer to live she could die at home in her bed or she could disappear in the lagoons behind the xerxes plant your friend warshawski can make the choice louisa is down at xerxes now shes well sedated all you have to doall you have to tell your friend warshawski to do is go down and take a look at her if she does the djiak woman will wake up in her bed tomorrow without knowing she ever left it but if any police come along with warshawski theyll have to find some frogmen who like diving in xerxine before they can give the djiak woman a christian burial the line went dead i wasted a few minutes on useless selfrecrimination id been so focused on myself on my closeness to lotty id never imagined louisas being in danger despite the fact that id told jurshak i knew her secret if she and i were gone no one would remain to speak about it and he would be safe i forced myself to think calmlycursing myself not only wasted time it would cloud my judgment the first thing to do was get movingi could wait for the long drive south to develop some brilliant strategy i loaded a second clip and stuck it in my jacket pocket then scribbled a note for lotty i was amazed to see my handwriting flow in the same large dark strokes as always i was just locking lottys door when i remembered the ruse that had gotten mr contreras away from our building a few nights ago i didnt want to walk into a trap here i went back inside to make sure that louisa really was missing from the bungalow on houston no one answered the phone after a few frantic callsfirst to mrs cleghorn to get the names and numbers of some other people at scrap i learned caroline had come back to the office around four she was closeted now with some epa lawyers downtown in what was likely to be an allnight session the woman i talked to had the number of the people living in my parents old house a couple named santiago caroline had given their home phone number to everyone she worked with in case of some emergency when i called mrs santiago she obligingly told me that louisa had been taken away in an ambulance around eightthirty i thanked her mechanically and hung up it had been almost half an hour since id gotten the call it was time to move i wanted company for the trip but it would be wanton to bring mr contreras alongfor him and louisa both i thought of friends of police of murray but of no one whom i could ask to go with me into such extreme danger i looked carefully around the hallway when i left lottys someone had known to phone me herethey might take the easy route and just shoot me as i walked down the stairs i kept my back pressed against the stairwell wall crouching low instead of going out the front door i went on down to the basement carefully picked my way across the dark floor fumbling cautiously with lottys keys for the one that undid the double lock on the basement door made my way down the alley to irving park road a bus pulled up just as i got to the main road i dug in my pocket to find a token under the spare clip and finally pried one out without having to flash my ammunition to the world at large i rode the eight blocks down irving park standing seeing nothing either of passengers or the night at ashland i hopped down and found my car the buss grinding diesel had somehow provided the background i needed to relax my mind completely for ideas to flow if an ambulance had come for louisa if she was completely sedated they must have found a doctor and there could be only one guess as to what doctor would be involved in such an infamous scheme so there was one person who shared my involvement whom it would not be criminal to ask to share my risk for the second time today i headed out the eisenhower to hinsdale toxic shock veils of fog rose from the drainage ditches lining the tollway covering the road in patches so that other cars appeared only as shrouded pricks of red i kept the speedometer pointed at eighty even when the thick mist drowned the road in front of us the chevy vibrated noisily prohibiting conversation every now and then i rolled the window down and put up a hand to feel the ropes theyd loosened a bit but the dinghy stayed on top we exited at th street for the trek eastward we were about eight miles west of the xerxes plant but no expressway connects the east and west sides of chicago this far south it was getting close to midnight fear and impatience gripped me so strongly i could scarcely breathe all my will went into the car maneuvering around other vehicles squeaking through lights as they turned keeping a weather eye cocked for passing patrol cars as i managed to do fifty in the thirtyfivemile zones fourteen minutes after leaving the tollway we were turning north on the little track that stony island becomes that far south we were on private industrial property now but i couldnt cut the headlights on the rutted glassfilled track id chosen a rundownlooking plant in the hopes that they wouldnt run to a night watchman or dog we pulled to a stop in front of a large cement barge i looked at ms chigwell she nodded grimly we opened the car doors trying to move quietly but more concerned with speed ms chigwell held a strong pencil flash for me while i cut the ropes she folded a blanket across the hood so that i could slide the dinghy down as noiselessly as possible we then laid the blanket on the ground to make a little cradle for the dinghy i pulled it over to the cement barge while she followed holding the flash and carrying the oars the barge was tied up next to a set of iron rungs built into the wall we lowered the dinghy over the side then i held its painter while ms chigwell climbed briskly down the ladder i followed her quickly we each took an oar despite her age ms chigwell had a strong firm stroke i matched mine to hers forcing my mind from the incipient throb in my healing shoulders she had to use both hands to row so i held the pencil flash we hugged the left bank i periodically shone the light so we could avoid barges and keep track of the names on the slips as we rowed past the bank had long since been cemented over company names were painted in large letters next to the steel ladders that led to their loading bays the night was silent except for the soft clop of our oars breaking water but the thick mist carrying the rivers miasmas was a pungent reminder of the industrial maze we were floating through every now and then a spotlight broke the fog pinpointing a giant steel tube a barge a girder we were the only humans on the river eve and her mother in a grotesque mockery of eden we rowed north past the glowrite landing beyond steel and wire companies plants that did printing made tools or saw blades glided by the heavy barges tied up next to a rebar mill finally ms chigwells penetrating little flash picked up the double xs and the giant crown gleaming black in the fog we banked the oars i looked at my watch twelve minutes to cover the half mile or so it had seemed much longer i grabbed a steel rung as we slid by and carefully pulled the dinghy up next to it ms chigwell tied the painter with practiced hands my heart was beating hard enough to suffocate me but she seemed utterly calm we pulled dark caps down low on our foreheads we clasped hands for a moment her compulsive squeeze showing what her impassive face hid i pointed at my watch in an exaggerated movement and she nodded calmly pulling my gun out and releasing the safety i scrambled up the ladder my right hand bare so that i could feel the trigger of the smith wesson i slowed down at the top cautiously raising my darkhatted head so that just my eyes came above the bank if i cried out ms chigwell would row as fast as she could back to the car and raise an alarm i was at the back of the plant at the concrete platform where the barge had been tied the last time id visited the place tonight the steel doors surrounding the loading bay were rolled shut and padlocked two spotlights at the corners of the building cut the haze around me as nearly as i could tell no one was anticipating a river approach i slid my gun hand over the top of the bank and kept the smith wesson in front of me as i hoisted myself onto land i rolled over and lay still for a count of sixty that was ms chigwells signal to start the climb herself i could just make out the change in the darkness as her head popped over the edge of the bankanyone farther away wouldnt be able to see her she waited another count of twenty then joined me on the loading platform the steel doors lay in a shadow cast by the projecting roof we moved close to them trying not to touch themthe sound of arms or gun brushing on steel would vibrate like a reggae band in the still night in front of us the spotlights turned the fog into a heavy curtain using its draperies as a shield we moved slowly around to the north end of the plant where the claybanked lagoons lay ms chigwell moved with the practiced silence of a lifelong secondstory woman as soon as we rounded the comer we moved into thicker fog and danker smells no lights shone on the lagoons we sensed their pungent presence to our right but didnt dare use the flash ms chigwell stayed close to me holding my muffler feeling her way catfooted behind me in the dark after an eternity of careful steps moving slowly through ruts sidestepping metal scraps we reached the front end of the plant the fog was thinner here we crouched behind some steel drums and peered cautiously around them a single light burned at the gate leading into the yard after looking for a long moment i could make out a man standing near the entrance a sentry or lookout an ambulance was in the center of the drive i wished i knew if louisa was still in it is she going to show up or not the unexpected voice near my left startled me so much i almost knocked myself against the steel drum i recovered trembling trying to control my breathing next to me ms chigwell remained as impassive as ever its been a little over two hours well give her until one then well have to decide what to do with the djiak woman the second voice belonged to my anonymous phone caller shell have to go into the lagoon we cant afford any more traces now that my heart had settled to a less tumultuous pace i recognized the first speaker art jurshak showing a strong family feeling for his niece you cant the second man spoke with his usual uninterested coldness the womans going to die soon anyway well just get the doctor to give her a little shot and return her to her bed her daughter will find she died in the night at the mention of the doctor it was ms chigwells turn to tremble a little youre losing it art said angrily howre you going to get her back into the house without the daughter seeing you anyway shell know her mothers goneshes probably roused the neighborhood by now as it is better just dispose of louisa here and set a trap for warshawski someplace else itd be best if they were both gone ill do it for you the cold voice said flatly ill get rid of them both and the daughter too if you want but i cant if i dont know why youre so desperate to see them put away it wouldnt be ethical he used the last word without any hint of irony damn you ill take care of things myself art muttered furiously fine the voice said irritatingly either way its fine you tell me what they know and ill have that or you kill them yourself and ill have that its a matter of complete indifference to me jurshak was silent for a minute id better see how the doc is making out his footsteps echoed and disappeared hed gone inside so louisa wasnt in the ambulance presumably one of the flatvoiced mans sidekicks was waiting in its interior instead of louisatheyd left it temptingly in the middle of the yard so id head straight to it how to get past the coldvoiced man standing at the entrance was a tougher question if i sent ms chigwell out as a diversion shed be a dead diversion i was wondering if we could jimmy a door or a window around the side when the man solved the problem for us he strolled out to the center of the yard where he stopped to knock on the back of the ambulance the rear door opened a crack he stood talking through the opening i tapped ms chigwell on the shoulder she stood up with me and we sidled slowly to the shadow of the wall while we watched the ambulance door shut again and the coldvoiced man wandered on out to the gate as soon as he was on the far side of the vehicle i crouched low and sprinted around the comer to the plant entrance ms chigwells footsteps sounded softly behind me the ambulance shielded us from the view of the gate sentry and we made it inside without hearing any outcry we were on a concrete apron outside the plant floor the sliding steel curtain that separated the manufacturing area from the main entrance was shut but a normalsized door next to it stood ajar we quickly darted through it shutting it softly behind us and found ourselves immediately in the plant we walked on tiptoe although the noises around us would have drowned any sounds we made the pipes let out their intermittent belches of steam and the cauldrons bubbled ominously under the dull green safety lights fritz lang had invented this room presently we would come to the end and find only cameramen and laughing actors a drop of liquid fell on me and i jumped convinced id been poisoned with a toxic dose of xerxine i glanced at ms chigwell she was looking straight ahead ignoring the spitting from above as assiduously as she avoided the obscene graffiti scrawled on the huge no smoking signs suddenly though she bit back a cry i followed her eyes to the far comer of the room louisa lay there on a stretcher dr chigwell stood on one side of her art jurshak on the other the two of them stared at us slackjawed dr chigwell found his voice first clio what are you doing here she marched forward fiercely i held her arm to keep her from getting within jurshaks grabbing range i came to find you curtis her voice was sharp and carried authoritatively over the hissing pipes youve gotten yourself involved with some very nasty people i presume youve spent the last week or so with them i dont know what mother would say if she were alive to see you but i think its time you came back home again well help miss warshawski get this poor sick woman back into the ambulance and then you and i will return to hinsdale i had my gun leveled at art sweat stood out on his round face but he said pugnaciously you cant shoot chigwell here has a needle ready to inject louisa if you shoot me its her death warrant im overcome art by your family feeling if this is the first time youve seen your niece in twentyseven years or so your reaction would move even klaus barbie to tears art made a violent gesture he tried shouting at me but the messagesguilt over his longforgotten incest fear of others finding it out rage at seeing me alivekept him from getting out anything coherent is this woman his niece ms chigwell demanded of me yes indeed i said loudly and she has closer ties to you than that doesnt she art curtis i will not tolerate your killing this unfortunate young woman and if she is your friends niece it is absolutely unthinkable that you do so it would be unethical and totally unworthy of you as the inheritor of fathers practice chigwell looked at his sister dejectedly he shrank a little inside his overcoat and his hands hung loosely at his sides if i acted now he wouldnt do anything to louisa i was bracing myself to take a flying leap at art when i saw malice replace the frustration in his facehe was watching someone come up behind us without glancing around i seized ms chigwell and rolled with her behind the nearest vat when i looked up i saw a man in a dark overcoat stroll into the area where wed been standing i knew his faceid seen it on tv or the papers or in court when id been a public defenderi just couldnt place it you took your fucking time dresberg jurshak snapped whyd you let that warshawski bitch in here to begin with of course steve dresberg the garbage king majestic slayer of little flies buzzing around his trash empire he spoke in the cold flat voice that made the hairs prickle along my spine she mustve cut her way under the fence and come in when i was out talking to the boys ill get them to go take care of her car when were done here were not done here yet dresberg i announced from my nook too much success has gone to your head made you careless you should never have tried to kill me the same way you did nancy youre getting soft dresberg youre a loser now my taunts didnt move him he was a pro after all he lifted his left hand from his coat pocket and pointed a large gunmaybe a coltat louisa come out now girlie or your sick friend here will be dead a few months before her time he didnt look at mea message that i was too trivial for direct attention i listened to you and art out front i called the two of you agreed shes as good as dead already but youd better get me first because if you shoot at her youre dead meat he swung so fast i didnt have time to drop before he fired the bullet went wide as the shot boomed in the cavernous room ms chigwell crouched white but stern on the floor next to me unbidden she took her keys from her sweater pocket while she moved to one side of our protective vat i slid to the other when i nodded she darted around the end of the vat and hurled her keys at dresbergs face he fired at the movement from the corner of my eye i saw ms chigwell drop i couldnt go to her now i got behind dresberg and fired at him the first shot went by him but as he turned to face me i got him twice in the chest even then he fired two more rounds before collapsing i ran to him and jumped on his gun arm with all my force his fingers loosened on the revolver jurshak was moving up on me hoping to wrestle dresbergs gun away before i could get to it fury was riding me though choking the breath from me covering my eyes with a hazy film i shot jurshak in the chest he gave an enraged cry and fell in front of me chigwell had stood next to louisas stretcher throughout the fracas his hands flaccidly at his side his head hunched into his coat i went over to him and slapped his face i meant at first just to rouse him from his stupor but my rage was consuming me so that i found myself pounding him over and over screaming at him that he was a traitor to his oath a miserable worm of a man on and on over and over i might have kept at him until his body joined jurshak and dresberg on the floor but through the haze i felt a tug on my arm ms chigwell had staggered over trailing blood on the dirty concrete hes all of that miss warshawski all that and more but let him be hes an old man and not likely to change at this time of life i shook my head exhausted and sick sick of the stench in the plant of the foulness of the three men of my own destructive rage my gorge rose i skipped behind a vat to throw up wiping my face with a kleenex i returned to ms chigwell the bullet had grazed her upper arm leaving a bloody furrow of singed flesh but no deep wound i felt a small measure of relief weve got to get into an office someplace we can secure and call the police therere at least three more men outside and you and i are not taking on any more thugs tonight weve got to move fast before they start worrying about dresberg and come looking for him can you hold out awhile longer she nodded gamely and helped me bully her brother into showing us the way to his old office i pushed louisas stretcher behind them she was still alive her breath coming in short shallow gasps when we were inside with the door locked i moved louisa into the tiny examining room to one side of the office with the remaining shreds of my strength i pushed the heavy metal desk athwart the door i sank to the floor and pulled the phone down next to me bobby its me sorry to wake you but i need your help lots of help and fast i explained what had happened as clearly as i could it took a few tries to get him to understand me and even then he was skeptical bobby my voice cracked youve got to come i have an old woman with a bullet wound and louisa djiak with some awful drug in her and three thugs prowling outside i need you the anguish got through to him he took directions to the plant and hung up before i could say anything else i sat for a moment with my head in my hands wanting nothing more than to lie down on the floor and cry instead i forced myself to stand up to release the halfempty clip and slip in a full one chigwell had taken his sister into the little examining room to patch up her arm i wandered in to look at louisa while i stood there her eyelids fluttered open gabriella she said scratchily gabriella i mightve known you wouldnt forget me in my troubles plant cleanup louisa went back to sleep while i held her hand when her weak grasp had relaxed i turned to chigwell and demanded fiercely what he had given her justjust a sedative he said licking his lips nervously just morphine shell sleep a lot for the next day thats all from her seat at the desk ms chigwell gave him a look of scalding contempt but seemed too exhausted to put her feelings into words i fixed a pallet for her in the examining room but she came from a generation too modest to lie down in public instead she sat upright in the old office chair her eyelids drooping in her white face fatigue was combining with the tension of waiting to drive me into a frenzy of nervous irritation i kept checking my barricades moving into the examining room to listen to louisas shallow gasping breaths back to the office to look at ms chigwell finally i turned on the doctor putting all my feverish energy into prying his story from him it made a short unedifying tale he had worked so many years with the xerxes blood tests that hed managed to forget one niggling little detail he wasnt letting people know he thought they might be getting sick when i showed up asking questions about pankowski and ferraro hed gotten scared and when murrays reporters had shown up hed become downright terrified what if the truth came out it would mean not just malpractice suits but terrible humiliation at clios handsshed never let him forget that he hadnt lived up to their fathers standard that comment brought him the only fleeting sympathy he had from mehis sisters fierce ethics must be hell to live with when the doctors suicide attempt failed he didnt know what to do then jurshak had calledchigwell knew him from his workdays in south chicago if chigwell would give them a little simple help they would arrange for any evidence against him to be suppressed hed had no choice he mutteredto me not his sister when he learned all they wanted was for him to give louisa djiak a strong sedative and look after her down at the plant for a few hours he was happy to comply i didnt ask him how he felt about going one step further and giving her a fatal injection but why i demanded why go through that charade to begin with if you werent going to give employees their results humboldt told me to he mumbled looking at his hands i could have guessed that part i snapped but why in gods name did he tell you to ituhit had to do with the insurance he muttered in the back of his throat spit it out curtis youre not leaving until i know so say it and get it over with he stole a look at his sister but she sat white and still lost in her own cloud of exhaustion the insurance i prompted we could seehumboldt knewwe had too many health claims too many people were losing work time first our health insurance began going up way up then we were dropped by ajax assurance and had to find another company theyd done a study they told us our claims were too high my jaw dropped so you got jurshak to act as your fiduciary and screw up the data so you could prove you were insurable to another carrier it was just a way of buying time until we could figure out what the problem was and fix it that was when we started doing the blood studies what was happening on the workers comp side nothing none of the illnesses were compensable because they werent work related my temples ached with the effort of following his convoluted tale but they were you were proving they were with all that blood data not at all young lady for a moment his pompous side reasserted itself that data did not establish causality it merely enabled us to project medical expenses and the probable turnover of the work force i was too appalled to speak his words came out so glibly that they must have been spoken hundreds of times at committee meetings or before the board of directors lets just see what our workforce costs will be if we know that x percent of our employees will be sick y fraction of the time run different cost projections tediously by hand in the days before computers then someone has the bright ideaget hard data and well know for sure the enormity of the whole scheme made me murderous with rage louisas harsh breath in the background added fuel to my fury i wanted to shoot chigwell where he sat then ride off to the gold coast and plug humboldt that bastard that cynical inhuman murderer anger swept through me in waves making me weep so no one got their proper life or health coverage just to save you guys a few miserable stupid dollars some of them did chigwell muttered enough to keep the wrong people from asking questions this woman here did jurshak said he knew her family so he was obligated to look after her at that i thought i really would commit murder but a movement from ms chigwell caught my attention her gaunt face was unchanged but shed apparently been listening despite her seeming remoteness she tried holding out a hand to me but her strength wasnt up to the task instead she said in the thread of a voice what youre describing is too heinous to discuss curtis well talk tomorrow about our arrangements we cant go on living together after this he deflated again shrinking inside himself without speaking he probably couldnt think beyond tonight with its threat of arrest and prison perhaps other horrors were adding to the gray pallor around his mouth but i didnt think soi didnt think he had enough imagination to picture what hed really been doing as the xerxes doctor maybe being booted into the cold by the sister who had always protected him was punishment enoughmaybe it would hurt him worse than anything i could do exhausted i returned to the examining room to look at louisa again her shallow breathing seemed unchanged she muttered in her sleepsomething about caroline i couldnt make out what it was then that the shots started i looked at my watch thirtyeight minutes since id called bobby it had to be the police had to be i forced my weary shoulders into action moving the desk back from the door telling my charges to stay put i turned out the room lights and crept back to the plant another five minutes passed and then the place was filled with boys in blue i moved out from the cover of one of the vats to talk to them it took awhile to get things sorted outwho i was why an alderman was lying in his own blood next to steve dresberg on a factory floor what louisa djiak and the chigwells were doing there you knowall the usual stuff when bobby mallory showed up at three we started moving faster he listened to my worries about louisa for about thirty seconds then had one of the men send for a fire department ambulance to take her to help of christians another ambulance had already carted dresberg and jurshak to county hospital both were still alive their futures uncertain i snatched a minute in the confusion to call lotty let her know the bare bones of what had happened and that i was unhurt i told her not to wait up but in my secret heart i begged her to when the state police arrived they assigned a car to ferry the chigwells home theyd wanted to send ms chigwell to a hospital for observation but she was adamant about returning to her own home before mallory came id been telling everyone that jurshak had lured chigwell down to the plant with a tale about finding a halfdead employee on the premises ms chigwell hadnt let him go alone this late at night and the two found themselves caught in the cross fire bobby looked narrowly at me but finally agreed to my version when it was clear he wasnt going to get anything else from the doctor or his sister bobby left me squatting wearily against a pillar on the plant floor while he conferred with the fifth district commander the light winking from uniform jackets and hardware made me dizzy i shut my eyes but i couldnt keep out the clamor or the murky xerxine smell what would my creatine level be after tonight i pictured my kidneys filled with lesionsbloodred with black holes in them oozing xerxine someone shook me roughly i opened my eyes sergeant mcgonnigal was standing over me his square face displaying unusual concern lets get you outsideyou need some fresh air vic i let him help me to my feet and stumbled after him to the loading bay where the police had rolled back the steel doors leading to the river the fog had lifted stars showed little yellow pricks in the polluted heavens the air was still pungent with the scent of many chemicals but the cold made it fresher than it was inside the plant i looked down at the water glinting black in the moonlight and shivered youve had a pretty rough night mcgonnigals voice held just the right level of concern i tried not to imagine him learning how to talk to difficult witnesses like that at a seminar in springfieldi tried to think he really cared about the horrors id been through after all wed known each other six or seven years a little exhausting i admitted you want to tell me about it or do you want to wait to talk to the lieutenant so it was roleplaying from a seminar my shoulders sagged a bit farther if i tell you will i have to repeat it to mallory its not a story i feel like going over more than once you know the cops warshawskiwe never take any story just once but if youll give me the outline tonight ill make sure that does for nowget you home while theres still a little left of the night to sleep in maybe there was a little personal concern mixed in not enough to make me tell the whole truth and nothing buti mean i wasnt going to explain about the doctors medical texts and certainly not jurshaks relations with louisa but after id pulled a crate over to the waters edge and sat on it i gave him more details than id originally planned to i started with the call from dresberg he knew louisa was important to memy mother had looked after her when she was pregnant and theyd been pretty good friends so they must have realized she was one person id come out here to help why didnt you call us then mcgonnigal asked impatiently i didnt know how youd manage a quiet assault they had her in the back of the plant heretheyd simply have murdered her if they figured they were under attack i wanted to sneak in here myself and just how did you manage that they had a lookout where the road turns off to here and another guy at the gates dont tell me you sprayed some amnesiac in the air and slid by them i shook my head and pointed at the dinghy floating below us the floodlights overhead picked up the incredulity in mcgonnigals face you rowed up the river in that come on warshawski get real its the truth i said stubbornly believe it or not ms chigwell was with meits her boat i thought you said theyd come here together i nodded i knew if i told you the truth youd keep her and her brother here all night and theyre too old for that besides she got shot in the arm even if it did just graze her she should have been in bed hours ago mcgonnigal pounded the crate with the flat of his hand you dont have an armlock on empathy warshawski even the police are capable of showing concern for a couple as old as the chigwells cant you drop your sixties off the pigs mentality for five minutes and let us do our job you could have been killed and gotten the djiak woman and your elderly friends knocked off in the bargain for your information i said coldly my father was a beat cop and i never in my life referred to the police as pigs anyway no one got killed not even those two pieces of shit who deserved it do you want to hear the rest of my story or would you rather get up in your pulpit and preach at me some more he sat stiffly for a moment i guess i can see why bobby mallory shows up at his worst around you i was bragging to myself that i was going to show the lieutenant what a younger officer with sensitivity training could do with a witness like you and i blew it in five minutes finish your story i wont criticize your methods i finished my story i told him i didnt know how chigwell had gotten hooked up with jurshak and dresberg but that theyd forced him to come along tonight to look after louisa and that ms chigwell was worried about him so when i showed up with my crazy suggestion that we row up the calumet and sneak up on the plant from the rear she jumped at the chance i know shes seventynine but sailings been her hobby since she was a kid and she sure handled her oar splendidly so then we got here and we had a lucky breakjurshak went into the plant and dresberg walked off to check on the people in the ambulance who was in it is that who shot at you guys when you showed up no that was the sentry mcgonnigal explained he tried making a run for it someone got him in the abdomen i suddenly realized that caroline djiak didnt know where her own mother was i explained the problem to mcgonnigal shes probably roused the mayor by now i should call her if i can get back into one of the offices he shook his head i think youve done enough running around for one evening ill send a uniformed man over to her housethen she can get an escort down to the hospital if she wants ill run you home i thought it over maybe id just as soon not include a close encounter with caroline in the nights strains could we go pick up my car its down on stony a half mile or so he pulled out his walkietalkie and summoned a uniformed officermy pal mary louise neely she saluted him smartly but i could see she was eyeing me curiously so maybe she was human after all neely i want you to drive ms warshawski and me down the road to pick up her car then go to the address she gives you on houston he sketched the situation with caroline and louisa officer neely nodded enthusiasticallyits a break to be signaled out for a special assignment from among so many even though it was just chauffeuring duty it gave her a chance to make an impression on a senior man she trailed behind us as mcgonnigal went to tell bobby what we were doing bobby agreed reluctantlyhe wasnt going to contradict his sergeant in front of me or a uniformed officer but youre talking to me tomorrow vicki whether you like it or not you hear yeah bobby i hear just wait until the afternoonill be a lot more cooperative if i get some sleep yeah princess you private operators work when you feel like it and leave the garbage for the cops to sweep up youll talk to me when im ready for you the light was dancing in my eyes again i had moved beyond fatigue to a state where id start hallucinating if i wasnt careful i followed mcgonnigal and neely into the night without trying to respond night shakes when officer neely had dropped us at my car i dug the keys from my jeans pocket and handed them wordlessly to mcgonnigal he turned the car in the rutted yard while i leaned back in the passenger seat releasing it so it was almost horizontal i was sure id fall asleep as soon as i lay back but images from the night kept exploding in my head not the silent trip up the calumetthat had already faded to the surreal world of halfremembered dreams louisa lying on the cart at the end of the plant dresbergs cold indifference waiting for the police in chigwells office i hadnt been afraid at the time but the recurring pictures gave me the shakes now i tried clenching my arms against the sides of the seat to control the shaking its aftershock mcgonnigals voice came clinically in the dark dont be ashamed of it i pulled the seat back to its upright position its the ugliness i said the horrible reasons jurshak had for doing it and the fact that dresberg isnt a man anymore hes an unfeeling death machine if theyd just been a couple of punks jumping me in an alley i wouldnt feel this way mcgonnigal reached out an arm and groped for my left hand he squeezed it reassuringly but didnt speak after a minute his fingers stiffened he withdrew them and concentrated on turning onto the calumet expressway a good investigator would take advantage of your fatigue and get you to explain what jurshaks horrible reasons were i braced myself in the dark trying to prepare my wits never speak without thinking a cardinal rule to my clients in my public defender days first the cops wear you out then they show you some sympathy then they get you to spill your guts mcgonnigal tried taking the chevy up to eighty but slowed to seventy when it started vibrating police privilege i expect you have some cover story ready he went on and itd really be police brutality to force you to keep it up when youre this tired after that the temptation to tell him everything i knew became nearly irresistible i forced myself to watch what aspect of landscape one could see from the expressway canyons to push away the picture of louisas disoriented gaze confusing me with gabriella mcgonnigal didnt speak again until we were passing the loop exits and then it was only to ask for lottys address would you like to come back to jefferson park with me instead he asked unexpectedly have a brandy unwind spill all my secrets in bed after the second drink nodont get upset that was supposed to be a joke you just couldnt tell in the dark it sounded appealing but lotty would be anxiously awaiting mei couldnt leave her hanging i tried explaining this to mcgonnigal shes the one person i never lie to shesnot my consciencethe person who helps me see who i really am i guess he didnt answer until hed pulled off the kennedy at irving park yeah i understand my grandfather was like that i was trying to picture myself in your situation with him waiting up for me id have to go back too they didnt teach that in any seminar in springfield i asked about his grandfather hed died five years ago the week before my promotion came through i was so mad i almost resignedwhy couldnt they have given it to me when he was still alive to see it but then i could hear him saying what do you think johnniegod runs the universe with you in mind he laughed a little to himself you know warshawski ive never told that to another soul he pulled up in front of lottys place howre you going to get home i asked umm ill summon a squad car theyll be glad to have an excuse to leave the mayhem in uptown for a chance to drive me he held the keys out to me under the sodium light i could see his eyebrows lift in inquiry i leaned across the seat divider and put my arms around him and kissed him he smelled of leather and sweat human smells that made me wriggle closer to him we sat like that for several minutes but the ashtray in the divider was digging into my side i pulled away thanks for the ride sergeant a pleasure warshawski we serve and protect you know i invited him to come up and call a squad car from lottys but he said hed do it from the street that he needed the night air he watched while i undid the lobby locks then sketched a wave and walked off lotty was in her sitting room still in the dark skirt and sweater shed put on for the hospital seven hours earlier she was flicking the pages of the guardian making only a pretext of interest in scottish economic woes she put the paper down as soon as she saw me it felt like home to nestle in her arms i was glad id decided to come back here instead of going off with mcgonnigal while she bathed my face and fed me hot milk i told her the nights tale the strange ride up the river my fears ms chigwells indomitable courage she frowned deeply over chigwells betrayal of his medical vows lotty knows there are unethical doctors but she never likes to hear about them the worst part in a way was when louisa woke up and thought i was gabriella i said as lotty led me into the spare room i dont want to be back there you know back in south chicago cleaning up behind the djiaks the way my mother did lotty slid my clothes off with practiced medical fingers a little late to be worrying about that my dearits all youve been doing this last month i made a facemaybe i would have been better off with the sergeant after all lotty pulled the covers over me i was asleep before shed turned out the light falling deep into dreams of mad boat journeys of scaling cliffs while being attacked by eagles of lotty waiting at the top for me saying a little late to be worrying isnt it vic when i woke at one the next afternoon i was unrefreshed i lay for a bit in a drowsy lethargy stiff both mentally and physically i wanted to lie there indefinitely to drift to sleep until lotty came home and took care of me the last few weeks had taken from me any ability to find pleasure in what i did for a living or indeed any reason for continuing it if i had been able to follow my mothers dreams id be my generations geraldine farrar sharing intimate moments across a concert stage with james levine i tried imagining what it would be like to be talented and pampered and wealthy if someone like gustav humboldt came after me id have my press agent whip up a few paragraphs for the times and call the police superintendentwho would be my loverto knock him down a few pegs and when i was worn out some other person would stagger to the bathroom on badly swollen feet to try to clear her head under a coldwater tap she would make my phone calls run my errands suffer hideous hardships for me if i had time i would thank her graciously in the absence of this selfless bunter i called my answering service myself mr contreras had phoned once murray ryerson had left seven messages each progressively more emphatic i didnt want to talk to him not ever but since id have to eventually i might as well get it over with i found him steaming at the city desk ive had it with you warshawski you cannot get help from the press without delivering your side of the bargain this fight in south chicago is old news the electronic guys already have it i helped you out on the understanding youd give me an exclusive stick it in your ear i said nastily you did sweet nothing for me on this case you took my leads and gave me back zero i beat you to the finish line and now youre pissed the only reason im calling at all is to keep the communications lines open for the future because believe me im not too interested in talking to you in the present murray started to roar back but his newspaper instincts won out he put on the brakes and began asking questions i thought about describing my midnight boat ride up the misty acrid calumet or the utter fatigue of soul i felt after talking to curtis chigwell but i didnt want to justify myself to murray ryerson instead i gave him everything id told the police along with a vivid description of the fight around the solvent vats he wanted me to join a photographer down at the xerxes plant to show where id stood and got indignant at my refusal youre a fucking ghoul ryerson i said the kind of guy who asks disaster victims how they felt when they saw their husbands or children go up in smoke i am not going into that plant again not even if they gave me the nobel peace prize for doing it the faster i forget the place the happier ill be well saint victoria you go feed the hungry and tend to the sick he slammed the receiver in my ear my head still felt leaden i went out to the kitchen and made myself a pot of coffee lotty had left a note in her thick black script next to the potshed turned off the phone before she left but both murray and mallory had called i knew about murray of course but bobby had mercifully not hounded me after the one message i suspected mcgonnigal had intervened and was grateful i poked around the refrigerator but couldnt get interested in any of lottys healthy food finally i settled at the kitchen table with the coffee using the extension on the counter i called frederick manheim mr manheim its v i warshawski the detective who came to see you a few weeks ago about joey pankowski and steve ferraro i remember you ms warshawskii remember everything connected with those men i was sorry to read about the attack on you last week that didnt have anything to do with xerxes did it i leaned back in the chair trying to find a comfortable spot for my sore shoulder muscles by a strange set of coincidences yes how would you feel about getting a cartload of material implying that humboldt chemical knew the toxic effects of xerxine as early as he was silent for a long moment then he said cautiously this isnt your idea of a joke is it ms warshawski i dont know you well enough to figure out what you think is funny i never felt less like laughing im looking at such an incredible display of cynicism that every time i think of it i get consumed by rage my old neighbor in south chicago is dying right now at the age of fortytwo she looks like a warravaged grandmother i checked myself what i really want to know mr manheim is whether youre prepared to organize and manage action on behalf of hundreds of former xerxes employees maybe present ones as well you should think about it carefully it would be your entire life for the next decade you couldnt handle it alone in your storefrontyoud have to take on researchers and associates and paralegals and youd have to fight off the big guns whod want to cut you out because they smelled the contingency fees you make it sound real attractive he laughed quietly i told you about the threat i got when i was preparing to appeal i dont think i have much choice i mean i dont see how i could live with myself if i had a chance now to win that case and passed it up just so i wouldnt have to give up my quiet practice when can i get your cartload tonight if you can drive up to the north side seventhirty okay i gave him lottys address when hed hung up i phoned max at the hospital after a few minutes on my latenight adventurewhich had made the morning papers in skeleton formhe agreed to get the chigwell documents copied when i said id come by at the end of the day for the originals he protested graciously it would be his pleasure to bring them to lottys for me after that i really couldnt delay a hearttoheart with bobby i tracked him down by phone at the central district and agreed to meet him there in an hour that gave me time for a soak in lottys tub to limber up my sore shoulders and a call to mr contreras assuring him i was alive moderately well and would return home in the morning he started a long anxious dump about how hed felt when he saw the news this morning i cut him off gently ive got a date with the police ill be pretty well tied up today but well have a late breakfast tomorrow and catch up sounds good doll french toast or pancakes french toast i couldnt help laughing it got me down to police headquarters in a light enough mood to deal with bobby his pride was badly wounded by my nailing the emperor of trash dresberg had been dancing rings around chicagos finest for years for any private investigator to have caught him dead to rights would have hurt mallory but that it had to be me so upset him that he kept me downtown for four hours he interrogated me himself while officer neely took notes then sent in relays of people from the organized crime division followed by the special functions unit finishing with an escorted interview with a couple of feds by then my fatigue had come back full force i kept dropping off between questions and it was getting hard for me to remember what i was revealing and what id decided belonged to me alone the third time the feds had to poke me awake they decided theyd had enough of a good time and urged bobby to send me home yeah i guess weve got everything were going to get he waited until his office was empty then said edgily whatd you do to mcgonnigal last night vicki he made it real clear he wasnt going to be present while i talked to you i didnt do anything i said raising my eyebrows he turn into a boar or something bobby frowned at me if youre trying to level any charges against john mcgonnigal who is one of the finest circe i cut in hastily thats what she did to odysseuss crew i assumed you were thinking of that or something like it bobby narrowed his eyes but all he said was go on home vicki i dont have the energy for your sense of humor right now i was at the door when he lighted his last squib how well do you know ron kappelman his voice had a studied casualness that warned me to be careful i turned to look at him my hand still on the doorknob ive talked to him three or four times were not lovers if thats what youre asking bobbys gray eyes measured me steadily you know jurshak did a few favors for him when he signed on as scraps counsel i felt the bottom fall out of my stomach like what oh cleared the way for him to do all the renovation work on his house that kind of thing and in exchange information nothing unethical he wouldnt jeopardize his clients standing just let the aldermans office know what moves they might make or what moves a smart pi like you might be making i see it was an effort to get words out let alone keep my voice steady i braced myself against the door how do you know all this jurshak talked a lot this morning nothing like the fear of death to get someone babbling of course the courts will throw it all out information obtained under duress but watch who you talk to vicki youre a smart girlsmart young lady ill even agree youve done some good work but youre one person alone you just cant do the job the cops are paid to do i was too tired and soulsick to argue i felt too bad even to think he was wrong my shoulders slumped i slogged my way down the long corridors to the parking lot and headed back to lotty a wise child when i got to lottys max was already there i felt so down after my talk with mallory that i would have preferred canceling my meeting with manheim what could one person do alone anyway as it was i only had time to explain to lotty who frederick manheim was and why id invited him when he showed up his round solemn face was flushed with excitement but he shook hands politely with max and lotty and offered lotty a bottle of wine it was a gruaudlarose max raised his brows appreciately so i assumed it was a good bottle as we talked in the kitchen my drooping selfconfidence began to revive after all i had been worried about kappelmans role all along it wasnt a failure on my part bobby just was trying to skewer me because id stopped steve dresberg when he and his thousands of backups hadnt been able to touch him i whipped up omelets while max opened the wine reverentially letting it breathe while we ate at lottys kitchen table we talked about general topicsthe wine was too splendid to pollute with xerxine afterward though we moved into lottys sitting room i spelled out the story for max and manheim lounging on the daybed i explained what id learned from chigwellthat theyd done the tests because they could see their high rates of illness as early as you should see if you can talk to ajax they were handling xerxess life and health insurance at the time i know they went to mariners rest in with evidence of how good and pure they were but if you find out why ajax dropped them back in the fifties you may get some inside dope on why they decided to look at blood instead ofi dont know some other choice manheim propped on his elbows on the floor was naturally most interested in what lay in chigwells notebooks lotty sketched the data for him but warned him he would have to get an array of specialists i am only a perinatologist you know so what im telling you is only what ive learned from dr christophersen you will need many peopleblood specialists a good renal pathologist and above all you will need a team in occupational health manheim nodded soberly at all their advice his rosy cherubs cheeks glowed deeper red as he filled legal pads with notes every now and then he asked me a question about the plant and the employees lotty finally put a halt to the discussionshe had to get up early i was her patient and wasnt fit for another allnight session and so on manheim stood up reluctantly im not going to do anything in a hurry he warned me i want to doublecheck the data find the lab that did the blood work for them all that kind of stuff and im going to have to consult with a specialist in environmental law i held up my hands its your baby now you do what you want with it you just need to keep in mind that gustav humboldt isnt going to lie down with his legs up in the air while youre gathering factsfor all i know hes already figured out a way to put the clamps on the lab you want one last chance to back out he thought for a short minute then grinned reluctantly ive spent enough time on my tush in beverlyi cant turn down this one as long as you agree to provide moral support every now and then yeah sure why not i agreed as positively as i couldi didnt want tentacles from south chicago to keep reaching out to strangle me when manheim had gone i headed off to bed leaving max in the sitting room with a bottle of lottys cognac lotty came in for a minute after id brushed my teeth to tell me caroline had phoned while i was with the police she wants you to call her but as she was angry and became rather rude i thought it wouldnt hurt her to wait i grinned thats my caroline she say anything about louisa i gather since she slept through her ordeal shes none the worse for it sleep well my dear she was gone when i got up in the morning i puttered aimlessly around the kitchen drinking coffee i started to make toast then remembered my promise to eat breakfast with mr contreras i slowly packed my overnight bag the longer i stayed at lottys the less interested i seemed to be in looking after myself it was time to go before i slipped into unconquerable lassitude in deference to lottys tidy spirit i took the sheets from the guest bed and bundled them up with the towels id used i wrote a note telling her id taken them home with me to launder i straightened up the other signs of my presence as best i could and headed over to racine mr contrerass delight at seeing me was equaled only by the dogs peppy jumped up to lick my face her golden tail thumping the door hard enough to swing it shut my neighbor took the laundry from me these dr lottys things ill wash em for you doll after breakfast youll want to unwind look at your mail do whatever so the case is over everything locked up with those two villains in the hospital i mighta known youd take care of those guys doll i shouldnt of worried so much about you no wonder you got teed off i put an arm around him yeah it all looks swell now that the battles nearly over but shooting someone in that kind of situation is just luckyou cant aim i could be in intensive care instead of dresberg if the luck had gone the other way nearly over his faded brown eyes showed concern you mean those guys still have someone gunning for you other way around theres a big old white shark thrashing around in the water dresberg and jurshak were his allies who knows what else hes got stashed in his cove i tried to keep my tone light anyway i came back here for french toast got any sure doll sure everythings readyjust waiting for you before i turn on the griddle he rubbed his hands together and bustled me inside somewhere from the recesses of his life hed dug up a white linen tablecloth hed cleared the diningroom table of the magazines and bricabrac that usually cluttered it and covered it with the cloth a vase in the middle held red carnations i was touched he swelled with pride at my compliments these were claras things they never meant so much to me but i couldnt bring myself to give them to ruthie when she died clara kind of treasured them and i just couldnt quite see ruthie prizing them like she should he hurried off to the kitchen and came back with a glass of fresh orange juice now you sit here doll and ill have breakfast out to you in two shakes he fried up tall mounds of bacon and gargantuan stacks of french toast i ate what i could and repaid him by telling the tale of my midnight trip up the calumet he was caught between awe at the exploit and jealousy that i hadnt picked him to go with me pipe wrench and all i gallantly suppressed a shudder at the idea i didnt think it would be fair to peppy i explained if we both got killed or laid up who would look after her he accepted that grudginglyand a bit suspiciouslyand asked me to tell him again how id shot dresberg finally around noon i felt id stayed long enough and made my escape upstairs the old man had stacked my mail neatly inside my apartment door letters in one pile newspapers in another i flipped through the letters quicklynothing personal not one thing just bills and solicitations in irritation i tossed the lot including my home phone bill the papers would keepid go through them later and see how theyd covered xerxes my rooms had that strange appearance of a place you havent visited for a whilethey seemed somehow unfamiliar as though id heard them described but hadnt ever actually seen them i moved around restlessly trying to reestablish myself in my own existence and trying not to wonder what humboldt might next attempt i wasnt entirely successful at two when the doorbell rang i jumped a little this has got to stop victoria i admonished myself i walked purposefully to the intercom and pressed it carolines voice came tinnily through if anything were needed to restore my selfconfidence it would be a little roughhousing with her i prepared myself for battle and buzzed her in i could hear her moving up the stairs with a slow heavy tread most unlike her usual canter when she made the last turning and came into view i could see that she looked somber my heart contracted louisa tuesday nights escapade had been too much for her weak system and shed died hello caroline come on in she stood in the doorway do you hate me vic my eyebrows went up in surprise why on earth do you ask that i thought youd shown up to chew me out for exposing louisa to so much abuse two nights ago it wasnt your fault it was mine if id told you what was going on you almost got killed because of me twice but all i could do was scream at you like the spoiled little brat you kept telling me i was i put an arm around her and dragged her into the apartmentthe last thing i wanted was for mr contreras to hear us and come bounding up caroline leaned against me and let me take her over to the couch hows louisa shes back home caroline hunched her shoulders she actually seems a little better today she doesnt remember anything that happened and whatever they shot her full of gave her a better sleep than she usually gets she picked up a copy of fortune and started twisting it around the police came by right after id gotten home and found her missing id been at a marathon meeting downtown you know going over the recycling stuff with some of the local epa attorneys i thought mad had a bad turn that the neighbors or aunt connie had taken her to the hospital then when the cops came for me i went a little crazy i nodded lotty told me youd called yesterday with an angry message i just didnt have the strength to get back to you she looked at me directly for the first time since shed arrived i dont blame youi was mad enough to spit blood and then some i was screaming my head off at you while i drove to help of christians but when i got there all i could think of was you and your mother looking after ma and me all those years and then i thought of what youd been through for the two of us just these last three weeks and i felt terribly ashamed it never would have happened if i hadnt pushed you into looking for my father when you didnt want to do it i took her hand and squeezed it ive been plenty mad at youprobably cursed you worse than you did me and im not exactly wearing a haloif id bugged out when you asked me to id never have been left for dead in the swamp and louisa wouldnt have been kidnapped but i dont think the police would ever have found out the truth she objected they never would have found nancys killer and jurshak and dresberg would still be ruling south chicago i shouldnt have been such a chickeni should have told you about the threats to louisa to begin with so you wouldnt get blindsided i knew i needed to tell her about discovering who had gotten louisa pregnant but i couldnt seem to find the words or maybe it was just the courage while i was fishing around for it caroline said abruptly i bought ma some cigarettes i remembered what you said that first night you came by how they wouldnt make her any worse and they might cheer her up and i could see all i was trying to do was have power over her keeping her from having one thing that might bring her a little pleasure her last words brought back lottys advice most strongly i took a breath and said caroline i have to tell youi did find out who your father was her blue eyes turned very dark not joey pankowski right i shook my head im afraid not there isnt any easy way to say this or to hear it but it would be really wrong for me not to tell youa most noxious way of controlling your life she looked at me solemnly go ahead vic ii think im more grown up than i used to be i can take it i took both her hands and said gently it was art jurshak he was your art jurshak she burst out i dont believe you ma never would have come across him in a million years youre making this up arent you i shook my head i wish i were artheuhyour grandmother djiak is his sister he used to spend a lot of time with connie and louisa when they were little and the djiaks chose not to notice that he was abusing them your grandparents are both terrified of sex and your grandfather especially is frightened of women so they made up a vile fairy tale for themselves that it was your mothers fault when she got pregnant although they did stop seeing art it was louisa they punished theyre a pretty loathsome couple ed and martha djiak her freckles stood out like polka dots against the pallor of her face art jurshak hes my father im related to him he gave you some chromosomes babe but youre not related to him not by any manner of means youre your own person you know not his not the djiaks either youve got guts youve got integrity and above all you have valor none of that has any relationship to art jurshak iart jurshak she gave a little bark of hysterical laughter all these years i thought your father had got ma pregnant i thought that was why your mother did so much for us i thought i was really your sister now i see i dont have anyone at all she got up and ran for the door i ran after her and caught her arm but she wrenched herself free and jerked the door open caroline i tore down the stairs after her this doesnt change that you will always be my sister caroline i stood on the sidewalk in my shirt sleeves watching helplessly as she drove recklessly down the street toward belmont humboldts gift i think the last time i felt this bad was the day after my mothers funeral when her death suddenly became real to me i tried calling caroline both at her house and at scrap both louisa and a secretary agreed to take messages but wherever caroline was she didnt want to talk to me a thousand times or so i thought of calling mcgonnigal asking the police to keep an eye out for herbut what could they do about one distraught citizen around four i borrowed peppy from mr contreras and drove her over to the lake i wasnt up to running although she certainly was but i needed her silent love and the expanse of sky and water to soothe my spirit it wasnt out of the question that humboldt a sore loser if ever there was one had some kind of backup to dresberg so i kept a hand on the smith wesson in my jacket pocket i threw sticks lefthanded for the dog she didnt think much of the distance they went but fetched them anyway to show she was a good sport when shed worked off some of her excess energy we sat looking at the water while i kept my right hand on the gun in some remote part of my mind i knew i should think of a way to take the initiative with humboldt so that i didnt have to walk around with one hand in my pocket for the rest of my life i could go to ron kappelman and force the issue with him see how much hed been feeding jurshak about my investigation maybe hed even know how to reach humboldt the whole prospect of action seemed so impossible that just thinking about it made my eyelids feel leaden my brain fogged over even the idea of getting up and walking to the car would take more effort than i could manage i might have sat staring at the waves until spring if peppy hadnt gotten fed up and started pushing me with her nose you dont get it do you i said to her golden retrievers dont feel guilty about their neighbors puppies they dont feel obligated to look after them till death she agreed happily tongue lolling whatever i said was fine as long as action accompanied it we walked back to the caror i walked and peppy danced in a spiral around me to make sure i didnt stray or go back into catatonia when we got home mr contreras came bustling out with lottys clean sheets and towels i thanked him as best i could but told him i wanted to be alone id like to keep the dog awhile too okay yeah sure doll sure whatever you say she misses your runs thats for certain so shed probably be glad to stay with you make sure you havent forgotten her back in my own place i tried caroline again but she was still either gone or refusing to talk to me disheartened i sat at the piano and picked my way through chio scordi di te it had been gabriellas favorite aria and it suited my mood of melancholy selfpity to play it through then work at singing it i felt tears of bathetic sorrow pricking my eyelids and went back to the middle where the soprano line is most melodic when the phone rang i jumped up eagerly sure it was caroline willing finally to talk to me miss warshawski it was the quavering voice of humboldts butler yes anton my voice was calm but an adrenaline surge cleared my lethargy like sunlight on fog mr humboldt would like to speak with you please hold the voice held frosty disapproval perhaps he thought humboldt wanted to make me his mistress and he feared i was too low class for the tone of the roanoke a minute or so went by i tried to get peppy to come to the phone and act as my secretary but she wasnt interested finally humboldts rich baritone vibrated the earpiece ms warshawski i would be most grateful if you would pay me a visit this evening i have someone with me whom you would be sorry not to meet lets see i said dresberg and jurshak are in the hospital troy is under arrest ron kappelman isnt of much interest to me anymore who you got left he gave his hearty chuckle to show that mondays contretemps was just an unhappy memory youre always so direct ms warshawski i assure you there will be no gunplay if you will pay me the courtesy of a visit knives hypodermics vats of chemicals he laughed again let us just say you would regret it forever if you did not meet my visitor ill send my car for you at six youre very kind i said formally but i prefer to drive myself and i will bring a friend with me my heart was pounding when i hung up and wild surmises flashed through my mind he had caroline hostage or lotty i couldnt check on caroline but i did phone lotty at the clinic when she came to the phone surprised at my urgency i explained where i was going if you dont hear from me by seven call the police i gave her bobbys home and office numbers youre not going alone are you lotty asked anxiously no no im taking a friend vic not that meddlesome old man hell cause more trouble than hell save you i laughed a little no i agree with you totally im taking someone whos silent and reliable only after i promised to call her as soon as i got away from the roanoke would she agree to my going without a police escort when shed hung up i turned to peppy come on babe youre going to the haunts of the rich and powerful the dog expressed herself interested as always in any expedition she watched her head cocked while i checked the smith wesson one last time to make sure a bullet was chambered then bounded down the stairs ahead of me we managed to make it outside without a checkup by mr contrerashe must have been in the kitchen making supper i looked around cautiously to make sure i wasnt walking into an ambush but no one was lying in wait peppy jumped into the backseat of the chevy and we headed south the doorman at the roanoke greeted me with the same avuncular courtesy id had on my first visit apparently anton hadnt told him i was a menace to society or the memory of my fivedollar tip outweighed any nasty messages from the twelfth floor the dog is accompanying you maam i smiled mr humboldt is expecting her very good maam he turned us over to fred at the elevator i moved with practiced grace to the little bench at the rear peppy sat alertly at my feet her tongue hanging out panting a little she wasnt used to elevators but she took the uncertain flooring with the cool poise of a champion when wed been decanted she sniffed around the marble floor of humboldts lobby but came to attention at my side when anton opened the ornate wooden door he looked coldly at peppy we prefer not having dogs up here as their habits are difficult to predict or control ill ask marcus to keep her in the lobby until youre ready to leave i grinned a little savagely uncontrollable habits sound as though they should mesh perfectly with your bosss style im not coming in without her so make up your mind how bad humboldt wants to see me very good madam the frost in his voice had moved into the low kelvin range if you will follow me humboldt was seated in front of his library fire he was drinking out of a heavily cut glasswhiskey and soda as nearly as i could tell my stomach twisted as i watched him my anger returning and jolting my system humboldt looked severely at anton when peppy came in at my left heel but the majordomo said aloofly that i refused to see him without her humboldt immediately switched personae genially asking the dogs name and trying to make much of her beauty shed picked up his antagonism though and didnt respond i ostentatiously walked around the room with her inviting her to sniff in corners i flicked back the heavy brocade curtains but the view was of the lakethere was no place for a sniper to hide i dropped the curtain i was kind of expecting a burst of machinegun fire dont tell me my life is going to settle into monotony humboldt gave his rich little chuckle nothing affects you does it ms warshawski you really are a most remarkable young woman i sat in the armchair facing humboldt peppy stood in front of me looking from him to me with concern her tail down i patted her head and she went down on her haunches without relaxing your mystery guest hasnt arrived yet my guest will keep he chuckled gently to himself i thought you and i could have a little chat first it might not be necessary to produce my visitor whiskey i shook my head your rarefied cellars are giving me ideas above my income i cant afford to get used to them but you could ms warshawski you could you know if you would stop going around with that outsize chip on your shoulder i leaned back in the chair and crossed my legs now that is really unworthy of you i expected a much grander or at least more subtle approach now now ms warshawski youre too hasty to react much of the time you could do worse than listen to me yeah i guess i could follow the cubs on a road trip but you might as well spit it out now so ill know if i have to dodge your minions bullets for the rest of my life he refused to let himself get ruffled youve paid a great deal of attention to my affairs recently ms warshawski so ive returned the compliment and paid much attention to yours i bet my researches were a lot more exciting than yours i kept my hand on peppys head perhaps we have different ideas of what might prove exciting for instance i was most intrigued to learn that you owe a balance of fifty thousand dollars on your apartment and that your mortgage payments are not easy for you to meet oh god gustav you arent going to pull the old illgetthebanktocutoffyourmortgage routine are you thats getting pretty boring he continued as though i hadnt spoken your parents are both dead i understand but you have a good friend who stands toward you as sort of a mother i believethis dr charlotte herschel yes i tightened my fingers so strongly in peppys hair that she gave a little yelp if anything happens to dr herschelanythingfrom a flat tire to a bloody noseyou will be dead within twentyfour hours thats a castiron prophecy he gave his hearty chuckle youre so active ms warshawski that you imagine everyone must be as energetic as yourself no i was more concerned about dr herschels medical practice whether she would be able to keep her license he waited for me to react again but id managed to regain enough selfcontrol to keep quiet i picked up the new york times from the little table that lay between us and flipped to the sports section the islanders were on a rollhow disappointing youre not curious ms warshawski he finally asked not especially i turned to a discussion of the mets prospects going into training camp i mean therere so many creepy things you might do itd be a waste of energy wondering which particular one youve lighted on this time he put his whiskey glass down with a snap and leaned forward peppy growled a little in the back of her throat i put what looked like a restraining hand on herits hard to imagine a golden retriever attacking someone but if you dont like dogs you might not know that he kept an eye on peppy so you are prepared to sacrifice your home and dr herschels career to your stubborn pride what do you want me to do i said irritably lie on the floor and kick and scream im prepared to believe you have much more in the way of power money whatever than i do you want to rub my nose in it be my guest just dont expect me to act real excited about it dont jump so quickly to conclusions ms warshawski he said plaintively youre not without options you just dont want to hear what they are okay i smiled brightly tell me get your dog to lie down first i gave peppy a hand signal and she obediently dropped to the floor but she kept her back haunches tensed ready to jump im only offering possibilities you mustnt be so quick to react to the first one its just one scenario you see your mortgage dr herschels license there are others you might be able to pay off that debt with enough money left to get yourself a car more suited to your personality than that old chevyyou see i have been doing my research what would you drive if you had the opportunity gosh i dont know mr humboldt i havent thought a lot about it maybe id move up to a buick he sighed like a disappointed father you should listen to me seriously young lady or you will soon find yourself out of options okay okay i said id like to drive a ferrari but magnums already doing that maybe an alfa so youll give me my coop and a sports car and dr herschels license what would you like from me as a show of gratitude for such generosity he smiled everyone can be pressured or bought dr chigwell a willing hardworking man but not alas of great ability unfortunately to have a doctor at an industrial location does not give one access to physicians of dr herschels caliber i put the paper down and stopped petting the dog to prove i was all attention he kept some notes over the years on our employees at xerxes without my knowledge of coursei cant keep on top of all the details of an operation the size of humboldt you and ronald reagan i murmured sympathetically he looked at me suspiciously but i kept an expression of intent interest on my face i only recently learned about these notes the information in them is useless because its totally inaccurate but in the wrong hands it might look most damaging to xerxes it could be difficult for me to prove that all the data he collected were wrong especially over a twentyyear period i said but if you could get those notebooks you would give me my mortgage and withdraw any threat to dr herschel there would also be a bonus for you because of the amount of trouble youve been subjected to by some of my overly zealous friends he reached inside his jacket pocket and held out a piece of parchment for me to look at after glancing at it casually i dropped it on the little table between us my coolness took an effortthe document represented two thousand preferred shares of humboldt chemical i picked up the times again and looked at the stock summaries closed at yesterday a twohundredthousanddollar bonus with no brokerage fees im impressed i leaned back in the chair and looked at him squarely trouble is i could double that just by shorting humboldt if money was that important to me it just isnt and youre shit out of luck on the notebooks anywaytheyve already gone both to an attorney and to a team of medical specialists youre dead i dont know what the value of the coming lawsuits is but half a billion probably isnt too far off the mark youd rather put your friend the woman who has stood as a mother to you out of practice for the sake of some people you never met and who arent worth your consideration anyway if youve been doing research on me you know that louisa djiak isnt a casual acquaintance i snapped and i defy you to think of any threat to dr herschel that her reputation for probity wouldnt be equal to he gave a smile that made him look very like a shark really ms warshawski you must learn not to be so hasty i would not make any threat i didnt feel competent to execute he rang a bell tucked into the mantel anton appeared so quickly he must have been hovering in the hallway bring our other visitor anton the butler inclined his head and left he returned a moment or two later with a woman of about twentyfive her brown hair was permed around her head in tight little corkscrews that exposed too much of her blotchy neck she had obviously made an effort over her appearance i supposed the ruffled acetate dress was her best since the boxy high heels had been dyed a matching aqua under the thick pancake covering her acne she looked belligerent and a little frightened this is mrs portis ms warshawski her daughter was a patient of dr herschels isnt that right mrs portis she nodded vigorously my mandy and dr herschel did what she should have known better than to do a grown woman with a little girl mandy was crying and screaming when she came out of the examining room it took me days to get her settled down again and find out what went on but when i found out you went to the states attorney and made a full report i finished smoothly despite a rage that was making my cheeks flame she was naturally too disturbed to know what do to humboldt said with an unctuousness that made me want to shoot him its very difficult to bring charges against a family doctor especially one who can summon the support that dr herschel can thats why i feel grateful for my own position which enables me to help out a woman like this i stared incredulously at him you really think you can take someone with dr herschels reputation to court with a woman like this as your witness an expert lawyer will shred her youre not just an egomaniac humboldtyoure stupid with it be careful whom you call stupid young ladyan expert lawyer can make anyone break down nothing turns a jury hostile faster and besides what would the publicity do to dr herschels practice not to mention the state licensing board especially if mrs portis is joined by other worried mothers whose daughters dr herschel has treated after all dr herschel is almost sixty and has never marrieda jury would be bound to suspect her sexual preferences the pulse in my neck was throbbing so violently i could hardly breathe let alone think the dog was whimpering a little at my feet i forced myself to stroke her gently it helped slow my heartbeat a little i got up and moved to a phone on a corner table peppy close on my heels lotty was still at the clinic vic youre all right its nearly seven now im okay physically dr herschel but mentally im slightly deranged i need to explain something to you and get your reaction do you have a patient named mrs portis lotty was puzzled but didnt ask any questions she came back to the phone quickly a woman who saw me once two years ago her daughter amanda was eight at the time and throwing up a lot i suggested psychological problems and it drove her away in a huff well humboldt has dug her up out of some ditch and gotten her to agree to claim you abused her daughter sexually you understand unless we turn chigwells notebooks over to him lotty was silent a moment my license for the notebooks in other words she finally said and you thought you had to call to get my answer i didnt feel able to speak for you on such a matter hes also offering me two hundred k in stock shares just so you know the size of the bribe and my mortgage is he with you i will speak to him myself but you should know i will tell him that i did not see my parents killed by fascists only to bow down to them in my old age i turned to humboldt dr herschel would like to talk to you he pushed himself out of his armchair almost the only sign of his age was the effort it took when he got up i stood next to him as he spoke to lotty my breath coming in short noisy pants i could hear her concise alto going on at length lecturing him as she might a failing student although i couldnt make out the exact words you are making a mistake doctor a most serious error humboldt said heavily no no i will not be insulted further on my own phone madam he hung up and glared at me you will be very sorry both of you i dont think you appreciate how very much power i have in this town young lady the pulse in my neck was still throbbing there are so many things you dont appreciate gustav that i hardly know where to start youre dead youre through in this town the heraldstar is working on your connection to steve dresberg and believe me theyll find it you may think you have it buried fifty layers deep but murray ryerson is a good archaeologist and hes burning right now but more than that your company is through your little chemical emporium just aint big enough to absorb the shock when those xerxine suits start pouring in it may be six months it may take two years but youre looking at half a billion in claims easy and its going to be like shooting rats in a barrel to prove malicious intent on your parthumboldts part that company you built upits going to be like jonahs gourdgrew in a night and withered in a night youre dead meat humboldt and youre so crazy you cant even smell the rot youre wrong you little polish bitch ill show you how wrong you are he hurled his whiskey glass across the room where it smashed into one of the bookcases ill break you just as easily as that glass gordon firth will never hire you again youll lose your license youll never get another client again ill see you on west madison with the other drunks and hasbeens and ill laugh at you ill roar with laughter you do that i said fiercely im sure your grandchildren will be much entertained by the spectacle in fact i bet theyd like to hear the whole story of how you poisoned people to maximize your goddamned bottom line my grandchildren he roared if you dare come near them neither you nor your friends will ever know another nights sleep in this city he kept shouting his threats escalating to include not just lotty but other friends whose names his researchers had dredged up peppys hackles rose and she growled menacingly i kept one hand on her collar and pressed the buzzer in the mantel with the other when anton came i pointed at the shattered glass you may want to clean that up and i think mrs portis would be more comfortable if youd send her down to marcus to get a cab come peppy we left as quickly as we could but it seemed i could hear that maniacal bellow all the way to the lobby bringing it all back home lotty and i spent the next few days with my lawyer i dont know if it was carter freemans efforts or antons or just that the scene at the roanoke had terrified her but mrs portis lost interest in bringing charges against lotty we had a tougher time over my mortgagefor a few weeks it looked as though i might have to find a place to rent but freeman managed to settle that somehow too ive always suspected that he put up a guarantee himself but he only raises his brows and feigns ignorance and changes the conversation when i try asking him after a bit my life regained its normal flowrunning peppy spending time with friends breaking my heart over chicagos sports teamsthe black hawks at that particular season i returned too to my normal workload looking at industrial fraud doing background searches on candidates for sensitive financial positions that kind of thing i worked hard to keep thoughts of humboldt and south chicago at bay in the normal course of things i wouldnt let loose ends drift away at the end of a case but i just couldnt take any more involvement in the old neighborhood so i decided to leave ron kappelmans role in the mess as an unanswered question if bobbys accusation was true that hed been feeding jurshak news of my whereabouts i should by rights go down to pullman and confront him i just didnt have the mental energy to pursue it any further though let the states attorney figure it all out when jurshak and dresberg came to trial sergeant mcgonnigal was another loose end that never got tied up i saw him with bobby a couple of times while going over endless statements and interrogations he acted pretty cold until he realized i wasnt going to blow the whistle on his latenight lapse from policeman decorum over time i knew i was better off not getting too cozy with a cop however empathic but we never talked about it by may with the cubs already vying for last place humboldt chemical was trading in the high fifties frederick manheim had consulted enough experts in law and medicine that whispers of possible trouble had followed the trade winds east to wall street manheim came to consult with me a couple of times but i was weary to the depths of my spirit of humboldt i told manheim id testify at any trials about my role in learning of the coverup but not to count on me for any other support so i didnt know what humboldt was doing to prepare a counterattack a blurb in the papers a few days after our final encounter said he was being treated for stress at passavant but since the heraldstar ran a photo of him throwing out the first pitch for the sox on opening day i guess hed gotten over it round about that time as the cubs moved north from tempe i got a postcard from florence dont wait until youre seventynine to see it ran the brief message in ms chigwells spidery hand when she returned home a few weeks later she called me i just wanted to let you know that im not living with curtis anymore i bought his share in the house from him hes gone to a retirement home in clarendon hills how do you like living alone very much i just wish id done it sixty years ago but i didnt have the courage to do it then i wanted to tell you because youre the one who made it possible showing me how a woman can live an independent life thats all she hung up on my incoherent protest i smiled a littlegruff to the end i hoped i was that tough forty years ahead the only thing that really troubled me was caroline djiak i couldnt get her to talk to me shed resurfaced after a days absence but she wouldnt come to the phone and when i drove down to houston street she shut the door on me not even letting me in to see louisa i kept thinking id made a terrible mistakenot just in telling her about jurshak but in keeping up my dogged search when shed been trying to call me off lotty shook her head sternly when i fretted about it youre not god victoria you cant pick and choose whats best for peoples lives and if youre going to spend hours in lachrymose selfpity please do it someplace elseits not an appetizing spectacle or find another line of work your dogged searches as you call them spring from a fundamental clarity of vision if you no longer have that sight you no longer are suited to your job her bracing words didnt kill my selfdoubts but in time even my worries over caroline receded when she called in early june to tell me louisa had died i could accept her abrupt conversation with relative equanimity i went to the funeral at st wenceslaus but not to the house on houston for food afterward louisas parents were running the event and whether they aped pious grief or murmured sly animadversions on divine providence i would be hard put to control my desire to decimate them caroline made no effort to speak to me at the service by the time i got home my lachrymose selfpity over her had been replaced by an older more familiar feelingirritation at her brattiness so when i found her waiting on my doorstep a month or so later i didnt exactly welcome her with open arms ive been here since three she said without introduction i was afraid youd gone out of town sorry i didnt leave my schedule with your secretary i replied sardonically but then of course i wasnt anticipating the pleasure dont be mean vic she begged i know i deserve itive been a horses rear end the last four months but i need to apologize or explain orwell anyway i dont want you only to be mad when you think about me i unlocked the lobby door you know caroline im reminded irresistibly of lucy and charlie brown and the football you know how she always promises this time she wont pull it away just as hes kickingand she always does and he always lands smack on his butt i have a feeling im about to end on my ass one last time but come on up her ready color came vic pleasei know i deserve anything you want to say to me but ive come here to apologize dont make it harder on me than it already is that shut me up but it didnt quiet my suspicions i led her silently to my apartment fixed her a coke while i had a rum and tonic and took her to the little ledge that serves as my back porch mr contreras waved at us from his tomatoes but stayed below the dog came up to join the party after shed fondled peppys ears and drunk her soda caroline took a deep breath and said vic i really am sorry i ran out on you last winter andand avoided you afterward somehowsomehow its only since louisa died that i could see it from your viewpoint see that you werent making fun of me making fun of you i was astonished she turned crimson again i thought you see you had such a wonderful father i loved your dad so much i wanted him to be my father too i used to lie in bed and imagine it imagine how much fun wed have when we were all together as a family him and me and ma and gabriella and youd be my real sister so you wouldnt feel pissed off at having to look after me it was my turn to be embarrassed i tried muttering something and finally said no elevenyearold wants to be saddled with looking after a baby i expect if youd really been my sister i would have been more annoyed instead of less but i wasnt laughing at you for having aa different father than mine it never once crossed my mind i know that now she said it just took me a long time to figure it out it was me that felt humiliated at the idea of art jurshak beingwell doing that to ma you know then when she died i suddenly saw what it must have been like for her and it made me realize what a remarkable woman she was because she was such a good mother she was so lively and really loved life and everything and it would have been so easy for her to be angry and bitter and take it out on me she looked at me earnestly then last week i wentwent to see young art my brother i guess he is he was pretty good about it even though i could see it was just hell for him having to talk to me i mean it was awful for him growing up art wasnt any kind of father he only got married to keep the djiaks from spoiling his political career and after young art was born he moved into the spare bedroom he never wanted to have anything to do with his own son so in a crazy kind of way i can see i was better off you know just with ma even ifeven if he hadnt been her uncle it would have been so much worse living with him than it was growing up without a father my throat was a little tight ive been full of selfrecriminations these last four months thinking i made the colossal mistake of an egomaniac in keeping on the case when you asked me to quit and then in telling you about him dont she said im glad to know its better to find out for sure rather than imagine it in my head even if what i made up was a hell of a lot nicer than what reality turned out to be besides if tony warshawski had really been my father hed seem like a pretty big sleaze moving ma and me next door to you and gabriella she laughed but i took her hand and held it after a bit she said hesitantly ithis next part is hard to tell you after all the insults i shouted at you about leaving the neighborhood but im leaving too im moving away from chicago actually i always wanted to live out in the country the real country so im going to montana to study forestry i never admitted it to anyone because i thought if i wasnt like you doing social activism stuff you know that you would despise me i gave an inarticulate squawk that made peppy jump no really vic but all these things ive been thinking about well i see you never wanted me to be like you it was just part of my head trip how i thought if i did the same things you did you would like me well enough to let me really be part of your family no way babei want you doing whats good for you not whats right for me she nodded so i applied out there and rushed everything through and im leaving in two weeks im making mas folks buy the house on houston and thats giving me the money to go but i wanted to tell you in person and i hope you meant it that youll always be my sister because well anyway i hope you meant it i knelt next to her chair and put my
