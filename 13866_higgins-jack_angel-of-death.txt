jack higgins angel of death the fourth book in the sean dillon series between two groups of men that want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds i see no remedy except force it seems to me that every society rests on the death of men oliver wendell holmes belfast london one a cold wind blew in from belfast lough driving rain across the city sean dillon moved along a narrow street between tall warehouses relics of the victorian era mostly boarded up now he stood on the corner a small man no more than five feet five wearing a trench coat and an old rain hat he was on the waterfront now there were ships out there at anchor their riding lights moving up and down for there was a heavy swell driving into the docks there was a sound of gunfire in the distance he glanced in the general direction lit a cigarette in cupped hands and moved on there was an air of desolation to the whole area examples of the devastation caused by twentyfive years of war everywhere and his feet crunched over broken glass he found what he was looking for five minutes later a warehouse with a peeling sign on the wall that said murphy son import export there were large double doors with a small judas gate for easy access it opened with a slight creak and he stepped inside it was a place of shadows empty except for an old ford van and a jumble of packing cases there was an office at the far end with glass walls one or two panes broken and a dim light shone there dillon removed his rain hat and ran a hand nervously over his hair which hed dyed black the dark moustache which hed gummed into place on the upper lip completed the transformation he waited still clutching the rain hat it had to be the van only reason for it being there so he wasnt surprised when the rear door opened and a rather large man a colt automatic in one hand emerged slow and easy my grand wee man he said in the distinctive belfast accent i say old chap dillon showed every sign of alarm and raised his hands no problem i trust im here in good faith arent we all mr friar a voice called and dillon saw daley appear in the doorway of the office is he clean jack the big man ran his hands over dillon and felt between his legs all clear here curtis bring him in when dillon entered the office daley was sitting in a chair behind the desk a young man of twentyfive or so with an intense white face curtis daley mr friar and this is jack mullin we have to be careful you understand oh perfectly old chap dillon rolled his rain hat and slipped it into his raincoat pocket may i smoke daley tossed a packet of gallaghers across try an irish cigarette im surprised to find youre english jobert and company now thats a french arms dealer thats why we chose him dillon lit a cigarette the arms business especially at the level you wish to deal isnt exactly thriving in london these days ive been in it for years ever since getting out of the royal artillery ive worked as an agent for monsieur jobert all over the world thats good monsieur jobert told me id be meeting your leader mr quinn daniel why should he expect that any special reason not really dillon said hurriedly i did a tour with the royal artillery in londonderry nineteen eightytwo mr quinn was quite famous notorious you mean daley said everyone after him the police the army and the bloody ira yes that does rather sum it up dillon said loyal to the crown thats what we protestants are mr friar daley said genuine anger in his voice and what does it get us a boot up the arse interference from america and a british government that prefers to sell us out to damn fenians like gerry adams i can appreciate your point of view dillon managed to sound slightly alarmed thats why we call our group sons of ulster we stand here or die here no other route and the sooner the british government and the ira realize that the better now what can jobert offer naturally ive put nothing on paper dillon said but in view of the kind of money were talking about a first consignment could be two hundred aks in prime condition fifty akms a dozen generalpurpose machine guns brownings not new but in good order ammunition no problem anything else we had a consignment of stinger missiles delivered to our marseilles warehouse recently jobert says he could manage six but that of course would be extra daley sat there frowning and tapping the desk with his fingers finally he said youre at the europa where else in belfast old chap right ill be in touch will i be meeting mr quinn i cant say ill let you know he turned to mullin send him on his way jack mullin took dillon back to the entrance and as he opened the judas gate there was a hollow booming sound in the distance what was that dillon said in alarm only a bomb nothing to get alarmed about my wee man did you wet your pants then he laughed as dillon stepped outside was still laughing as he closed the door dillon paused on the corner the first thing he did was peel away the moustache above his lip then he removed the rain hat from his pocket unrolled it and took out a shortbarrelled smith wesson revolver which he slipped into his waist band against the small of his back he put the hat on as the rain increased amateurs he said softly what can you do with them and he walked rapidly away at that moment daley was ringing a dublin number a woman answered scotts hotel mr brown a moment later daniel quinn came on the line yes curtis here im glad i caught you i thought you might be on the way to amsterdam tonight how did it go jobert sent a man called friar english exarmy officer he offered to meet all requirements including some stingers if you want them thats good what was he like this friar secondrate english public school type black hair and moustache frightened to death said he thought he was meeting you why should he think that jobert told him he would apparently he did a tour with the royal artillery in londonderry in eightytwo said you were quite famous there was a moments pause then quinn said take him out curtis i smell stinking fish here but why sure i was in londonderry in eightytwo only not as daniel quinn i used the name frank kelly jesus daley said take him out curtis thats an order ill call you from beirut dillon was staying at the europa hotel in great victoria street by the railway station the most bombed hotel in belfast if not the world he was still wearing the rain hat when he entered the suite the woman who sat reading a magazine was thirty years of age wore a black trouser suit and hornrimmed glasses she had short red hair her name was hannah bernstein and she was a detective chief inspector in the special branch at scotland yard she jumped up everything work out so far have you heard from ferguson not yet when do you make your move daley said hed get back to me he took off his hat i need a shower i want to get rid of this hair dye she made a face yes its just not you dillon he took off his coat and jacket and made for the bathroom at that moment the phone rang he raised a hand leave it to me and picked the phone up barry friar he said putting on the public school accent daley mr quinn will see you tomorrow night at six same place dillon asked no drive from the europa to garth dock its close to where you were tonight i know you have a hire car so use that and make sure you come alone youll be picked up mr quinn will be there the phone went dead hannah bernstein said now what daley the next meeting is tomorrow evening at six to meet quinn im to drive there alone it worked she said you were right i usually am wheres the meeting oh no he said i tell you youll tell ferguson and hell have some sas hit squad on my case no go hannah he smiled ill be all right girl dear go and do your bit with ferguson and ill have a shower damn you dillon but she knew better than to waste her breath in argument she left the room closing the door quietly behind her he stripped and went into the bathroom whistling cheerfully as he turned on the shower stood under it and watched the black dye run from his hair in most places in the world by the early seventies terrorism was a growing problem especially in britain because of the ira and in spite of the activities of the security services and scotland yard the prime minister of the day had decided drastic measures were needed and had set up an elite intelligence unit responsible to him alone and no one else brigadier charles ferguson had headed the unit since its inception had served every prime minister in office had no personal political allegiance he usually operated from an office on the third floor of the ministry of defence overlooking horse guards avenue but when hannah bernstein rang him on the red phone she was patched through to his flat in cavendish square bernstein brigadier dillon made contact with quinn no curtis daley dillon has a meeting tomorrow night at six he wont tell me where says he doesnt want you sending the heavy brigade in he has to drive there alone awkward sod ferguson said will quinn be there so it seems sir ferguson nodded catching him is the name of the game chief inspector some of these loyalist groups are now as big a threat as the ira quinn is certainly the most dangerous leader to be found amongst their rather numerous factions sons of ulster he grunted i mean my mother was irish but why do they have to be so damned theatrical dillon always says its the rain he would wouldnt he everythings a joke so what do you want me to do sir you do nothing chief inspector dillon wants to do things his own way as usual get close enough to quinn to put a bullet between his eyes let him get on with it but i wont have you in the line of fire you provide backup at the europa only if he pulls this thing off tomorrow night get him straight to aldergrove airport ill have the lear jet waiting to fly you to gatwick very well sir ill have to go ive got my weekly meeting with the prime minister at downing street in an hour hannah bernstein checked her makeup and hair then left her room and took the lift downstairs she went into the bar but there was no sign of dillon so she sat at a corner table he came in a few minutes later wearing a rollneck sweater donegal tweed jacket and dark slacks his hair washed clean of the black dye now so fair as to be almost white half a bottle of krug he called to the barman and joined her taking out an old silver case and lighting a cigarette still determined to take a few years off your life she said you never give up do you sweetheart his voice was humphrey bogart to perfection of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine damn you she laughed as the waiter brought the krug and opened it you could have a guinness instead after all youre in ireland no ill force a little champagne down good for you did you speak to ferguson oh yes i brought him right up to date and you can go to hell in your own way if it works the lear will be waiting at aldergrove and i get you straight out good he raised his glass heres to us are you free for dinner i cant think of anything else to do at that moment he noticed a poster by the bar good god grace browning he went over to inspect it and turned to the barman is it still playing dillon asked reverting to his english accent last night tomorrow sir could you get me a couple of tickets for tonights performance i think so but youll have to be sharp curtain up in forty minutes mind you the lyric isnt too far good man ring the box office for me i will mr friar dillon went back to hannah there you go girl dear grace brownings onewoman show shakespeares heroines shes brilliant i know ive seen her at the national theatre tell me dillon dont you ever get confused one minute sounding like youve been to eton the next belfastirish ah youre forgetting my true vocation was the theatre i went to the royal academy of dramatic art before grace browning did in fact i played the national theatre before she did lyngstrand in lady from the sea ibsen that was youve mentioned it several times since ive known you dillon she stood up lets get moving before that monumental ego of yours surfaces again ferguson s daimler was admitted through the security gates at the end of downing street and the front door of the most famous address in the world was opened to him instantly an aide took his coat and led the way up the stairs knocking on a door and ushering him into the study john major the british prime minister looked up and smiled ah there you are brigadier the week seems to have gone quickly ive asked simon carter deputy director of the security services to join us and rupert lang you know him i take it as an under secretary of state at the northern ireland office i thought he might have a useful contribution to make to our weekly consultation he serves on a number of government committees i have met mr lang prime minister like myself grenadier guards until he transferred to the parachute regiment yes fine record i know you dont care for simon carter and the security services dont care for you you know what they call you the prime ministers private army so i believe try and get along if only for my sake there was a knock at the door and two men entered ah come in gentlemen the prime minister said i believe you all know each other hello ferguson carter said frostily he was a small man in his fifties with snowwhite hair rupert lang was tall and elegant in a navyblue striped suit and guards tie hair rather long an intelligent aquiline face a restless air to him nice to see you again brigadier and you good sit down and lets get started the prime minister said they worked their way through a variety of intelligence matters for some forty minutes with particular reference to terrorist groups of various kinds and the new menace of arab fundamentalism in london the prime minister said im sure everyone tries but look at this group january how many have they killed in the last few years mr carter ten that we know of prime minister but theres a particular difficulty other groups have specific aims and targets january kill everybody kgb a cia man ira both here and in belfast even a notorious east end gangster all with the same weapon ferguson put in could that indicate just one individual it could but i doubt it carter said and the name is no help january was the date of bloody sunday but they kill amongst others members of the ira a puzzle the prime minister said which brings me to the downing street declaration he spoke about the governments discussions with sinn fein and the efforts so far unsuccessful to achieve a ceasefire it was rupert lang who said im afraid were going to have as many problems with the protestant factions from now on prime minister true carter said theyre killing just as many as the ira can we do anything about that the prime minister queried he turned to ferguson brigadier ferguson shrugged yes im conscious of the protestant loyalist problem yes but are your people doing anything about it carter said with some malice ferguson was nettled actually ive got dillon taking care of something rather special in that direction at this precise moment in time carter said so were back to that little ira swine rupert lang frowned dillon whos he ferguson hesitated go on tell him the prime minister said but this is top secret rupert of course prime minister sean dillon was born in belfast and went to school in london when his father came to work here ferguson said he had a remarkable talent for acting and a flair for languages he went to the royal academy of dramatic art for a year and then joined the national theatre ive never heard of him lang said you wouldnt dillons father went back to belfast on a visit and got caught in the middle of a firefight he was shot dead by paratroops dillon joined the ira and never looked back he became the most feared enforcer they had then what he became disenchanted with the glorious cause and switched to the international scene worked for everybody not only the plo but the israelis for money i presume oh yes he was behind the mortar attack on downing street during the gulf war that was for the iraquis good god carter broke in and he employs this man he also flew drugs into bosnia medical supplies for children the serbs held him under death sentence i did a deal with them and him he came to me slate wiped clean good heavens lang said set a thief to catch a thief the prime minister said hes been more than useful rupert saved the royal family from a dreadful scandal involving the duke of windsors involvement with the nazis then there was a rather tricky business involving hong kong but never mind that whats he up to now brigadier ferguson hesitated actually hes in belfast doing what ferguson hesitated again and the prime minister said impatiently come on man if you can tell anyone you can tell us all right ferguson said the deputy director wanted to know what were doing about protestant terrorism as you know there are numerous factions one of the worst call themselves the sons of ulster their leader is undoubtedly the most dangerous man on the loyalist side of things daniel quinn hes killed many times soldiers as well as ira and dares to use the word loyalist carter said yes i know about quinn the trouble is that he isnt just another thug ferguson replied hes astute cunning and a firstclass organizer dillon has been staying at the europa under the name of barry friar with my assistant detective chief inspector hannah bernstein he posed as an arms dealer for a paris outfit and met with quinns righthand man curtis daley tonight i know that name too carter said whats the point of all this the prime minister asked to draw quinn into the open and deal with him ferguson said you mean shoot him that is correct prime minister dillon has a meeting with quinn tomorrow at six all he would tell chief inspector bernstein was that he was to drive there alone wouldnt say where because he knew shed tell me and thought i might send in the heavy brigade arrogant bastard carter commented perhaps the prime minister nodded but he does seem to get results he closed the file in front of him youll keep me informed brigadier he stood up good night gentlemen as ferguson went to his daimler outside number ten carter paused on his way to his own car hell get you into trouble one of these days ferguson very probably ferguson said and turned to lang have you got a car or would you like a lift no thanks i feel like the exercise ill walk lang went out through the security gates and walked along whitehall he stopped at the first phone box and made a call after a while the phone was picked up at the other end belov oh good yuri glad i caught you at home rupert here somethings come up ill be straight round he put the phone down and hailed the first cab that came along two twenty minutes later he was ringing the bell of the small cottage in a mews off the bayswater road the door was opened within moments and belov stood there dressed in a navyblue pullover and slacks a small darkhaired man with a humorous mouth he was in his late fifties he motioned lang inside good to see you rupert he led the way into a small sitting room where a gas fire was burning cheerfully in the hearth this is nice lang said on a night like this a scotch would make it even better yes i should say so lang watched him get the drinks belov was senior cultural attaché at the soviet embassy just up the road a job which masked his true vocation as colonel in charge of the london station of the gru soviet military intelligence the kgbs great rivals he handed lang a glass cheers rupert how are you still having trouble with the kgb they keep changing their name these days belov smiled anyway what was so important ive just had one of my regular meetings with the prime minister simon carter and brigadier charles ferguson tell me does the name sean dillon mean anything to you oh yes belov said quite a character he was very big in the ira then moved on to the international scene ive the best of reasons for thinking he was behind the attack on downing street in ninetyone then brigadier charles ferguson got his hands on him belov smiled again you british really are devious bastards rupert whats it all about so lang told him and when he was finished belov said i know all about daniel quinn believe me my friend if the angloirish agreement and the downing street declaration really do bring sinn fein and the ira to the peace table you are going to have serious problems with the protestant factions well that seems to be the general opinion and thats why dillon hopes to meet quinn and eliminate him tomorrow night only one problem belov said my man at our embassy in dublin told me yesterday that quinn is in dublin en route for beirut under the alias of brown an associate of his named francis callaghan went to beirut last week do you know why there is a kgb involvement but i believe its a rather nefarious one some connection with gangsters from moscow what you call the russian mafia i understand an arab faction the party of god are also involved they make hezbolla look like a primary school outing but what could it be arms plenty of ways of getting arms these days something big thats all i know all right lang said lets look at this thing this man daley has arranged a meeting for dillon tomorrow to meet quinn only we know quinn wont be there what does that tell you that dillons cover is blown they intend to kill him my friend is that what you think will happen dillons reputation goes before him hes the original survivor in fact i would imagine he knows what hes doing which means you think hell survive this meeting possibly but more than that dillon is extremely astute what he wants is quinn now if he expects skulduggery he will also expect not only to survive it but to come out of it knowing quinns whereabouts beirut which is where charles ferguson will send him belov got up reached for the bottle of scotch and replenished the glasses and that would suit me we of the gru and the kgb dont hit it off too well these days they have a disturbing tendency to associate with the wrong people the moscow mafia for example which doesnt sit well with me id like to know what theyre up to with quinn in beirut id like to know very much which means it would suit you to have dillon on their case unquestionably then youd better pray he survives this meeting tomorrow night exactly belov nodded a great inconvenience if he didnt but i get the impression you have thoughts on this lang said you have your associates in belfast who could provide backup when necessary equipment and so on of course why do you ask tom curry is in belfast at the moment doing his monthly two or three days as a visiting professor at queens university by coincidence grace browning has been there doing her onewoman show at the lyric theatre how convenient isnt it dillon could have an invisible support system a phantom minder watching his back my dear rupert what a splendid idea only one thing if hes to be followed from the hotel they need to know what he looks like no problem i have his file at the embassy i can fax tom curry at his office at queens tonight he only needs to know its on its way and ill take care of that rupert lang raised his glass cheers old sport half an hour later professor tom curry at his office at queens university and working his way through a mass of papers cursed as his phone rang curry here he said angrily rupert are you alone well i would be old lad considering its ten oclock at night ive been hacking my way through exam papers but what brings you on ill be with you on sunday evening i know but this is important tom very important so listen well about half an hour later dillon and hannah bernstein returned to the europa they got their keys at the desk and she turned to him i really enjoyed that dillon she was wonderful but im tired i think ill go straight up sleep well he kissed her on the cheek i think ill have a nightcap she went to the lift and he went into the library bar which was reasonably busy and ordered a bushmills a moment later grace browning walked in with a man in an opennecked shirt tweed jacket and slacks he looked in his forties had brown hair and a pleasant rather amiable face they sat down at a corner table and were immediately approached by a woman whod been to the show dillon recognized the program grace browning signed it with a pleasant smile which she managed to retain even when a number of other people did the same thing finally the intrusions stopped and the waiter took a half bottle of champagne over and uncorked it dillon swallowed his bushmills crossed the room and paused not only a great actress but a woman of taste and discernment i see krug nonvintage the best champagne in the world she laughed really its the grape mix she hesitated then said this is my friend professor tom curry and you god save us that doesnt matter one damn bit our only connection is that like you i went to rada and did the odd thing for the national he laughed about a thousand years ago i just wanted to say thank you you were magnificent tonight he walked out she said what a charmer hes that all right curry said just have a look at the color fax belov sent me he opened an envelope took out a sheet and passed it across her eyes widened as she examined it good god yes staying here under the name of friar but in actuality sean dillon a thoroughly dangerous man let me tell you about him and more to the point what were going to do the following evening just after halffive dillon stood at the window of his suite drinking tea and looking out across the city rain was driving in and it was already dusk lights gleaming out there there was a knock on the door and he went and opened it hannah bernstein entered how are you fine the grand cup of tea they give you here cant you ever take anything seriously i could never see the point girl dear he opened a drawer took out a millimeter browning pistol with a silencer on the muzzle and slammed in a twentyround magazine dear god dillon you really are going to war exactly he slipped the browning into the waistband of his slacks at the rear pulled on a tweed jacket and his rain hat took another twentyround clip from the drawer and put it in his pocket he smiled and put his hands on her shoulders we who are about to die salute you a fella called suetonius wrote that about two thousand years ago youre forgetting i went to cambridge dillon i could give you the quote in latin she kissed him on the cheek try and come back in one piece jesus he said you mean you care theres still hope for me she punched him in the chest get out of here he walked to the door opened it and went out the rushhour traffic was already in place as he turned out of the europa car park and moved along victoria avenue he expected to be followed although monitored would be a better description it was difficult of course with all those cars but hed seen the motorcyclist in the black helmet and leathers turn out of the car park quite close behind him noticed the same machine keeping well back it was only when he turned down toward the waterfront through deserted streets of warehouses that he realized he was on his own ah well perhaps hed been mistaken you sometimes are old son he said and then a rover saloon turned out of a side turning and followed him here we go then dillon said softly at that moment a toyota saloon emerged from a lane in front of him and blocked the way dillon braked to a halt the man at the wheel of the rover stayed where he was the two men in the toyota jumped out carrying armalites out friar out one of them shouted dillons hand slipped under his coat and found the butt of the browning isnt that you martin mcgurk he said getting out of the car jesus and havent you got the wrong man remember me from derry in the old days he pulled off the rain hat to reveal his blond hair dillon sean dillon mcgurk looked stunned it cant be oh yes it can old son dillon told him bringing up the browning and firing through the open door knocking mcgurk on his back then swinging and shooting the man beside him through the head the man at the wheel of the rover pulled forward drew a pistol and fired through the open passenger window then put his head down and took off dillon fired twice at him shattering the rear window but the rover turned the corner and was gone there was quiet except for the steady splashing of the rain dillon walked round to the two men he had shot and examined them they were both dead there was a burst of armalite fire from somewhere above as he ducked an engine roared and the motorcycle he had noticed earlier passed him sliding sideways on the cobbles as it came to a halt he saw the blacksuited rider raise some sort of weapon he recognized the distinctive muted crack of a silenced ak a man fell from a platform high up in a warehouse on the other side of the street and bounced on the pavement the rider raised an arm in a kind of salute and rode off dillon stood there for only a moment then got in behind the wheel of his car and drove away leaving the carnage behind him he parked near the warehouse with the sign murphy son where he had first met daley as he turned the corner he saw the rover at the curb the big man jack mullin was standing by the judas gate peering inside as dillon watched mullin went into the warehouse dillon followed opening the gate cautiously the browning ready he could hear jack mullins agitated voice hes dead curtis shot twice in the back dillon moved quickly toward the office the door of which stood open he was almost there when mullin turned and saw him its friar he said and reached inside his coat dillon shot him knocking him back against the desk he slumped to the floor and daley got to his feet total panic on his face no daniel quinn dillon told him naughty that and you made another mistake its not barry friar its sean dillon dear god daley said so lets get down to business quinn where is he i cant tell you that its more than my life is worth i see dillon nodded all right i want you to watch something he reached and pulled mullin up a little the big man moaned are you watching dillon asked and shot him through the heart no for gods sake no daley cried you want to live then youll tell me where quinn is hes on his way to beirut daley gabbled francis callaghans been there for a while setting up a deal some arab group called the party of god and the kgb are going to start supplying us with arms daley shook his head plutonium daniel says well be able to cause the biggest bang ireland s ever seen really show those fenian bastards we mean business i see and where does all this take place i dont know dillon raised the browning and daley screamed its the truth i swear it daniel said hed be in touch all i know is callaghan is staying at a hotel called al bustan he was obviously telling the truth dillon said there that wasnt too hard old son was it he raised the browning very quickly and shot him between the eyes tumbling him back out of the chair then he turned and walked away no more than a mile away from garth dock where the shootings had taken place the motorcycle turned into a narrow side street and entered a yard driving straight into an open garage professor tom curry closed and barred the gate to the street then went into the garage the blackclad rider pushed the motorcycle up on its stand then turned and took off the helmet grace browning smiled pale and excited quite a night a good job i was there she unzipped her leather jacket and took out the ak butt folded what happened curry asked theyd set him up quite a man our mr dillon he killed two and shot up the second car they had an extra man up on a platform with an armalite he tried to shoot dillon i shot him end of story so i cleared off she was taking off the leathers as she spoke revealing jeans and a jumper she draped the leathers over the motorcycle just leave everything curry told her belovs people will clear up youve got my bag sure he handed her a holdall and she opened it and took out a light raincoat the cars parked not too far away in the main road he told her as he opened the side gate and left the yard do we claim credit for january on this curry asked well were entitled to one so why not the lot somehow i dont think dillon and the prime ministers private army would be happy to go public right ill phone the news desk at the belfast telegraph good she checked her watch just after seven well have to hurry curtain up at eight the lear jet with two raf pilots at the controls climbed steadily after lifting from aldergrove leveling off at thirty thousand feet hannah bernstein sat on one side of the aisle facing dillon who sat on the other he found the drawer containing the bar box the thermos of hot water he made coffee for her and tea for himself then took a miniature of scotch from the selection of drinks provided and poured it into his tea he drank it slowly and lit a cigarette all this had been done in silence now he spoke you havent said much its a lot to take in plutonium do they mean it its been available on the black market in russia for a while now it was always only a matter of time before some terrorist group or other had a go god help us all she sighed anyway how about you are you all right fine who do you think it was on the motorcycle i havent the slightest idea but they saved my bacon as we used to say in county down i wonder what gave you away oh that was me i told daley id known of quinn when he was on the run in londonderry but quinn used an alias there frank kelly i wanted to draw their fire she shook her head youre quite mad and this man mullin and curtis daley did you have to kill them its the business were in girl dear twentyfive years of war and for many of those years you fought for the ira yourself true i wasnt much more than a boy when my father was killed by british soldiers joining made sense to me then but the years go by hannah long weary years of slaughter and to what end that was then and this is now something clicked in my head one day put it any way you want he found himself another miniature of scotch as for daley three months ago he and quinn stopped a truckload of catholic roadworkers at glasshill lined them up on the edge of a ditch all twelve of them and machinegunned them so an eye for an eye he smiled gently straight out of the old testament id have thought a nice jewish girl like you would have approved he reached for the phone and now id better report in on the secure line ferguson always likes to hear bad news as soon as possible it was no more than an hour and a half later that ferguson was ushered into the prime ministers study at downing street simon carter and rupert lang were already seated you used words like urgent and gravest national importance brigadier so what have you got for us john major demanded so ferguson told them in finest detail when he was finished there was silence it was rupert lang who spoke first how extraordinary that january have claimed responsibility terrorist groups habitually claim credit for someone elses hit ferguson said and there is the business of the gunman on the motorcycle yes strange that carter said and yet you had no backup whatsoever did you absolutely not ferguson told him none of which is relevant now the prime minister said the really important thing that dillon has come up with is this possibility of the sons of ulster getting their hands on plutonium with the greatest respect prime minister simon carter said having plutonium is one thing producing some sort of nuclear device from it is quite another perhaps but if you have the money and the right kind of connections anything is possible ferguson shrugged you know as well as i that terrorist groups on the international circuit help each other out and since the breakdown of things in russia theres plenty of the right kind of technical assistance available on the world market there was another silence the prime minister drumming on the desk with his fingers finally he said the angloirish agreement and the downing street declaration are achieving results and president clinton is behind us fully twentyfive years of bloodshed gentlemen its time to stop if i may be a devils advocate rupert lang said thats all very well for sinn fein and the ira but the protestant loyalist factions will feel theyve been sold out i know that but theyll have to make some sort of accommodation like everyone else theyll continue the fight prime minister carter said gravely i accept that well just have to do our best to handle it machine guns by night are one thing even the semtex bomb but not plutonium that would add a totally new dimension im afraid youre right carter said the prime minister turned to ferguson so it would appear to be beirut next stop for dillon brigadier so it would if i recall the details on his file arabic was one of the numerous languages he speaks he should feel quite at home there he stood up thats all for now gentlemen keep me posted brigadier when ferguson reached his cavendish square flat the door was opened by his manservant kim an exghurka corporal who had been with him for years mr dillon and the chief inspector have just arrived brigadier ferguson went into the elegant drawing room and found hannah bernstein sitting by the fire drinking coffee dillon was helping himself to a bushmills from the drinks tray on the sideboard feel free with my whisky by all means ferguson told him oh i will brigadier and me knowing you to be the decent old stick that you are drop the stage irishman act boy weve got work to do now go over everything in detail again i suppose the strangest thing was the mystery motorcyclist dillon said as he finished no mystery there ferguson told him january have claimed responsibility for the whole thing someone phoned the belfast telegraph its already on all the tv news programs the dogs dillon said but how would they have known about the meet never mind that now weve more important things to consider its beirut for you my lad and you chief inspector not the easiest of places to operate in dillon said as i recall you managed it with perfect ease during the more unsavory part of your career true i also sank some plo boats in the harbor for the israelis and the plo have long memories anyway what would our excuse be for being there the united nations humanitarian division will do nicely irish and english delegates youll have to use aliases naturally and where will we stay hannah asked me darling there is only one decent hotel to stay these days in beirut dillon told her especially if youre a

in the money arent we all brigadier arent we all dillon smiled so lets get down to it and work out how were going to handle this thing it was just after eleven at the europa hotel when grace browning and tom curry finished late supper in the dining room and went into the bar it was quite deserted and the barman watching television came round to serve them what can i get you miss browning brandy i think two brandies he went away and tom curry said you were splendid tonight she took out a cigarette and he lit it for her to which performance are you alluding he shook his head thats all it is to you isnt it another performance he nodded ive never really seen it before but i think i do now on stage or before the camera its fantasy but roaring up to garth dock on that bike that was real and in those few moments of action i live more feel more and with an intensity that just cant be imagined you really are an extraordinary person he said the barman pouring the drinks called ive just seen the latenight news flash a real bloodbath three men shot dead at garth dock and three more not far away at some warehouse january has claimed thats bloody sunday so the dead men must be loyalists the prods will want to retaliate for that grace said dillon certainly doesnt take prisoners you can say that again the barman brought the brandies and served them with a flourish there you go he shook his head terrible all this killing i mean what kind of people want to do that kind of thing and he walked away grace browning turned to curry a slight smile on her face and toasted him well she said london belfast devon three if it began anywhere it began with tom curry who was professor of political philosophy at london university a fellow of trinity college cambridge and had in his time been a visiting professor at both yale and harvard he was also a major in the gru russian military intelligence born in in dublin into a protestant angloirish family his father a surgeon had died of cancer when curry was five leaving the boy and his mother in comfortable circumstances a fierce proud arrogant woman whose father had fought under michael collins in the original irish troubles she had been raised to blame everyone for the mess ireland had been left in after the english had partitioned the country and left she blamed the free state government as much as the ira like many wealthy young women of intellect at that period she saw communism as the only answer and as part of her brilliant sons education taught him that there was only one true faith the doctrine according to karl marx in at seventeen curry went to trinity college cambridge to study political philosophy where he met rupert lang an apparently effete aristocrat who never took anything seriously except tom curry for the bond was instant and for a lifetime and they enjoyed a homosexual relationship which lasted throughout their period at university they went their separate ways of course lang to sandhurst and the army following the family tradition and curry to the university of moscow to research for a phd on aspects of modern politics where he was promptly recruited by the gru they gave him the usual training in weaponry how to handle himself in the field and so on but told him that he would be regarded as a sleeper once back in england someone to be called on when needed no more than that on of january rupert lang having transferred from the grenadier guards was serving as a lieutenant in the parachute regiment in londonderry in northern ireland a day that would be long remembered as bloody sunday by the time the paratroopers had stopped firing thirteen people lay dead and there were many wounded including rupert lang who took a bullet in the arm whether from his own side or the ira he could never be sure on sick leave in london he had lunch at the oxford and cambridge club and was totally delighted when he went into the bar to find his old friend sitting in a window seat enjoying a quiet drink you old bastard how marvelous lang said i thought you were in russia oh im back now at trinity putting the thesis together curry nodded at langs arm why the sling lang had always been aware of his friends politics and he shrugged i dont expect youll want to speak to me bloody sunday i stopped a bullet you were there curry called to the barman for two bushmills how bad was it terrible not soldiering not the way i thought it would be lang accepted his whisky from the barman and raised his glass anyway to you old sport i cant tell you how good it is to see you that goes double curry toasted him back what are you going to do lang smiled you could always read me like a book yes im finished with the army as a career not straightaway my captaincys coming up and i want to keep the old man happy i see hes a minister at the home office now yes but his health isnt good i think hell stand down at the next election which will leave a vacancy for one of the safest conservative seats in the country curry said youre going to go into parliament why not ive all the money in the world so i dont need to work and ill walk into the seat if the old man steps down what do you think bloody marvelous curry stood up lets have a bite to eat and you can tell me all about bloody sunday and your irish exploits terrible business lang said as they walked through all hell going on at army intelligence hq at lisburn i heard the prime minister is going through the roof how interesting curry said as they sat down tell me more currys control was a thirtyfiveyearold gru major named yuri belov who was supposed to be a cultural attaché at the soviet embassy curry met him in a booth at a pub opposite kensington park gardens and the soviet embassy belov enjoyed london and had no great urge to be posted back to moscow which meant that he liked to look good to his superiors back there currys version of bloody sunday and his account of the sensory deprivation methods used to break ira prisoners at army headquarters at lisburn was just the sort of stuff belov wanted to hear excellent tom he said when curry was finished of course your friend has no idea youve been pumping him dry absolutely not curry said he knew what my politics were when we were at cambridge but hes an english aristocrat couldnt care less curry lit a cigarette and hes my best friend yuri lets get that clear of course tom i understand however anything further you can learn from him would always be useful he intends to leave the army soon curry said his fathers a minister of the home office i think rupert will step in when the old man leaves really yuri belov smiled a member of parliament now that is interesting yes well while were discussing whats interesting curry said what about me this is the first time weve spoken in nine months and im the one whos come to you id like to see a little action patience belov said thats what being a sleeper is its about waiting sometimes for many years until the time comes when you are needed a bloody boring prospect yes well spying usually is most of the time and after all youve got your work belov stood up hope to see you again soon tom but he didnt and it was to be fourteen years before they met again belov was transferred back home tom curry went to america harvard for five years yale for four before returning to cambridge where he became a fellow of trinity college rupert langs father died in office and lang promptly left the army and put himself forward for the seat in parliament winning with a record majority he and curry were as close as ever lang often spent vacations with him during the american period and curry always stayed when in london at langs beautiful town house in dean court close to westminster abbey and within walking distance of the houses of parliament in curry became a professor of political philosophy at london university and visiting professor at queens university belfast his mother had been dead for some time but he had his friendship with lang his work and the fact that due to his academic standing he had been invited to sit on a number of important government committees the arrangement made with yuri belov was so long ago that it might never have happened then one day out of the blue he received a telephone call at his office at the university belov had put on a little weight and there was a scar on his left cheek otherwise he had changed little the same sort of savile row suit the same genial smile they sat in a booth in the pub opposite kensington park gardens and shared half a bottle of sancerre the russian toasted curry good to see you tom and you what about the scar afghanistan a dreadful place you know those tribesmen skinned our men when they caught them but youre back now yes senior cultural attaché at the embassy but you must treat me with respect he grinned i am now a full colonel in the gru and head of station here in london you by the way have been promoted to major but i havent done anything curry said except sit on my arse for years you will tom you will all these government posts you hold particularly on the northern ireland committee and your friend lang hes doing well a government whip thats very important isnt it and i hear mrs thatcher likes him dont set too much store by that rupert doesnt take life too seriously he still isnt aware of your connection with us not a hint curry told him i prefer it that way now what do you want from now on full and intimate details of all those committee meetings especially irish affairs and anything to do with the activities of our arab friends and their fundamentalist groups all over london these days the english are far too liberal in letting them in anything else not for the moment belov stood up youre too valuable to waste on small things tom your day will come believe me just be patient he took out his wallet and passed over a slip of paper emergency numbers if you need me embassy and home ive a cottage in a mews just up the road ill be in touch he smiled and went out leaving curry more excited than hed been in years it was perhaps a year later on a wet october evening that curry received a phone call at the dean court town house lane was at the commons making sure in his capacity as a whip that as many conservative mps as possible were available to vote on a bill crucial to the government belov here the colonel said i must see you at once most urgent ill pick you up at the entrance to dean square curry didnt argue hed seen belov only twice in the previous year although in that time he had passed on a continuous stream of information it was raining hard outside so he found an old burberry trench coat a trilby hat and black umbrella and let himself out of the front door he stood by the entrance to the garden in dean square and within ten minutes a small renault car coasted in to the curb and belov leaned out over here tom curry climbed in beside him whats so important belov pulled out from the curb im supposed to meet an arab tonight in about thirty minutes from now at a place on the river in wapping who is this arab a man called ali hamid who has apparently fallen out with a fundamentalist group called wind of allah they gave us a lot of trouble in afghanistan this man is offering full documentation on their european operation the meeting place is called butler s wharf youll be at the river end at seven you give him that briefcase on the rear seat fifty thousand dollars hell give you a briefcase in return can you be sure all this is kosher curry asked the tip came from a colleague colonel boris ashimov of the kgb head of station here in london why doesnt he handle this himself why this gift to you strictly speaking its none of their business division of labor the arabs are a gru matter and i cant go myself for the simplest of reasons im hosting an embassy cultural evening at the savoy im due there in thirty minutes notice the black tie very capitalistic curry told him shame on you all right ill do it he reached for the briefcase and belov pulled in at the curb you can get a cab from here ill be in touch curry got out and watched the renault drive away then he put up his umbrella and moved along the pavement it was no more than thirtyminutes later that a cab dropped him in wapping the rain was very heavy now no one about he found butler s wharf with no difficulty walked to the end and stood by an oldfashioned street lamp the umbrella up against the rain which poured down relentlessly there was the faintest of footfalls behind him the arab wore a black reefer coat of the kind used by seamen and a tweed cap his brown face was gaunt his eyes pinpricks as if he was on something curry felt a certain alarm ali hamid who are you the man asked in a hoarse voice colonel belov sent me but he was to come himself hamid laughed in a strange way it was all arranged it was belov i was paid to kill but instead you are here he laughed again and there was a kind of foam on his mouth unfortunate his hand came out of his right pocket holding a silenced beretta automatic pistol and curry swung the briefcase knocking the arabs arm to one side and closing with him he grabbed the mans wrist the gun between them was aware of it going off a kind of punch in his left arm strangely it gave him even more strength and he struggled harder aware of the beretta discharging twice hamid dropping it and falling back clutching his stomach he lay there under the lamp legs kicking then went very still curry crouched and felt for a pulse but hamid was dead eyes staring curry stood and examined his arm there was a scorched hole in the burberry and blood seeping through there wasnt too much pain although he suspected that would come later he eased off the burberry tied a handkerchief awkwardly around the arm over his jacket sleeve then pulled the raincoat on again he picked up the beretta opened the briefcase and slipped it inside he retrieved his umbrella and stood looking down at hamid a lot to be explained but no time for that now he had to get moving surprising how calm he felt as he hurried along the wharf hardly sensible to take a taxi it was going to be a long walk to the town house in dean close and how in the hell was he going to explain this to rupert he turned into wapping high street and hurried along the pavement aware of the pain now in his arm rupert lang returned from parliament only fifteen minutes earlier was pouring a large scotch in the drawing room when the front doorbell sounded he swallowed some of the whisky put down his glass and went into the hall when he opened the door curry almost out on his feet fell into his arms tom what is it quite simple old lad ive been shot get me into the kitchen before i bleed all over your best carpet lang got an arm round him helped him into the kitchen and eased him into a chair curry tried to get his burberry off and lang helped him dear god tom your sleeves soaked in blood yes well it would be lang reached for a towel and wrapped it around the arm ill call an ambulance no you wont old lad ive just killed a man lang on his way to the door stopped and turned youve what arab terrorist called ali hamid tried to kill me thats when i stopped the bullet took a couple himself in the struggle i left him on butler s wharf in the rain its all right no one saw me and i didnt get a cab on the way back long bloody walk i can tell you curry managed a smile a large whisky and a cigarette would help lang went out and returned with a glass and a bottle of scotch he poured handed the glass over and found a packet of cigarettes as he gave curry a light he said i think youd better tell me whats going on tom curry said weve been friends a long time best of friends rupert lang said no ones known me better than you old lad and ive always been honest you know my politics of course i do lang said comes the revolution youll take me out and have me shot with great regret of course just one thing i never told you and whats that curry swallowed the scotch and held out the glass for another lets see you were a captain in one para when you retired thats right lang poured more whisky well the thing is old lad i outrank you im a major in russian military intelligence the gru lang paused in pouring then carefully replaced the cap on the bottle you old bastard he was smiling suddenly excited how long has this been going on ever since moscow thats when they recruited me shades of philby burgess and maclean lang put the bottle down and lit a cigarette himself he paced around the kitchen full of energy tell me everything tom not only what happened tonight everything when curry finished talking he tried to stand up so you see much better if i get out of here lang pushed him down dont play silly bastards with me although i must say you have done my god all that stuff from the northern ireland office going to our russian friends dammit tom i sat on one of those committees with you i know isnt it terrible curry said you say belovs at the savoy thats right good im going to ring him up he can sort this mess out for you after all its his kind of business he reached for the kitchen phone curry said for gods sake old lad you cant afford to get involved just let me go i shouldnt have come back here only a guest after all it was as if he was losing consciousness not your affair oh yes it is rupert lang wasnt smiling now he ran a hand over currys head rest easy tom ill handle it he rang through to the savoy and asked that colonel yuri belov come to the phone urgently rose house nursing home was a discreet establishment in holland park it had once been the town mansion of some turnofthecentury millionaire and stood in two acres of gardens behind high walls in a lounge area on the second floor belov and rupert lang drank coffee and waited finally a door opened and a small cheerful indian walked in in green surgical robes this is dr joel gupta the principal of this establishment belov said to lang how is he joel very lucky the beretta fires millimeter parabellum at close quarters enough to take a mans arm off it only chipped the bone passed through flesh hell be fine but i want him in for a week when can we see him belov asked hes woozy right now give him half an hour then five minutes only ill see you later gupta went out lang said he seems on your side i knew him in afghanistan belov said helped him come to england dont get the wrong impression he helps me out on the odd occasion most of the time he specializes in drug addiction does fine work so what went wrong tonight lang asked my dear man do you really want to get into this any more than you have to im already up to my ears lang said and tom curry is the best friend i have in the world but youre in the government so and curry like me is a committed communist we believe that we are right and you are wrong but i often am lang told him im sure youll lead me to the guillotine when the moment arrives but i take friendship seriously so what about tom what went wrong colonel boris ashimov went wrong hes head of station at the london embassy for the kgb as you know gru is military intelligence and we have our differences i hadnt realized how deep they were until tonight he set you up rupert lang said so it would appear if it hadnt been for the savoy affair id have gone personally but instead poor old tom takes the bullet rupert lang wasnt smiling his eyes glittered there was a wolfish look to his face i took a bullet myself once not nice of course belov said one para bloody sunday you were a lieutenant then just then a nurse appeared hes surfaced you can go in now if you like curry managed a weak smile still here am i for a long time yet rupert lang told him curry turned to belov what went wrong yuri it would appear ashimov set me up ali hamid was supposed to knock me off unfortunately i sent you for you that is not for me however we must cover the trail as much as possible give an explanation for hamids death hes a known terrorist both scotland yard and mi will find that out soon enough what would you suggest lang asked someone should claim credit for his death belov nodded that would take care of things nicely like the provisional ira curry demanded no something new something to confuse them all you mean an entirely new terrorist group rupert lang asked why not belov smiled bloody sunday wasnt that january what if i put a call through to the times claiming credit for hamids killing on behalf of january that would certainly give the antiterrorist units at every level something to chew on rather like that greek group we read about lang said november yes i like it should muddy the waters nicely of course belov said you see mr lang because of the cause i serve and tom here chaos is my main interest in life fear uncertainty and chaos i want to create as much of all these things as possible in the western world then gradually the cracks begin to show and finally the system breaks down ireland for example we dont take sides but we do actively help to keep the whole rotten mess going a civil war a descent into madness and then our friends and there are many in ireland take over another cuba only in britain s backyard lang said interesting ive been very frank belov said but it doesnt seem to bother you very little in this life does old sport fine ill take care of this january thing then it was curry who said and who takes care of ashimov hes got to kill you now yuri no choice yes someone should sort that bastard out rupert lang opened the briefcase beside the bed and took out the beretta he said to belov fifty thousand dollars in there i believe its yours ill keep the beretta just tell me where and when there was a moments silence and curry said you cant be serious lang smiled that strange wolfish smile again i killed three people on bloody sunday tom and two others elsewhere during my service in ulster never told you that secrets you see just like you he turned to belov another job for january first this arab then the station head of the kgb in london that should really make the security services squirm and i should know im on half the committees he killed colonel boris ashimov with absurd simplicity a week later on a rainy morning in kensington gardens belov had timed it for him every morning at ten ashimov walked in the gardens whatever the weather on that particular thursday it was raining heavily rupert lang enjoying a coffee in a café opposite kensington park gardens was not expecting ashimov to appear but the man carrying an umbrella over his head filled the description belov had given him ashimov turned into the bayswater road and entered the gardens lang got to his feet and went after him he followed him along the path keeping well back his own umbrella raised there was no one about they reached a clump of trees at the center of the gardens and lang quickened his pace excuse me ashimov turned what do you want you actually rupert lang said and shot him twice in the heart the silenced beretta making only a slight coughing sound he leaned down and put another bullet between ashimovs eyes then put the beretta in his raincoat pocket moved rapidly across the gardens to queens gate crossed to the albert hall and walked on for a good half mile before hailing a cab and telling the driver to take him to westminster he lit a cigarette and sat back shaking with excitement he had never felt like this in his life before not even in the paras in ireland every sense felt keener even the colors when he looked out at the passing streets seemed sharper but the excitement the damned excitement he closed his eyes my god old sport whats happening to you he murmured he arrived at the st stephens entrance to the commons went through the central lobby to his office and got rid of his umbrella and raincoat and put the beretta in his safe then went down to the entrance to the house and passed the bar there was a debate taking place on some social services issue he took his usual seat on the end of one of the aisles when he looked up he saw tom curry seated in the front row of the strangers gallery his left arm in a sling lang nodded up to him folded his arms and leaned back half an hour later the london times news desk received a brief message by telephone in which january claimed credit for the assassination of colonel boris ashimov in the three years which followed curry maintained a steady flow of confidential information of every description aided by lang they made only three hits during the period two at the same time a couple of ira bombers released from trial at the old bailey on a legal technicality who proceeded on a drunken spree that lasted all day it was curry who charted their progress until midnight then called in lang who killed them both as they sat backs to the wall in a drunken stupor in a kilburn alley the third was an american field officer of the cia attached to the american embassys london station he had been giving belov considerable aggravation and after the berlin wall came down appeared to be far too friendly with the russians latest rival mikhail shimko who had replaced ashimov as colonel in charge of london station kgb the cia man was called jackson and by chance his name came up at one of the joint intelligence working parties news that he was having a series of meetings at an address in holland park with members of a ukrainian faction resident in london curry kept a watch at the appropriate times and noticed that jackson always walked for a mile afterwards following the same route through quiet streets to the main road where he hailed a taxi after the next meeting lang was waiting in a small ford van at an appropriate point on the route provided by belov of course as jackson passed lang wearing a knitted ski mask in black stepped out and shot him once in the back penetrating the heart finished with a head shot got in the van and drove away he left the van in a builders yard in bayswater again an address provided by belov and walked away whistling softly to himself it was half an hour later that a young reporter on the news desk of the london times took the phone call claiming credit for the killing by january the british government allowed the americans to flood london temporarily with cia agents intent on hunting down jackson s killer as usual they drew a complete blank that the killings claimed by january from ali hamid onwards had been the work of the same beretta millimeter was known to everyone as was the significance of january the bloody sunday connection should have indicated an irish revolutionary connection but even the ira got nowhere in their investigations in the end the cia presence was withdrawn british army intelligence scotland yards antiterrorist department mi all failed to make headway even the redoubtable brigadier charles ferguson head of the special intelligence unit responsible to the prime minister had only total failure to report to downing street it was in january following the collapse of the communistdominated government of east germany that lang and curry attended a cultural evening at the american embassy there were at least a hundred and fifty people there including belov whom they found at the champagne bar they took their glasses into an anteroom and found a corner table so everythings falling apart for you people yuri lang said first the wall comes tumbling down now east germany folds and a little bird tells me theres a strong possibility that your congress of peoples deputies might soon abolish the communist partys monopoly of power in russia belov shrugged disorder leads to strength its inevitable take the german situation west germany is at present the most powerful country in western europe economically the consequences of taking east germany on board will be catastrophic in every way and particularly economically the balance of power in europe once again altered totally remember what i said a long time ago chaos is our business i suppose youre right when you come to think of it lang said curry nodded of course he is i invariably am belov raised his glass to a new world my friends and to us one never knows whats round the corner i know rupert lang said thats what makes it all so damned exciting they touched glasses and drank four rupert lang was more right than he knew there was something round the corner something profound and disturbing that was to affect all three of them although it was not to take place until the gulf war was over and done with january to be precise grace browning was born in washington in her father was a journalist on the washington post her mother was english when she was twelve tragedy struck devastating her life on the way home from a concert one night their car was rammed into the curb by an old limousine the men inside were obviously on drugs she remembered the shouting the demands for money her father opening the door to get out and then the shots one of which penetrated the side window at the rear and killed her mother instantly grace lay in the bottom of the car frozen terrified glancing up only once to see the shape of a man gun raised shouting go go go and then the old limousine shot away she wasnt even able to give the police a useful description couldnt even say whether they were white or black all that mattered was that her father died the following morning and she was left alone not quite of course for there was her mothers sister her aunt martha lady hunt to be precise a woman of considerable wealth and widowed early who lived in some splendor in a fine town house in cheyne walk in london she had received her niece with affection and firmness for she was a tough practical lady who believed you had to get on with it instead of sitting down and crying grace was admitted to st paul s girls school one of the finest in london where she soon proved to have considerable intellect she was popular with everyone teachers and pupils alike and yet for her it was a sort of performance inside she was one thing herself detached cold but on the surface she was charming intelligent warm it was not surprising that she was something of a star in school drama circles her social life because of her aunt was conducted at the highest level cannes and nice in the summer barbados in the winter always a ceaseless round of parties on the london scene when she was sixteen like most of the girls she knew she attempted her first sexual encounter a gauche seventeenyearold public schoolboy it was less than rewarding and as he climaxed a strange thing happened she seemed to see in her head the shadowy figure of the man who had killed her parents gun raised when the time came for grace to leave school although her academic grades were good enough for oxford or cambridge she had only one desire to be a professional actress her aunt being the sort of woman she was supported her fully stipulating only that grace had to go for the best so grace auditioned for the royal academy of dramatic art and they accepted her at once her career there was outstanding in the final play macbeth she played lady macbeth absurdly young and yet so brilliant that london theatrical agents clamored to take her on board she turned them all down and went to chichester to the smallest of the two theatres the minerva to play the lead in a revival of anna christie and so triumphantly that the play transferred to the london west end the theatre royal at the haymarket where it ran for a year after that she could have everything the royal shakespeare company the national theatre establishing herself in a series of great classic roles she went to hollywood only once to star in a classy and flashy revenge thriller in which she killed several men after that she turned down all subsequent offers except for the occasional tv appearance and returned to the national theatre money of course was no problem aunt martha saw to that and took great pride in her nieces achievements she was the one person grace felt loved her and she loved her fiercely in return dropping out of theatre totally for the last terrible year when leukemia took its hold on the old woman martha came home at the end to die in her own bed the windows of her room looking over the thames there was medical help in abundance but grace looked after her every need personally on the last evening it was raining beating softly against the windows she was holding her aunts hand and martha gaunt and wasted opened her eyes and looked at her youll go back now promise me and show them all what real acting is about its what you are my love promise me of course grace said no sad tears no mourning a celebration to prove how worthwhile its been she managed a weak smile i never told you grace but your father always believed the family tradition that they were kin to robert browning the poet grace said yes theres a line in one of his great poems our interests on the dangerous edge of things i dont know why but it seems to suit you perfectly her eyes closed and she died a few minutes later she was healthy now the house in cheyne walk was hers and the world of theatre was her oyster but no one could control her no one could hold her her wealth meant that she could do what she wanted her first role on her return was in look back in anger with an obscure south coast repertory company in a seaside town the critics descended from london in droves and were ecstatic after that she did a range of similar performances at various provincial theatres finally returning to the national theatre to do chekhovs a month in the country no longterm contracts no ties she had set a pattern if a part interested her she would play it even if it was for four weeks at some obscure civic theatre in the heart of lancashire or some london fringe theatre venue such as the kings head or the old red lion and the audiences everywhere loved her love in her own life was a different story there were men of course when the mood came but no one who ever moved her in male circles in the theatre she was known as the ice queen she knew this but it didnt dismay her in the slightest amused her if anything and her actors gift for analysis of a role told her that if anything she had a certain contempt for men in october she did brendan behans the hostage at the minerva studio at chichester still her favorite theatre it was a short run but such was the interest in this most irish of plays that the company was invited to the lyric theatre belfast for a twoweek run unfortunately grace was scheduled to start rehearsals at the national for a winters tale immediately after her stint at the minerva and so the director of the hostage came to see her in some trepidation the lyric belfast would like us for two weeks of course ill have to say no i mean you start rehearsing monday at the national belfast she said ive never been i like the sound of that but the national he protested oh they can put things on the back burner for a couple of weeks she smiled that famous smile of hers that seemed to be for you alone or get someone else she indulged herself by staying at the europa hotel she stood at the window of her suite and looked out at the rain driving in across the city suddenly excited to be here surely one of the most dangerous cities in the world it was only four oclock and she was not due at the lyric until sixthirty on impulse she went downstairs at the main entrance the head doorman smiled a taxi miss browning posters advertising the play with her photo on them were on a stand close by she gave him her best smile no i just need some fresh air and i like the rain plenty of that in belfast miss better take this and he put up an umbrella for her she started toward the bus station and the protestant stronghold of sandy row feeling suddenly cheerful as a bitter east wind blew in from belfast lough tom curry always stayed at the europa during his monthly visits as visiting professor at queens university he liked belfast the sense of danger the thought that anything might happen sometimes his visits coincided with rupert langs for lang was now an extra under secretary of state at the northern ireland office which meant frequent visits to ulster on crown business and this was one of them he arrived back at the europa at fivethirty went into the library bar and found tom curry seated at one end reading the belfast telegraph a bushmills in front of him curry glanced up hello old lad had a good day bloody raining every time i come to belfast lang nodded to the barman same as my friend you dont like it much do you curry said i went through hell here tom back in seventytwo close to six hundred dead in one year bodies under the rubble for days the stink of explosions i can still smell it he raised his glass to you old sport curry toasted him back as the fenians say may you die in ireland thanks very much lang smiled mind you you cant fault them on their attitude to culture here he nodded behind the bar where graces poster was displayed curry said grace browning shes wonderful strange choice of a play for belfast though the hostage very ira nonsense lang said behan showed the absurdity of the whole thing even though he was in the ira himself at that moment grace browning entered as she unbuttoned her raincoat a waiter hurried to take it she walked to the bar and rupert lang said good god its grace browning hearing him she turned and gave him that famous smile hello may i introduce myself he asked she frowned slightly you know i feel ive met you before curry laughed no youve occasionally seen him on the television under secretary of state at the northern ireland office rupert lang im impressed she said and you tom curry lang said hes just a rotten old professor of political philosophy at london university visiting professor here at queens once a month can we offer you a drink why not a glass of white wine just one ive got to give a performance lang gave the order to the barman weve seen you many times together oh yes he smiled tom and i go back a long way cambridge thats nice she sipped her wine there was something about them she sensed it something unusual are you coming to the show tonight didnt realize it was on curry said only here for three days dont suppose there are any tickets left ill leave you two of my tickets at the box office she said it was a challenge instantly taken up oh youre on lang said wonderful she swallowed the rest of the wine good ill have to love you and leave you hope you enjoy it she went out curry turned to lang and they toasted each other by the way curry said are you carrying of course i am lang told him if you think im going to walk the streets of belfast without a pistol youre crazy as a minister of the crown i have my permit tom no problems with security at the airports the beretta curry asked but of course lucky for us id say curry shook his head its just a game to you isnt it a wild exciting game exactly old sport but then life can be such a bore now drink up and lets go and get ready and grace browning was wonderful no doubt about it received a rapturous reception from the packed house at the end of the play curry and lang went into the bar for a drink and debated whether to go round and see her it was lang who said i think not old sport probably lots of locals doing exactly that well go back to the europa and have a nightcap at the bar she may well look in you like her dont you curry said so do you curry smiled lets get the car and they went out on their way back to the hotel curry who was driving turned into a quiet road between several factories and warehouses deserted at night lang put a hand on his arm as they passed a woman walking rapidly along the pavement an umbrella up against the rain good god its her the damned fool curry said she cant walk around the back streets of belfast like that on her own pull in to the curb lang said ill get her curry did so lang opened the car door and saw two young men in bomber jackets run up behind grace browning and grab her he heard her cry out and then they hustled her into an alley grace wasnt afraid just angry with herself for having been such a fool on a high after her performance shed thought that the walk back to the hotel in the rain would calm her down she should have known better this was uncharted territory belfast the war zone they hustled her to the end of the alley where there was a dead end a jumble of packing cases under an old street lamp bracketed to a wall she stood facing them what do you want english is it the one with a ponytail laughed unpleasantly we dont like the english the other who wore a tweed cap said theres only one thing we like about english girls and thats whats between their legs so lets be having you he leapt on her and she dropped the umbrella and tried to fight back as he forced her across the packing case yanking up her dress let me go damn you she clawed at his face disgusted by the whisky breath aware of him forcing her legs open thats enough rupert lang called through the rain the man in the tweed cap turned and grace pushed him away the one with the ponytail turned too as lang and curry approached just let her go curry said you made a mistake lets leave it at that youd better keep out of this friend the man in the tweed cap told him this is provisional ira business really rupert lang replied well im sure martin mcguinness wouldnt approve hes a family man they were all very close together now there was a moment of stillness and then the one in the ponytail pulled a smith wesson from the pocket of his bomber jacket rupert langs hand came up holding the beretta and shot him twice in the heart at the same moment the man in the tweed cap knocked grace sideways so that she fell he picked up a batten of wood and struck lang across the wrist so that he dropped the beretta the man scrambled for it but it slid on the damp cobbles toward grace she picked it up instinctively held it against him and pulled the trigger twice blowing him back against the wall she stood there legs apart holding the gun in both hands staring down at him and rupert lang said give it to me is he dead she asked in a calm voice if not he soon will be lang took the beretta and shot him between the eyes he turned to the one with the ponytail and did the same always make sure now lets get out of here he picked up the umbrella yours i think curry took one arm lang the other and they hustled her away no police she said this is belfast curry told her another sectarian killing they said they were ira didnt they but were they she demanded as they took her down to the car and pushed her into the rear probably not my dear rupert lang said nasty young yobs cashing in lots of them about never mind curry told her theyll be heroes of the revolution tomorrow especially if january claims credit rupert lang lit a cigarette and passed it to her even if you dont use these things you could do with one now she accepted it strangely calm do you need a doctor no he didnt penetrate me if thats what you mean good curry said then a hot bath and a decent nights sleep and put it out of your mind it didnt happen oh yes it did she said and tossed the cigarette out of the window when they reached the europa lang a hand on graces arm started toward the lifts she said actually id like a nightcap lang frowned then nodded fine he turned to curry better make the call tom then he led her into the library bar a few minutes later the phone rang on the desk of the night editor at the belfast telegraph when he picked it up a gruff voice said carrick lane got that youll find a couple of provo bastards on their backs there we wont be sending flowers who is this the night editor demanded january the phone went dead the night editor stared at it frowning then hurriedly dialed his emergency number to the royal ulster constabulary curry joined them in the bar at a corner table they were drinking brandy and there was a glass for him lang said you seem rather calm considering the circumstances you mean why am i not crying and sobbing because i just killed a man she shook her head he was a piece of filth he deserved everything he got i loathe people like that when i was twelve i was driving back from a concert in washington one night with my parents we were attacked by armed thugs my parents were killed she sat staring down into her glass and curry said gently im sorry lang said you handled the gun surprisingly well have you had much training she laughed one hollywood movie just one i didnt like it out there there were a few scenes where i had to use a gun they showed me how she finished the brandy and raised the empty glass to the barman three more she smiled tightly i hope you dont mind but we do seem to be rather tied in together dont we yes you could say that curry told her she turned to lang as the barman brought the brandies and waited until hed gone you said in the car something about january claiming credit ive read about them theyre some sort of terrorist group thats right lang said of course in this sort of case revolutionaries and so on all sorts of groups like to claim credit very useful fact of life were just making sure somebody does ive already spoken to the night desk at the belfast telegraph curry said by tomorrow youll find the ulster freedom fighters or the red hand of ulster claiming credit also theyre protestant loyalist factions but youd prefer january to get the credit she said there was a moment of silence it was lang who said youre a remarkably astute young woman is there a problem here not in the slightest as i said it would seem were tied together in this invisible bonds and all that exactly she opened her handbag took out a card and passed it to him thats my address and phone number cheyne walk ill be back in london in twelve days perhaps we could meet i think you can count on that she stood up youll have to excuse me now i have a matinee tomorrow she walked out curry said my god what a woman yes quite remarkable you know tom i think this is going to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship when she put out the light and pulled up the covers grace browning lay there strangely calm staring up through the darkness looking for him the shadowy figure with the gun in his hand but he seemed to have gone she closed her eyes and slept it was four weeks later that rupert lang received a call from her in response to a message he had left on her answering phone a week earlier sorry i havent called you before she said but some friends had a problem at cross little theatre in the lake district they had a week unexpectedly vacant someone let them down so i went up and did my onewoman show that sounds interesting no big deal shakespeares heroines that sort of thing can we meet toms in town i thought we could have dinner that sounds fine you could come here for drinks first sixthirty suit you smashing well look forward to it at the cheyne walk house she opened the door to them herself she wore a deceptively simple armani trouser suit in black crepe and her black hair was tied at the back of the neck with a velvet bow rupert lang took her hands you look fabulous thats a bit over the top she said not at all he kissed her on both cheeks dont you think she looks fabulous tom curry took her hand briefly dont mind rupert extravagant in everything they went through into a panelled drawing room it was furnished in victorian style dark velvet drapes at the windows a basket fire on the hearth four paintings by atkinson grimshaw on the walls my goodness theyre worth a bob or two curry said as he inspected them she took a bottle of champagne from an ice bucket and rupert lang moved in fast allow me yes she said my aunt loved grimshaw loved everything victorian lady martha hunt to be precise she raised me from the age of twelve when my parents were killed this house was her pride and joy rupert lang poured the champagne i remember her husband sir george hunt merchant banker in the city my father used to do business with him he died before i arrived she said and martha only the other year im truly sorry she went and opened the french windows a cold february night outside a slight drizzle some fog and some barge traffic their red and green lights clear in the murk as they passed downriver i love the thames at night heart of the city lang said lovely to see you he raised his glass now what shall we drink to why not january she said i read about that in the belfast telegraph i also noticed just as you said that some protestant terrorist organizations also claimed credit she moved to the fire and sat down in a wingbacked chair and those two thugs were ira after all there were details of their military funerals lang and curry sat on the long sofa opposite her thats right curry said irish tricolor on the coffin black beret and gloves neatly arranged weeping relatives lots of women in black lang said always looks good keeps the glorious cause going and you dont approve only one solution the british army should leave but that would lead to civil war and total anarchy exactly but this time wed build from the ashes a new state entirely curry said run on the political lines he approves of lang told her which is marxistleninist to the core i should warn you tom is the communist equivalent of a jesuit he went and got the bottle of champagne and replenished their glasses ive looked you up she told curry mentioned you to one or two people all i heard was that you were a brilliant academic who serves on all sorts of government committees not a hint of this marxistleninist thing well thank god for that curry said she turned to lang you were easier i just asked my press agent to check the newspaper libraries it would appear from the dates that you two were at cambridge together afterwards you served briefly in the grenadier guards and transferred to one para rather a notorious outfit bloody sunday and all that so they tell me you served again in ireland before leaving the army when your father died interesting there was only one mention of your military cross and that was tucked away in a decoration list in the times no reason for the award given and you never mention it not even in election speeches natural modesty lang smiled you never even told me curry said secrets again old sport we all have them i certainly do i killed a man grace said perhaps not i was the one who made sure with both of them i killed him she said i know it and so do you has it given you a problem coming to terms with it curry asked not really looking back it seems to have been like a performance in a play or film and it merges into all my other performances she shook her head heaven knows what a psychiatrist would make of that and anyway those men were scum exactly lang said there was as the courts put it reasonable cause a good point she said i got all the press cuttings on january there was ali hamid an arab terrorist a kgb colonel called ashimov two ira bombers some silly judge released an american here in london reputed to be a cia agent and now our two friends in belfast id say the one weak link would be the american i see curry said you accept the killing of the kgb colonel but the cia man is a different proposition i see the logic in what youre saying i suppose its a question of your point of view she finished her champagne and put the glass down on a side table of course it didnt take the authorities long to work out that january was the date of bloody sunday in londonderry and you were there mr lang interesting coincidence rupert he said please yes i was there along with a couple of thousand soldiers and large numbers of ira supporters there was a long silence she opened a silver cigarette box and took one out lang gave her a light and she blew out a feather of smoke why do you do it do what exactly lang asked i mean just because we arrived in that alley at an opportune moment and as a minister of the crown on service in ulster i do have a permit to carry a weapon a silenced beretta millimeter parabellum she said in all the newspaper reports they constantly mention the fact that all january hits have been committed with the same weapon many people think of it as the best handgun in the world these days lang said the american army uses it thousands of them around she opened a drawer in the side table and took out a newspaper clipping this is the belfast telegraph report on the deaths of those two animals in carrick lane they state that the credit for the killings claimed by january is substantiated by the forensic tests on the rounds removed from the bodies indicating that they were killed by the same weapon used to assassinate the other victims a beretta millimeter silenced version amazing what they can do these days lang said the scientific people i mean curry emptied his glass what are you going to do turn us in dont be stupid tom id be turning myself in however much a good lawyer tried to argue my case no i havent the slightest intention of doing that but one thing i would like to know why do you do it for me its simple curry said ive been a marxistleninist since boyhood its my faith my religion if you like i think the world needs to change and communism is the answer yes but change comes out of chaos and anarchy which is where we come in and you she said to lang well life can be such a bloody bore helps to have a little excitement once in a while rupert never takes anything seriously curry told her lang smiled all right father she can play good women or bad great queens murderers the worst harlot in the world now thats really getting your rocks off he turned to grace but it isnt enough is it and never will be you bastard she said you clever clever bastard but im right youd like to join in she sat there looking at him and for a moment had a quick glimpse of that shadowy figure in washington gun raised high and her stomach crawled with excitement it was two weeks later that curry turned up at the old red lion a pub fringe theatre where she was doing her onewoman show for a week she was sharing a cramped little dressing room with two young girls acting as assistant stage managers he glanced in and found her putting on jeans hello its me he said tom how nice how was i dreadful bastard she said only sometimes are you free for a chinese why not an hour later working their way through a third or fourth course she said its lovely to see you but to what do i owe the honor we saw that interview on you in the stage all about you having a month off after finishing this show until you start macbeth for the royal shakespeare company so theres a parliamentary break so ruperts free and i have nothing on the thing is rupert has this old hunting lodge in devon lang place been in his family for years moors shooting all that kind of stuff on dartmoor my dear tom the only time anybody bothers to go there for the shooting is august when the birds do their usual stupid thing and deer culling is so rigid these days that its hardly worth the effort so whats it all about he paused while crispy duck and pancakes were served the shooting could be fun all kinds of shooting i know rupert might seem your effete aristocrat but he knows his stuff when it comes to weaponry she nodded that does sound interesting anything else he paused looking at her then sighed youve heard of kim philby burgess maclean oh yes didnt they all go to cambridge too and work for russia yes well they all had rank in the kgb im a major in the gru thats russian military intelligence my boss would like to meet you and who might that be colonel yuri belov she started to laugh but i know him when i did chekhovs three sisters last year the soviet embassy gave us a reception he was chief cultural attaché or something or something curry said with an apologetic smile she laughed again all right when do we leave and she was glad shed gone rupert had a twinengined navajo chieftain pick them up from an airfield in surrey and the flight to an old world war two raf landing strip near okehampton only took an hour here a man with a weatherbeaten face was waiting for them he introduced himself as george farne and escorted them to a range rover after a halfhour drive through wonderful moorland scenery and forest they reached a wooded valley and saw lang place it appeared to be eighteenth century with tall chimneys and an ornate garden behind high walls when they pulled up at the steps below the front door rupert lang came out wearing jeans and a sweater an irish wolfhound at his heels he came down the steps and took graces hands you look wonderful as usual well you dont look too bad yourself she kissed him on the cheek whats the wolfhounds name danger lang fondled its ears bring the bags george he called and took her up the steps an arm about her waist tell me can you ride a motorcycle one thing ive never tried oh youll take to it like a duck to water i have a couple of montesa dirt bikes spanish job go anywhere good if youve got sheep in the high country ill show you tomorrow they had an excellent dinner although very simple all prepared by george farnes wife steak new potatoes salad and some sort of cream tart afterwards lang opened the french windows and they stood on the terrace with brandies listening to the silence do you only have the farnes working here she asked thats right georges dad worked for my father so hes known this place as long as i have he and his wife caretake he brings in local help when he needs it what a heavenly existence she said dont be an idiot tom curry told her youd be screaming your head off by the second week philistine she said and turned to lang what now bridge actually i have a shooting range in the barn i thought you might like to try your hand for a moment she stared at him and then she smiled why not when lang switched on the lights in the barn they disclosed a very professional shooting range with a wall of sandbags at the rear fronted by sixfoot cardboard replicas of charging soldiers an assortment of weaponry was laid out on several trestle tables hand guns machine pistols and rifles curry lit a cigarette and stood watching lang picked the first pistol up recognize this our old friend the beretta this is how you load it he picked up an ammunition clip and rammed it in the butt would you like to try why not he ejected the clip and handed her the beretta she loaded it for herself good now pull the slider and youre in business but dont fire let me give you some ear muffs he adjusted them good take aim both eyes open then squeeze gently she did as she was told hitting the target she aimed at in the shoulder firing one round after the other a widely dispersed pattern he showed her how to discharge the magazine not bad at least you hit him she was suddenly angry could you do better rupert slammed another magazine in the butt of the beretta pulled the slider and his hand swung up he fired three times very rapidly shooting out the targets eyes and putting the third in between my god she said hes got nothing to do with it ive got a selection for you here walther ppk browning both similar to the beretta and a smith wesson revolver she moved to the other table and this lot stun grenade standardtype hand grenade the rifles are an armalite ak both with sonic noise suppressor silencer to you the big job is a barret light fifty rifle with a laser guide night sight fiftyround that thing fires guaranteed to penetrate a kevlar at two thousand yards a kevlar flak jacket like the army wears in ireland actually ive got a neater job here rather like a waistcoat titanium and nylon should suit you down to the ground she examined it you were sure of me werent you do i get to try the rifles plenty of time we have all week but why not he reached for the ak unfolded the butt and curry came forward just one thing before you two start having fun he picked up the walther slammed in the magazine and said to grace come on he walked down the range and paused about five feet from the targets you want to make sure ill show you how he walked to the center target held the gun to it and pulled the trigger see what a brilliant marksman i am he came back to her but if that isnt possible never further away than five or six feet he raised the walther and emptied it into the target grace said i get your point curry turned walked to the table and put down the walther shes all yours old lad he said and walked out five it was a bright clear morning although rain threatened and grace browning was enjoying herself on a track high up above the forest she wore black bikers leathers which lang had provided and a rather sinister black helmet lang was riding behind her wearing jeans and a bomber jacket but no helmet danger ran alongside them after his initial instruction it was fun to find how well she could handle the bike he pulled in beside her lit two cigarettes and passed one to her youve got flair typical actor i suppose chameleonlike ability to take on anything at short notice nothing typical about me darling she said but i like physical things and this is fun good youve mastered the rudiments well take a twentymile run round the moor and back to the house youll be amazed how quickly youll pick it up just one thing theres a very good reason why the montesa is so popular with shepherds in mountain and moorland country theyll do half a mile an hour over rough ground if you want on the other hand you can go rather faster he turned the throttle and zoomed away and after a moments hesitation she went after him curry returned to london on the navajo the following day after breakfast lang took grace up into the forest to give her more practice on the montesa after an hour they stopped for a break and sat on the grass he lit two cigarettes as always and gave her one she lay on her back i like you rupert i like you a lot snap my sweet he said except i love you a lot yet youve never put a hand on me once i know my gorgeous one he teased her but you see im terribly faithful fell in love with tom first time we met at cambridge women and please dont get upset dont do the slightest thing for me he turned over and kissed her having said that i adore you i suppose you think ive got a piece missing in my personal jigsaw oh rupert my lovely rupert dont we all she said and kissed his cheek he rolled away and raised himself on one elbow the navajos doing a return bringing an old friend of mine down just for twentyfour hours george is picking him up who would that be ian mcnab used to be my company sergeant major in the paras he runs a gym in london karate judo aikido all that sort of thing for those who want it he paused and she said and something more rupert lit another cigarette most martial arts and defense techniques generally are designed to help you defend yourself ward the attacker off that sort of thing to come to terms with those techniques takes years of training ian mcnab offers something quite different and what would that be his selfdefense system is delivered with extreme prejudice no point in using it except to kill or maim good god she said there we go again you invoking the almighty he stood up come on lets get going ian mcnab was surprisingly small a grayhaired man of fifty with a broken nose and a pleasant highland voice a great pleasure miss browning i was in glasgow on business last year and saw you do that tennessee williams fellas cat on a hot tin roof at the citizens theatre wonderful you were he wore a black tracksuit and trainers lang said plenty of judo mats in the barn ian they left the house and walked across the yard the thing is miss browning was attacked by a mugger last week shook her up badly luckily someone drove by but it occurred to me that you could help her your special course the seven moves of course captain mcnab shook his head the terrible times we live in they went in the barn and he and lang got a number of judo mats from a pile in the corner and laid them out together he turned to grace right miss my system is special and its only to be used in extreme situations i understand you see i can show you seven things to do which will always cripple but may also kill you follow me i think so for example if you extend your knuckles in the right hand you are righthanded i take it yes good if you extend a punch under the chin at the adams apple then even a sixteenstone rugby player will go down you can also do it with stiffened fingers the trouble is he could choke to death thats why i call my special course with extreme prejudice i see theres another the kneecap is one of the most sensitive parts of the human body again lets imagine our sixteenstone rugby player if you raise your foot in a struggle and stamp down on his kneecap youll dislodge it and hell go down you wont kill him but youll cripple him and very probably for life i see extreme prejudice again thats right no offense meant miss but theres then the question of your attackers private parts grace laughed out loud there always is with men sergeantmajor lang laughed and mcnab smiled too true miss then theres the reverse elbow strike very lethal that she turned to rupert are you an expert in all this now do i look the physical type darling he said ive got phone calls to make give her the works for an hour sergeantmajor ill see you later he went out and mcnab turned to grace right you are miss lets get started just before midnight she came down in her dressing gown and found lang in the drawing room examining some faxes problems government business my love particularly the irish mess never goes away nightcap all right he poured two bushmills and gave her one what about the sergeantmajor she asked thought you very promising he has a gym in soho hed like to see you there when you can manage sounds good to me im having the navajo take him back to gatwick tomorrow it will return late afternoon bring tom and yuri belov back with him that should be interesting the wolfhound dozed in front of the fire hes lovely she said why do you call him danger well he can be pretty ruthless when roused there was a portrait of a regency buck over the fireplace he wore a tailcoat light buskins and top boots he bore an extraordinary resemblance to lang who is that she said an ancestor of mine he was a rupert too he was the earl of drury and a great friend of the prince regent the title was lost in the eighteen sixties when the male line died out im descended from the female side what a shame you could have been earl of drury true he looks very arrogant and theres a restlessness to him i sense it in you rupert he killed two men in pistol duels once faced up to the duke of wellington who shot him in the shoulder youd rather have been him than you she said with sudden insight yes why not action color excitement i mean lifes such a bore politics a joke but what about when you were in the army that must have had its moments not real soldiering ireland a sordid bloody mess woman poured a chamberpot full of urine over me once from a bedroom window but enough of that rupert poured more whisky and sat sprawled beside her gazing into the fire he took her hand this is nice very pleasant she said as im not into women and you dont exactly go for men in that way id say we have a perfect relationship she kissed him on the cheek and snuggled close i love you rupert lang i know he said isnt it a shame the following morning she was on her own on the montesa high above the forest enjoying herself amazing how expert she had become in so short a time she paused to have a cigarette sitting astride the bike and looked up at a gray sky that threatened rain there was a droning in the distance and far away through a break in the clouds she saw the navajo she finished the cigarette and took off driving quite fast following the track then turning across the moor bumping over tussocks and scattering a flock of sheep she skidded to a halt searching for a gap in the dry stone wall and there was an angry shout she turned still astride the bike the man hurrying toward her wore an old tweed suit and cap and heavy boots he looked about fifty with a brutal unshaven face and carried a shepherds crook and what in the hell is your game he demanded frightening my sheep youve run pounds off them im sorry she said sorry is it you need seeing to you do he lunged with the crook catching the front wheel the bike toppled and went over as she scrambled sideways her helmet came off and he paused astonishment on his face my god a woman and then there was something else there now what if i put you over my knee and give you a bloody good hiding dont be so stupid she said and reached down for her helmet he dropped his crook and grabbed her from behind you posh bitch ill have to teach you some manners she delivered a reverse elbow strike to his mouth and as he cried out and released her she swung round and drove her knee into his crotch all exactly as ian mcnab had shown her he lay on his back knees up in agony blood on his pulped mouth she looked down at him conscious of a fierce exhilaration here endeth the first lesson she said as she replaced her helmet then picked up the montesa got astride it and drove away ten minutes later she drove into the garage at lang place shoved the montesa up on its stand beside the range rover hung her helmet on a peg and crossed the courtyard lang opened the front door you looked pretty dashing as you shot into the courtyard one boot trailing youll be on the dirt track circuit next that sounds fun come in the drawing room yuri and tom have arrived they were standing in front of the log fire in the great stone hearth tom curry kissed her on both cheeks youre looking very dramatic ive been having fun rupert said yuri i believe you two have met last year at the soviet embassy she said when we did three sisters at the national belov was dressed for the country in a light brown thornproof suit he looked fit and well and smiled with great charm and took her hand and kissed it i saw you three times i now believe with great regret that chekhov can only be played at his best by the english your performance as masha was fantastic halfenglish in my case she said but my thanks for the compliment mrs farne has prepared lunch in the conservatory rupert said do you want to change five minutes she went out lang opened a bottle of bollinger and poured her performance on the firing range has been superb and ian mcnab was more than impressed with the way she took to his instruction shes to go to his gym when shes back in town what did you tell mcnab belov asked i said shed had a close shave with a mugger and wanted to know how to take care of herself belov sipped some champagne amazing this whole business of acting the ability to be the role as masha she was totally convincing as a russian woman and yet i saw her in a tv showing of that hollywood movie she made where she shot several men quite convincingly he accepted a cigarette from rupert will she join us oh yes i think so lang said at that moment grace entered the room in jeans and sweater she took the glass lang offered her tell me rupert the sheep above the forest are they yours thats right why oh a rather unpleasant man was up there shabby old tweed suit shepherds crook took exception to me riding through the fields that would be sam lee rupert wasnt smiling now what happened when i stopped he pushed the montesa over then he grabbed me from behind he what langs face was suddenly bone white his eyes blazing did he harm you in any way well the fact is im afraid i harmed him she said i tried something the sergeantmajor showed me reverse elbow strike to the mouth swivel and put a knee to the crotch when i last saw him he was in the fetal position on the ground lang laughed out loud oh my god thats bloody marvelous he shook his head ill have george deal with him hes out no she said hell behave better next time give him a chance rupert she smiled shall we go in to lunch they had cold salmon a mixed salad and potatoes and lang opened another bottle of bollinger rain drummed against the conservatory glass sorry about the weather he said thats dartmoor for you starts to improve from march into spring all the joys of country living grace told him curry saw to the coffee and belov said i saw a latenight showing on television of a hollywood film you made miss browning grace she said please and it was my only hollywood film i didnt like it there they had me wear a series of incredibly short skirts and i killed rather a lot of men it was whats known as a revenge movie in the trade yes in the film you killed more than efficiently belov said as i recall the police nicknamed you dark angel my one contribution to the script one of my greatgrandmothers on my fathers side was jewish as a child i recall the stories she told me judaism teaches that god is the master of life and death but he employs angels as his messengers so there was an angel of death curry said when god inflicted the ten plagues on the people of egypt in exodus the jews were instructed to put blood on either side of the door post so the angel of death would pass over them to this day thats why passover is celebrated an interesting legend belov said in hebrew the angel of death is malach hamavet in the old days the word was used to frighten children the film people when i suggested it thought it too melodramatic and came up with dark angel interesting belov nodded the revenge concept revenge gets you nowhere lets stop fencing gentlemen we all know pretty much all there is to know about each other if at some time id caught up with and killed the man who murdered my parents it wouldnt have brought them back but it might have afforded a certain satisfaction rupert told her true i mean things happened in a hurry back there in belfast but you didnt regret shooting that swine did you not at all in fact it rather exorcised a ghost in my machine i sleep better there was a long pause and rain rattled the windows belov said do i take it you are prepared to join us grace yes i think so but on my terms you and tom have a political commitment and i understand that but it means nothing to me she ran a hand over langs hair rupert cant take life seriously he bores easily likes the excitement i relate to that more in what way curry asked my fathers family believed they were kin to the victorian poet robert browning theres a line in one of his poems our interests on the dangerous edge of things i can relate to that its like a performance if you like and performance is what my life is about exactly belov said but always fantasy always except for that alley in belfast that was real and earnest razorsharp i should imagine that afterwards on reflection it must have seemed like one of your finest performances very perceptive colonel but one stipulation if i dont like the sound of something i dont do it but of course my dear he smiled at the other two and raised his glass they all followed suit to us my friends to january back in london she was free for most of march she went to ian mcnabs gym three times a week and bought herself a bmw motorcycle which she used to explore parts of the city shed never been toward the end of the month she was asked to do hedda gabler at the national and started five weeks of intensive rehearsals it was in the third week that curry asked if they could all meet and she invited them to cheyne walk as grace handed round coffee belov said im having problems with the kgb here in london not that they call themselves that since the breakup of things in russia the latest title is federal service of counter espionage at the moment the london station is being run by a major silsev heres his photo he passed it across a crook of the first water involved with the russian mafia illegal trading in weapons various currency rackets drugs particularly drugs she examined the photo and passed it to lang he looks mean he is he passed her another photo frank sharp one of the most notorious gang bosses in the east end of london intends a deal with him at the moment if sharp meets his terms silsev will bring in heroin with a street value in excess of a hundred million pounds why should you mind i didnt think you were in the business of doing good grace said i take your point in my own defense i hate drugs and people who trade in them disgust me but the feud between my people of the gru and the kgb or whatever name they choose to call themselves is of prime importance the kind of money silsev would make from this deal would give them too much power i see my sources at the embassy tell me that silsev and sharp are to meet tomorrow afternoon at four oclock at the karl marx memorial in highgate cemetery i know where that is ive been there its facetoface stuff no one else allowed so sharp wont have his minders with him there was a short silence grace browning turned to the others currys face was pale and even rupert lang looked grave moment of truth my friends she said and turned back to belov how do you want it done it was raining hard when the mercedes limousine drew up by the main gates of highgate cemetery shortly before four oclock on the following afternoon the man in the chauffeurs uniform at the wheel said sure you dont want me to come guv no need bert this guys kosher too much in it for him not to be give me the umbrella i wont be long he got out of the car a large fleshy man of fifty in a dark blue overcoat put the umbrella up and went in through the gates dusk was already falling and what with the rain the cemetery was deserted he followed the path through a jumble of graves monuments and marble angels there were trees here and there and it was all rather overgrown sharp didnt mind hed always liked the place had always liked cemeteries if it came to that up ahead was the monument with the huge head karl marx sharp stood looking up at it took out a cigarette and lit it commie bastard he said softly major silsev stepped round from the other side he was small eyes close set wore a trilby hat and raincoat and like sharp held an umbrella ah there you are mr sharp yes here i bleeding well am sharp told him wet and cold and i dont like all this cloak and dagger stuff so lets get on with it at that moment an engine roared into life and as they turned a motorcycle emerged from a clump of trees and came toward them the rider wearing black helmet and leathers what the hell sharp cried as it skidded to a halt silsev turned to run but grace pulled the beretta from the front of her leather jacket and shot him in the back bastard sharp cried and his hand came out of his overcoat pocket clutching a revolver before he could raise it she shot him between the eyes and he went down silsev was still twitching as she moved past she leaned over and finished him with a head shot a few moments later she emerged through the main gate a dark and anonymous figure as she drove past the mercedes where bert sat behind the wheel reading the standard she moved through the evening traffic of highgate road into kentish town and then to camden finally turning into a yard in a side street near camden lock there was a large truck the rear door open a ramp sloping up inside as she ran the motorcycle up and put it on its stand curry behind her closed the yard gate he didnt say a word simply stood waiting while she stripped off the leathers and helmet revealing jeans and a tee shirt underneath he opened a holdall bag he was carrying and offered her a nylon anorak and a baseball cap and she put them on quickly right lets get out of here curry closed the truck door and opened the gates belovs people will clear up she handed him the beretta and he slipped it in the holdall everything okay if you mean did i kill sharp and silsev yes what with ashimov london s not going to be a favored kgb posting i expect not they were approaching a telephone kiosk he said give me a minute a few seconds later the news desk at the times received the call claiming responsibility for the deaths of major ivan silsev and frank sharp by january as a direct response to their involvement in the drug trade curry paused on the corner of camden high street and hailed a cab you all right he asked never better good ruperts got tickets for sunset boulevard were eating at daphnes afterwards does that suit fantastic just get me home as a great writer once said a bath and a change of clothes and i can go on forever a cab slid in to the curb and he opened the door for her when grace entered the piano bar at the dorchester it was just before seven guiliano the manager met her with pleasure kissed her hand and took her down to the far corner beside the piano where lang curry and belov waited she looked quite spectacular in a black beaded shift black stockings and shoes belov waved off a waiter and started to pour from a bottle of cristal champagne you look wonderful at that moment guiliano came up the late edition of the standard i thought you might like to see it a double shooting in highgate by some terrorist group isnt it terrible not safe to be out these days he walked away rupert lang laughed even tom curry was having difficulty belov raised his glass looked at grace and she smiled slightly what can i say after that except to you my friends and he toasted them beirut six the lebanon was kind of arab belfast a setting for destruction unparalleled in modern world history the country had once been the switzerland of the middle east with beirut its capital as popular with the wealthy of the world as the south of france and yet since when serious fighting had broken out between members of the christian phalangist party and the muslim militia only death and destruction had followed in his room on the fourth floor of the al bustan hotel sean dillon poured out a small bushmills from the bottle he had brought with him hed need to conserve it he was just adding a little mineral water when there was a knock on the door he put down his glass and went to open it hannah bernstein stood there wearing a linen suit the color of pale straw and tinted glasses ah miss cooper he said mr gaunt come in he went back to the window and picked up his drink and she joined him it looks quite a place she said used to be the most sophisticated place in the middle east nearly three million people christians muslim and druses and what went wrong emerging arab fundamentalism it was originally french which gave it a very sophisticated base then in seventyfive the christians and muslims got stuck into each other then palestine refugees moved in and made things worse after that the israelis then the syrians then the israelis again but theres always that arab fundamentalism eating away at the heart of things in the middle east dont know the answer he raised his glass here endeth the lesson very unhealthy she said poor old dillon youre a doer not a philosopher lets remember that and get on with it ill do my best now if youll put your jacket on and come next door to my room walid khasan is on his way up why didnt you say he picked up a lightweight navyblue blazer and followed her next door her room was exactly like his and he checked the french windows to the terrace there was a knock at the door when hannah opened it a man in his midforties stood there he wore a crumpled white suit had long black hair a wrinkled face and olive skin good afternoon i am walid khasan he spoke with a strong foreign accent amy cooper hannah told him and this is harry gaunt do come in please this is not necessary he said as he entered and placed a briefcase on the table i am very well aware of who you are miss bernstein and you mr dillon she closed the door and dillon said in fluent arabic so ferguson filled you in totally yes but then he usually does walid khasan replied in the same language good dillon switched back to english im afraid the chief inspector has no arabic hebrew only im afraid hannah said walid khasan replied at once in excellent hebrew oh i can speak that also but it is not to be recommended in beirut the israelis are not popular here what a pity she said in hebrew ill remember that of course we have enough problems walid khasan opened the briefcase took out two walther ppk pistols with silencers and several clips of ammunition i trust these will hold you i can supply heavier artillery mr dillon if necessary but ill require notice youll get it when necessary dillon checked the walther and put it in his waistband at the rear and an extra clip in his blazer pocket hannah put hers in her shoulder bag so dillon said what about our friends from belfast walid khasan opened the french window and sat down in a wicker chair francis callaghan is staying here on the floor below and uses his own name hes supposed to represent an irish electronics firm from cork ive checked and the firm is genuine they specialize in hotel contracts security and that sort of thing hannah leaned on the rail and dillon sat opposite khasan and quinn ive seen him only once and he certainly isnt staying here what happened hannah asked ive had callaghan followed by people working for me he seems to have spent his time as any tourist would visiting historic remains shopping he smiled it may surprise you but there is still a certain normality here and nothing out of the ordinary she asked oh yes one day when i was following him myself he had lunch at a cafe right on the waterfront the sort of place dockworkers might use he met daniel quinn there he smiled the brigadier supplied me with color faxes of these men it was definitely quinn youre sure hannah demanded oh yes more interesting was the fact that they were joined by two men i am familiar with selim rassi a very important figure in the party of god movement and a man from the russian embassy called ilya bikov hes supposed to be in public relations but hes a captain in the federal service of counter espionage kgb dillon said change the name but the same smell they went down to a dock boarded a highspeed boat and took off i couldnt follow so i dont know where they went a lot of shipping out there so what happens now hannah bernstein asked walid khasan smiled callaghan always has a drink in the bar around six oclock he checked his watch which is in about ten minutes shall we go the lounge bar was very pleasant windows open to a terrace and the view overlooked the city the harbor crowded with shipping the blue waters of the mediterranean sparkling in the fading sunshine as evening fell there was no sign of callaghan but there was a sudden call to prayer from a mosque down there in the city then another and yet another the sounds echoing across the rooftops very pleasant hannah bernstein said and yet in the middle of all this people have to kill each other a very oldfashioned habit in this part of the world walid khasan told her at that moment francis callaghan came up the steps from the garden and sat down at a table at the other end of the terrace dillon hannah and walid khasan sat down at a table at their end of the terrace when a waiter approached walid khasan ordered a pitcher of lemonade for all of them you cant get alcohol until after seven he said to dillon apologetically ill do my best to hang on dillon said francis callaghan waved a waiter away and took what looked like a diary from his pocket he flipped through the pages put it back into his pocket and lit a cigarette hes waiting for someone said hannah perhaps quinn i doubt it walid khasan told her as i told you the only time quinn has surfaced was at that dockside cafe i think our friend callaghan is simply filing time he may have an appointment to see quinn later fine dillon said when he goes we follow him he turned to hannah you stay here and hold the fort thanks very much she said indignantly dont be so sensitive you need to make a progress report to ferguson dont you that link is essential especially if we need to move fast to get out of beirut yes i suppose youre right she made a face damn you dillon next time round im going to be a man callahan made his move about twenty minutes later passing them on the way into the hotel here we go dillon said to hannah see you later and he and walid khasan got up and followed callaghan he crossed the foyer went out of the front entrance and hailed a taxi as it took off walid khasan led the way across to another taxi he pushed dillon into the rear and scrambled in after him if you lose him ali he said to the swarthy arab behind the wheel ill have your manhood he leaned back and smiled at dillon one of my men charles ferguson in his office at the ministry of defence listened to what hannah bernstein had to say so far so good he said with any luck callaghan could lead us straight to quinn you could be out of there in twentyfour hours i suppose so sir well see keep me posted and watch your back chief inspector he put down the phone sat there brooding for a moment and then rang through to simon carters office ferguson here he said the prime minister insists i keep you informed so heres where we are it was really quite pleasant sitting under an umbrella at one of the tables of the waterside cafe callaghan had led them to colored lights were strung overhead there was a buzz of conversation and the tables were crowded plenty of booze being consumed here dillon observed ah but beirut is a mixed society my friend walid khasan reminded him callaghan was at a table by the far rail drinking a beer he appeared totally unconcerned looking over the crowd and then out into the harbor and this is where he met quinn and bikov dillon asked yes actually he sat at the same table excellent if this thing works as it should i could be in and out like flynn he waved to a waiter and ordered two lagers at that moment callaghan got up and crossed to the door marked mens room is there another way out of there dillon asked no definitely not ive been in good dillon relaxed and lit a cigarette as the waiter arrived with the lagers francis callaghan stood at the urinal and as he adjusted his trousers and turned the door to one of the stalls opened and a young arab in khaki shirt and pants emerged holding a sterling submachine gun silenced version good evening mr callaghan he said in good english i could blow your spine off with this thing and they wouldnt even hear out there in the cafe but we wouldnt want that would we he reached in callaghans right pocket and removed a colt automatic thats better now stand on that stool we have so thoughtfully provided and climb through the window where my colleagues are waiting to receive you callaghan did exactly as he was told his years of involvement in the struggle of ulster had taught him the advisability of playing it cool in a situation like this he clambered through the window and was pulled down by two more young arabs there was a van backed up behind them the door open one of them handcuffed his hands behind him callaghan said look if its money he got no further one of the men slapped him across the face shut up he said and pulled a linen bag over his head he was pushed into the back of the van the door slammed and they drove away after fifteen minutes with no sign of callaghan returning walid khasan got up ill check it out he said and eased his way through the tables to the mens room he was out again in seconds and returned dont tell me dillon said hes gone im afraid so he must have used the window the only other way out you think he knew he was being followed id be surprised weve been very careful and i was told he didnt know you by sight thats true enough then i think it more likely he was just being careful and taking precautions in case he was being followed so what do we do now walid khasan frowned considering the matter finally he said ill go for a run in the taxi with ali circle the area see if we can spot him you stay here in case quinn shows up somehow i doubt that dillon told him yes well theres not much else that we can do my friend ill see you in half an hour he left and dillon sat there waiting a young woman was working her way through the tables she had hair as black as night long to her shoulders good breasts and hips in a clinging silky dress dark eyes and a full red mouth she finally reached him after much lewd comment from men at the surrounding tables you are tourist she said in english with a heavy accent you could say that me darling she put a hand on his shoulder you need a nice girl then or a bad girl whichever is okay by anya fifty dollars american my place is close by oh moon of my delight heaven is here in your presence dillon told her in arabic unfortunately business requires me to wait here for a friend he took a twentydollar bill from his wallet and handed it to her this is for the pleasure of looking on you she smiled her delight tucked it down her cleavage and made off in london rupert lang rang the bell of yuri belovs mews house and was admitted instantly something important belov asked as he led the way into the sitting room yes i tried to get you the other day but they told me you were in paris some very interesting developments the belfast thing went extremely well in fact grace probably saved dillons life i heard that january had claimed responsibility for several deaths belov said ira it wasnt the protestant factions must be furious dillon certainly doesnt pull any punches the whole thing was a setup lang said he took care of them of course but there was an extra man in the shadows hed have got dillon in the back if grace hadnt intervened so we thought we might as well claim the whole lot while we were at it and whats happened now dillon made daley talk before killing him it seems that quinn is in beirut to do a deal for a supply of plutonium hes dealing with a man called selim rassi of the party of god and a kgb captain called bikov bikov belov shook his head i dont know him but these party of god people are pretty ruthless he shook his head plutonium all my sources indicate that the protestant paramilitaries in ulster have reached a new mood of desperation but plutonium that brings in the threat of nuclear devices thats a whole new dimension yes but see it from their point of view sinn fein which is really the same as the ira get three percent of the vote in the republic of ireland and ten percent in ulster and yet as the product of a ruthless campaign of terrorism they end up having achieved peace negotiations which could mean the protestants being thrown to the wolves the army packing it in and the threat of some sort of departure by the british government it could be a recipe for civil war another bosnia my friend belov said but the threat that could be imposed if this plutonium could be used in a nuclear device would be incalculable a whole new and terrible world he walked to the sideboard poured a couple of whiskys came back and gave one to lang lets hope our friend dillon has the right kind of luck at that moment francis callaghan was standing in front of a desk in a rather gloomy room illuminated by a single lightbulb they had only just pulled the bag off his head and he was dazzled after the darkness he was also for the first time beginning to feel thoroughly frightened the young man who had kidnapped him in the toilet at the cafe sat behind the desk smoking a cigarette the uzi machine gun in front of him he was examining callaghans passport you are from cork i see you represent an electronics firm thats right callaghan told him eagerly francis callaghan im at the al bustan if you look in my wallet theres a permit from the ministry of supply youre a liar the young man nodded and someone standing behind callaghan punched him in the kidneys so that he went down on one knee youre an irish terrorist protestant variety here with daniel quinn to acquire a supply of plutonium from a kgb agent named bikov and selim rassi of the party of god theres been a mistake callaghan said the young man nodded again this time a rifle butt thudded into callaghans back and he went down again the two men who had been standing behind him started to kick him in the body savagely not his face the young man ordered after a while they stopped pulled callaghan up and sat him in a chair he was in considerable pain and half sobbing as he said youve got the wrong man really the young man leaned back and lit another cigarette i dont think so but well see he nodded to the others lets save some time put him in the well i dont think hell last long down there they grabbed callaghan by the arms picked him up and hustled him out along a passage across a courtyard and into a barn there was the round low stone wall of a well in the center one of the men provided a key and unfastened callaghans handcuffs the other picked up a rope with a loop on the end and slipped it over his head beneath his arms now look here he said one of them slapped him then they ran him across the barn and shoved him over the wall hanging on to the rope bracing themselves as he swung against the stonework they lowered him quite quickly and after about thirty feet he splashed into water he had a moment of panic as he went under but it was only about four feet deep the bottom a thick and slimy ooze and the stench was terrible loosen the rope one of them called callaghan did as he was told looking up at the faces peering down at him watching the rope going up it was bitterly cold and he shivered and then the light went out and there was only the darkness at that moment back at the cafe dillon leaned over the rail looking out at the shops in the darkness of the harbor waiting for walid khasan there had been no sign of quinn not that hed really expected one he went down some steps to a lower level where motor boats were moored as he lit a cigarette there was a footfall and he turned and found anya the prostitute there so here you are she said in arabic so it would appear he said and the answer is still the same what a pity she reached in her shoulder bag produced a colt automatic with a silencer on the end and rammed it into his side no one will hear mr dillon so i suggest you do as i say she reached in his pocket and found the walther so now we walk to the other end and mount the steps all very sensibly you follow me oh if needs be im the most sensible man in the world girl dear he told her in english good then lets get moving there were several cars parked at the top of the dock and she took him across to the other side where the same van which had transported callaghan earlier was waiting two men moved out of the shadows one of them pulled a bag over his head and the other handcuffed him they pushed him in the rear and joined him anya got behind the wheel and drove away when they took the bag off his head he was standing in the same room callaghan had found himself in earlier and the same young man sat behind the desk the two men stood behind dillon and the girl went and leaned against the wall smoking a cigarette you do good work dillon told her im only sorry i didnt take you up on your offer the man behind the desk said my sister mr dillon so mind your mouth he nodded and one of the men put a rifle butt into dillons back sending him down on his knees they lifted him up and put him in a chair the young man said you are sean dillon an ex ira enforcer now working for brigadier charles ferguson of british intelligence you are staying at the al bustan with a goodlooking lady called amy cooper who is really chief inspector bernstein of scotland yards special branch he shook his head jewish we dont like jews here in beirut theyve given us a lot of trouble well good for them dillon said one of the men clouted him across the side of the head and the young man said my name is omar that is all you need to know im with the dark wind group youve heard of us yes ive heard of you i know why you are here to find an irish protestant terrorist called daniel quinn who is here to do a deal with selim rassi of the party of god and a piece of kgb slime called ilya bikov youve a vivid imagination one of the men hit dillon again and omar said you were following callaghan tonight quinns righthand man you were a nuisance mr dillon you see we of dark wind dont care for the party of god at the best of times but in this case we would like the plutonium for ourselves so whats stopping you like you i dont know where quinn and selim are hanging out however we do have callaghan at the bottom of the well on the other side of the courtyard he wont like it down there he wont like it at all and neither will you i see dillon said im to have a bath too you will end up dirtier than you went in mr dillon its rather unpleasant i dont think callaghan will last the night hell talk by morning you seem sure about that oh i am you see ive had a rather ingenious idea ive nothing against you so ill have a message sent to walid khasan and the chief inspector offering to sell you back now isnt that kind of you dillon said ah theres a catch once down there with callaghan you go to work on him i dont care how you do it but you get him to tell us where quinn may be found is that all dillon said omar got up came round put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it enjoy it dillon your last for some time and be sensible you see if you dont get callaghan to talk i wont sell you back ill have you shot dillon smiled at anya see where an interest in goodlooking women gets you i should have listened to my aunt mary anya laughed out loud and omar smiled i like you dillon but business is business he nodded to the two men take him they led dillon along the passage across the courtyard and into the barn they paused at the well while one of them removed his handcuffs then slipped the loop over his head over you go he ordered dillon climbed over the wall and they lowered him down into the darkness he was aware of the water cold and clammy the stench glanced up as he slipped out of the rope and saw them peering down they pulled up the rope dillon turned aware of the other man against the wall would you be francis callaghan who in the hell are you one of the men called in english have a good night and the light was turned out leaving only the darkness dillon said im supposed to be harry gaunt working for the united nations and staying at the al bustan supposed to be im sean dillon does that name mean anything to you my god i cant believe it the big ira gunman that turned sides and works for brit intelligence the same i was following you and why would you do that i want quinn francis me boy we know all about this plutonium deal and selim rassi and bikov so dont bother to deny it screw you callaghan said have you heard from belfast lately daley jack mullin and four more of your lads all dead francis six at one blow just like the tailor in the fairy tale only his were flies on a slice of jam and bread youre a bloody liar sorry old son but its the truth i stiffed five of them myself there was a silence for a moment then callaghan said jesus he cant help and neither can i you see they dont need me theyre going to sell me back to my people turn the odd pound but you dillon said either you come up with the right answers or theyll have your balls ive got to think this out callaghan sounded desperate well youve got a long cold night ahead of you to make a decision dillon waded across the well feeling at the wall my god this place stinks there was a movement in the water rats too all the comforts of home callaghan said i hate rats well son i think youll be used to them by morning dillon found a ledge sat down water up to his waist and folded his arms seven it was perhaps an hour later that the light came on again above dillon glanced up and saw walid khasan peering over the wall are you there mr dillon yes dillon called and callaghans with me im sorry my friend they picked me up when i returned to the cafe are you joining us dillon called no omar their leader has decided hell ransom you for one hundred thousand english pounds im being released to go back to the hotel to inform chief inspector bernstein i just wanted to assure myself you were alive and well im alive and in the well as you can see dillon told him i dont know for how long double pneumonia coming up i shouldnt wonder its rather cold down here try and hang on ill be back and dont worry i know this omar whatever else hes a man of his word and callaghan out of our hands now omar has made it clear either he comes up with the information as to quinns whereabouts by morning or he stays down there till he dies goodbye for the moment the light went out and callaghan said the bastards all right for you dillon theres always a choice francis you can come clean and tell them what they want to know theyll kill me anyway maybe not quinns their business now not mine but you could still be of use to my boss brigadier charles ferguson and you must know who he is become an informer you mean absolutely im sure you could tell him a great deal about all those friends of yours in the uff and the uvf you see if a ceasefire comes with the ira its the protestant loyalists the british government are going to have to worry about and so they should well give them hell for selling us out not from the bottom of a well in beirut tell me where quinn can be found and ill see if we can do a deal with omar youll be of no further use to him but to us thats a different story ill see you in hell first suit yourself son youll be a long time dead there was a swishing in the water callaghan said oh christ the rats are back hannah bernstein had been worried for some time it was taking too long she sat in her room at the al bustan gazing out to the bright lights of the city below damn you dillon where are you she said softly born into a wealthy upperclass jewish family her father a famous surgeon her grandfather a rabbi the best schools then cambridge she had astounded everyone by joining the police and her rise to detective chief inspector in special branch had been meteoric on two occasions she had shot people in the line of duty so violence was not unknown to her but her weakness was a rather rigid moral code that made it difficult for her to cope with the dillon of the old days the legendary ira gunman she could never see his slate as wiped clean no matter what he was doing now on the side of right having said that the truth was she liked him too much the empty hotel room had begun to feel oppressive she went downstairs to the bar waved a waiter away and went out on the terrace leaning on the balustrade she looked down over the gardens to the brightly illuminated car park at that moment a taxi drove up and walid khasan got out he started up the steps to the terrace and she called over here he paused glanced up then hurried to join her weve got trouble im afraid he said serious trouble her stomach knotted tell me when he was finished she said can this omar be trusted oh yes but judge for yourself walid turned and waved to the taxi the rear door opened and omar got out he paused halfway up the steps to light a cigarette then joined them smiling pleasantly chief inspector what a pleasure she became very formal very much the police officer can we rely on your good faith absolutely we of dark wind always keep our word see that you do she glanced at walid khasan ill speak to the brigadier obviously youll act as our contact in this matter of course she turned to omar well be in touch then a pleasure meeting you chief inspector he said turned and went down the steps beirut at that time of the year being three hours ahead of london it was just before eight at the cavendish square flat and charles ferguson was about to leave for dinner at the garrick club when the phone rang bernstein she said bad news im afraid ferguson listened to what she had to say then sighed oh dear what a bloody mess can anything be done sir oh yes plenty of cash in the contingency fund anticipating the need to perhaps get you out in a hurry i ordered the raf to respray one of our lear jets in united nations strip that way it can land at beirut international airport well fly via cyprus we sir yes id better come myself ill be with you tomorrow chief inspector thank god for that one thing you can do you demand to see dillon personally to assure yourself hes still in one piece you also tell this chap omar that i want callaghan too this present jobs blown of course but he could be very useful to us fountain of knowledge as regards the protestant movement right sir be of good heart chief inspector ill be with you soon when walid khasan and hannah were led into the room omar stood up behind the desk a pleasure to see you again chief inspector and so soon lets make this brief she was as cold and formal as if charging someone at west end central police station brigadier ferguson arrives tomorrow and your terms will be met excellent just one thing you give us callaghan too that could be arranged he shrugged depending on his willingness to give us the information we need right ill speak to dillon now and ill make that point clear the lights turned on and dillon glanced up to see her peer down you all right dillon ive been better girl dear but you shouldnt be here in such bad company well have you out tomorrow the brigadiers flying in now isnt he the grand man are you there callaghan she called and where else would i bloody be weve struck a deal tell them where to find quinn and theyll let you leave with us and then what youll fly back to london and sing your heart out screw you then theyll leave you down there to rot your choice she leaned over further bye for now dillon see you soon the lights went out and callaghan said lousy stinking bitch oh she can be all of that dillon laughed but i like her it was unbelievably cold down there and after a few hours dillon found that hed somehow got used to the stench but not the cold that was mindnumbing sitting on the ledge leaning back he actually dozed off and came awake in a split second to hear callaghan get away from me damn you there was a splash in the water and dillon felt a rat scurry across his arm are you all right francis no im bloody well not dillon checked his watch which was a rolex divers the face phosphorescent seventhirty break of a new day theyll be starting to serve a traditional english breakfast at the al bustan fried eggs bacon sausage toast and marmalade nice hot pot of tea or coffee shut your mouth callaghan said i can dream cant i thats exactly what im going to have when the brigadier arrives and gets me out of here nice long hot shower to get rid of the stink clean clothes and then that breakfast doesnt matter what time of day it is i want the breakfast screw you dillon i know what youre trying to do im not trying to do anything francis our operation to catch quinn is blown its dark winds business now were out you could have been useful back in london but if you prefer to be a hero of the glorious revolution if thats how you see yourself well thats your problem shut up will you just shut up beirut international airport was served only by the national carrier mea but when ferguson arrived at nine oclock in the morning after a night flight via cyprus the lear jet in its united nations colors was accepted without question as were the papers the forgery department at the ministry of defence in london had supplied at such short notice hannah bernstein and walid khasan met him as he came through into the terminal he wore a linen suit and panama hat and guards tie and carried his malacca cane he handed his overnight bag to walid khasan and kissed hannah on the cheek youre looking agitated my dear ive a right to be not at all he nodded to walid khasan its been a long time they went out to the yellow taxi where walids man ali sat behind the wheel walid sat in the front and ferguson and hannah in the rear shall we go straight there walid asked good god no ferguson said i need a shower and some breakfast do this fellow omar good to wait and what about dillon sir hannah demanded and since when did you get worked up about his welfare chief inspector hell survive he opened his briefcase and took out some colored faxes which he passed to walid khasan is this them walid nodded thats selim rassi and the other is the russian bikov good ferguson took them back and put them in the briefcase hannah bernstein said but does that matter sir i dont understand you will my dear ferguson told her you will it was still very dark down there in spite of the fact that it was eleven oclock in the morning when dillon checked his watch he hadnt heard a sound from callaghan for a while are you still with us francis there was a splashing sound then callaghan said warily only just he sounded terrible i cant take much more dillon at that moment the light was turned on up above and omar leaned over your friends are here mr dillon our business has been concluded satisfactorily so well bring you up now well drop the rope what about callaghan has he spoken no then he stays here comes the rope now as it dropped down callaghan surged through the water and grabbed at dillon dont leave me ive had enough dillon cant take any more not on my own steady son dillon put one arm around him and reached for the rope just tell me about quinn hes on a freighter called alexandrine algerian registration its anchored about a mile out of the harbor there was a meeting arranged on board for seven oclock tonight with selim rassi and bikov the russians delivering the plutonium then the truth is it dillon said if youre lying these lads up above will skin you i swear it callaghan sounded desperate just get me out dillon take me to london with you ive had enough sensible lad dillon pulled the loop over him and under his armpits haul away he called he waited as callaghan rose above him and was pulled over the edge of the well the rope came down again dillon pulled it over his head here we go he went up quite quickly pushing his feet against the side and hands reached to pull him over the round wall they were all there omar and his two men anya walid khasan hannah ferguson and callaghan draped in a blanket good god dillon you stink like a sewer ferguson said i think it was a sewer dillon told him hannah passed him a blanket concern on her face you look terrible ferguson said so our friend here decided to speak up did he freighter called the alexandrine about a mile out of the harbor algerian flag quinns out there now theres a meeting with rassi and bikov at seven when the plutonium passes over ferguson smiled fiercely excellent everything comes to he who waits he turned to walid khasan dont you agree major i certainly do khasans english had lost its accent major hannah bernstein said looking bewildered yes allow me to introduce major gideon cohen of mossad israeli intelligence she said you didnt tell me whats more to the point he didnt tell me dillon said yes well i didnt want to spoil your performance dear boy i mean we all know what a brilliant actor you were at rada and still am you old bastard yes well i thought the real thing would give you an edge and i knew you would cope you always do dillon and what about me brigadier hannah demanded you didnt trust me thats what it came down to not at all thought youd give a better performance if you thought it was for real just like dillon they were all laughing and omar lit a cigarette and put it in dillons mouth captain moshe levy all mossad dillon asked im afraid so even anya she laughed and still anya lieutenant anya shamir youre mad the lot of you dillon said operating here in beirut like this israelis theyd hang you in the marketplace oh we manage gideon cohen said will somebody tell me whats going on here francis callaghan asked and turned to dillon this whole thing was a fucking setup is that what theyre saying so it would appear francis you rotten lousy bunch of bowsers callaghan jumped up the blanket slipping down revealing the filth that covered his clothes he was almost in tears ferguson said dont be a silly boy youve really done rather well youll fly back to london and answer every question the chief inspector here asks you and what if i tell her to stuff it ah well in that event youll just have to stand trial at the old bailey as a participant in numerous bombings and murders plenty unsolved on the files that we can hang on you id say you could draw about four life sentences callaghan slumped in the chair mouth open staring at him it was dillon who said with surprising gentleness its coming to an end francis twentyfive years of slaughter be sensible and help that end to come about you do what the brigadier wants and you wont end up in a cell for the rest of your life callaghan nodded looking dazed but i should have met daniel last night how do you know how hes reacting to my disappearance maybe hes changed the meet leave that to us boy ferguson nodded to moshe levy and he and his two men lifted callaghan up and anya followed now what dillon demanded well i think it would be useful if major cohen arranged for a little reconnaissance just to check that the alexandrine is still at anchor out there once we know that position well decide on what to do tonight ill go out myself in a speedboat cohen told him and wrinkled his nose you really do stink dillon you realize there were rats down there dillon said one bite and you could get weils disease i mean forty percent of people who get that die not you dillon hannah bernstein said youve so much bushmills irish whiskey in your blood its the rat who would die now for gods sake lets get you back to the al bustan and a bath dillon stood in a hot shower for a solid thirty minutes lathering his body with shower gel shampooing his hair several times finally he turned the bath taps on padded to his suite to find the ice box there was a half bottle of bollinger champagne he opened it found a glass went and climbed into the bath and just lay there stewing in the hot water and luxuriating in the icecold champagne after a while the wall phone rang and he picked it up dillon its me hannah said are you decent how dare you suggest such a terrible thing very funny major cohens turned up the brigadiers meeting him on the terrace he wants both of us there ten minutes dillon said ill see you down there he replaced the phone finished the champagne climbed out of the bath and reached for a towel the terrace was bright in the afternoon sunshine the awnings billowing in the breeze when dillon arrived ferguson hannah and cohen were sitting at a table under an umbrella by the balustrade well i must say you smell better ferguson observed ill ignore that dillon turned to cohen all right major whats the situation the alexandrine is there all right there are quite a few oceangoing ships at anchor that far out so it was easy to have a run round in a speedboat and check the situation anything unusual definitely security lights rigged all the way round the entire ship id say its going to be very difficult to get anywhere near in darkness and it will be dark at seven hannah said look what if we forget about the alexandrine what if we concentrate on intercepting bikov and rassi before they actually get out there not possible cohen said he took a map from his pocket and unfolded it this is beirut now out there is the alexandrine and here he tapped a finger here are three yacht basins and two areas of high density for small craft if quinn has been alerted to callaghans disappearance the last thing he will do is take a speedboat from the area i first saw them there was silence hannah said then what do we do if the ship is protected by security lights we couldnt make an approach oh yes we could ferguson said we could go in underwater dillon groaned you mean i could hes really too modest major ferguson said he actually blew up some plo boats the other year in this very harbor and on behalf of your people yes im very well aware of that fact cohen said ive studied the file he smiled at the irishman ill be honest dillon none of my people are underwater specialists youd be on your own jesus dillon said tell me something new i can get you anything you want as regards scuba equipment anything how kind dillon said ill call again could you also get me a little semtex and a few timer pencils yes that would be no problem what on earth is this dillon ferguson put in semtex we dont need to blow the damn ship up maybe we do dillon said maybe we do he turned to cohen now lets see how were going to do this it was already dark by sixfifteen when ferguson dillon and hannah bernstein on a small private dock next to a yachting marina watched cohen and moshe levy check the diving equipment there were two air tanks an inflatable jacket a pair of nylon fins an underwater torch and a dive bag dillon was already wearing a black nylon diving suit and cowl he opened the dive bag and took out a browning hipower there was a carswell silencer which he screwed on the end and a twentyround clip youre going to war again hannah said thats right he took a block of semtex from the bag and two pencil timers three minutes he asked cohen yes the major said thats what you asked for and thats what ive done but i think youre crazy i usually am youre sure youll recognize them hannah demanded jesus girl i saw those fax pictures the brigadier brought didnt i ferguson who had been a silent observer said let him get on with it chief inspector and save the free world dillon laughed isnt it interesting that its always sods like me that have to do it brigadier he turned to cohen who had finished loading the large inflatable tied to the dock helped by levy you and me major dillon said and climbed down levy untied the line securing them to the dock and at that moment hannah stepped down chief inspector ferguson said what are you doing im going along for the ride sir just for once im tired of being a bystander dillon laughed out loud and she nodded to cohen who started the twin outboard motors and they slipped away from the dock into the darkness all the security lights were on view as they coasted in toward the alexandrine cohen cut the engines about a hundred yards out and they came to a halt and just floated virtually motionless the israeli produced a night sight and had a look toward the general harbor something coming a motor boat it appeared from the shadows into the pool of light surrounding the alexandrine and coasted in to the ships ladder two men clambered over and started up thats them bikov and rassi he passed the sight to dillon see for yourself dillon had only seconds to catch them before they reached the deck he nodded looks like them to me lets do it he passed the sight to cohen went and put on a weight belt then clamped a tank to his inflatable and pulled it on fastening the velcro tabs across his chest he hooked the diving bag at his waist he took out the hipower and slipped the weapon inside his jacket i dont like it this diving hannah whispered its not natural the only danger is from going deep he said the air we breathe is part oxygen and nitrogen the deeper i go the more nitrogen is absorbed and thats when the trouble starts only im not going deep ill cross to the alexandrine at fifteen or twenty feet no sweat he pulled on his mask do you still love me go to hell dillon she said ive been doing that for a long time now dear girl he said and fell back into the water dillons approach took only a few moments he surfaced by the platform at the bottom of the steel stairway at the side of the ship he eased out of the inflatable and tank and clipped them to the rail beside the platform then clambered up onto the platform he opened his jacket and took out the browning and cocked it at that very moment an arab seaman holding an ak appeared at the top of the stairs and started down he saw dillon and tried to bring the gun to bear but dillon shot him instantly the silenced weapon making a dull thud as it hit the arab in the chest and knocked him over the rail into the water dillon started up the stairway and a voice called in arabic achmed where are you dillon paused another arab appeared also armed with an ak he stood there quite unconcerned and dillon took careful aim and shot him in the head the man dropped his rifle and went over the rail into the water a hundred yards away in the darkness hannah bernstein looking through the night sight shuddered my god there were guards two of them what did he do cohen asked he shot them both well he would wouldnt he and he took the night sight from her gently dillon moved along the deck keeping to the shadows he heard laughter peered through a porthole and found half a dozen sailors playing cards smoking and drinking and merciful allah wouldnt be too pleased about that he said softly and moved on he came to some sort of salon glanced in through a square window and found selim rassi and daniel quinn sitting on either side of a table there was a small briefcase between them there was no sign of the russian dillon opened the salon door and stepped inside quinn had his back to him but the arab saw him at once and reached inside his jacket dillon shot him twice in the heart sending him backwards in his chair quinn turned his own chair going over and dillon said easy danny boy easy who in the hell are you quinn demanded oh we go back a long way you and me derry in the old days sean dillon danny your worst nightmare dillon quinns face was pale you fucking bastard working for the brits now but i thought that was your side danny make your mind up now open the case you go to hell dillons hand came up he fired and part of quinns right ear disintegrated he lurched against the table a hand to his ear dillon said open it quinn unclipped the briefcase inside were two objects resembling thermos flasks dillon picked one up and slipped it in his dive bag he did the same with the other what have i got here plutonium three hundred grams dillon said that could take out half of dublin for gods sake dillon youre not with the ira anymore we can show the fucking fenians we mean business its finished danny dillon said peace coming whether you like it or not weve got callaghan hell sing like a bird i killed daley in belfast and five of your foot soldiers youre finished me ould son the door opened behind him he turned dropping to one knee and found bikov there dillon fired twice knocking him out to the deck and behind him quinn dropped behind the desk drew a pistol and fired at the same time shouting at the top of his voice dillon went out crouching low in time to catch the seamen emerging onto the deck farther along several of them were armed and when they saw him they fired he darted to the other side of the ship paused beside the engine room and took out the semtex block he activated both threeminute timers raised the engine room hatch and dropped them in then he went up a ladder to the top deck cohen had been watching through the night sight as gunfire cracked hannah said what is it hes in trouble cohen dropped the night sight picked up an uzi cocked it and gave it to her i hope you can pull a trigger because were going in to get him as the first seaman emerged at the top of the ladder behind him dillon turned and fired twice knocking him down then he simply vaulted over the stern rail into the water as he surfaced the inflatable surged forward cohen at the tiller hannah bernstein spraying the deck above with the uzi hang on cohen cried and threw a line they sped away into the darkness the odd angry shot pursuing them and finally slowed cohen leaned over did you get it oh yes its here in the dive bag cohen gave him a hand on board and at that moment the alexandrine blew up in a great eruption of orange flames the sound echoing toward the land oh my god hannah bernstein said they must have had trouble in the engine room dillon shook his head and the sons of ulster are going to need a new leader just shows you cant depend on anything in this wicked old life it was exactly two hours later that the lear lifted off the runway at beirut international airport and started a steady climb to thirty thousand feet callaghan dressed in slacks and a polo neck sweater sat by himself looking decidedly unhappy ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon were grouped together you did well chief inspector the brigadier told her better than well dillon said when cohen came in to get me she stood up in that boat and gave us covering fire with an uzi annie oakley come back to haunt us time you made her superintendent brigadier out of my hands a scotland yard matter and you with no influence dillon mocked and what about dillon sir hannah demanded if anyone did well it was he yes well i had every confidence in him as usual which was why i brought this ferguson opened the small ice box in one of the cupboards and produced a bottle of krug you open it dear boy you old sod dillon said and eased off the cork while hannah got out the glasses he turned to callaghan will you join us in a glass francis go stuff yourselves the lot of you callaghan said london eight the prime minister at the debriefing the following morning was absolutely delighted so dillons done it again he turned to carter i know you dont like him but you must admit he gets results yes the little swine manages that all right oh come on simon rupert lang told him its results that count the protestant terrorist movements have been dealt a crippling blow ferguson s unit has not only foiled the worst bomb threat possible a threat that would have added an entirely new dimension to the irish problem theyve also got rid of one of the most dangerous leaders there was and that is of crucial importance the prime minister told them president clinton is giving us all his support in an effort to produce a final and lasting peace in ireland senator edward kennedy has brought his considerable influence to bear in congress and several other prominent irish americans such as senator patrick keogh and former congressman bruce morrison have been working behind the scenes for months to persuade the ira to come to the peace table ill believe it when it happens carter snorted i mean how can we deal with people whove bombed the hell out of us for twentyfive years we dealt with kenyata in kenya after the mau mau rebellion and gave them independence ferguson told him same thing in cyprus with archbishop makarios i think ferguson s right rupert lang said we have to travel hopefully quite right the prime minister said look gentlemen im the last person to look favorably on the ira i dont forget the brighton bombing when they almost got the entire government but twentyfive years is long enough the chance for peace is overwhelming and we must seize it but it does mean keeping the lid on the protestant hard men its the most volatile of situations let me put it this way i dont want us on the very brink of peace to see it all destroyed by the wrong kind of incident i think were all agreed on that ferguson told him i intend a flying visit to washington quite soon to see president clinton the irish prime minister mr reynolds will be joining us this is all very hushhush and you gentlemen will respect my confidence of course prime minister carter said and they all nodded one other matter you may have heard of mr liam bell i know him rupert lang said met him in washington when he was a senator before he gave up politics and became president of some huge electronics firm hes also irish american and was much involved with fundraising for the ira through noraid the northern ireland aid committee yes well hes seen the error of his ways there hes genuinely committed himself to achieving peace hes coming over on a factfinding mission on behalf of president clinton on thursday hell spend one night in london at his house in vance square then proceed to belfast hell be coming in by private jet do you want us to look after him prime minister carter asked no publicity thats essential as it happens theres a conservative party fundraiser on thursday night at the dorchester six oclock for drinks you know the sort of thing ill have to show my face and ive seen that mr bell has an invitation so that i can have a private word with him he turned to ferguson id like you to keep an eye out for him brigadier of course prime minister john major stood up hard times gentlemen dangerous times he smiled but we shall come through we must rupert lang and yuri belov had lunch in the pub opposite kensington gardens shepherds pie washed down with lager so civilized london belov said you english are unique the french say you cant cook but your pub grub is wonderful theyve never forgiven us for waterloo lang said belov sat back ferguson and dillon are a rare combination you can say that again and this bernstein girl is pretty hot stuff too belov nodded so where do we stand the sons of ulster destroyed daniel quinn eliminated the plutonium threat taken care of and francis callaghan singing like a bird lang smiled so where does that leave us with the prospect of peace looming up in ireland and that doesnt suit i see you mean you and your people would prefer another bosnia a civil war ive told you before rupert out of chaos comes order and the kind of ireland youd like to see based on sound marxist principles something like that but the most important factor in the equation will be how well the protestants react to the peace proposals i think theres a fair chance they might react violently lang said its essential belov told him to provoke not so much the ira but the catholics yes i see the logic in that so what are you thinking of that perhaps we should do it for them after all january have hit the ira before this and the prods it doesnt matter its consequences that are important for example this irish american liam bell here on behalf of clinton what if something unpleasant happened while he was here in london thered be hell to pay exactly i mean never mind president clinton i dont think the great american public would be pleased so where is this leading to whats grace doing at the moment a noel coward thing private lives at the kings head thats a pub theatre you know the sort of thing fringe what time does she go on stage eightfifteen i went last night excellent speak to her and tom get them invitations for this affair at the dorchester on thursday lets see what we can come up with when dillon called at ferguson s office at the ministry of defence just after lunch on thursday the brigadier was busy but hannah came to the outer office to greet him dillon wore a bomber jacket navyblue sweater and jeans he said how is he your message on my answer machine said urgent it is hell speak to you in a moment dillon lit a cigarette and she sat down at her desk her tan wrapover skirt opening i love that fashion he said lets a fella see what grand legs youve got well get used to it she said because thats all youre going to see the hard woman you are have we got far with francis callaghan oh yes hes behaved himself the trouble is most of his hardcore information concerns the sons of ulster so its out of date the other stuff concerning the uvf the uff and the red hand of ulster is very generalized hes not told us much that we didnt know what about january she shook her head he seems as much in the dark as the rest of us do you believe him our interrogation team does and they havent left it to chance theyve used a pretty advanced lie detector test and it certainly shows he was telling the truth another dead end there then he walked to the window strange that oh i dont know it could simply indicate a terrorist group operating very privately on a cell system good sound marxist principles that she frowned thats an interesting point you could be right the buzzer sounded she got up and dillon followed her into ferguson s office where they found him seated at his desk ah there you are so we can get on he said as if dillon had kept him waiting tis sorry i am dillon said doing his stage irishman ten miles ive walked from the castledown bridge in my bare feet my boots tied round my neck to save the leather but an honor it is to serve a grand englishman like yourself in what way may i be of service there are times dillon when i think youre quite mad but never mind that now i see youre dressed in your usual careless way well it wont do decent suit collar and tie and be at the dorchester ballroom for six he pushed an engraved card across his desk that gets you in you as well chief inspector ill meet you there i want you both armed by the way it was hannah who said do we get to know why sir of course as you can see from the card fundraiser for the conservative party the prime minister will be looking in there will be one unexpected guest and who would that be sir he told them about liam bell when he was finished he said hell just be a face in the crowd highly unlikely anyone would recognize him he pushed a photo across there he is no press release hell arrive at sixfifteen ill greet him when he comes in and take him to a private room where he and the pm will have a little chat he has a house in vance square i presume hell return there afterwards he has an onward journey by private jet in the morning at seven oclock from gatwick so hes hardly likely to go out on the town and what would you like us to do sir keep an eye on him thats all fine sir hannah said well see you there then she and dillon went out and ferguson opened a file and started to go through some papers dillon arrived at the park lane entrance to the dorchester at ten minutes to six there was quite a crowd pressing to get in and he pushed his way through taking off his navyblue burberry trench coat to reveal a rather smart gray flannel suit by yves st laurent with blue silk shirt and dark blue tie he saw hannah bernstein standing beside the uniformed security guards and she waved here give me your coat ill put it with mine dont use the cloakroom it would take an hour to get it back she turned to the head security guard hes with me ministry of defence dillon produced his id card and the man nodded thats fine sir they moved toward the entrance to the ballroom and found ferguson standing talking to rupert lang ah there you are ferguson said and turned to lang chief inspector hannah bernstein and sean dillon this is rupert lang an under secretary of state at the northern ireland office a pleasure chief inspector lang took in her black silk trouser suit with obvious approval mr dillon he didnt hold out his hand your fame precedes you what you really mean is illfame dillon said cheerfully for gods sake dillon i cant take you anywhere ferguson said clear off and get yourself a drink while the goings good and be back here in fifteen minutes dillon and hannah pushed through the crowd to the champagne bar not for me she said good god girl is it the sabbath or something he reached for one of the glasses of champagne and drank it down of course i was forgetting you only drink kosher wine i shall kick you very hard if you dont behave yourself she told him at that moment there was a flurry of movement at the entrance and they turned to see the prime minister enter the crowd parted and started to applaud he smiled his acknowledgment most of the cabinet behind him and waved the great and the good and the not so good dillon said theyre all here he turned to reach for another glass of champagne and saw grace browning and tom curry at the other end of the bar jesus he said would you look whos here who hannah asked grace browning and that professor fella from the europa i told you i spoke to her after youd gone to bed ill have a word with her no you will not its just on sixfifteen were needed and she turned and moved toward the entrance as they arrived ferguson was greeting liam bell a tall grayhaired man with a fleshy face who seemed to smile easily thats real kind of you brigadier he was saying as ferguson took his coat ferguson passed the coat to dillon sean dillon who is on my staff a good irish name liam bell held out his hand and dillon warmed to him and detective chief inspector hannah bernstein bell smiled ive always approved of women police officers but never more than now before she could reply ferguson said the prime minister is waiting ill take you to him he nodded to dillon and hannah be available they moved off through the crowd dillon said did you come in your car yes i have priority parking right outside on the curb see what having great legs gets you you offensive little jerk she punched him in the side only some of the time now lets one of us have another drink grace browning at the bar with tom curry sipped a glass of perrier youre sure you dont want a glass of champagne he asked dont be silly tom i have to perform dont i what about transport a black cab just for us one of yuris boys at the wheel he knows what we look like hell be straight across the road the moment we appear that seems all right an arm went about her shoulder and rupert lang kissed her hair youre looking rather delicious rupert darling she kissed him on the mouth stop trying to make tom jealous he said bell has just arrived and ferguson s taken him to see the pm in a side room you know what he looks like of course i do ive been shown enough pictures yuri belov moved out of the crowd urbane and charming a glass of champagne in one hand hello colonel good to see you rupert lang said mr lang professor belov took graces hand and kissed it miss browning you look as charming as ever youre looking forward to your performance this evening of course rupert said softly by the way ferguson has sean dillon here and the bernstein woman just your type tom she went to cambridge too he kissed grace again see you later after the show at my place he walked one way and belov another and dillon who had observed the whole scene said to hannah ill be back and pushed through the crowd miss browning he gave her his best smile you wont remember me but i do she said the europa in belfast youd been to see my show and were very charming about it you were wonderful you remember professor tom curry of course dillon nodded but you didnt tell us your name dillon sean dillon and you were at rada a long time ago i worked at the national briefly played lyngstrand in lady from the sea one of my most favorite plays but ive never heard of you oh i gave it all up a long time ago ah i see you found something better no you might say the theatre of life called are you working at the moment im doing private lives at the kings head not a bad play dillon said he had a way with words old noel at that moment he was tapped on the shoulder and turned to find hannah bernstein there sorry to interrupt but our friends ready to go dillon smiled took grace brownings hand and kissed it ill try to get in to see the show id hate to miss it curry said actually wed better make a move too grace hasnt a lot of time good night and he led her away through the crowd come on dillon hannah said and pulled on his arm as dillon and hannah reached the foyer ferguson led liam bell through the crowd i hope everything went well the brigadier said fine just fine the prime minister was most helpful i hope things are as constructive in belfast and dublin but you must excuse me now im kind of jetlagged and ive an early start ill get a cab good god no ferguson said my daimlers outside my chauffeur can run you home its vance square isnt it islington thats right i have this rather nice old house on the other side of the churchyard used to be the ministers good well take care of that as bell walked to the door ferguson dropped back slightly follow him chief inspector just to make sure and you dillon right sir she said ferguson and bell paused in the doorway while the brigadier waved to his driver grace browning in the back of the black cab belov had provided saw them there he is she said lets go i want to be there before him and the cab moved out into the park lane traffic as liam bell got into the daimler dillon and hannah turned to her rover saloon she got behind the wheel dillon scrambled in and they were away hold the bag open grace told curry he did as he was told she removed her highheeled shoes took out a pair of loose muslin trousers and pulled them on tucking the short skirt of her dress inside next came a pair of slippers and a cheap threequarterlength raincoat then she found a long scarf and wrapped it round her head the chador worn by most muslim women finally she took out a harrods plastic bag with the beretta inside she checked the action then put it in her shoulder bag ready to go i didnt tell you tom but ive changed the plan i went and had a look at this place vance square this afternoon bell lives in the old rectory and the easiest way to get there is to walk through st marys churchyard im banking thats what hell do so you drop me there and clear off now look here he protested its only a quarter of a mile to the kings head ill walk no problem i can wait no way she said fiercely ill see you at the theatre its how i want it tom the cab turned into vance square and she tapped on the window the driver pulled in at the curb she turned smiled once at curry got out and crossed to the entrance to the churchyard and the cab moved away the churchyard was a jumble of gothic monuments and gravestones great crosses and here and there a marble angel there was a path running through to the old rectory with a light at the entrance and one at the other end in between it was a place of shadows she walked about halfway positioned herself between a mausoleums bronze doors and waited it started to rain in a sudden rush as the daimler deposited liam bell at the curb by the entrance to the churchyard good night he said to the chauffeur and turned the daimler drove away and hannah bernstein coasted into the square and slowed down there he goes she said as bell entered the churchyard we can go now she started to increase speed and dillon grabbed her arm just a minute i think i saw someone in there up ahead of him are you sure she braked to a halt yes i damn well am he was out of the car in a second and running for the entrance to the churchyard a silenced walther in his hand liam bell pulled up the collar of his raincoat and hurried on as the rain increased he reached the center of the churchyard was aware of a movement up ahead in the shadows he paused and grace browning moved out of the shadows at the same moment dillon ran through the entrance gates in the half light he saw grace and shouted at the top of his voice mr bell get down bell paused bewildered turned to look at dillon turned again and she leveled the beretta and fired twice hitting him in the heart knocking him to one side of the path he fell against a tombstone and hung there for a moment dillon dropped to one knee and fired the walther but she had already slipped into the shadows of the mausoleum he emptied his gun into the darkness of the bronze doorway but unknown to him grace had dropped flat on her face on the ground he ejected his magazine and reached for another as he rammed it into the butt she stepped into the light and took deliberate aim her arm extended very foolish mr dillon her voice was perfect pakistani english in its inflection and you dont often make mistakes i admire that dillon stood there frozen awaiting the bullet then suddenly she raised an arm in a kind of salute and slipped into the shadows he pulled the slider on the walther and fired twice and behind him hannah ran up the path gun in hand see to him he said and ran along the path into the darkness grace browning was already on the other side of the rectory the church to one side there was another older part of the cemetery there as she went round the end of the church a side door opened and an old man in a cassock appeared light flooding out she ran past him head down to where she knew there was a gate in the wall opened it and darted along the street outside she paused in a doorway at the far end removed the chador from her head slipped off the muslin trousers and pulled down her skirt she put the beretta into her shoulder bag rolled up the muslin trousers and put them and the chador in her plastic harrods bag at the end of the street there was a rubbish bin at the base of a streetlight she dropped the plastic bag inside turned into the high street and walked calmly away along the pavement as dillon entered the other part of the cemetery the side door was still open light flooding out and the old man in the cassock stood there what on earths going on he demanded police dillon told him because it was the easiest thing to say who are you father thomas did you see anyone a woman ran past a few moments ago muslim i think she wore one of those headscarves oh and baggy cotton trousers whats happened theres been a shooting a neighbor of yours liam bell the old man was shocked oh my god back there on the path youll find a young woman there shes a chief inspector bernstein tell her ill contact her on my cellnet phone dillon hurried away found the gate in the wall and ran to the end of the lane grace browning reached upper street fifteen minutes later there were already large numbers of people crowding into the kings head one of the most celebrated pub theatres in london and a poster on the wall featured her prominently she walked through the crowd many people recognized her smiled and said hello but she kept on going until she reached curry who was at the far end of the bar oh there you are tom she called brightly thought you were going to be late he said and ive never known you to do that all this was for the consumption of those standing nearby she said come through and talk to me while i dress dillon hesitated on the corner of the lane and islington high street it was quite busy in spite of the rain plenty of people hurrying by and lots of traffic hopeless really and then he noticed the plastic shopping bag sticking out of the rubbish bin at the base of the street lamp in front of him it was the harrods name that caught his eye common enough in the right place but not on the high street he took it out opened it and found the muslin trousers and the chador would you look at that now he said softly he replaced them in the bag and pushed it inside the front of his trench coat then he called hannah on his cellnet phone she answered at once im on islington high street he said youve seen father thomas yes hes here two police cars arrived already and i can hear the ambulance a waste of time im afraid liam bell is dead poor sod dillon said didnt stand a chance did the priest tell you about the woman dressed like a muslim yes ive just found a harrods shopping bag sticking out of a rubbish bin here on the corner of the back lane and islington high street inside a pair of muslin trousers and one of those headscarves the chador sounds like an arab fundamentalist hit i dont think so she called out to me hannah called me by name she had a very pronounced pakistani accent another thing ill bet you five pounds that january claim this one within the next hour but why ill tell you later im going to take a walk up the high street nothing i can do here ill call you he put the cellnet phone in his pocket turned up the collar of his raincoat and walked rapidly away through the rain a waste of time of course after all hed no reason to know whether shed gone left or right on the high street the rain increased in force clearing the pavements to a certain degree as people sought shelter he turned into upper street and paused looking across at the welcoming lights of the kings head remembering that grace browning had told him she was playing there in private lives he could see the poster on the wall darted across the road and paused in the doorway he took out the cellnet and called hannah again she answered at once bernstein dillon where are you took a walk up the high street and ended up at the kings head whats happening all the usual things forensic are onto it now theyve just turned up with the sceneofcrime van have they taken him away theyre bagging him now the brigadiers here ill see if he wants a word she called to ferguson dillon sir do you want to speak to him ferguson who was talking to father thomas called tell him to come to cavendish square ill see you there as well im waiting for the american ambassador dillon she said stay there ill pick you up he got himself a bushmills and moved to the door giving access to the theatre section the young girl on duty had the door half open and was peering inside herself she halfturned as dillon appeared at her shoulder its a sellout im afraid thats all right i just wanted a peek i happen to know grace browning he looked over her shoulder across the darkened room the audience seated at the tables to the brightly lit stage area grace browning dressed in a costume from the nineteen thirties was vigorously denouncing her leading man she turned and stormed off and the audience applauded the young girl said isnt she wonderful you could say that dillon said and smiled yes i think you could he turned away as the intermission crowd started to come out to the bar and saw hannah enter he went to her draining his glass and putting it on the bar i might have known i meant you to wait outside not inside she said lets get going jesus girl the bad mood youre in i got both barrels from the brigadier in his opinion you and i have fallen down on the job rather badly they got into her car and drove away now what happened back there she stepped out from a mausoleum doorway on the other side of bell there wasnt much light and she had the scarf around her head i shouted to bell to get down but she shot him twice silenced weapon of course as i fired in return she faded away and then rather stupid i emptied my gun hoping for a lucky hit while i was reloading she stepped into the path leveled her gun and called to me what did she say dillon told her and the accent was very pakistani no doubt about that when she made off i opened fire again which was when you arrived so were looking for a muslim woman or someone pretending to be one dillon took the harrods shopping bag from inside his trench coat and opened it a pair of muslin trousers and one chador good she said you can get good fingerprints from a plastic bag did you know that no i didnt but why didnt she shoot you hannah shook her head it doesnt make sense and how did she know who you were he lit a cigarette oh thats easy you see i think weve met before nine ferguson was sitting by the fire the telephone in his hand when kim showed them in he waved them to sit yes prime minister of course ill be there in an hour he nodded well have a complete update for you he put the phone down what a ballsup god knows what president clintons going to say yes its bad news im afraid hannah said bad news his face was purple its bloody disastrous i mean you two were supposed to watch out for him it was dillon who said she was ahead of him waiting in ambush in the cemetery it was only chance that i noticed her as we drove off what happened tell me everything which dillon did when he was finished he said a bit of luck finding the muslin trousers and the chador not that theyll help much in my opinion which doesnt count for very much at the moment ferguson told him hannah said dillon has a theory that january will claim this one sir ferguson in the act of taking a cigarette from a silver box paused frowning a little but they just have phoned the bbc about an hour ago thats one of the things the prime minister wants to see me about he lit his cigarette all right dillon lets have it i think weve met before thats why she knew me where belfast when the sons of ulster set me up the lone motorcyclist in black leathers who took out the lookout man i said at the time if you recall that he made a strange gesture raised an arm in salute before riding off and she did exactly the same tonight so it was no man on that motorcycle in belfast it was her another thing sir hannah said the night she saved dillon in belfast she used an ak but all the other hits have been with the same weapon the beretta ive a hunch that the rounds that come out of mr bell will match im not sure that makes sense to me ferguson said but well wait and see what the lab report shows anyway ive got to go and see the pm now to discuss this whole unfortunate affair and the possible repercussions you two will just have to wait here until i get back not much sleep for anyone tonight but thats the way it is simon carter and rupert lang were waiting downstairs when ferguson arrived at downing street good god ferguson what went wrong carter demanded ill explain that to the prime minister ferguson said as an aide took them upstairs are you thoroughly briefed on all this he asked rupert lang nodded im afraid so terrible business he was in fact more uptodate than any of them for he had been at cheyne walk after the show discussing the nights events with grace curry and belov when the call on his cellnet phone had summoned him to downing street the aide showed them into the study the prime minister didnt bother with the courtesies sit down and lets get on with it gentlemen brigadier what went wrong ferguson explained exactly what had happened when he was finished carter snorted angrily so dillon failed this time nonsense it was the prime minister who had spoken there was nothing more that dillon or chief inspector bernstein could have done thats obvious this woman was ahead of them waiting to ambush mr bell what id like to know is how she knew about him knew he was here knew his whereabouts yes a mystery that prime minister ferguson said and dillon has supplied another he explained briefly dillons theory that the motorcyclist in belfast and the muslim woman were one and the same person and it may not be just a theory he concluded dillon predicted who would claim responsibility before we heard about the call to the bbc january the prime minister said surely to god we can do something about these people brigadier i would be obliged if youd mount a special investigation go over everything theyve ever been connected with there must be something some clue or other there must be if there is well find it ferguson told him perhaps the deputy directors people can do the same two separate approaches might turn something up of course prime minister carter told him and id particularly like to find out why this woman didnt shoot dillon when she had the chance the prime minister stood up and warmed his hands at the fire events in ireland are moving faster than i would have thought possible because of this i intend to make my flying visit to see president clinton tomorrow with luck ill be back before anyone knows ive gone i do not i repeat do not want this on the front page of the daily express we understand prime minister carter said but i stress again how worried i am that the protestant factions may get out of hand and ruin all hopes of peace at the most crucial stage this january business tonight will hardly help i know theyve operated across the board appear to kill willynilly but bell was not only a good man he was a catholic and this wont sit well with sinn fein and the ira im afraid youre right rupert lang said the prime minister nodded another thing as you know president clinton appointed mrs jean kennedy smith american ambassador in dublin last year i understand from reports from your people mr carter that there have been threats to her life from loyalist terrorists a lunatic fringe only prime minister perhaps john major nodded but i need hardly point out the disastrous consequences of anything happening to the sister of the most revered american president of the century at the cavendish square flat kim provided sandwiches and tea while ferguson went over the proceedings at downing street with dillon and hannah bernstein so what does he want us to do dillon asked weve already eradicated one of the worst protestant factions and saved ireland from nuclear threat do we work our way through the leadership of the uff and uvf onebyone i dont think that will be necessary ferguson told him but coming up with an answer on january would be more than helpful i want you and the chief inspector to get straight on with it tomorrow go back in all the old files since they first struck check everything again ask the computer for answers he stood up good god two oclock im for bed and he walked out all right for him dillon said as they went downstairs ten paces to his bedroom thats all come off it dillon its only five minutes walk to your place in stable mews hannah said true but a lot further for you i was thinking how about a glass of something to warm you up on this cold night and as you say my place is just around the corner well you can think again she got in her car and switched on the engine night dillon sleep tight she drove off without waiting for his response they were waiting for rupert lang when he got back to cheyne walk grace opened the door for him and led the way into the drawing room where the others were sitting by the fire foul night lang said any coffee tea she nodded at the table freshly made much better for you at this time of night so my friend what happened yuri demanded considerable agitation as you may imagine the prime minister went through the roof carter got stuck into ferguson dillon and bernstein being supposed to keep an eye on liam bell on his way home he felt theyd fallen down on the job and the pm pointed out that as grace was waiting ahead of bell in the cemetery to ambush him it was rather unfair to blame dillon the thing is carter hates his guts well he would belov said what was ferguson s reaction oh he agreed with the prime minister that dillon couldnt be blamed especially as dillon had actually forecast that january would claim credit for the killing he what tom curry said but how could he know lang turned to grace you im afraid my sweet that sons of ulster thing he said that before riding away you raised your arm in a kind of salute so grace browning said calmly it seems you spoke to him tonight quite deliberately in a very pakistani accent she said to use your favorite phrase rupert it muddies the waters fine but you could have shot him and didnt but if he was dead darling nobody would know that the muslim even existed never mind had a pakistani accent bernstein was too far away to see anything but according to the report the old priest at the church saw you run past that was chance rupert i didnt know id be seeing the priest when i confronted dillon i follow your logic belov told her but the arm raised in salute a trifle theatrical but then i am she said simply anyway lang said the prime minister has ordered ferguson to mount a special investigation into january go right through the files see what the computer comes up with hes asked carter to get his people to come up with something similar i dont think we need to worry about that belov said an old story theyve tried before and gotten nowhere i agree tom curry said lang shrugged if you say so belov said anything more yes actually lang smiled i was saving the best till last the prime minister is flying out tomorrow in secret to washington the irish prime minister will join him there and the purpose of the meeting to discuss the final negotiations leading to sinn fein persuading the ira to call a truce of some sort you know how it goes come to the peace table all is forgiven hell be back in twentyfour hours now that is interesting belov said you really must keep me informed on that one rupert he stood up wed better let you get to bed grace she nodded yes i could do with it its been a heavy night she took them to the door and got their coats rupert kissed her on the cheek how about lunch tomorrow the caprice suit you marvelous not me im afraid belov said too conspicuous ill be there curry told her you can count on it they stood for a moment on the pavement waiting for belov to adjust his collapsible umbrella ill get a taxi at the albert bridge belov said and you going the other way we could always walk only a mile and a half to dean close belov hesitated a pity she did what she did i mean alerting dillon like that why on earth this business of the arm raised in salute one brave acknowledging another curry said well it worries me belov said smacks of unbalance she never guaranteed you sanity old sport rupert lang said only a performance its theatre to grace an exciting game thats all and youll just have to put up with that i take your point still belov shrugged id better get off they parted and grace browning watched them go from the parted curtains of her bedroom she turned and moved through the quiet dark and got into bed when she closed her eyes the shadow man was there again the gun raised but only for a split second then he disappeared she smiled and drifted into sleep but why didnt she shoot you hannah asked it was the following morning and she and dillon worked in one of the side offices of ferguson s suite at the ministry of defence try this for size ferguson said from the doorway many assassins stick to the target and dont deviate many psychological profiles agree on that hes right dillon told her if you take underworld killings a professional hit man only goes for his target because thats all hes paid for unless you happen to get in his way hannah said of course ferguson said ill leave you two to sort it out ive got other fish to fry check the letter file on my desk chief inspector and send them out im due at the home office the door closed and hannah said the fact is she could have killed you and didnt even more interesting she could have let me die in belfast and saved my life instead thats the real puzzle what do you mean well wrap your fine police brain around this there is only one possible explanation for belfast she was protecting me so but theres more than one possible explanation for her action last night weve just agreed you werent the target what else do you suggest to start with i dont buy the muslim woman act too up front but lets say she wanted me to see her in that guise and calling to me in that pakistani voice just to reinforce the whole idea without me we wouldnt have known that the assassin was apparently a muslim except for father tom and he was an accident exactly she sighed ill have to go and see to the brigadiers mail she went to the door what about you im going to start with that first hit in wapping the arab go through the others stepbystep see if theres a pattern they did all that at scotland yard they even allowed the fbi to go through the files after that cia man was killed none of them came up with a thing when ordinary men have failed the great dillon may achieve much on your way woman she started to laugh helplessly and went out it was just before lunch that she returned dillon was surrounded by files and working away at the computer keyboard how are you getting on im treating the whole thing as if nothings been done punching in the facts from each case as i see them picking out items which seem strange or unnatural to me and asking the computer to comment and oh nothing yet ill wait until everything is there before putting it into the search pattern anything strike you particularly well in a general way the randomness of it all no apparent pattern he reached for a cigarette the first hit on the waterfront here was wapping that was when the beretta was first used the victim hamid a known arab terrorist the following day colonel boris ashimov who our people knew was head of station kgb london i cant see any connection there i think there must have been i think the two hits were too close together not to be related i dont believe in coincidence i see what you mean then there were two provisional ira men not important just foot soldiers killed in belfast and with the same beretta now i find that particularly strange why two reasons first of all the fact that they werent important i mean if january wanted to make a statement why not do somebody of significance in the ira framework secondly how come the gun turns up in belfast when last used in london hannah sat on the window seat what are you getting at exactly to get from london to belfast you either fly or go by ferry in either case theres strict security to pass through no way of carrying a gun every alarm in the place would go off no terrorist i can think of whether ira or anything else would try it if were talking about our woman of mystery maybe she just decided to take a chance not this woman it would be like committing suicide so whats the answer maybe whoever took the beretta through had a right to lots of people are licensed to carry in northern ireland prominent civil servants members of the judiciary members of parliament plus serving members of the armed forces she hooked her head thats a large assumption someone like carter might think it just a little crazy oh i dont know think of that greek outfit november its an open secret in athens that the members are doctors lawyers politicians theyve killed as ruthlessly as january in the last few years and never been caught an interesting idea well never mind that now the fact that january means bloody sunday has no significance we know from information the ira have passed over that theyre not a known irish republican group they not only killed those two provos in belfast they did the two bombers released on a technicality by the courts here in london yes their operations do appear to be totally random you can say that again theyve killed arabs prods a cia man two kgb men here in london and a wellknown east end gangster and now an examerican senator yes random it certainly is dillon nodded but only in the sense that theyll do anybody its almost as if they dont take sides hannah said no i dont buy that dillon shook his head i dont think its as random as it looks i think theres a purpose it beats me she stood up do you feel like some lunch give me ten minutes i just want to tap a few more facts in she went back to her desk and busied herself with some papers after a while he came in how do you fancy some pub food in wapping she sat back what are you up to the gangster who was shot in highgate cemetery sharp along with that kgb man silsev what about him according to the file his chauffeur found him a man named bert gordon so he said he didnt see or hear a thing said he sat in the car at the cemetery gates reading the paper until so much time had gone by he got worried so he went and found them hannah said i read that file too yes he said his boss had a meet but he didnt know who with or what it was about so oh ive a suspicious nature id imagine he knows more than hes said i mean an east end hood meets the head of station kgb for london in highgate cemetery in the rain and they both get wasted come on girl dear theres got to be a good reason she nodded you think you can get this bert gordon to tell you what he wouldnt tell scotland yard i can be very persuasive all right she stood up where do we find him runs a pub in wapping called the prince albert she picked up her shoulder bag well take the car come on and she led the way out as they went downstairs she said knowing how you operate i think police presence very sensible you drive while i talk to central records office at scotland yard i might as well find out all there is to know about mr bert gordon the prince albert was at the end of a wharf in wapping overlooking the river it looked in good order brightly painted in green and gold they got out of the car and hannah looked across the cobbled street itll be like a grave at lunchtime and shouldertoshoulder at the bar tonight and how would you be knowing that he asked i did my time on the pavement as a constable in tower bridge division lots of pubs like this down there one fight a night and two on fridays we used to say shocking he said a nice jewish girl like you and friday night the start of the sabbath very funny she said and led the way in there was a long mahogany bar mirrors on the wall behind fronted by bottles tables were scattered here and there and there were three booths by the window the only customers were two very old men sitting on high stools pints of beer in front of them while they stared up at a television set suspended from the ceiling in a corner the barmaid was reading a newspaper and looked up she was middleaged with hair that had obviously been dyed black and a careworn face what can i get you mr bert gordon dillon said there was something in her eyes as if she sensed trouble he isnt here who wants him anyway hannah produced her id and held it up detective chief inspector bernstein so tell him to come out like a good boy dillon told her hed been aware of the door slightly ajar at the end of the bar now it opened and gordon stepped out dillon recognized him from his photo in the file its okay myra ill handle it he took hannahs id card and examined it then passed it back nice jewish girl in a job like that disgraceful you should be married with two kids im jewish myself i know mr gordon you changed your name from goldberg years ago antisemitism used to be a problem when i was a kid yes well a change of name didnt keep a nice jewish boy out of prison i calculate youve done fifteen years when you add it together so i did my time what is this anyway we want a little information dillon said about the killing of your old boss in highgate cemetery gordon shrugged i told the police everything i knew i gave evidence at the inquest its all in the record i wouldnt say all was the right word hannah said in fact you were rather sparse on facts so lets talk all right he said reluctantly and raised the bar flap follow me and he led the way out through the door anyone like a drink he asked he and hannah were sitting on either side of a large cluttered kitchen table no thank you hannah answered well ill join you dillon told him just to stay friendly you dont look to me as if youve ever been friendly to anyone in your life my old son gordon said scotch all right he splashed whisky into two glasses and handed dillon one the irishman went and stood by the door hannah said albert samuel goldberg known as gordon i checked you out quite a record bookies runner as a kid professional boxer nightclub bouncer then you were mixed up in that gold bullion robbery at heathrow in march seventythree you served three years ancient history grievous bodily harm assault with a deadly weapon armed robbery in seventynine you got ten years and served seven lately youve been frank sharps chauffeur and minder he always looked after you didnt he but then he wasnt the one who went to prison it was idiots like you frank was good to me he was good to all his boys he swallowed his scotch but like i said all ancient history so what is this you said you didnt know who your boss was meeting at highgate and that youd no idea what the meet was about thats what i told those guys from scotland yard and thats what i told the coroners inquest hannah leaned back in her chair then why is it i dont believe you fuck you darling gordon told her and mind you thats not a bad idea naughty that dillon said bad language to a lady brings out the worst in me well fuck you too gordon said and reached for the whisky bottle dillons hand came out of his trench coat pocket clutching the silenced walther there was a dull thud and the whisky bottle shattered in gordons hand jesus christ he jumped up soaked in whisky whats going on here i didnt count on shooters what kind of police are you he reached for a kitchen towel and dillon said just keep thinking gestapo and well get along im very good with this thing i could shoot half your right ear off he leveled the walther and gordon put up a hand and cowered away for gods sake no dillon stop it hannah ordered when im finished he lowered the walther i could say youre going to tell me the truth because frank sharp was a friend of yours and youd like to see the people responsible pay gordon was shaking and mopped himself down dillon continued but well forget about loyalty morality all that good old english rubbish well say youre going to speak up in the next five seconds because if you dont i really will shoot your ear off dillon for gods sake hannah said gordon put up a hand defensively okay i give in just let me get another drink i need it he found another bottle of scotch in a cupboard and opened it and dillon said you knew it was this russian silsev that sharp was meeting in the cemetery yes frank told me the meet was at the karl marx statue i asked if he wanted me along but he said no and you knew what the meeting was about hannah asked it was to do with drugs frank said this silsev geezer was kgb working in london but he had connections with this moscow mafia and what are we talking about hannah asked heroin frank said a street value of maybe a hundred million i see she nodded and thats all you know about it on my mothers life frank said this guy had approached him and no other mob in london told him he was offering him the deal of a lifetime so no one else knew of course not i mean why would this silsev geezer approach anyone else frank was the number one man in the east end for years he poured a little more scotch hand shaking dillon said you just sat in the car waiting for him like i told the cops and i didnt hear a thing the gun must have been silenced i sat there reading the paper until i got worried and went looking and you saw nobody like i told the police nobody think hard dillon said its raining heavily and getting dark and youre sitting there at the wheel with the newspaper and no one came out ive told you gordon paused frowning here just a minute yes thats right it was as if he was looking back and recreating the scene yes this big bike came out through the gates the guy in the saddle wore black leathers and one of those black helmets you cant see through bingo dillon said give the man the star prize god you were a bastard in there dillon she told him as they drove away dont ever do that to me again it got a result he said exact description of our mystery rider from belfast and you now know what silsev and sharp were up to my god she said heroin at a street value of a hundred million pounds it doesnt bear thinking of well dont he said lets call in at mulligans in cork street smoked salmon and champagne im driving dillon i know girl dear ill drink the champagne for you you can content yourself with the smoked salmon he sat back grinning and lit a cigarette washington london ten it was raining in washington driving in from the river through the late afternoon as the large sedan moved along constitution avenue toward the white house in spite of the weather there was a sizable crowd on pennsylvania avenue not only tourists but a fair smattering of journalists and tv cameras the chauffeur lowered the glass screen that separated him from the rear its going to be difficult getting at the front without them recognizing you senator patrick keogh leaned forward lets try the east entrance the sedan turned up east executive avenue pulled up at the gate where the guard recognizing keogh at once waved them through the east entrance was used frequently by white house staff and by diplomatic visitors who wanted to avoid the attention of the media keogh got out and said to the chauffeur dont know how long ill be on this one and went up the steps when he got inside he found a secret service agent on duty a young marine lieutenant in razorsharp uniform talking to him the lieutenant snapped to attention good evening senator how did you know id use this entrance i didnt senator i have a colleague at the front entrance as well keogh smiled amiably now thats what i call sound strategic thinking the young man smiled back at him if youll follow me senator the presidents waiting when they entered the oval office the room was in halfdarkness curtains drawn most of the light coming from a table lamp on the massive desk and a standard lamp in one corner it was a room entirely familiar to keogh with its array of service flags a room he had visited many times to speak to more than one president a different one now behind the desk bill clinton but it was the other occupant of the room at ease in a wingback chair that surprised keogh john major ah there you are patrick i appreciate you coming at such short notice clinton said i believe you two know each other mr prime minister keogh held out his hand as john major stood up a real pleasure senator john major said please be seated patrick and well get to it clinton told him by the way theres coffee over there if youd like i think i would ill help myself which keogh proceeded to do he finally returned to the desk area and took a spare chair yours to command mr president id like to believe thats true and in a way it makes what im going to ask you especially difficult patrick keogh paused the cup to his mouth and then he smiled that slightly lopsided grin that had always been a personal feature and his face was suddenly suffused with immense charm cant wait mr president i can tell this is going to be real special it is patrick in fact its probably more important than anything youve been involved in in your entire political life and what would it be concerned with ireland and the peace process keogh paused his face serious and then he quite deliberately emptied his cup and put it on the small table beside him please go on mr president we know how hard youve worked behind the scenes with other committed irish americans toward achieving peace in ireland john major said and the visits to ireland of former congressman bruce morrison and his friends have proved a real help in the necessary consultations its nice of you to say so prime minister keogh said but its no burden the killing has gone on too long this thing in ireland must come to an end now what is it you want me to do wed like you to go to ireland for us the president said good god keoghs head went back and he laughed me go to ireland but why because to use that old irish phrase youre one of their own youre as irish as the kennedy family hell ive read about what happened when president kennedy went there in nineteen sixtythree and visited the old kennedy farm clinton looked at a paper in front of him dunganstown you were with him patrick keogh nodded his greatgrandfather left there back in the nineteenth century at the same time mine did to become a cooper in boston he smiled at john major no offense prime minister but the english didnt leave large numbers of irish much option in those days except to get out true john major said in selfdefense id point out that many came to england and prospered its estimated at least eight million of the english population are irish or of irish descent thats right keogh said but the american tradition is especially strong you know that year i went to berlin with jack kennedy and he made the famous speech he challenged the communist system he said ich bin ein berliner at that moment in time he was the most famous man in the world absolutely john major said and deservedly so then he went to ireland to dublin and stayed at our embassy in phoenix park then wexford and on to dunganstown and mary kennedy ryans cottage first cousins second cousins every kind of cousin patrick keogh laughed they all turned up and the crowds when he visited new ross the town shut down and then he spoke to the irish parliament keogh shook his head when he left at shannon airport thousands turned out to see him go women were crying i know clinton said by the way the irish prime minister sends his regrets hed hoped to be with us but the peace movement has gathered such momentum in ireland he just couldnt leave i understand keogh said so what is it you want me to do clinton turned to john major prime minister as the president has said wed like you to go to ireland let me explain the peace process has moved very fast gerry adams for sinn fein and john hume have between them started a genuine groundswell toward peace in the communities do you believe this to be true of the protestant loyalists as well keogh asked yes in the generality the hardliners on both sides will still be a difficulty and if the ira do stand down a further problem will be in persuading the other side that its genuine but well cross that bridge when we come to it john major smiled i call it the paisley bridge keogh grinned now that is one hell of a bridge to cross president clinton said but first and foremost we need a ceasefire from the ira adams and sinn fein have tried hard and so have bruce morrison and his friends but its a question of persuading the hardliners to agree it cant be partial it must be total all or nothing the thing is major said theres the prospect of a secret meeting in ireland soon all sections of the ira getting together even splinter groups like inla now if you could attend that meeting throw your weight behind adams john hume and the peace movement the effect might be incalculable your name means a lot over there the president said it might just tip the balance keogh shook his head im not so sure why should they listen to patrick keogh ive not been exactly everybodys cup of coffee for some time now its worth a try patrick dont put yourself down clinton got up and paced around politics is so often just a game no one knows that better than the three of us but now and then not very often perhaps but now and then something comes along thats worth everything i think that after twentyfive years of war in ireland we might just have a chance this time of doing something about it and i sure as hell would hate to see that chance go there was silence for a moment keogh sitting there frowning and then he sighed id find it difficult to argue with that so how am i going to get in on this meeting nothing official clinton said look around this office you dont see my national security adviser no cia presence no one from the fbi or justice and state the prime minister and i believe that this should be under wraps until its actually happened and how in the hell do we do that ive given the matter some thought clinton said and then the other day i saw something rather interesting in the washington post there was a report that mentioned a stainedglass window of your greatgreatuncle who was a catholic bishop and which was recently installed at drumgoole abbey its a convent run by the little sisters of pity i understand thats correct mr president this stainedglass window is in a small chapel the keogh chapel i understand you helped create a foundation to assist in the development of the school the little sisters run there i was fortunate enough to be able to interest a few business associates in the work there but youve not visited the place yet i will when i can keogh told him why not now patrick clinton said lets say you go to paris on holiday the press wont get too excited about that you go via ireland put down at shannon airport and proceed onwards by helicopter to drumgoole abbey announcing that you want to visit the chapel you see the point john major put in the press and tv are caught on the hop youre on your way before they know its happening thats right clinton said if you turn up theyll lay on a service at the abbey turn out the kids from the boarding school and wave you off as you fly back to shannon only on the way youll put down at a place called ardmore house thats where the sinn fein and ira meeting will take place youll do your thing for good or ill keogh said for good patrick im certain of it then back to shannon and onwards to paris keogh nodded slowly totally secret the whole thing absolutely you see the visit to drumgoole abbey would take care of any reports of you being sighted at shannon provide an explanation the mother superior wouldnt be told of your visit until you were on the way yes i understand that there was another pause and john major said gently is there a problem senator only if this doesnt stay top secret patrick keogh said im aware that the american ambassador in dublin has received death threats from hardline protestant loyalist groups i understand shes been referred to as that kennedy bitch god knows what theyd call me yes we are very concerned about the other sides attitude in all this john major said but we cant let that stand in the way of our negotiations of course not keogh said but if news got out about what im supposed to be trying to achieve there are those on the orange side of the line who might think it would make sense to remove me permanently from the scene lets face it the murder of liam bell doesnt exactly fill one with hope clinton went back to his chair behind the desk and sat down god knows this wouldnt be a picnic and we are asking you to put yourself on the line thats why i suggest following the procedure ive laid out all very low key only a very small circle of people will know what about the ira conference theyll know john major said gerry adams wants things to happen now no doubt about that im sure we can work something out for example what if you were introduced as a total surprise i like it clinton said the shock effect would be tremendous so what do you think patrick im not sure keogh sighed i cant argue with the importance of all this but youre asking me to go into the war zone and im getting old he smiled that wry smile again okay maybe im kind of scared at the prospect but i do have my family to consider i would have to consult my wife and shes gone down to our house at hyannis port were only three miles down the beach from ted kennedy how long do you need twentyfour hours john major said i leave at noon tomorrow right ill be in touch before then he stood up and clinton pressed the buzzer for the aide ive given instructions to the commanding officer at andrews air force base to grant you every facility if you want to go to hyannis port tonight theyll speed you on your way thats kind mr president keogh held out his hand to john major prime minister well speak tomorrow the door opened behind him the marine lieutenant appeared and patrick keogh turned and went out he didnt even bother to go to his washington home simply told his chauffeur to take him to andrews air force base and spoke to the commanding officer on the car phone to let him know he was coming on the way he changed his mind and told his chauffeur to divert to arlington national cemetery it was raining harder now so he took an umbrella his chauffeur provided and walked to president kennedys grave he stood there for quite some time lost in thought and an aging lady who also held an umbrella over her head walked up what a man she said the greatest president this century i couldnt disagree with that keogh said he gave people hope she said that was his greatest gift and he had courage on top of that he was a war hero amazing he certainly was she glanced sideways excuse me but do i know you you look familiar patrick keogh gave her that immensely charming smile no i dont think so im nobody special and he turned and walked away at andrews they provided a helicopter but pointed out that the cape cod area was not good that evening with heavy fog at hyannis port the best they could offer was a flight to otis air force base on cape cod itself and onward transportation by limousine he had no quarrel with that and found himself on his way within twenty minutes drifting out across the potomac as dusk settled on the horizon he tried to read the washington post but his brain refused to take it in he could think of only one thing the situation outlined to him by the president and the british prime minister it came to him with sudden clarity that he was faced with the most important decision of his life in london it was almost midnight and dillon was working away at his desk checking computer printouts it was very quiet suddenly the door opened and hannah bernstein entered she was wearing a raincoat i dont believe this ive been trying to contact you all night why didnt you have your answerphone on i hate those bloody things i then had the crazy thought that you might still be here he ignored her checking a printout so you were right then he put the printout down and sat back swivelling in the seat do you believe in coincidence sometimes why do you ask carl jung used to speak about something he called synchronicity events having an apparent coincidence in time and the feeling that some deeper motivation is involved and whats that got to do with january oh i dont know the ould heads pounding from it all all those hits with the beretta thats no coincidence its a fact four ira men stiffed thats a fact no chance there so he lit a cigarette two heads of station kgb london knocked off now why i asked myself why two and then good old bert gordon gives us the reason for the silsev and sharp hit drugs and why was ashimov killed i dont know but its synchronicity that we go to beirut and find another kgb officer on the make this time flogging plutonium youre not suggesting a connection only in that it indicates that the kgb or whatever they call themselves now seem to be dipping their fingers into every racket available so what does that tell you that there might be a russian connection somewhere so ive asked the computer to check everything for me as regards the soviet embassy in london personnel the lot brilliant she said any other coincidences you want to check strange you should say that but there is and for the life of me i cant think what it is are you serious absolutely then you really do need a nights sleep he stood up and reached for his jacket my place or yours where shall i kick you dillon just tell me she said now come on ill drop you off and she led the way out when the limousine reached the hyannis port house from otis air force base patrick keogh was tired and the last few miles through thick fog had been a real strain the driver an air force sergeant declined the offer of a cup of coffee and started back immediately keogh stood there for a moment and suddenly a wind blew in strongly from the sea tearing the fog into tatters and he could see the white surf on the edge of the beach on impulse he walked down there and stood listening to the waves thundering in the wind in his face a voice called pat are you there it was his wife and he turned and saw her a few yards away a flashlight in her hand are you all right is anything wrong they phoned me from otis to say you were on your way i heard the car he put an arm around her and kissed her my head was feeling a little thick you know what helicopters are i just felt like a blow well go in now in the kitchen he poured a little scotch whisky into a glass and added branch water while mary made coffee a literary agent by profession she was nobodys fool but more than that she was a woman with a womans uncanny instinct to sense when things werent right she poured coffee you shouldnt have this you wont sleep i wont sleep anyway not tonight she sat on the opposite side of the table tell me about it pat so he did when he was finished she said it could be a can of worms theyre asking you to put yourself on the line even the ira cant control all their people there are splinter groups real crazies look at those inla people who killed mountbatten and these protestant loyalists are just as bad ulster volunteer force ulster freedom fighters then theres the red hand of ulster theyre the kind of fanatics whod kill queen elizabeth if they thought it would advance their cause and theyd still call themselves loyalists while doing it she shook her head its a mad crazy world over there so much killing so many years of brutality which is why it has to stop he reached for the coffee pot it takes courage to make that decision by the way i went to arlington before i came down after all it was jack kennedy who got me into politics i felt close you always will be but while were on the subject of heroes he gave her a wry smile where im concerned some would say i have made a considerable number of errors but not this time this time im going to stand up and be counted youre going to go im afraid so can i go with you no she sighed i see are you angry with me no proud of you actually good he stood up and reached out a hand lets go to bed ill fly back to washington in the morning and inform the president and john major of my decision it was a fine bright morning with a patchy sky the washington streets cleared by the rain as keoghs sedan once again turned into the white house by the east entrance when keogh went in the marine lieutenant from the previous evening was waiting good morning senator dont they ever give you any time off keogh asked seldom sir the young officer smiled im a fourthgeneration marine senator path of duty and all that if youll come this way the president and the prime minister are in the rose garden as keogh joined them clinton turned and smiled you must have got up early you could say that but i wanted to catch you both together before the prime minister left youre going to go clinton said yes i think you can count on that what kind of time scale are we talking about clinton turned to john major who said quite soon the next few days obviously the irish prime minister must know and gerry adams well let you know at the soonest possible moment patrick clinton told him thats fine im at your disposal there is of course the question of your personal safety clinton said patrick keogh smiled wryly mr president im a big target having said that i dont take kindly to the idea of a dozen secret servicemen surrounding me at all times but you must have some security clinton was shocked yes well maybe we should look to our british cousins for that they are after all the experts where ireland is concerned he turned to john major wouldnt you agree prime minister im afraid so john major replied right lets examine the problem i land at shannon helicopter to drumgoole drop in at ardmore house then back to shannon i hardly need the sas to take care of that who would you recommend mi no as the operation takes place in a foreign country it would be mi senator you dont sound too enthusiastic keogh said come on prime minister im putting myself on the line so who have you got whos your best my best is rather unusual john major said what some people call the prime ministers private army for some years now there has been such a group specifically targeting terrorism and responsible to the prime minister only i like the sound of that are they any good extremely good though rather ruthless the unit is commanded by brigadier charles ferguson john major hesitated there is one unusual thing i should tell you ferguson s righthand man is called sean dillon he was a feared ira enforcer for years then in ninetyone he tried to blow me up at downing street when the war cabinet was meeting patrick keogh laughed his delight the dog and now hes working for you and ireland in his way like most of us he thinks its gone on too long good keogh nodded and turned to clinton mr president ive agreed to go but these are my terms i want ferguson and this man dillon taking care of me when im there clinton glanced at major and the prime minister nodded no problem to that end id like to meet them as soon as possible can you have them over here fast would tomorrow suit john major asked and they all started to laugh in london charles ferguson sat in his office and listened to the prime minister on the secure phone as he crossed the atlantic of course prime minister he said ill take care of it he put the phone down and sat there frowning for a moment finally he picked up the internal phone and spoke to hannah bernstein get in here and bring dillon he got up went to the map wall fiddled around until he was finally able to pull down a largescale map of ireland he was examining it when hannah bernstein and dillon entered do you know where drumgoole abbey is ferguson asked dillon and what decent catholic doesnt dillon moved beside him and pointed have you taken to religion brigadier little sisters of pity there very holy ferguson ignored him ardmore house dillon frowned slightly naughty brigadier very naughty the provisional ira have been known to meet there on more than one occasion and will again only this time theyll have a special guest whose welfare well be responsible for may i ask who that might be sir hannah bernstein inquired of course you may my dear its senator patrick keogh he told her eleven the following morning ferguson reported for a breakfast meeting at downing street when he was shown into the study the prime minister carter and rupert lang were having coffee ah there you are brigadier ive already filled in the deputy director and mr lang on my discussions with the president and senator keogh i see ferguson said gravely i would remind you that you stressed absolute secrecy in this business as i understood you both the president and senator keogh were adamant about that i can assure you that no one else outside of this room will know about the affair the prime minister said to be frank im not mentioning it to the cabinet not even to the secretary of state for northern ireland that may seem strange considering the fact that ive informed mr lang but he after all is here in another capacity as a member of this rather special committee dont you trust us ferguson carter demanded belligerently silly questions dont need an answer ferguson said but as i see it senator keoghs offered to put his head into the mouth of the lion that shows considerable courage i want to make sure he has every chance of taking it out again you really do think he could be in danger rupert lang asked ferguson sat there frowning the prime minister said brigadier well lets look at it this way prime minister say you were a protestant terrorist group who didnt want the peace initiative to work can you think of a better way of ruining it than killing patrick keogh one of the kennedy old guard perhaps the most respected senator in washington simon carter nodded it was almost with reluctance that he said hes right and it wouldnt just be the ira up in arms but the entire irish nation rupert lang said id have thought the same argument would apply where ira extremists are concerned explain the prime minister said ive seen the reports we all have there are plenty of hardliners in the ira who dont agree with gerry adams and his supporters politicizing the struggle there are plenty who still want to go down the path of the gun and the bomb there might well be amongst them people who would see the advantage in killing keogh and why would that be john major asked because the automatic assumption would be that the protestants were responsible ferguson said i think youll find all negotiations would break down and pretty permanently im afraid hes right carter said the prime minister nodded thoughtfully then well just have to see that it doesnt happen and thats your department brigadier carter interrupted the security services would be happy to help we do have considerable expertise on the ground in ireland i hardly need to stress that but not in the republic john major said and smiled slightly that would be illegal wouldnt it a technicality as you know prime minister mi operates there all the time not on this occasion senator keogh has been specific about his security as i told you he turned to ferguson does the assignment give you any problems not at all prime minister senator keogh arrives out of the blue at shannon helicopter trip to drumgoole where the mother superior wont even know hes coming until hes on the way lets say half an hour on site then on to ardmore house where only gerry adams will be expecting him and what about security there rupert lang demanded general security will be as good as you want ferguson said the ira run a tight ship at these affairs all the delegates will be shocked out of their socks when adams produces him hell have finished his speech before they have time to recover and back to shannon and away put that way it all sounds terribly simple the prime minister said it could be ferguson told him but with one proviso total secrecy nobody must know hes coming at any point in the trip shannon drumgoole ardmore nobody must know and just you and dillon guarding him no ill take chief inspector bernstein as well the three of us should suffice the prime minister nodded right lets pray it works he turned to the other two this meeting at ardmore should take place in a matter of days ill notify you of course but for now well adjourn the brigadier is due in washington he shook ferguson s hand good luck brigadier youve never handled anything of greater importance the lear jet left gatwick at tenthirty with the usual two raf pilots ferguson and dillon in the rear the brigadier worked his way through two newspapers for half an hour while dillon read a magazine later as they crossed the welsh coast and moved out to sea the irishman made tea plenty of sandwiches in here brigadier if you feel peckish not now later chief inspector bernstein didnt seem too happy she feels left out of things well thats just too bad i mean someones got to mind the shop he shook his head women are so unreasonable dillon they dont think like us different species my god if the sisterhood heard you say that theyd tear you limb from limb sexist racist chauvinistic and of the male variety my dear boy you know exactly what i mean heres bernstein brilliant and capable firstclass honors from cambridge marvelous police record i mean shes shown herself capable of shooting a man when necessary and a woman dillon said yes i was forgetting that so why does she now have to go into a pet because she isnt going to washington maybe she just fancied meeting pat keogh well she will eventually you should have made that clear nonsense ferguson handed back his mug another cup of tea and tell me what you think of all this dillon said as he made the tea you mean whether keogh turning up at ardmore house would have any effect on sinn fein and the ira well would it you should know you were in the bloody movement for long enough times change dillon lit a cigarette and men change with them irish people north and south of the border protestant and catholic want peace oh there are still the traditional hardliners on both sides but if we stick with sinn fein and the ira i think youll find theres groundswell support for peace twentyfive years is too long having said that gerry adams martin mcguinness people like that who want to take the whole thing into the political arena need all the help they can get and yes keogh could help why particularly he worked with president kennedy in the old days for one thing and thats a special kind of irish legend for another his credentials are good hes a catholic nobody can query him which could be important if he makes the right speech well lets hope he does how have you got on with the january investigation fine ive disregarded all previous investigations sifted through every piece of information put it all on the computer and instituted various searches the chief inspector is going to check the results as they come through while im away well lets hope you turn something up ferguson said and reached for another newspaper at that moment in the office at the ministry of defence the printer was churning out the latest batch of information from one of dillons searches his inquiry about staff at the russian embassy as it happened hannah put the sheets together mainly text information but also photos amongst them was yuri belovs not that his face meant anything to her she placed them in neat piles and left them on dillons desk she went back into her own office rather disconsolate annoyed that shed missed out on the american trip but there was nothing to be done about that rain drove against the window she wondered how dillon and the brigadier were getting on out there over the atlantic then sat down at her desk with a sigh and started to sort through the days mail when grace browning answered the door at the cheyne walk house she found tom curry on the doorstep this is a nice surprise she said as she led the way through to the kitchen i was just making coffee business im afraid rupert phoned me curry told her something very bigs come up he and yuri will be round directly have you any idea what it is she asked as she made the coffee no cant help just as much in the dark as you ill put some extra cups out then at that moment the doorbell rang ill get it curry told her and went out by the time shed prepared a tray and carried it through to the drawing room they were there the three of them standing by the fire rupert kissed her on the cheek ravishing as always save the compliments whats this all about she asked as she poured the coffee tell them rupert belov said when lang had finished recounting the details of his meeting at downing street there was silence for a moment then curry spoke very interesting but what are we talking about here sinn fein and the ira are very close to calling at least a truce and going to the peace table belov said if that happens there would be enormous pressure on the various protestant groups to also call a ceasefire international pressure lang said ill tell you that for nothing peace in ireland grace said that wouldnt suit you would it yuri what youd like to see is another bosnia she laughed what a shame all your hopes of ireland descending into chaos and a good communist state emerging at the other end have gone up in smoke not necessarily he said if keogh was assassinated on this trip the effect would be incredible especially if one of the protestant loyalist factions was to blame and you think thats a possibility tom curry said why they wouldnt even know he was there yes but we would belov smiled and this time january wouldnt claim credit wed give that to the uff or the red hand of ulster there was total silence now until lang said the ultimate hit my god yuri you are ambitious grace brownings heart was beating fast her mouth was dry with excitement belov said when does your show finish at the kings head saturday two days belov nodded since rupert first phoned me ive spoken to my dublin sources the word is that this ira conference will take place on sunday afternoon grace took a deep breath how would i get there very simple straight in and out theres a man who does the occasional flight for me highly illegal of course his name is jack carson he operates a small air taxi service from a little airfield in kent near a village called coldwater he owns a couple of twinengined planes and he could do the irish run no problem hes mainly done france for me in the past but he did ireland once before a year ago its just like england scores of small landing strips out there in the countryside im sure he could find one very close to this drumgoole place i say drumgoole because i imagine that will be the soft spot you cant go after keogh at ardmore house with provisional ira gunmen all over the place but what about air traffic control and so on curry asked i mean you have to log flights and get permission oh carson s used to that no flight plan means youre a bogey on someones radar screen but there are lots of bogeys up there including birds and if you know where to go theres a lot of airspace thats not controlled but the approach to the irish coast rupert lang said surely that presents a difficulty not at all if he hits the coast at six hundred feet hell be below their radar screens belov shrugged this man is good and he knows his business it will work and what happens at the other end once we know where carson will land ill arrange for my people in dublin to leave a car and then what happens grace asked i dont know but were talking about an abbey nuns schoolchildren not fort knox i still need to get close youll come up with something no we will tom curry put an arm around her shoulder no arguments grace im coming too she turned to lang what do you think he always did like his own way he smiled wryly wish i could come along but i rather obviously cant on this occasion it sounds like fun belov said right ill get things started with carson and it only remains for rupert to keep us informed he smiled and held out his cup could i have some more coffee when the lear jet landed at andrews air force base and dillon and ferguson disembarked they were met by a young air force captain brigadier general ferguson right this way sir theres a helicopter waiting to take you to otis air force base youll be taken from there by limousine to senator keoghs house at hyannis port ill see your bags are delivered to your hotel within five minutes they were strapped in and taking off brigadier general dillon said youve been promoted no thats the american terminology he said we stopped using the general bit years ago i thought wed be seeing keogh in washington so did i until we were halfway across the atlantic i wonder why the change i expect hell tell us when he wants us to know ferguson opened his briefcase produced a map of ireland and unfolded it now show me ardmore house and drumgoole again when the limousine deposited them outside the hyannis port house it was mrs keogh who met them at the front door brigadier ferguson im mary keogh a pleasure maam sean dillon he held out his hand and she looked eyeing him curiously now you ive heard a great deal about mr dillon all bad i suppose im afraid so ah well you cant win them all she turned to ferguson actually my husbands walking on the beach i see ferguson said perhaps we could join him why not ill see you in a little while of course as they turned to go she called brigadier ferguson paused maam im not happy about this i understand maam believe me she closed the door and went in dillon lit a cigarette a good woman that one yes im inclined to agree ferguson said now lets go and find the senator on the beach the surf pounded in with a great roaring and it was very windy they saw patrick keogh in the distance walking toward them occasionally stopping to throw a stick for a black dog that ran in circles around him as he got closer they could see he was wearing heavy corduroy trousers and an aran sweater brigadier ferguson yes senator ferguson shook hands a pleasure sir and this must be the great sean dillon keogh held out his hand jesus mary and joseph senator and isnt that overdoing it dillon said ah but isnt that what we irish always do lets walk awhile of course sir ferguson said im sorry to make john major rush you two across the atlantic at such short notice but with my wife being concerned that i might get my head blown off i decided that where security was concerned i wanted the best and your prime minister said that was you two very flattering ferguson said dillon cut in no false modesty needed brigadier well do as good a job as anyone and better than most he lit a cigarette in cupped hands im a plain man senator so one irishman to another why are you doing this because if the wrong people got on your case you really could get your head blown off dillon ferguson said sharply no keogh put up a hand ill answer that jack kennedy once said something about good men doing nothing you know just standing by well maybe ive stood by on too many occasions ferguson said i remember when you made the cover of time magazine during the vietnam war when khe san was besieged you insisted on flying in on a factfinding mission and ended up manning a heavy machine gun as i heard and took a bullet in the shoulder there were those especially my political opponents who thought i was grandstanding brigadier i could never compare with bobby kennedy i worked closely with him he never shirked an issue helped guide us through the cuban missile crisis had the guts to stand up to the mafia served his country and gave his life he stood gazing out to sea and dillon said you think you should do the same good god no patrick keogh rocked with laughter sean my friend just for once i want to get something absolutely right something that i myself can respect but i sure as hell dont want to finish up facedown doing it which is why i want you and the brigadier he laughed again now lets go and have something to eat and then we can talk some more they had a light meal in the kitchen salad salmon and new potatoes just the four of them around the kitchen table afterwards over the coffee keogh said so lets go over it again brigadier well as i told the prime minister it can all be very simple you drop in at shannon totally unexpected i believe that for political reasons its essential that your appearance at the ira conference at ardmore house should be kept secret and perhaps for some time i agree but even arriving at shannon in a private gulfstream doesnt mean you wont be recognized ground staff baggage handlers who knows and someone will talk rumors will start and the media will get to hear of it but too late to be able to do anything about it mary keogh said exactly the brigadier nodded it can be said afterwards that the sole reason for the stop at shannon was that the senator on a sudden whim decided he wanted to see the keogh chapel at that stage no one will know about the stopoff at ardmore house on the way back its certainly slick the senator said but security his wife said im concerned about that no need to be dillon myself and detective chief inspector hannah bernstein my aide will be with him at all times i need hardly stress that the usual ira efficiency will ensure security at ardmore house and i know drumgoole abbey dillon said its miles from anywhere in a beautiful valley theres the abbey itself the convent with its school just nuns and children itll work keogh patted his wifes hand reassuringly well have some more coffee on the porch then ill let you gentlemen go sitting there looking down at the beach the sea wild beyond mary keogh said im intrigued mr dillon my husband asked for your background hes told me about you but there are things i dont understand you went to the royal academy of dramatic art in london you acted with the national theatre thats right dillon said but then you joined the ira i was nineteen years of age mrs keogh and living in london with my father nineteen seventyone it was he went to belfast on a holiday and was killed by cross fire british paratroopers and ira an accident only you didnt see it that way there was real sympathy in her eyes not at nineteen dillon lit a cigarette so i joined the glorious cause and never looked back ferguson said on the mostwanted list for years is it true you tried to blow up the british war cabinet in february ninetyone keogh asked now do i look the kind of fella that would do a thing like that dillon said keogh roared with laughter yes actually you do my fine irish friend mrs keogh said im still puzzled how come you changed sides i fought for what i believed in im not ashamed of that although i never approved of the bomb as a weapon for me that was the greatest weakness in the ira campaign not just the dead but fifty thousand ordinary people maimed or injured women in a shopping mall kids he shrugged in the end nothings worth that not even a united ireland something goes click in your head you change i finally caught up with him in a serb prison ferguson said they were going to shoot him for flying medical supplies in for children i managed to make a deal he shrugged now he works for me and ill say amen to that i couldnt be happier on this occasion patrick keogh told them ill go and tell your driver to bring the limousine round and ill inform otis youre on your way he got up moved to the door and turned oh by the way the president wants to meet you when you get back to washington mrs keogh said her goodbyes and went inside ferguson dillon and keogh stood by the limousine for a moment tell me dillon keogh said do you really think it will work peace in ireland a lot is going to depend on protestant reaction dillon said on how threatened they feel theres an old prod toast senator our country too if they think the other side will allow them that observation there might be hope our country too keogh nodded i like that it has a ring to it he looked solemn perhaps i could use that at ardmore ferguson said well be seeing you soon sir at shannon only a matter of days brigadier and youre happy senator am i hell keogh laughed frightened to death ah well we all get like that dillon told him its a healthy sign you know i once made a speech that for various reasons didnt appeal to a lot of people but it appealed to me keogh told them i said something about a man doing what he must in spite of personal consequences that whatever sacrifices he faces if he follows his conscience he alone must decide on the course he must follow they stood there in silence and it started to rain keogh flung back his head and roared with laughter hell that sounded like a campaign speech off you go gentlemen and ill see you at shannon he turned and went inside in the helicopter ferguson busied himself with papers from his briefcase and hardly said a word it was later when they were being driven from andrews in an air force limousine through the heavy washington traffic that he finally put the papers away and leaned back interesting man patrick keogh triumphs on occasion but also tragedies and mistakes but hes still here dillon said hes a survivor he doesnt whine when something goes wrong he picks himself up and gets on with it you liked him oh yes i think hes a man who can look in the mirror and not be afraid ferguson said i didnt know you had an artistic soul dillon and at that moment they reached the white house and were delivered to the west basement entrance when an aide showed them into the oval office there was no one there please wait gentlemen he said outside darkness was falling and ferguson moved to the window and looked out my god but were part of history here dillon from roosevelt to clinton and everything in between i know dillon said the performance continues relentlessly its like the windmill theatre during the blitz in london during the second world war the motto was we never closed a private door clicked open and clinton appeared sorry to keep you waiting brigadier ferguson he held out his hand mr president and mr dillon so they tell me dillon said be seated gentlemen they did as they were told and clinton sat behind the desk youve seen senator keogh i understand and everythings in place yes ferguson said or as far as it can be at this moment in time hes spoken with me on the phone and seems more than happy with your plans good ferguson said clinton got up and walked to the window a fact of life when you hold high office gentlemen is that in the eyes of the media everything becomes political im afraid it has always been so ferguson told him i know clinton nodded anything i do must have some political advantage this has already been said about the efforts ive made to help with the irish situation he came back to the desk and sat down not true gentlemen politicians are accused of many things but for once i can say hand on heart that im interested in the outcome for its own sake and in this case that means peace in ireland i believe you sir ferguson said thank you and please believe senator keogh also there is no personal advantage for him in this business hes putting himself on the firing line here because he believes its worth doing as i said ive talked to senator keogh and he seems satisfied with your plan of campaign id appreciate it if youd go over it with me now brigadier when ferguson was finished clinton nodded it makes sense to me he turned mr dillon it could all be beautifully simple dillon said but surprise is everything the senator arriving out of the blue and so on secrecy is essential to the whole thing yes i agree clinton checked his wristwatch midnight in london gentlemen which means its now friday there im expecting news of the timing of the ira meeting at ardmore house quite soon now id go to your hotel and catch a little sleep now while the goings good brigadier ill be in touch on the instant of course mr president clinton pressed the buzzer on his desk and stood once again i cant impress on you enough the importance of this mission an aide came in and held the door open for them it was in fact only four hours later that dillon came awake with a start in his hotel room and reached for the telephone ferguson here ive got the good word so stir yourself dillon and lets get out of here ive phoned andrews and the lear will be ready to leave by the time we get there ill see you downstairs the phone went dead and dillon hauled himself out of bed wonderful he said bloody marvelous there must be a better way of making a living and he stood up and went to the shower as the lear lifted and turned out over the atlantic dillon unbuckled his seat belt and altered his watch fivethirty in the morning london time yes with luck we should hit gatwick by noon flight lieutenant jones tells me well have tailwind all the way across so what about the ardmore house meeting when is it sunday afternoon at two thats all right then is it okay if i sleep now and dillon dropped his seat back and closed his eyes london ireland london twelve hannah bernstein was working in her office when dillon went in she took off her glasses and rubbed her forehead wheres the brigadier dropped off at cavendish square to change clothes hell be here directly then he wants to see the prime minister again has anything been finalized you could say that the ira meeting is at ardmore house on sunday afternoon at two keogh will arrive at shannon in a private gulfstream hell proceed by helicopter at once to drumgoole and security the good senator will be quite content with you me and the brigadier she smiled in delight so he hasnt left me out i thought he might now why would he do a thing like that to you dillon grinned and lit a cigarette how do you get on with keogh fine a decent enough stick and not at all the way some of these reporters write him up hes got plenty of guts to take this thing on dillon nodded i liked him how have we got on with the january investigation ive pulled the printouts for you i think its all done here ill show you she got up and walked into the office dillon had been using the printouts were neatly stacked by the computer that lot there is the russian inquiry you asked for details of personnel at the soviet embassy good ill have a quick look a long look dillon theres a lot of it of course senior personnel are at the top she smiled ill make some tea and she went back to her office as she waited for the kettle to boil there was a step behind her and she turned dillon stood in the doorway his face pale and excited there was a computer printout in his hand he laid it on her desk what is it she demanded a nicely colored photo and full details on a man called colonel yuri belov senior cultural attaché at the soviet embassy so she carried on making the tea its been suggested hes head of london station for the gru thats the russian military intelligence i know what it is dillon she came and stood at his shoulder belov in the photo smiled up at her does he look familiar to you dillon asked no she shook her head i cant say that he does well he does to me at that moment the outer door opened and ferguson entered ah is that tea on the go jolly good ill have a quick cup then ill get off to downing street hannah bernstein handed him a cup of tea dillon thinks hes come up with something to do with the january inquiry sir oh and whats that colonel yuri belov dillon indicated the printout do you know anything about him senior cultural attaché at their embassy ive seen him around on the embassy party circuit it says here he may be head of station gru that suggestion has been mooted but never proved and weve never been involved with the gru over here in any kind of a conflict of interest our dealings with the kgb of course have been very different ferguson sipped some of his tea but what is this anyway ive only seen him once but it was an important once he turned to hannah remember when we were at the europa i told you i spoke to grace browning the actress and a professor curry so i saw them at the dorchester the night liam bell was killed she and curry were at the champagne bar rupert lang appeared all very affectionate old friends kissing that sort of thing good heavens man so rupert lang is a friend of hers so what ferguson demanded dillon held up the printout this man joined them colonel yuri belov possibly head of station gru now you must admit that would make a grand scandalous plot for the sunday papers a minister of the crown and a russian agent but ive told you ive seen the man myself on the embassy party circuit these people are always around ferguson put down his cup politicians are constantly invited to such affairs they meet everybody dillon dillon said just hear me out then you can give me the sack if you want he turned to hannah and you use your fine policewomans mind on it too all right ferguson said come into my office and get on with it he sat behind the desk dillon said i was talking to hannah about coincidences the other night it got a little academic what with carl jung being mentioned but what i was really getting at was that i dont believe in them ferguson was interested now go on as i said to hannah all those hits with the beretta in the january murders thats no coincidence four ira men stiffed and thats no coincidence two heads of station kgb london knocked off was that chance i think not and thats why i asked for a computer printout on all staff at the soviet embassy he smiled which brings us to yuri belov at the champagne bar at the dorchester dillon turned to hannah ive always heard a good copper develops a nose for crime that has nothing to do with facts are you beginning to smell something unusual here chief inspector she turned to ferguson id like to hear more sir there is more ferguson said i too can smell it carry on dillon my meeting with daley that night in belfast the sons of ulster business my supposed meeting with daniel quinn when they set me up who knew about it hannah though she didnt know where i was to meet them you brigadier the prime minister simon carter and rupert lang he turned to hannah lets hear what a brilliant detective has to offer on this one she glanced at ferguson and he nodded gravely carry on my dear right sir lets accept that january knew dillon was having a meet and didnt know where but the mystery woman knew enough to follow him and was armed and ready for action my question would be how did she know it was all going to happen and what is your conclusion chief inspector you can discount yourself brigadier me dillon she smiled now we come to the prime minister simon carter and rupert lang we can hardly imagine the prime minister to be the source of the leak ferguson said and the idea that the deputy director of the security services would seems inconceivable which leaves us with only one probable source sir it doesnt seem possible he shook his head a minister of the crown an under secretary of state at the northern ireland office he shook his head rupert lang served in my regiment the grenadier guards after that one para he received a military cross in ireland was wounded just bear with me dillon said the liam bell killing the whole thing was kept under wraps his stopoff in london i mean we knew and as usual you the pm and the deputy director and lang there was a pause they were ready for bells presence at the dorchester that night brigadier ready enough to be able to wait ahead of him in ambush in that cemetery in vance square dillon was full of energy and very insistent ferguson raised a hand enough youve made your point he turned to hannah whats the police view chief inspector not strong enough to make a case sir but worth pursuing inquiries and you dillon at this point in time id say your little ad hoc committee of you carter and lang should cease functioning there should be no further opportunity of langs receiving secret and valuable information until we sort this out for example he knows about the keogh affair but doesnt at this moment know when keogh will be arriving at shannon or the time of the ira meet at ardmore hannah said id say it should remain that way sir but what on earth can i say to the prime minister ferguson asked oh come on you old sod dillon said impatiently youve been lying beautifully for years why stop now dear god charles ferguson said but youre right of course and he reached for the red phone the prime minister in his study at downing street said ive just heard from president clinton that the ira meeting at ardmore is scheduled for two oclock on sunday afternoon i presumed you would be coming round to fill me in on your meeting with senator keogh something of supreme importance has happened prime minister a question of a leak of vital information serious john major asked im afraid so and it could have a bearing on senator keoghs visit as you know secrecy is of the essence there well of course it is we all accept that then may i very earnestly beg you to take my advice on this prime minister i know of the sunday meeting because president clinton has told me just as he has told you dillon and chief inspector bernstein know because they must will you leave it at that for the moment you mean dont tell the deputy director and rupert lang are you suggesting this leak you mention comes from one of them there was total astonishment in the prime ministers voice surely thats inconceivable prime minister be advised by me in this matter its a question of checking all avenues give me a few hours only there was a pause and john major said of course im disturbed brigadier because youre usually right and this time i dont want you to be but carry on and speak to me at your soonest when ferguson went into dillons office the computer was humming dillon and hannah beside it ferguson was full of energy now brisk and businesslike all right what are we up to were just checking on tom curry hannah said ferguson nodded you know that name is familiar theres a professor curry from london university who sits on a number of government committees the printer started to eject paper and dillon tore it out and laid it on the desk tom currys picture stared up at them the details from the data bank did not only mention his academic qualifications but as usual with those engaged in government work referred to his private life in intimate detail cambridge ferguson said and frowned good god moscow university researching a phd the printer kept working rupert lang coming through now hannah said good god he doesnt need to ferguson told her it says here that curry and lang have been living together for years at langs house in dean close thats within walking distance of westminster homosexual relationship since they were at cambridge together yes but look further down hannah said its currys academic record thats interesting hes worked at yale harvard is a professor at london but look at that sir hes a visiting professor at queens university belfast three or four days a month how interesting ferguson was all business now we know curry was in belfast when you and dillon were handling the sons of ulster business chief inspector yes sir those two provisional ira foot soldiers in the alley that january claimed the other year it would be interesting to know if professor curry was in belfast then it would be interesting to know if rupert lang was dillon put in easy enough to find out ferguson said it also raises an interesting point about the famous beretta january used in all of their killings except the sons of ulster thing dillon said the fact that a weapon used in london could have turned up in belfast security restrictions into ulster being so tough i suggested to hannah that the explanation might be that the owner of the beretta might have a permit to carry that would certainly apply to a minister of the crown but we can check on that soon enough ferguson frowned and rubbed the bridge of his nose somethings just occurred to me those two kgb head of stations getting knocked off apparently since the changes in russia in the last few years the longstanding feud with the gru and the kgb has intensified there could be a connection there with belov ill look into it ill phone queens university and check if the date of the killing of those two ira men coincided with curry being there hannah said and ill get a rundown on the times langs visited belfast from the northern ireland office what about you dillon ferguson demanded oh ill just ring grace brownings agent ferguson in the act of reaching for the phone stopped why it was a woman who saved me in the sons of ulster affair it was a woman who killed liam bell someone in my opinion giving a rather excellent performance as a pakistani woman id like to remind you that she was performing in belfast when i had my meeting with the sons of ulster and i did see her at the champagne bar at the dorchester with curry lang and belov no that really would be too much ferguson said what are you going to do find out from her agent if shes performed in belfast before the time hannah and i were there ill also have a look at the files check her background do that dillon paused in the doorway and turned to hannah remember the other night when we were talking about synchronicity and you asked me if there were any other coincidences i wanted to check yes you said there was but for the life of you you couldnt think what it was i finally discovered the night in belfast when our mystery woman saved me and then raised her arm in salute id seen grace brownings picture on a theatre poster at the europa after the same woman didnt shoot me and gave me that identical salute in the cemetery at vance gardens i walked up to the kings head in upper street and saw grace brownings face on a theatre poster there was silence ferguson said thats pretty slim evidence dillon circumstantial to say the least i know brigadier but its what carl jung meant by synchronicity and dillon went into the other office within an hour he and hannah were back at ferguson s desk well what have we got he demanded hannah turned to dillon you start right dillon said in october ninetyone grace browning did a short run at the minerva in chichester of brendan behans the hostage the company was asked to do a twoweek run of the play at the lyric theatre in belfast the first and second weeks in november he paused go on ferguson said the killing of those two ira men that january claimed credit for took place during the first week of the run he turned hannah she said professor tom curry was there for four days covering the time in question and also rupert lang he was there for two days but one of them was the day in question dear god ferguson said more bad news hannah bernstein told him according to the record lang is licensed to carry a handgun when in northern ireland and the weapon a beretta millimeter parabellum wed need to check the rounds its fired of course ferguson said but theres increasingly little doubt about what wed find he shook his head i dont understand one slight clue dillon told him it seems curry came from dublin there was a history of irish nationalism in the family but his mother became a cardcarrying member of the communist party all right that might explain curry but the browning woman one of our finest actresses and rupert lang there is one link sir hannah bernstein said a violent one when she was twelve her parents were murdered in a street robbery in washington she was present saw it all good lord after that she came to london and lived with her aunt in the house she presently occupies in cheyne walk and rupert lang isnt just mr savile row dillon said he was at bloody sunday with one para wounded killed at least three times according to his army record and was awarded a military cross for undercover work ferguson sighed and turned to hannah is it still a circumstantial case chief inspector oh yes sir but a strong one he nodded i can see that but ill have to speak to the prime minister and lang sir well see leave it to me at around the same time grace browning and tom curry driving down from london into kent found a sign to coldwater the village wasnt much a line of cottages on either side of the road a village green a pond a small inn called the george and dragon they carried on through and found another sign a quarter of a mile farther on that indicated coldwater airfield to the right they found it at the end of a narrow lane a couple of old hangars a control tower and a single tarmac runway that was crumbling badly there was an old landrover parked outside a nissen hut they parked beside it and as they got out the door opened and a man emerged he was of medium height obviously in his late forties with a graying beard and tangled hair he wore black flying overalls and an old american air force flying jacket mr carson curry asked thats me dont lets bother with names carson didnt offer to shake hands colonel belov said youd be around better come in curry opened the boot of his car and took out two suitcases and followed him into the nissen hut grace behind him inside he put the cases down and looked around there was a stove for heating a desk charts pinned to the wall you know the flights planned for sunday curry asked thats right carson unrolled a flying chart across his desk it covered ireland across to the galway coast ive found an old flying strip about ten miles from this drumgoole place here at kilbeg do you envisage any problems with the flight grace asked him only with the weather ireland s a sod too much rain flight time to county clare could be anything between three and four hours depending on the wind i cant do anything about that youre stuck with what you get on the day in view of what you say if we want to be at drumgoole by noon well need an early start curry said id say seven to seventhirty in the morning to be on the safe side carson said fine curry nodded well be here and the return carson asked lets say well be back with you by two oclock curry told him thats good i dont want to hang about grace said could we see the plane sure this way it had started to rain as they crossed to the hangars she said its a strange place this raf feeder station during the second world war everything falling apart now he rolled back one of the hangar doors and led the way in there were two planes in there one single engined the other a twin the single is an archer the twin is a cessna conquest thats what well be using fine grace said they turned and went out and he closed the door when they reached their car tom curry said well be here at the crack of dawn on sunday lets hope we have a good day i dont care what kind of day you have carson told him im getting more than well paid so i mind my own business im an inandout man thats all im interested in well be seeing you then grace told him he frowned slightly do i know you from somewhere you seem familiar i dont think so she said and got in the car curry opened the door the two suitcases arent locked so you dont need to break into them look after them until sunday he got behind the wheel and drove away carson watched them go and then went back into the nissen hut he lit a cigarette and stood looking down at the suitcases finally he shrugged and put them on the desk when he opened the first one he found a priests cassock and clerical collar the second one contained a nuns habit underneath there was an ak and a beretta automatic he shivered and closed the cases quickly none of his business any of it he didnt want to know much better that way and he put the cases on the floor against the wall in the study at downing street the prime minister sat grimfaced as he listened to what ferguson had to say so there it is prime minister im sorry thats all i can say you were right of course to advise me to keep quiet about sundays meeting at ardmore house the prime minister said if there is any truth in what you say if rupert lang is connected with january the consequences could have been grave i must point out prime minister that even if january knew of the meeting it doesnt necessarily mean they would have made an attempt on senator keoghs life their general motive has been obscure to say the least true but youve made a more than circumstantial case against lang and the others as far as i am concerned im afraid the word circumstantial is apt prime minister they can tough it out the browning woman and professor curry and lang well there is a point there the beretta once in our hands we can prove that it is the weapon that killed so many people he has no way of avoiding that then let us confront him the prime minister said bear with me brigadier he lifted the phone find out where mr rupert lang under secretary of state for northern ireland is at the present time he put the phone down ferguson said are you sure you want to do it this way prime minister absolutely he has not only betrayed his country and his colleagues he has betrayed me as his party leader the phone rang and he lifted it and listened thank you he replaced the phone and stood up hes at the house brigadier i intend to see him there and id like you to accompany me some people consider the house of commons to be the best club in london with its numerous restaurants and bars most peoples favorite is the terrace and it was to this the prime minister led the way passing through the central lobby acknowledging many people on the way the terrace itself was quite busy plenty of people around mostly with a glass in one hand there was westminster bridge on the left albert embankment on the other side of the river they leaned on the parapet and the prime minister waved a waiter away a rotten business brigadier i dont understand why why would he do it ferguson found a cigarette and lit it you could say the same thing about philby maclean blunt he shrugged i cant give you an answer sir it certainly wont do the conservative party any good john major smiled sorry brigadier politics is not your consideration in this matter no but i sympathize sir not your fault but you get the flak one of the privileges of rank brigadier at that moment rupert lang appeared on the terrace paused then saw them he hurried across smiling prime minister i got your message he nodded to ferguson brigadier he turned back to the prime minister you said it was urgent john major turned to ferguson brigadier ferguson said mr lang as a minister of the crown you have a permit to carry a handgun when visiting northern ireland the weapon i understand is a beretta millimeter parabellum lang knew knew at once what this meant but smiled thats right id like to examine it sir may i ask why to see if it is the weapon which has been responsible for the deaths of at least ten people assassinations claimed by a terrorist group known as january there was a long pause and then lang said this is nonsense rupert the prime minister said for gods sake its over rupert lang stood there staring at him and suddenly smiled and turned to ferguson what is it you want brigadier the beretta mr lang yes of course ill get it its in my office desk at that moment a crowd of japanese tourists came onto the terrace lang turned and plunged into them disappearing through the entrance on the far side before ferguson or the prime minister could do a thing there are dozens of exits to the house of parliament and rupert lang an expert in all of them was in his car in one of the underground car parks and driving away within five minutes of leaving ferguson and the prime minister thirteen belov was in his mews cottage off the bayswater road when he got langs call my dear rupert how are you not good yuri ive been rumbled calm yourself rupert and explain belov said lang went through exactly what had happened on the terrace with ferguson and the prime minister when he was finished he said there was no mention of you or tom or grace just the beretta he laughed i licensed it because i was entitled to you know that yuri but once theyve tested it fired a couple of rounds ive had it where is it i gave it to grace she wanted it for sunday i see ive been thinking yuri perhaps ferguson has made something of my connection with the prime ministers special security committee but theres one thing they dont know that we know that the ira meeting at ardmore is to take place on sunday afternoon youre right belov said lets make sure that stays that way you see my friend if the prime minister and ferguson think you dont know the whole thing will go ahead as normal no need to give keogh any anxieties of course but that doesnt help me ive got to get out of it where will you go rupert i dont know perhaps to devon to lang place theyll catch up eventually yes its the end of something you dont need to tell me that its so bloody frustrating not knowing what ferguson is up to is it just me and the damn beretta or is more going on have other connections been made if so theyll work their way round to all of us i suppose dont worry rupert take care of yourself and good luck they cant touch me if i go to the embassy belov put the phone down went to his bedroom and packed a bag with a few essentials he left the cottage went to his car parked at the curb and got in ten minutes later he drove into the diplomatic safety of the soviet embassy in kensington palace gardens land stopped at a phone box and rang his house in dean close the ringing seemed to go on forever before tom curry answered thank god rupert lang said he told curry what had happened when he was finished his friend said what will you do ill go to lang place and think things out ill use the usual airtaxi people ill be there tonight its you im worried about old sport they didnt mention yuri or you or grace but ferguson s a downy old bird itll only be a matter of time dont worry old lad curry said well manage suddenly he was choking with emotion take care rupert and then he said the words that were always so difficult for one man to another i love you he put down the phone then picked it up again and dialed grace browning when she answered he said just listen she didnt feel afraid more excited than anything else when he was finished she said so what now it could be a while before they make connections and as regards the ardmore house meeting rupert wasnt supposed to know anything sit tight is that it i honestly think so they cant touch yuri if he stays in the embassy diplomatic immunity they dont have cant have any reason to move against you or me ill be around tonight as usual at the kings head and take you to supper look forward to it she put down the phone and turned to the window and her head spun for a moment she saw the shadow of a man gun raised but when she took a deep breath it went away it was late in the afternoon when rupert lang arrived at the small airtaxi firm in surrey he habitually used for flights to devon his usual pilot a young man called alan smith greeted him as he got out of the car all ready to go mr lang good rupert said lets get moving ten minutes later the navajo chieftain lifted off the runway he opened the bar box and poured a double scotch into a plastic cup heres to you old sport he toasted himself i think bloody sunday has finally caught up with you at the ministry of defense ferguson was at his desk at six oclock that evening when hannah bernstein came in with dillon our inquiries finally showed that he frequently flies down to his house in devon sir lang place he uses an airtaxi firm in surrey weve checked and he flew down there during the late afternoon in a navajo chieftain the pilot has not yet returned i see ferguson looked out at the gathering gloom too late to do anything now well fly down in the morning use the same firm he wont be going anywhere and he knows it make the booking chief inspector do you want the okehampton police involved sir no just tell the airtaxi people to arrange to have a car waiting to take us to lang place tell them were expected and the browning woman sir hannah asked and curry oh hell have tipped them off and belov unless im mistaken our russian friend will have headed straight for sanctuary at the soviet embassy but to a certain extent theyre in the dark all they know for certain is that i asked for langs beretta to see if it had any connection with the january killings he knew it damn well had which is why he did a runner but there was no mention of any connection with the others they may even be banking on the fact that there is no connection well all i can say is that if it was me id smell a very large rat dillon said yes very probably shall i have curry and the browning woman put under surveillance then hannah bernstein asked from the facts youve put before me of this young womans life and background ive formed certain opinions about her ferguson said something went very obviously wrong in her head a long time ago possibly the trauma of her parents being murdered in washington a hell of a thing for a child to see i suspect there may be more to it than that well probably never know the whole truth but what if they decide to run sir hannah asked why should they lang and curry lived together what does that prove they were friendly with grace browning so what yuri belov exchanged pleasantries with them at a drinks party he also probably spoke to at least fifty people now your fine police mind knows that everything about this case is circumstantial except for langs beretta once thats tested its curtains for him and he knows it she said and if he disposes of it wheres your evidence then dillon asked another thing even under interrogation would he be likely to shop his friends he doesnt seem the sort to me i agree ferguson said the blunt truth is we know what these people are and what they have done proving it will be another matter in my opinion theyll sit tight for the moment and await developments so no surveillance hannah said she wont be going anywhere and neither will curry shes got a show to give last performance tomorrow night she wouldnt walk out on that would she dillon he smiled why not see if you can get us some tickets chief inspector hannah gave dillon a lift home and it was sixthirty as they drove out of the ministry of defence car park dillon checked his watch shell be leaving for the theatre soon lets drive past her house have you something in mind not really just idle curiosity it was raining slightly as they turned along cheyne walk and slowed as they approached the house shall i stop hannah asked just for a minute at that moment she emerged from the side entrance on her bmw motorcycle she wore black leathers and a dark helmet she paused legs astride and pushed up the dark visor and checked the traffic in the light of the street lamp they saw her face clearly she pulled the visor down and rode away my god hannah breathed the final proof so it would seem dillon said so it would seem rupert lang was sitting by the fire in the drawing room at lang place danger lying in front of the fire when the phone rang it was the navajo pilot alan smith calling from surrey that you mr lang alan smith here about the flight in the morning which flight would that be lang asked a brigadier ferguson a lady a miss bernstein who made the booking and a man called dillon she said you were expecting them ah yes lang said what time will you drop in ninethirty start a little wind forecast but we should do it in an hour they asked for a taxi no need ill have george farne pick them up in the range rover thanks alan and good night he sat there thinking about it then went and poured a scotch finally he picked up the phone and called dean close curry answered at once ive just heard theyre flying in tomorrow rupert told him ferguson bernstein and dillon how did you find out the pilot rang me said hed been told i was expecting them strange that ferguson must have known the pilot might do that of course he did maybe he wants to give me a chance to do the decent thing and put a bullet through my head honor of the regiment and all that for gods sake rupert there was panic in currys voice dont worry old sport ive no intention of doing any such thing ill hear what he has to say i want to know how close they are to the rest of you if at all and the beretta what will you say when he asks for it found it had been stolen from my desk i panicked shocked by the appalling suggestions made at that meeting with the pm so i cleared off down here to think rather weak old lad of course it is lang laughed out loud you know that and so does ferguson but lets see what he comes up with youd better phone yuri at the embassy and bring him up to date ill do that good night old sport lang put the phone down reached for his glass and sat staring into the fire while he stroked the wolfhounds head the weather was wretched the following morning when the daimler turned into the entrance of the small airfield in surrey and pulled up on the concrete apron the doors of one of the hangars stood open and they saw the navajo standing inside the pilot beside it talking to an engineer in overalls ferguson dillon and hannah got out and ran through the rain brigadier ferguson alan smith the pilot said he nodded out at the curtain of rain not too good are you saying we cant go its up to you could be rough my friend here is a pilot ferguson turned to dillon whats your opinion i wouldnt dream of interfering dillon smiled and gave smith his hand sean dillon ive got a commercial license so it will comfort you to know that if you have a heart attack i can take over smith laughed all right then if you folks are game so am i lets climb aboard and get on with it it was raining steadily in devon as rupert lang rode one of the montesa dirt bikes along the track above the forest danger running alongside lang wore riding breeches and boots and an old paratroopers camouflaged smock instead of a helmet he wore a tweed cap he paused beside a low wall there were sheep over there crowding round sam lee the shepherd and danger went over the wall and ran to them barking sam lee struck out at him with his shepherds crook damn your eyes lee ive told you before lang called do that again and ill break that thing over your head its the sheep mr lang he wont leave them alone damn the sheep lang paused looking up into the rain aware of the sound of an aircraft in the distance he whistled to the dog come on boy started the montesa and rode away when the range rover entered the courtyard at lang place rupert was standing at the front door still wearing the old cap and the paratroopers smock a curiously debonair figure ah there you are ferguson right on time chief inspector hannah bernstein my personal assistant and sean dillon your personal hit man lang smiled at dillon we probably traded shots back there in derry in the old days and isnt that a fact dillon told him lang turned to hannah and what have they brought you along for chief inspector to read me my rights make an arrest if necessary sir well it isnt i assure you stupid mistake the whole thing but come in out of the rain and ill explain he led the way into the drawing room where danger lying in front of the fire got up down boy lang stroked him cheerfully not a bit of harm in him believe me soft as a brush ive got a bottle of bollinger on ice and mrs farne will serve a light lunch in the conservatory before you go back dont you mean we sir hannah said a trifle premature i would have said would you mind doing the honors dillon its stuffy in here he went and opened the french windows to the terrace thats better dillon uncorked the champagne and poured hannah said not for me on duty chief inspector lang smiled looking immensely attractive and held a glass out to her and in spite of herself she took it now what shall we drink to why not january ferguson said oh dear there you go again brigadier i honestly dont know what youre talking about as for the beretta well unfortunately its been stolen from my desk at the house ferguson held up a hand and took one of the chairs by the fire id sit down if i were you he turned to hannah chief inspector in the matter of mr rupert langs involvement in the terrorist group we know as january make your case land sprawled in a chair listening a slight smile on his face one hand stroking dangers head the other holding his glass of champagne when she was finished he stood up and went and recharged his glass anyone else he asked holding up the bottle no a convincing case you must agree lang ferguson said total fantasy the lot of it tom curry and i have lived together for years and quite openly thats the connection there colonel yuri belov is someone ive met casually on the embassy party circuit as im sure many members of parliament have grace browning is a dear friend to both tom curry and myself to attempt to tie us all in together as members of this january group quite frankly beggars belief high melodrama the whole thing i grant you that ferguson told him and totally circumstantial i mean come on ferguson im in belfast on government business tom has a few days at queens and grace browning happens to be performing at the lyric theatre and when a couple of ira louts end up dead in an alley you accuse the three of us i accuse january ferguson said who claimed those killings after all theres the business of dillon and the sons of ulster only dillon himself chief inspector bernstein simon carter myself the prime minister and you knew about that and the same circumstance applied in the unfortunate killing of liam bell he shook his head simple process of elimination lang in both cases you had to be the leak lang stood there the slight fixed smile on his face any good barrister could demolish that argument at an old bailey trial in five minutes flat you see ferguson the only link to the january killings is the beretta now you say its my beretta but as that has unfortunately been stolen well never know will we of course im sorry i panicked and cleared off after finding the gun was missing naturally ill offer the pm my resignation it was dillon who broke the log jam jesus me ould son but youve got a tongue on you he went to the table and took the bottle of bollinger from the bucket is it all right if i help myself be my guest old sport dillon filled his glass why did you do it thats what interests me i mean belov i understand hes a pro working for his own side and curry is obviously your typical british middleclass wealthy liberal nut case who wants to make the world safe for communism have i left anything out hes irish actually lang said as for the girl ive formed the opinion shes touched in the head dillon told him but thats another story he looked up at the portrait of the earl of drury over the fireplace ancestor of yours from the look of his face a grand arrogant bastard who walked over everybody he probably laid his riding crop over the shoulders of his servants and made all the maids have sex with him langs face was pale take care dillon youd rather be him is that it modern life too boring all the money in the world and all you could find to do was play at politics and then january came along i dont know how but it came along there was that wolfish look on langs face now dillon said id like to know one thing did grace browning make all the hits or did you share you go to hell lang told him ferguson stood up i believe there is enough evidence to take you into custody lang youll come back to london with us he turned to hannah read him his rights and for the moment charge him with treason nobodys taking me anywhere lang said and snapped his fingers stand boy danger was on his feet instantly a rumble like distant thunder deep in his throat hell tear your arm off ferguson if i tell him to is that a fact dillon said and whistled a strange eerie sound that seemed to come from another place now then danger boy he held out a hand the wolfhound wriggled close reached up and licked the hand good god lang said a man who was once my friend taught me that trick dillon said ah well it just goes to show you cant rely on anything in this wicked old world rupert lang said and took a browning from inside the pocket of his smock except one of these of course sorry ferguson but im not going anywhere he backed out of the window and was gone the dog running after him dillon took out his walther and ran onto the terrace pausing to get his bearings there was no sign of lang and then the roaring of an engine and he rode out of the barn on the montesa skidded out through the main gate and took the track up to the moor dillon ran across to the range rover and in the same moment saw the other montesa on its stand inside the barn he turned and called to ferguson and hannah who had emerged onto the terrace theres another bike im going after him ill call you on my cellnet phone hannah a moment later he roared out of the barn turned through the gates and went after lang who was high up on the track now the wolfhound chasing him dillons tweed suit was soaked within minutes water spraying everywhere from the rough track and the rain dashed in his face halfblinding him for some reason he seemed to be gaining and when he went over a rise after coming up through the trees he saw lang no more than a hundred yards in front danger running alongside keeping pace with him with apparent ease and yet it was the wolfhound in the end that was langs undoing for as they reached the crest of the track high above the forest three sheep came over the drystone wall danger ahead of the motorcycle at that point crossed in front to snap at the sheep lang swerved to avoid him at that point there was a wooden five bar gate he smashed through it careered down a grass slope and plunged over a ledge of rock still astride the montesa and amazingly the dog leapt after him dillon left his bike by the smashed gate slithered down the slope and looked over lang lay there with the montesa on top of him and the wolfhound was crawling toward him dragging its hind legs dillon moved to one side where the grass sloped again and went down he got both his hands to the montesa lifted it up and tossed it to one side there was blood on one side of langs face dillon leaned down to lift him and lang cried out in agony my bloody backs broken dillon christ i can feel the bone sticking out ill get help i have a phone dillon got his cellnet out and dialed hannahs number she was with him in seconds are you okay dillon theres been a bad accident langs crashed and broken his back youd better get onto the police at okehampton well need an ambulance or a helicopter if there is one im high on the track above the forest ill get straight onto it dillon turned to lang and danger whimpered in pain trying to drag himself to his master lang turned his head theres a good boy he tried to reach the dog with a hand and groaned my god his rear legs dillon the bones are jutting out he closed his eyes and took a deep breath finish him for me dillon do the decent thing cant bear to see him suffer dillon took out his silenced walther danger looked up at him eyes filled with pain theres a boy dillon said stroking his head and shot him dillon crouched beside lang lit a cigarette and put it to his lips lang coughed and said weakly what a way to go what a stupid bloody way to go someone will be here soon dillon said one of the advantages of the cellnet phone system instant communication not instant enough im dying dillon maybe not just hang in there what for a show trial he closed his eyes ive always been so bored dillon had everything and had nothing if you follow ireland disgusted me so i left the army for silly political games and then things happened all by chance wonderful exciting things nothing was ever so exciting his breathing was labored take it easy dillon told him no something i want you to understand want to tell you because it doesnt seem to matter now the first january was a mistake tom was a delivery boy for belov but the arab he met was supposed to kill belov for the kgb tom shot him in a struggle for the gun the beretta thats why we invented january to explain the killing but tom was shot and i couldnt have that so i knocked off ashimov the kgb bastard behind everything i killed people in ireland dillon so why couldnt i kill a piece of slime like that blood was trickling out of his mouth easy dillon said so it started and after a while came grace his words were distorted now tom and i went to see her at the lyric on the way back those two scum jumped her heroes of the glorious revolution took her up an alley to rape her tom and i intervened i was carrying you see id made the beretta my licensed handgun for visits to the province and you killed them they were armed i shot one there was a struggle and grace picked up the beretta and took out the other bastard and that was the start of it for her got a taste for it another kind of performance i put her through a weapons course here very apt pupil he closed his eyes his breathing shallow dillon said the beretta has grace got it oh yes needs it dillon frowned why poor ferguson another bloody sunday like to see his face lang said and coughed turning his head to one side blood erupting from his mouth his body shook violently then went very still a moment later dillon heard his cellnet phone he took it out and switched on and ferguson said dillon theres an raf base only twelve miles away theyre sending a helicopter too late dillon said he just died ill see you in a little while brigadier he switched off and turned as stone cascaded down the slope and sam lee arrived what happened then he crashed through the gate off the track and came down the slope dead is he there was a certain satisfaction on lees coarse face ah well thats the way of the world even the high and mighty come down to this who the hell are you dillon asked the estate shepherd and that damn dog lying there like that is the best news ive had in years he stirred danger with his foot and dillon anger flooding through him like lava put a knee in lees crotch and raised it again into the descending face sending the shepherd back down the slope a good forty feet it was midafternoon when alan smith took the navajo up over the trees at the end of the old raf landing strip and climbed through the rain one bright spot from the prime ministers point of view hannah bernstein said with rupert langs timely death a rather large scandal is averted for the conservative party but it still leaves us with the browning woman curry and belov thanks to rupert langs rather emotional leavetaking we now have our suspicions confirmed id like to point out brigadier hannah said that dillons account of langs dying confession carries no weight in a court of law if it was put forward by the prosecution the judge would have no option but to throw it out yes i am aware of that sad fact chief inspector ferguson sighed but im deeply disturbed by dillons other piece of information he said that the browning woman had the beretta yes dillon told him he said she needed it i asked what he meant and he said poor ferguson another bloody sunday like to see his face thats exactly what he said then he died how very inconvenient of him ferguson said isnt that rather hard sir hannah told him not at all theres only one sunday thats important in my book tomorrow and any kind of involvement in that affair by grace browning fills me with horror but shes here in london sir hannah said performing at the kings head tonight so are we my dear but flying out to shannon in the morning she could do the same shall i have her lifted sir you got the tickets for the show yes well allow her the final performance pick her up afterwards my guess is curry will be there he turned to dillon are you looking forward to it i wouldnt miss it for all the tea in china sean dillon told him fourteen the untimely death of rupert lang under secretary of state at the northern ireland office was featured on television news as early as one oclock tom curry preparing a sandwich in the kitchen at dean close had the television on and could not believe what he had heard he felt himself start to shake with emotion stumbled across to the dresser and got a bottle of scotch open and spilled about three fingers into a glass he swallowed it down then went into the drawing room and sat on the couch hugging himself rupert oh god rupert what happened he started to cry and then the phone rang he let it ring for a while then picked it up reluctantly grace said are you there tom rupert he said brokenly rupert is dead yes i know now just hang on im on my way and she put down the phone but he couldnt do as she asked because there was nothing to hang on to he had never felt so totally desolate in his life rupert was gone and in that moment he realized that the most important reason for his existence had gone forever this time he poured an even larger whisky and swallowed it down quickly then he went and got his raincoat and let himself out of the front door it was raining quite hard not that it mattered nothing mattered now it was as if his whole life had been for nothing and he kept on going in the general direction of the houses of parliament grace driving along millbank was astonished to see him walking along the pavement she tried to pull in but the traffic was extremely heavy and then he crossed the road to the other side and there was nothing she could do stuck for a moment in a long jam of traffic he was some distance ahead now and she tapped the wheel nervously and then the traffic started to move at the same time a delivery van moved out of a parking space and she swerved into it she locked the car hurriedly and ran along st margarets street and entered parliament square she paused looking everywhere desperately then saw him on the corner of bridge street she ran even faster now and reached the corner to see him on the other side of the street approaching westminster underground station he entered with a number of other people and she dodged her way through traffic and crossed the road curry didnt have a destination he simply took a pound coin from his pocket put it in the appropriate slot took the ticket that came up and went through the barrier he went down the escalator with a large queue of people walked along the corridors below just another face in the crowd until he came out onto the station platform there was quite a crowd people standing shouldertoshoulder and he pushed his way through to the front and stood at the edge of the platform the whisky had done its work now it was not that he was drunk just totally numb no feeling at all there was the roar of a train approaching a blast of air and then a voice calling tom wait for me he halfturned and saw grace browning trying to push through the crowd toward him and then he turned back and as the train emerged from the tunnel stepped off the platform in front of it it was no more than forty minutes later that hannah bernsteins computer buzzed in her office at the ministry of defence she got up from her desk crossed to the printer and tore off the strip of paper and read it my god she said and called dillon where are you then she knocked on ferguson s door and went in ferguson at his desk looked up what is it at that moment dillon joined them its the professor tom curry hannah said i had a general call out to central records office to update me if anything new turned up on him as i did with the others it seems he just stepped in front of a train at westminster underground station dead presumably ferguson asked oh yes immediate identification from the wallet in his jacket the police officer in charge radioed it in to cro when it entered their computer it referenced to my inquiry sweet mother of god dillon lit a cigarette and why would he do that rupert lang perhaps ferguson said they lived together for years dillon perhaps langs death was a blow he simply couldnt take so where does it leave us sir hannah asked two down one to go dillon said two ferguson told him theres belov at the embassy remember what will you do about him sir hannah asked leave him to stew for a while always difficult this diplomatic immunity business and grace browning whichever way you look at it shes on her own now dillon put in im afraid so ferguson said i almost feel sorry for her jesus you old sod dillon said you never felt sorry for anyone in your life ferguson ignored the remark she wont have heard about curry yet of course the media will catch on to the fact that he lived with lang for years and draw their own conclusions very convenient when you think of it dillon said now if only grace browning would break her neck on that motorcycle everything would be wrapped up nice and quiet you could invite yuri belov to come over instead of going home to bread queues in moscow lots of juicy information to be obtained there youre a callous bastard dillon hannah told him hes right of course ferguson observed in the circumstances i think ill turn the screw on her and he picked up the phone grace browning back at cheyne walk was drinking a cup of hot and very sweet tea sitting at the table trying in the most coldblooded way to assess the situation the phone rang and she picked it up ferguson said brigadier charles ferguson here my dear i think you know who i am what do you want she said calmly im sure youre aware as it has been prominently featured in all news bulletins that your good friend rupert lang died earlier today in a tragic accident yes i know about that what you wont yet know is that your other good friend professor tom curry died under the wheels of a train at westminster underground station within the past hour grace took a deep breath thats shocking news yuri belov is in effect locked up at the soviet embassy which leaves only you the games over im afraid and what game would that be brigadier i always did say you were a brilliant actress thats why i got my aide chief inspector hannah bernstein to get us tickets for the kings head tonight you will be appearing i take it ive never missed a performance in my life brigadier im looking forward to it ill tell you what i think of it afterwards hannah said she could decide to run i dont think so ferguson said but if you want to keep a discreet eye on her do so she knows dillon so youll have to take care of it yourself im on my way hannah said picked up her shoulder bag and went out full of enthusiasm dillon said thats what i like god save us but the women are taking over the world no alcohol she needed a clear head she made another very hot cup of tea went into the drawing room and looked out at cheyne walk lots of traffic and plenty of cars parked somebody out there would be keeping an eye on her she took that for granted now so she would have to be very very clever the one important thing was her firm intention of still keeping her date with destiny at drumgoole abbey she owed it to tom and rupert if for no other reason she lit one of her rare cigarettes pacing up and down and then it came to her the perfect solution and devastatingly simple yuri belov was in his office at the soviet embassy when the phone rang grace said yuri its me youve heard about rupert unfortunately yes ive more bad news tom flung himself under a train at westminster underground station this afternoon dear god belov said and theyre definitely onto me grace said i had a cryptic phone call from ferguson hes coming to my final performance at the kings head tonight with dillon and this bernstein woman get out grace while you can he said urgently no way im sticking to the plan you see im taking a chance im betting on the fact that they dont know anything about sunday rupert could have told them although im sure he wouldnt have toms dead that means its all still in place carson at the airfield at coldwater the flight to kilbeg will your people definitely leave a car there all taken care of but grace this is madness not really ive worked it out very carefully there is one thing i need to know theres no chance of ferguson ringing you up to offer you a deal i mean some of your people have come over in the past lots of information in return for a comfortable asylum hell offer im sure of it but not yet but if youre shipped back to moscow as a failure wouldnt that be rather unpleasant but i wont be a failure if you succeed in shooting patrick keogh belov laughed of course if you fail i can always do a deal with ferguson then she laughed back at him thats my yuri but tell me he said whats your plan its really quite simple im going to die good god he said tell me so she did she found a large plastic bag in the kitchen and put in it an old navyblue tracksuit a light raincoat some trainers and a pair of black leather flatheeled shoes she went to her safe opened it and took out two bundles of tenpound notes a thousand pounds in each she placed a bundle in each of the black shoes thought about things for a while then rolled up a kitchen towel and added that also when she left the house fifteen minutes later she wore an old burberry and carried an umbrella against the rain she turned along the pavement to where she had parked her red mini opened it and got in hannah parked farther along on the other side of the road watched all this with interest following her as grace browning pulled out into the heavy traffic driving toward westminster skirting the tower of london until she reached wapping high street finally parking close to a department store there was room a couple of cars behind and hannah pulled in and switched off her engine grace got out the plastic bag locked her car then paused to put money into the parking meter she turned and made for the main entrance of the department store and went inside hannah went after her but when she went into the store it was crowded with shoppers and no way of knowing which department her quarry had gone to and there was also the chance that if she went walkabout looking for her she might miss grace leaving she decided to take a chance and returned to her car grace browning at that moment was visiting the toilet and rest room at the bottom of a short flight of steps at the rear of the building there was a door which said staff only shed used it once out of curiosity and had discovered that it led into an alley at the side of the store she hurried along to the end and came out onto the waterfront she walked quickly to an area of decaying warehouses st jamess stairs not too far away she knew this place well had once done an episode for a television thriller here there was a narrow alley called dock street nothing but boardedup windows and several old dustbins she was taking a chance but there was a risk in everything now she pushed the plastic bag down behind the dustbins pulled a dirty old sack over it turned and hurried back she was entering the staff door at the department store five minutes after exiting from it went up the stairs walked to an area displaying bedding and towels chose a couple of towels at random paid for them and waited while the assistant packed them into a white plastic bag similar to the one she had entered the store with hannah saw her at once as she came out of the entrance and walked to her mini grace opened the door tossed the plastic bag in the rear and slid behind the wheel if she was being followed shed fooled them nicely she was certain of that and she pulled into the traffic followed by hannah a little while later she approached wapping underground station and turned into the multistory car park that was close by she drove into the basement and pulled up at the car valeting service hannah followed taking a vacant parking spot and watched grace smiled at the young black man in overalls who came out of the office a wash and wax would be fine can you manage that no problem when do you want it the fact is im doing a show tonight and i might be late ten oclock something like that we close at seven couldnt you leave the keys under the mat for me well we arent supposed to do that lady she opened her purse how much will it be twenty pounds thats fine she handed him a twentypound note and gave him her most dazzling smile as she also produced a fivepound note perhaps youd make an exception id really be very grateful he smiled i could never resist a beautiful woman youll find it over there on that yellow section bless you she said turned and walked down the ramp passing hannah who watched her go then pulled out and followed grace walked along the pavement until she saw an approaching black cab she hailed it and got inside hannah followed and fifteen minutes later found herself once again in cheyne walk where grace paid off her taxi driver and went inside hannah called in to the office and spoke to ferguson she took a drive to wapping high street did some shopping at a department store then she left her car with a valeting service next to wapping underground station and caught a taxi home as i told you chief inspector there was no need for surveillance shell be there tonight im sure of it however if it gives you peace of mind to stay and keep watch do so dillon and i will see you at the theatre i must go now im due at downing street simon carter was already seated in the prime ministers study when ferguson was shown in ah there you are brigadier weve just been discussing those two extraordinary deaths fill us in as much as you can of course prime minister ferguson described in detail the events in devon which had led to rupert langs death he also told them as much as he knew about tom currys suicide strange carter said when hed finished that remark rupert lang made about another bloody sunday what in hell was that supposed to mean is keogh at risk is that the reference to a sunday do you think there is a threat of some sort was a threat ferguson said certainly there is no threat now two dead belov trapped in the soviet embassy and the woman carter demanded well pick her up after her show tonight my chief inspector is on her tail she isnt going anywhere the prime minister nodded i wish we could keep this whole damn thing under wraps my god a minister of the crown a traitor he smiled ruefully and im not just thinking of the welfare of the conservative party though there would be those who think so well have to see prime minister but there is a legal difficulty many murders have been committed by january and we know now that grace browning was responsible for a number of them rather difficult to get round that god help us all then the prime minister said it was about six fortyfive when grace browning appeared from the side of the house in cheyne walk on the bmw she sat astride it wearing her usual black leathers and adjusted her helmet so that anyone watching could be sure it was her then she rode away and hannah pulled out and followed her twenty minutes later they arrived at the kings head grace browning parked the bmw and got off hannah pulled up and watched her take off her helmet and enter when she was satisfied that grace was safely in she found a parking space herself she saw ferguson s daimler with his chauffeur at the wheel a few vehicles away crossed the pavement and went into the kings head which was crowded as usual just before a show started ferguson and dillon were at the far end of the bar and dillon called to her as she approached he said jesus woman a fine boring day youve given yourself never mind my dear ferguson told her have a drink no thank you sir im driving god save us what a woman but as it happens im not dillon turned to the barman another bushmills while the goings good a moment later the fiveminute warning sounded over the tannoy and everyone crowded in they found their table and settled the lights dimmed and a moment later grace browning came on stage to strong applause when the intermission lights went up ferguson said she is really quite remarkable all that talent what a pity dillon stood up im going to go round and speak to her no youre bloody well not i mean what for ferguson demanded because i bloody well feel like it hannah stood up then if you go i do suit yourself grace brownings dressing room was cramped and untidy she was drinking a glass of white wine when dillon knocked and entered why dillon she looked genuinely pleased was i any good bloody marvelous and you know it this by the way is detective chief inspector hannah bernstein one of scotland yards finest what a pleasure grace said we will be expecting you to accompany us after the finish of the play hannah said i hope you understand that oh i do grace poured another glass of white wine sorry how things worked out dillon i think you and i could have been friends he smiled and gave her the timehonored good wish from one actor to another break a leg my love he said pushed hannah bernstein out of the door and closed it at the plays end the applause was tumultuous and when grace browning came on she received a standing ovation she bowed linked hands with other members of the cast glanced toward dillon and ferguson and gave them an extra bow when she went off she found hannah in the corridor being jostled by members of the cast and stage crew ah there you are chief inspector i must change yes you do that hannah said ill wait for you here in the dressing room grace stripped then pulled on her leathers the one change from usual was that instead of wearing heavy leather boots she wore a pair of black dancers pumps she went out gloves in one hand and helmet in the other you wont need that hannah said nodding at the helmet oh dear grace browning smiled arent you supposed to read me my rights or something if youre going to charge me she smiled not that it matters youll have to excuse me call of nature she had the door of the toilet on the right side of the corridor open and closed again in a second the bolt rammed home shed checked the window earlier and now she stood on the toilet bowl as hannah thundered on the door grace got the window open and dropped her gloves and helmet into the yard byebye chief inspector she called and climbed through outside in the corridor hannah turned and ran into the theatre where she found ferguson and dillon at the bar entrance shes done a runner hannah called dillon actually laughed jesus girl that was careless of you and he turned and hurled his way through the crowded bar he arrived on the pavement hannah close behind and there was a roaring in the night as grace browning exploded on the bmw she skidded to a halt caught for a moment by heavy traffic and hannah got the door of her car open and slid behind the wheel in dillon in she called and switched on her engine ferguson shouted ill follow in the daimler grace moved out into the traffic turned to look at hannah bernsteins car and raised her arm in that inimitable salute to dillon then she was away hannah pulled a blue police reflecting light from under her seat slammed it through the open window onto the roof and went after her grace sped down upper street turned left at the angel and took the city road weaving in and out of heavy traffic but hannah driving brilliantly and with the help of her police warning light managed to stay on her tail ferguson s voice came through on the police radio she had fitted in her car whats the position chief inspector were well behind way down the city road sir she replied id say making for the city now grace turned off the road moving from one street to another hannah said into the radio she seems to be aiming for the tower of london all right enough is enough ferguson replied put out a general alarm i want her stopped as grace browning reached st katherines way a police car moved to block her she swerved around it and carried on hannah mounted the pavement to pass the police car and went after her they were into wapping high street now and on the other side of the road bearing down on her grace saw two police cars one of them edged out to block her way and she put a foot down like a dirt rider broadsided and disappeared into a narrow side road hannah turned after her and the two police cars followed they twisted from one narrow street to another passing between tall decaying warehouses oldfashioned street lamps on the corners and finally turned into a slightly broader street the lights of boats on the river beyond she roared to the end of the street and stopped hannah braked to a halt the two police cars behind her the four uniformed men in them jumped out and ran forward detective chief inspector bernstein hannah told them is this important maam a young sergeant asked very much so the target is also highly dangerous are any of you armed only me maam the sergeant said and produced a smith wesson at that moment the daimler arrived with ferguson who got out and hurried forward this is brigadier ferguson my boss hannah said what the hell is going on ferguson demanded whats she playing at grace browning sat astride the motorcycle the engine turning over as she looked toward them anonymous in the dark helmet she sir the sergeant asked yes ferguson told him but dont let that deter you hes right son dillon cut in youve never faced a harder prospect at the moment grace browning raised her arm shes coming dillon cried she revved the engine and roared down the street toward them putting a foot down at the last minute and sliding round pointing the other way whats she playing at the sergeant asked no way out a dead end thats samsons wharf grace browning increased her speed and at the last moment raised the front wheel and lifted off high over the edge of the wharf pausing for a moment then plunging down into the thames they all ran along the street and stood at the edge of the wharf looking down at the swirling water but nothing showed except white foam in the murky yellow light from the street lamps and then the black helmet bobbed to the surface jesus the sergeant said why did she do that because as you said sergeant it was a dead end no way out charles ferguson told him better call in the river police and all the usual services well leave it in your hands he turned to hannah and dillon one person who wont be too displeased at this outcome will be the prime minister he said as they walked to the cars lang curry and now the woman all dead easy to say none of it ever happened rupert lang can have an honorable funeral as befits a minister of the crown and belov sir hannah asked no problem chief inspector just leave him to me fog rolled across the river rain drifting in and something washed in through the shadows by st jamess stairs grace browning surfaced and hauled herself up a ladder onto a wharf her leathers were wet and she unzipped the jacket and tossed it into the river then turned and ran along the deserted waterfront a shadowy figure moving from one patch of light to the next she reached dock street within ten minutes scrabbled behind the old dustbins and found her plastic bag under the sack there was no one about and she stood under a street lamp bracketed to the wall above stripped off her pumps the leather pants and soaking tee shirt she stood there quite naked for a moment toweling her hair and body then pulled on the tracksuit and trainers she put the raincoat on took the two black shoes from the bag each with a thousand pounds inside and put them in the raincoat pockets then she started to walk fifteen minutes later she reached the multistorey car park next to wapping underground station when she went down into the basement it was a place of shadows cold and damp but her mini car was waiting in the yellow area she opened the car got inside found the keys under the mat then she found a comb put her hair into some sort of order and tied it back a few moments later she drove out of the car park turned into the main road and was on her way in his office at the ministry of defence ferguson spoke to the prime minister on the red phone giving him an account of the nights proceedings when the brigadier was finished the prime minister said i dont want to sound callous but a rather satisfactory end to the whole saga lang curry and now this browning woman all gone only belov left and im sure youll sort him i presume youll have no difficulty in treating her unfortunate death as accidental you may rely on it prime minister good all good fortune in ireland tomorrow the prime minister put down the phone at that precise moment in time grace browning was coming out of a motorway service restaurant on the outskirts of london a bacon sandwich and two coffees inside her she felt warm again the chill of the river thames long gone she got behind the wheel of the mini pulled out onto the motorway and started on the next stage of her journey to coldwater kent drumgoole abbey ardmore house london fifteen it was just after one oclock in the morning when grace browning reached coldwater village passed the george and dragon and the village green and found the sign a quarter of a mile farther on that pointed the way to the airfield she turned down the narrow lane then pulled in on the grass verge and switched off her lights she found a small torch in the glove compartment got out and proceeded on foot the final caution but she had to be sure she paused on the edge of the runway there was a light on a bracket above the hangar door where she and tom had inspected the conquest and there was another in the nissen hut she waited for a moment then keeping to the shadows crossed to the hangar and worked her way to the nissen hut when she peered through the window she saw carson sitting at the table an enamel mug in one hand a chart spread in front of him satisfied she turned back across the runway and returned to the car she switched on the lights started the engine and set off across the runway when she reached the nissen hut she turned off the engine and sat there waiting the door opened and carson appeared whos there its me she said she got out of the car and looked across at him youre early wheres your friend change of plan he wont be coming i thought id get here early in case of weather problems youd better come in then it was warm in the hut so warm that she could smell the heat from the stove on which an old coffee pot stood the coffees fresh help yourself if you like he wasnt wearing the flying jacket only the black overalls and his beard seemed more tangled than ever he sat down at the table and lit a cigarette she found a spare mug poured coffee into it and crossed to the table the chart was the one covering ireland to the galway coast checking our route for about the fifth time i never leave anything to chance ive been flying a long time and thats why im still here ive been thinking she said id definitely like to be at kilbeg by eleven ive spoken to colonel belov within the last few hours and the car will be in place well have to leave no later than seven then fine by me she sipped some coffee where are my cases on the bed in the next room did you open them of course not he tried to sound indignant not my business im not interested in what youre up to like i said im an inandout man im getting paid well over the odds for this one and thats all that interests me he was lying she knew that but she nodded calmly and sipped some more coffee good i think ill lie down for a while you do that as she went to open the door to the other room he said you know its funny but i seem to know you from somewhere she turned and shook her head not possible mr carson you see id have remembered you and she went into the bedroom and closed the door currys case with the priests cassock was not needed now and she pushed it under the bed she examined the other placing the nuns habit on the bed taking out the ak and beretta removing the clips then reloading them there were two spare clips for each and a capacious shoulder bag in soft black leather she took the two thousand pounds from her raincoat pockets and put them in the bottom of the suitcase under the nuns habit placed the ak its butt folded in the shoulder bag then dropped the bag back in the suitcase she put the suitcase against the wall then took off the raincoat and lay on the bed in her tracksuit her right hand on the beretta beside her the light was so dim that she left it on in any case she didnt want total darkness in case she saw him again that shadowy figure with the arm raised and the gun in spite of herself her eyes closed and after a while she slept fitfully and across the atlantic at andrews air force base a black sedan drove across the tarmac and pulled up beside the waiting gulfstream it was three oclock in the morning in england but with a fivehour time difference only ten at night in america patrick keogh was quite alone except for an air force driver and the base commander got out and opened the door for him nice and private this plane senator as requested but the crew are air force there were three of them all wearing rather anonymous navyblue airline uniforms captains harris and ford take care of the flying and sergeant black takes care of you keogh shook hands with all three and turned to the base commander many thanks your luggage is on board and youre cleared for immediate takeoff senator the base commander saluted good luck sir keogh went up the steps into the luxurious interior of the gulfstream found himself a seat and strapped in sergeant black checked him out ive got full meal facilities senator i believe your wife suggested the menu anytime you like once were airborne just say the word sounds good to me keogh said the engines had already fired and black went and strapped in himself a few moments later the gulfstream roared down the runway lifted off and started to climb grace came awake with a start and stared up at the ceiling a gray light filtered in and rain pattered against the pane she realized she could smell cooking got up and sat on the edge of the bed for a moment she put the beretta in one of her tracksuit pockets moved to the door and opened it carson had a frying pan on the stove and he turned and smiled eggs and bacon best i can do but youll need something inside you she was surprised to find that she felt hungry and checked her watch it was sixfifteen she opened the door and looked outside at the relentless rain it looks rough will there be a problem not really he told her and dished out the bacon and eggs on two metal plates a bit bumpy to start but well soon climb above it theres bread and butter there and tea in the pot help yourself at about the same time dillon and hannah bernstein arrived in cavendish square and were admitted to ferguson s flat by kim who vanished at once into the kitchen ferguson appeared from his bedroom fastening a guards tie ah there you are have you had breakfast hannah glanced at dillon hardly sir we knew you were anxious for an early start very conscientious of you chief inspector well beat the traffic to gatwick time enough to have breakfast at one of the airport cafes jesus but youre a thoughtful man brigadier dillon said arent i which is why i told kim to make us a nice pot of tea at that moment the ghurka came in with a tray there you are ferguson said help yourselves while i finish dressing and he went out it was soon after that the cessna conquest roared along the runway at coldwater and lifted into the rain carson was sitting in the pilots seat a chart spread on the righthand seat grace sat in a seat at the rear of the cabin her suitcase wedged between two seats on the other side she looked out of the window and saw only rain and heavy cloud the plane rocked from side to side and was buffeted by a crosswind as they turned and climbed after a while they broke out through the cloud but there was no sunshine only a great vault of gray the buffeting had stopped now and they seemed to have leveled out curtain up she said softly first act she leaned back and closed her eyes at precisely nine oclock the lear jet lifted off at gatwick and started to climb ferguson sat on the right of the gangway hannah bernstein on his left dillon sat opposite her facing them the phone rang and hannah bernstein answered it she listened then said thank you and put it down what was that ferguson said the yard the river police have recovered grace brownings bmw but not her oh shell come up eventually ferguson said and well have a lovely funeral half of show business crying into their hankies if you dont mind me saying so sir that is rather callous hannah told him thats as may be as for me id be happier if id seen her laid out on the slab dillon said its my superstitious nature now that is being melodramatic ferguson told him go and do something useful from what the pilot tells me the weather at shannon isnt marvelous go and check with him youre the flyer dillon unbuckled his seat belt and ferguson took a times from the pile of newspapers hed purchased at gatwick and opened it after a while he said here we go coroners inquest on rupert lang today shouldnt dillon have been there sir i got an exclusion order from the home office defense of the realm and all that so the coroner has agreed to accept dillons written statement i wrote it myself rather good dillon was acting as a security guard lang suggested they go for a ride on the motorcycles and it went tragically wrong what about the shepherd sam lee all that lout can say is what he saw they were riding along the track and lang lost control and went through the gate funeral is tomorrow st margarets westminster i should think that will be quite a turnout hannah said good god yes theyll all be there the pm and the cabinet leader of the opposition not to mention officers from the grenadiers and the parachute regiment after all he was a hero ferguson said mc and all that brave officer theyll see him out in style he must be laughing his head off she said yes he always was a cynical bastard dillon came back and slid into his seat low cloud and turbulence at shannon and heavy rain thats expected to last most of the day any problems ferguson asked not with the two lads up there in the cockpit flying this thing they flew tornadoes in the gulf war twenty trips each to baghdad thats all right then good dillon said well have some tea and just to stay politically correct and on the right side of miss wonderful here ill make it the conquest came out of cloud at approximately a thousand feet and saw the coast of ireland ahead county waterford to be precise carson went lower approaching the coastline at five hundred feet over a turbulent sea and then as grace looked out they were across green fields below hedgerows and farmhouses a few miles inland and he started to climb until they were enveloped in cloud she unbuckled her belt and went forward and tapped him on the shoulder and he pulled down his earphones any problems she asked none so far but there are headwinds from now on will it hinder us my timing is of absolute importance i shouldnt think so thanks to that early start if it stays like this well have a tailwind most of the way back a much quicker trip home good she said theres a black box back there by the luggage compartment and toilet youll find a thermos flask of boiled water and coffee and tea bags whats your preference coffee very black ill see to it and she turned and went along the gangway the lear jet came in to shannon airport sixteen miles west of limerick at twenty minutes to eleven the pilot made an excellent landing and proceeded to a dispersal point at the far end of the hangars as ordered an area of little activity the only other machine in sight was a helicopter two crew visible in the cockpit there was also a black rover car parked there a driver at the wheel and a large man in a navyblue raincoat and an umbrella over his head came forward as one of the pilots opened the door of the lear jet and the stairs came down ferguson went first followed by hannah bernstein and dillon who carried a canvas holdall bag the big man had a cork accent and a tough hard face to him brigadier ferguson im chief superintendent patrick hare special branch ferguson shook hands this is my assistant chief inspector hannah bernstein of scotland yards special branch a great pleasure hare shook her hand and this rogue is one sean dillon of whom you may have heard over the years hares astonishment was plain holy mother of god i cant believe it in the flesh dillon said i remember back in the eighties i was on the run in the republic and you were snapping at my heels chief inspector then hare grinned reluctantly so youve gone over havent we all these days dillon said and offered his hand after a slight hesitation hare took it and turned to ferguson theres an office in the hangar we can use the gulfstream carrying senator keogh is twenty minutes out as you can see the helicopter is ready and waiting how much do you know ferguson asked as they went into the hangar everything ive been briefed by the prime minister himself who stressed the need for total secrecy which is why hes not here himself it would obviously attract too much attention of course ferguson said as they went into the office there was a tray with cups a thermos flask and milk on a desk hare said tea there if it takes your fancy how long to reach drumgoole ferguson asked as hannah opened the thermos half an hour ill wait until youre ten minutes on your way and then ill telephone the mother superior sister mary fitzgerald a good kind soul i know her well the father confessor to the little sisters of pity at drumgoole is father tim mcguire a decent ould stick just the nuns and the school kids there and theyll all go potty when they hear keogh is coming but not for long ardmore house is whats important ferguson said as hannah handed tea round well i wish him well there hare said i think hes going to need it how close grace was at carson s shoulder now not far fifteen miles and where is drumgoole abbey from here we fly over it good id like to take a look she went back to her seat and peered out of the window the conquest came out of cloud at two thousand feet into heavy rain and there it was in a pleasant wooded valley below the abbey a schoolhouse and several cottages grace took in the lay of the land the approach road leading up from the valley and disappearing into a vast forest area the conquest continued for another ten miles and during that time she opened the suitcase took off her tracksuit trousers then dressed in the nuns habit not easy in the restricted space of the cabin but years of having to change in cramped dressing rooms had given her a certain expertise she finished off by pulling on a pair of black knee socks and black flatheeled shoes she took the shoulder bag out pushed the case between two seats and sat waiting kilbeg was a desolate sort of place the grass runway plain there was a wind sock on a pole a ruined cottage at the north end a shed beside it and as they landed she could see a dark green car parked inside the plane rolled to a halt close to the cottage and carson switched off when he got out of the pilots seat and saw her he looked truly shocked god in heaven the door mr carson he got the airstair door open and went down the steps turning to give her a hand she accepted lifting the skirt of her habit with the other and they ran through the relentless rain to the shelter of the shed the car was a toyota saloon the door wasnt locked but when she opened it there was no key in the ignition she felt under the rubber mat and found it at once she turned to carson and held it up here we are she got behind the wheel and put the shoulder bag on the passenger seat how long will you be carson asked two to two and a half hours if im lucky ive got to have a time cant wait forever she looked up at him calmly be here when i return mr carson i need hardly remind you that colonel belov has a very long arm there would be nowhere you could go that he couldnt find you he shrugged dont get me wrong its just that i dont want to hang around too long you wont have to she switched on the engine and drove away the gulfstream landed and taxied toward the hangars taking up position beside the lear jet patrick hare said ill go and get him he walked out toward the gulfstream under his umbrella and the door opened and the stairs came down followed by sergeant black a moment later captains harris and ford appeared they lined up at the bottom of the stairs and keogh joined them shaking hands with each in turn as ferguson watched hare engaged the senator in a brief conversation then they walked toward the hangar brigadier great to see you again keogh said and you dillon allow me to introduce my aide detective chief inspector hannah bernstein ferguson told him keogh gave her his best smile a real pleasure maam and shook hands dillon said we have a present for you senator he opened the holdall he had been carrying kevlar jacket latest model oh no keogh groaned must i those things make you look like youve put on twenty pounds they also stop most bullets from most modern rifles stone dead dillon said unless theyre armor piercing am i supposed to feel happy with that thought keogh took off the jacket and waistcoat he was wearing and hare and dillon helped him into the kevlar jacket well get armani to make this stuff into suits next season dillon said itll save everyone a lot of trouble they fastened the velcro tabs and helped him back into his waistcoat and suit jacket there was a small mirror on the wall and keogh stood back and examined himself yes he said i can see now that ill definitely have to cut out the potatoes he grinned can we go now grace browning followed the road through the forest and paused while still in its cover to look at the abbey to her left there was a track leading into a further spread of trees she drove along it then paused while still screened from view reversed and parked the toyota pointing back the way she had come she could see down into the abbey gardens various paths leading down to the abbey itself although there was no one about in the heavy rain she turned to get her shoulder bag and noticed that there was a black folding umbrella on the backseat whether by accident or design it didnt matter she pulled out the telescope handle put the umbrella up against the rain and went down through the gardens at that moment patrick hare telephoned drumgoole abbey and asked for sister mary fitzgerald there was a slight delay before she came on yes who is it sister mary its chief superintendent pat hare ive got a shock for you in approximately fifteen minutes a helicopter will be landing on your front lawn and why would it be doing that because it has senator patrick keogh on board he wants to visit the keogh chapel and see the stainedglass window holy mother of god i cant believe it youd better sister because hell be dropping into your lap minutes from now she slammed down the phone and ran into the main office where three sisters were working at their desks drop everything sisters she cried ive just heard that a helicopter is arriving with senator patrick keogh on board weve fifteen minutes at the most sister margaret you and sister josephine get over to the school and have all the children taken to the abbey church sister amy you will see that the acolytes are properly dressed for whatever service father tim wants to give ill warn father tim now hurry she chased them to the door was about to leave herself when she remembered and went to the internal phone sister clara were going to need the organ so get over to the church senator keogh is coming she slammed the phone down went out and ran along the corridor holding up the skirts of her habit she went out of the main door and ran through the rain to the great door of the abbey pushed it open and hurried inside when she opened the vestry door father tim was sitting at his desk very frail with snowwhite hair and steelrimmed glasses he turned in shocked surprise sister mary what on earth is it she collapsed in the other chair quite breathless and told him grace browning moved down through a walled kitchen garden her umbrella sheltering her from the rain as she got closer to the abbey she saw considerable activity nuns running backwards and forwards through the rain and then a crocodile of young girls in white blouses navyblue school skirts and white socks moving from the school to the abbey a number of nuns hurrying alongside and trying rather ineffectually to protect them with umbrellas grace stood watching and a nun turned and on catching sight of her called come sister we need you senator keogh is coming at that distance and with the umbrella over her head she was just another nun but she seized the opportunity hurried down and joined on the end of the tail of children as they went in through the great door of the abbey inside they moved up the center aisle toward the high altar grace browning put down her umbrella paused just inside glancing around her then saw a stone spiral staircase through an archway a gallery above it she moved forward without hesitation and went up as the helicopter approached drumgoole senator keogh said what is it with the kevlar jacket and so on brigadier do we really have a problem let me put it this way senator if there was a problem it no longer exists were just taking full precaution well one things for sure keogh said looking out as they approached the abbey the visit down there should be the least of my problems its what im going to say at ardmore that concerns me were so close brigadier so damn close to getting the ira to make a peace initiative weve got to make it work weve just got to i couldnt agree more senator ferguson told him as the helicopter settled on the lawn the second pilot came back and opened the door sister mary fitzgerald and father tim wearing an alb over his cassock and a stole around his neck stood waiting dillon handed keogh an umbrella youll need this senator this is ireland remember and how could i forget that keogh grinned he went down the steps and crossed to the abbey and ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon went after him from the gallery grace browning had a perfect view of events below the schoolgirls so excited half a dozen boys acolytes bright in their scarlet cassocks and white cottas although she did not know who sister mary fitzgerald was she realized she was in charge from the way she marshaled people and shed also noticed father tim arranging things in the side chapel that must be the keogh memorial there was a sudden excited murmur from the nuns grouped at the door which spread to the children and then patrick keogh walked in followed by ferguson dillon and hannah bernstein well well grace said softly old home week she moved to a position behind a pillar from which she could see across into the keogh chapel put the shoulder bag on the floor took out the ak and unfolded the butt such an honor senator sister mary fitzgerald told him the honor is mine he replied if we could show you the window senator father tim said a fitting memorial to your great ancestor im sure it is keogh said and followed him there was a small altar in front of the stainedglass window and three young girls neat in their school uniforms stood in front of it holding tiny bouquets of flowers patrick keogh smiled and stepped toward them whats this in the gallery leaned against the pillar took aim and her finger eased on the trigger at the same moment a young girl ran forward holding out a bunch of flowers crossing keogh and grace pulled the weapon up there was the inimitable muted crack of a silenced ak and a large vase on the altar disintegrated dillon called down senator down thats rifle fire the girls at the altar turned and patrick keogh presenting his back flung his arms around the three nearest pulling them close and grace browning shot him twice sixteen dillon drew his walther looking up saw a movement and raised his gun to fire it was hannah who called out to stop him no dillon no and then he saw the figure in the gallery and realized it was a nun he turned and ran to keogh whom ferguson was already bending over the senator was gasping for breath as they pulled him up bring him into the vestry father tim said he needs to sit down as grace browning stepped back she heard a sound turned and saw a boy of perhaps ten in scarlet cassock and white cotta she stood there looking at him holding the ak across her front he gazed at her roundeyed as she folded the butt and replaced it in the shoulder bag she put a finger to her lips be a good boy now she said in an irish accent and be off with you he turned and ran the other way and she went down the spiral staircase in the vestry they got keoghs jacket and waistcoat off and removed the kevlar jacket god help me the senator said but i feel like ive been kicked in the back twice by a mule dillon showed him the two rounds embedded in the kevlar jacket you could have been dead except that you made me wear that damn thing keogh said ferguson shook his head not good enough senator i was responsible and i got it wrong in some way i got it wrong sister mary fitzgerald standing listening opened the door and went out there were children at the main door nuns trying to control them in the porch and father tim doing his best to help sister mary fitzgerald took him to one side its incredible someone tried to shoot senator keogh the ira father tim asked and why would they do that to one of their own praise be to god he was wearing a bulletproof jacket hes all right at that moment the young acolyte from the gallery ran up sobbing what is it liam father tim asked im frightened father i was in the gallery and there was a nun there someone i didnt know and what was so special about her she had a rifle father on the other side of the pillar where she had overheard everything grace browning eased away and slipped out of the church through a side door putting up her umbrella she started up through the gardens she reached the woods and her car within five minutes got behind the wheel and drove away she felt quite calm she had tried and she had failed that was how the script had turned out and there was nothing to be done about it she was here dillon said instead of at the bottom of the thames the whole thing was a trick cant you see lang and curry were dead so she had to die too to fool us my god ferguson said what a woman but how hannah bernstein demanded that charade in wapping that was only a few hours ago how did she get here how did we get here dillon said i suspect she did it the same way ferguson said theres only one important thing at the end of the day she failed he turned and went to keogh who sat there on a chair breathing deeply are you all right senator im here arent i and do you feel up to ardmore house keogh laughed and yet there was a hardness to him i sure as hell do ive come this far so lets do it brigadier grace browning drove very fast most of the way through the forest was at kilbeg within twenty minutes of leaving drumgoole there was nothing to keep her here now no way of interfering with what was to take place at ardmore house the best thing to do was to get out she parked inside the shed beside the ruined cottage and killed the engine then she got out of the toyota her shoulder bag in one hand and walked toward the conquest holding the umbrella over her head carson got out to meet her everything okay she smiled calmly couldnt be better coldwater next stop so lets get moving and she went up the steps in front of him in the helicopter ferguson sat apart from them the telephone to his ear finally he put it down and moved to join them ive spoken to chief superintendent hare hell do what he can but i dont think it will be much i mean what do we have an eightyearold boy says he saw a nun in the gallery with a rifle not much of a description a nun in ireland dillon said exactly keogh was drinking black coffee supplied by hannah from a thermos it seems to me theres more here than meets the eye brigadier do i get to know of course senator if anyone has a right to know its you ferguson turned to dillon youre the irishman the storyteller so lets see what you can do when dillon was finished keogh said lets stick with the basics this woman this grace browning is whats left of january thats right dillon said you last saw her apparently going into the river thames yesterday you assume it was she who tried to shoot me now how could she have been there and turn up here we were there sir hannah bernstein said and we turned up here a few hours flying thats all and i suspect she did the same ferguson said but where is she now keogh asked adrift in ireland ferguson shook his head i doubt it sir if she flew in shell already be flying back leaving us with one god almighty mess keogh said the whole drumgoole thing could hit front pages all over the world i dont think so sir most of the children virtually all of them have no idea what happened back there there was one hell of a scrummage as for the little boy in the gallery he can be handled mother mary and father tim will do whatever chief superintendent hare suggests im certain of that its a remote place and the damage limitation will keep the lid on things in the immediate future by the time any kind of story leaks out it can be dismissed as fantasy he smiled this is after all ireland senator my god patrick keogh said after this events on capitol hill will seem like an everyday story of country folk the conquest was heading east fast grace browning changed out of the nuns habit carefully folded everything and replaced it in the suitcase she had failed all that effort and she had failed strange because that wasnt the way the script had intended at all she opened the thermos had some coffee and sat back thinking of rupert and tom she closed her eyes the man wasnt there only the darkness and after a while she slept the helicopter dropped in at the lawn in front of ardmore house two men were posted in the porch on either side of the door both carrying armalites and two men stood on the lawn itself holding umbrellas against the rain gerry adams and martin mcguinness the helicopter settled and the pilot killed the engine patrick keogh turned to ferguson this is it then well wait for you senator like hell you will after what weve been through i want you to hear what i have to say the second pilot opened the door keogh clambered out and dillon grabbed an umbrella gerry adams came forward a pleasure to see you again senator he shook hands this is martin mcguinness ferguson and hannah emerged and joined the group keogh said brigadier charles ferguson his aide chief inspector hannah bernstein and sean dillon we know only too well who brigadier ferguson is gerry adams said good keogh told him id like the brigadier and his people to hear what i have to say gerry adams looked at mcguinness who nodded fine senator whatever you want theyre all waiting for you theyve just been told they walked toward the house keogh leading with ferguson and hannah behind adams and mcguinness took up the rear on either side of dillon a long time sean adams said belfast seventyeight dillon told him i remember it well we got out of the falls road one night using the same sewer he turned to mcguinness and you martin the old days in derry were like a bad movie incredible adams told him you nearly got john major and the whole british cabinet in downing street in ninetyone and here you are with ferguson turncoat is it sean mcguinness asked and arent we all that now in the cause of peace dillon shot back gerry adams exploded into laughter god help us but hes got you there martin he said as they followed the others up the steps to the entrance the entrance hall of ardmore house was very large and there were at least fifty men crammed in there and a handful of women ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon stood against the wall at the back and keogh was halfway up the huge staircase flanked by adams and mcguinness gerry adams said one of our own senator patrick keogh listen to what he has to say thats all i ask there was a murmur that stilled as keogh started to speak when my greatgrandfather left ireland all those years ago for east boston it was to find a new life to be an american but like so many other families in the same tradition we were irish americans good catholics with warm memories of home and nationalist ideals ireland must be free that was our creed but i think we perhaps forgot one thing and its this there are just as many irish americans with protestant roots as catholic there was a murmur from the crowd and he raised his hand bear with me friends i beg you im a catholic by birth perhaps not a good one but ill always remain one and isnt there room for all of us when i was a youngster and involved with irish history i was much influenced by wolfe tone who founded the united irishmen he said that ireland had a right to assert its independence i agreed with everything he wrote and was amazed to discover that he was a protestant someone laughed and there was scattered clapping he carried on the other day someone quoted an ancient protestant toast to me our country too he paused and there was total silence we should seize that toast my friends ireland belongs to every decent irish man and woman irrespective of creed if you can go forward and declare that as your belief make peace after twentyfive bloody years reach out your hand and say to the other side lets go forward together then i think that would be the most significant step ever taken in the history of this country there was total stillness and then someone started to clap and the clapping spread and suddenly there was cheering and the applause mounted ferguson turned to hannah bernstein and dillon thats it back to the helicopter walking through the rain beneath the single umbrella dillon had hannah said what did you think sir very impressive and you dillon she turned to him ive lived my life day by day for the past twentyfive years he said ive a habit of expecting the worst bastard she said at the bottom of the steps leading up to the gulfstream keogh turned to ferguson and shook hands an interesting experience brigadier if i can ever do you a favor thank you sir keogh took hannahs hand chief inspector he turned to dillon you know you havent said much since drumgoole come on dillon one irishman to another i was thinking what a terrible pity it was that there wasnt a press photographer present when she fired at you and you turned your back and protected those little girls god theyd have elected you president dillon sighed and nobody will ever know ill know patrick keogh grinned goodbye my friend and he went up the steps they stood in the shelter of the hangar and watched the gulfstream lift into the gray sky hare turned to ferguson what about this grace browning i dont think you need to worry about her ferguson said instinct tells me shell be on her way back to my patch and what then an interesting point ferguson said shes dead remember drowned in the river thames after an unfortunate accident but she isnt hare said what happens when she surfaces she wont ferguson said not in the way you mean you see shes not quite on her own yet chief superintendent i do have a source i can go to dont worry about it ill handle it believe me he shook hands thanks for your help just do me one favor hare said dont come back for a while i dont think i could stand the excitement ferguson laughed then turned to dillon and hannah come on you two he said to dillon and hannah put up his umbrella and walked toward the lear jet the conquest landed at coldwater just before darkness fell inside the hangar carson killed the engines got out of the pilots seat dropped the airstair door and went down grace browning slung her bag over her shoulder picked up the suitcase and followed he was lighting a cigarette and paused in the entrance to look out at the desolate landscape and the rain when he turned there was a different look on his face hard calculating i said i thought i knew you and now i remember i saw you in a film on television really she said so what i dont know what youve been up to but whatever it is its worth more than ive been paid i had a look in your suitcase while you were away i found that two thousand pounds ive taken it you shouldnt have done that she said calmly you can suit yourself oh i will she reached into her shoulder bag took out the beretta and shot him twice in the heart carson fell back against the tail of the conquest bounced off and fell on his back he was already dead when she leaned down felt inside his flying jacket and found the two bundles of tenpound notes her mad money she frowned at the thought is that what i am she put the money in her shoulder bag picked up the suitcase went out and rolled the hangar door shut then she walked to her mini car got in and drove away the lear jet had already landed at gatwick and as the daimler drove down into london ferguson spoke to the prime minister on the phone dillon and hannah bernstein sat there listening and finally ferguson put the phone down and what did the great man have to say dillon asked damn glad things worked out for keogh as they did but hes horrified that the browning woman is out there like a loose cannon wants to make sure we do something about her but what can we do sir hannah asked ferguson smiled i think its time i spoke to yuri belov and he leaned back in his seat grace browning drove into a motorway service area just before reaching the outskirts of london she sat there in the car in the rain for a while feeling very tired drained of all emotion finally she got out and made her way through the parked cars to the cafe there was a newsstand by the shop just inside the entrance copies of the latest edition of the evening standard stacked there and rupert langs face stared out at her she took a copy went into the cafe and got a coffee then went and sat at a corner table and looked at the paper it was all there his career in the army his presence at bloody sunday his subsequent years in politics and then the tragic accident there was a smaller photo of tom curry a discreet mention of the fact they had lived together for many years the circumstances of currys unfortunate death were treated fully and the inference was plain she turned the page automatically and saw a standard theatrical photo of herself the article was brief and to the point while going home from the kings head on her motorcycle the police had attempted to stop her from speeding for some reason she had refused to stop and after a furious chase had gone over the edge of a wharf in wapping river police were still looking for her body very clever ferguson she said softly drank some of the coffee and turned back to the front page rupert was in uniform in the photo and wore the red beret of the parachute regiment and two medals one for the irish campaign and the military cross he was standing outside buckingham palace and the photo had obviously been taken after being decorated by the queen he looked handsome and rather devilmaycare dear rupert she said i never really understood why you did it not any of it the article said that his body would be on view for friends who wished to pay their last respects at an undertakers named seaton and sons in great george street by the treasury the burial service would be at st margarets westminster at three in the afternoon she thought about it and smiled to herself she had to say goodbye to rupert that was obvious but first there was one last thing to do she went and got some change at the counter and found a telephone belov in his office at the embassy picked up the phone and recognized her voice instantly he was excited and nervous where are you motorway service station just outside london what happened theres been nothing on the news did you get him oh i got him all right yuri twice in the back only he was wearing a kevlar jacket my god they were all there ferguson dillon bernstein but i got away with no trouble and flew back with carson yes but there was a slight problem there he recognized me then stole a couple of thousand pounds i had in my case belovs heart sank and you killed him he didnt leave me much choice did he i left him on his back beside his plane in the hangar you kill everybody grace and so easily belov told her you helped create me yuri an angel of death was what you wanted and thats what you got anyway what will you do now i dont know personally i dont see that you have a choice she said if you go back to moscow theyll shoot you in some cellar isnt that the usual reward for failure handed out by your people id make my peace with ferguson if i were you hell look after you yuri youre too valuable to waste and you he asked what about you oh ill go and see rupert his body is on display at an undertakers in westminster the funeral is tomorrow but what happens then ferguson and dillon now know youre not at the bottom of the river theyll hunt you down youve no place to go i know yuri but i dont care anymore take care of yourself she hung up the phone left the cafe and walked to her car a few moments later she was driving to london yuri belov sat there at his desk racked by conflicting emotions she was right of course there was nothing back there in moscow but a bullet and the trouble was he actually preferred london now he opened a deep drawer and took out a bottle of vodka and a glass he filled it and poured the vodka down at that moment his phone rang again colonel yuri belov charles ferguson here dont you think its time you stopped playing silly buggers senator keogh is alive and well grace browning is on the run yes i know all this belov said shes just spoken to me really ferguson said now that is interesting an extraordinary woman but i now believe her to be truly mad belov said we can discuss that later the point is are you going to let your people ship you back to moscow in disgrace not a very agreeable proposition the crime rate there is worse than in new york now bread queues winter coming on and theyd very probably shoot you and whats your alternative come over to us my dear chap it would be the intelligence coup of my career to get my hands on someone like you youll be well taken care of financially well find you a decent apartment new identity very tempting belov said and all you have to do is put on your coat and leave the embassy now just walk out you know the pub on the opposite side of kensington park gardens of course ill be there in twenty minutes ill expect you belov put down the phone and poured himself another vodka he raised his glass in a toast to ideals he said softly but then one must have a practical approach to life he swallowed the vodka then went to get his coat switched off his office light and went out in the booth at the pub opposite kensington park gardens ferguson dillon and hannah bernstein listened to yuri belov the russian finally finished there it is he said ferguson nodded so she said she was going to see rupert well we know where that is hes lying in his coffin at seaton and sons undertakers in great george street you actually think shell turn up sir hannah bernstein asked shes nowhere else to go chief inspector ferguson told her by the way youd better get on to the kent constabulary tell them to check out this airfield at coldwater he sighed poor devils theyre going to have another unsolved murder case on their patch he stood up and checked his watch seventhirty on a nice dark rainy london night with a touch of fog at the end of the street it would take dickens to do justice to it dillon said are we going where i think we are seaton and sons great george street ferguson said ive always been fascinated by funeral parlors grace browning pulled into another motorway service area as she reached london she parked took her suitcase and went to the rest area for women there was no one about and she went into a vacant stall closed the door and opened the suitcase when she emerged five minutes later she was dressed as a nun again she walked back to the car put the case on the rear seat and drove back onto the motorway heading for central london it was just after ninethirty that she arrived at great george street in westminster and found herself a vacant parking place at the side of the street she sat there for a while then reached for the black shoulder bag and opened it she removed the ak and put it in the suitcase then she got out the bag over her shoulder and walked along the street her umbrella up there was a uniformed policeman walking toward her and she paused and said in a soft irish accent excuse me officer but im looking for an undertakers seaton and sons i believe its somewhere about here his raincoat was wet sparkling in the light from a street lamp indeed it is sister just over the road on the right you can see the light over the door thank you she said and crossed the road he watched her go then turned and carried on she found the door the name seaton and sons etched in acid on the glass paused then tried the handle and went in there was the allpervading smell of flowers peculiar to funeral parlors she walked

and opened the door im sorry sister how can i help you mr rupert lang she said ah yes we put mr lang in the main parlor weve had visitors most of the afternoon let me show you he led the way along a dark corridor doors open and inside she could see coffins banked with flowers these are our normal chapels of rest he said but mr lang being a special case he was put in the main parlor as i said weve had a lot of visitors to see him there were three gentlemen and a lady a little while ago but they must have gone he opened the door and led her into a large room it was a place of shadows just a little subdued lighting flowers banked everywhere and the coffin at the far end on a plinth ill leave you now sister he closed the door and went away she stood beside the coffin and looked down only rupert langs head and shoulders showed he wore a navyblue suit and a guards tie his face was very calm not rupert at all more like a wax mask my poor rupert she said aloud i let you down im afraid it
