jack higgins dark side of the street war game somewhere across the moor gunfire rumbled menacingly strangely subdued in the heat of the afternoon and below in the quarry where the prisoners laboured stripped to the waist there was a sudden stir of interest ben hoffa worked in the shadow of the north face amongst a jumble of great blocks of slate and he paused as he swung the ten pound hammer above his head and lowered it slowly to look up towards the distant hills a hand shading his eyes from the sun he was a small man in his late thirties muscular and wiry with good shoulders his hair prematurely grey the eyes as cold and hard as the blocks of slate around him his partner obrien a tall stolid irishman loosened the crowbar he was holding with easy strength and straightened a frown on his face and what in the hell would that be field artillery hoffa told him obrien stared at him blankly you must be joking summer manoeuvresthe army hold them every year around this time in the distance three transport planes moved over the horizon and as they watched a line of silken canopies fluttered open as men stepped into space to float down like thistledown blown on a summer breeze the sensation of space and complete freedom was so acute that obrien was conscious of a sudden aching emptiness in his stomach his hands gripped the crowbar convulsively and hoffa shook his head not a chance paddy you wouldnt get five miles obrien dropped the crowbar to the ground and wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of a hand it makes you think though the first five years are the worst hoffa said his face expressionless there was the crunch of a boot on loose stones behind them obrien glanced over his shoulder and reached for the crowbar parker he said simply hoffa showed no particular interest and continued to watch the paratroopers drift down behind the breast of the moor three or four miles away as the young prison officer approached in spite of the heat there was a touch of guardsmanlike elegance about the neatly starched openneck shirt with its militarystyle epaulettes and the tilt of the uniform cap over the eyes he paused a yard or two away the staff in his right hand moving menacingly and what in the hell do you think youre on hoffa he demanded harshly a sunday school outing hoffa turned glanced at him casually and without speaking spat on his palms swung the hammer high and brought it down squarely on the head of the crowbar splitting the block of slate in two with an insolent grace all right paddy he said to the irishman lets have another for all the notice he had taken of him parker might not have existed for a moment the prison officer stood there his face white and then he turned suddenly and walked away you want to watch it ben obrien said hell have you that one if it takes all year hell have you thats what im counting on hoffa said and ignoring the expression of shocked amazement that appeared on the irishmans face he swung the hammer high above his head and brought it down again with unerring aim hagen the principal officer stood by one of the landrovers at the top of the dirt road that led into the quarry and smoked a cigarette a black and tan alsatian crouched at his feet he was a tall heavily built man nearing retirement and a thirty year sentence spent at various of her majestys prisons had failed to erase an expression of natural kindliness from the pleasant bronzed face he watched parker approach aware from the set of the mans shoulders that something was wrong and sighed heavily amazing how difficult some people made it for themselves whats wrong now he said as parker joined him hoffa parker slapped his staff hard against the palm of his left hand he really needles me that one what did he do dumb insolence wed have called it in the guards thats an army chargeit wont wash here hagen pointed out i know that only too damned well parker leaned against the bonnet of the landrover a muscle twitching in his right cheek it doesnt help matters when every con in the place treats him like lord god almighty hes a big man in their book not in mine he isnt just another cheap crook hardly that hagen laughed gently nine hundred thousand quid is quite a bundle by anyones standards and not a sou of it recoveredremember that and what did it buy him parker demanded five years behind bars and another fifteen to go that really must have taken genius poor old ben hagen grinned he put too much trust in a woman a lot of good men have made that mistake before him parker exploded angrily now youre sticking up for him for gods sake the smile was wiped from hagens face as if by an invisible hand and when he replied there was steel in his voice not exactly but i do try to understand him which is a major part of my job yours too though that fact seems to have escaped your notice so far before the younger man could reply he glanced at his watch and added three oclock well have them in for tea if you please mr parker he turned and walked a few paces away the alsatian at his heels and parker stood there glaring after him after a moment or two he seemed to gain some sort of control took his whistle from his pocket and blew a shrill blast below in the quarry hoffa dropped his hammer and obrien straightened not before time he said and picked up his shirt from all parts of the quarry prisoners converged on the track and climbed towards the landrovers where parker was waiting to dispense tea from an urn which stood in the back of one of the vehicles each man picked up a mug from a pile at one side and moved past him and hagen and half a dozen other officers stood in a group lighting cigarettes hoffa took his tea ignoring parker completely gazing towards the horizon where a couple of helicopters had swung into view he moved to join obrien who was watching them intently now wouldnt it be the grand thing if theyd drop in kind of unexpected like and whisk us away the irishman observed hoffa watched the helicopters drift across the distant hills and shook his head not a chance paddy theyre army air corps augustabell scout copters they only take the pilot and one passenger youd need something a little more substantial obrien swallowed some of his tea and made a wry face i wonder what they make it withturpentine hoffa didnt reply he watched the helicopters disappear over the horizon and turned to hagen who stood a couple of yards away talking to another officer could i have the time mr hagen thinking of going somewhere ben hagen demanded goodhumouredly and there was general laughter you never know hagen glanced at his watch threefifteen hoffa nodded his thanks gazed down at the contents of the enamel mug in his right hand for a moment and then walked towards the landrover where parker still stood beside the tea urn he frowned warily as hoffa approached and held out the mug would you mind telling me what this is supposed to be mr parker sir he said mildly behind him the voices died away and hagen called sharply whats all this then hoffa hoffa replied without turning round a simple enough question mr hagen he held the mug out towards parker have you tasted it mr parker have i hell parker said and the knuckles of his right hand showed white as he tightened his grip on his staff then i really think you should hoffa said gently and tossed the contents of the mug into parkers face there was a moment of stunned silence and then everything seemed to happen at once parker moved in with a cry of rage his staff flailing down and hoffa ducked under it doubled him over with a fist to the stomach and raised a knee into the decending face behind him there was a roar of excitement from the other prisoners and a moment later he was on the ground borne down by a rush of officers there was a brief struggle and he was jerked to his feet wrists handcuffed in front of him the alsatian snarled on the end of its steel chain driving the excited prisoners back hagen shouting for order he got it in the end turned and came toward hoffa a slight puzzled frown on his face all the instinct all the experience of thirty hard years telling him that there was something wrong here you bloody fool he said softly six months remission gone and for what hoffa gazed past him stolidly face impassive and hagen shrugged and turned to parker who leaned against the landrover blood on his face are you all right my nose is broken think you could drive parker nodded a handkerchief to his face i dont see why not hagen turned to one of the other officers im leaving you in charge mr smith get them working and no nonsense i expect to see some sweat when i get back the prisoners were marched away and hagen slipped the alsatians lead the dog moved across to hoffa sniffing at his boots and hagen said lets have you then into the back of the green landrover any funny stuff and ill put the dog on youthats a promise hoffa moved across the landrover without a word the alsatian at his heels he climbed inside sat on one of the benches and waited a moment later hagen joined him closing and locking the rear door a small glass window gave a view of the interior of the cab parkers face appeared momentarily the brief glance he gave hoffa full of venom he nodded to hagen and a moment later the engine roared into life and they drove away as the landrover turned on to the dirt road that led across the moor hagen leaned across a frown on his face all right ben whats it all about but hoffa ignored him gazing past his shoulder through the side window across the moors his face calm and impassive in some strange way it was as if he was waiting for something somewhere to the east of them gunfire rumbled again and the brief ominous chatter of a machine gun was answered by sporadic shooting hagen glanced out of the side window and saw the red berets of the paratrooopers moving across a hillside two or three miles away another scout helicopter drifted across the horizon and the alsatian growled uneasily he ran a hand along its broad flank and patted it gently only a game boy only a game as the dog subsided there was a sudden roar of an engine in the west and another helicopter lifted over the hillside and swept in towards the road for a moment it kept pace with them so close that he could read the code name painted on its side in white letters the hatch was open and a soldier crouched there looking out his green beret a splash of vivid colour look like commandos hagen said to his surprise hoffa answered him sibemartin troop carrier they can manage a dozen men and equipment theyve been using them in borneo lately the commando waved and the helicopter swung ahead of them lifted over a rise and disappeared hagen turned to face hoffa you seem to know your stuff there was an article in globe magazine last month hoffa said its in the library hagen shook his head and sighed youre a funny bloke ben i never could figure you out and thats a fact unexpectedly hoffa smiled immediately looking about ten years younger thats what my old man used to say too late now though too late for all of us i suppose youre right hagen reached for his cigarettes and as he got them out the landrover went over the rise and started down a heavily wooded valley he gave a sudden exclamation and leaned forward the helicopter had landed in a clearing at the edge of the trees and half a dozen commandos were strung out across the road the cab window was pushed back and parker called what in the hells all this then god knows hagen said maybe they think were on the other side parker started to slow as a young officer walked forward waving him down like his men he wore a combat jacket and his face was darkened with camouflage cream as the landrover rolled to a halt the rest of the party moved in on the run tough determined looking men each carrying a machine pistol parker opened the door of the cab and leaned out look what is this hagen couldnt see what happened but parker cried out in alarm there was the sound of a scuffle a blow and then silence boots crunched the dirt surface of the road as someone walked round the side of the vehicle a moment later the glass window at the top of the rear door was shattered and the young officer peered inside all out he said pleasantly this is the end of the line hagen glanced across at hoffa taking in the smile on his face realising that the whole affair had been rigged from the start and the alsatian leapt for the broken window a growl rising in its throat for a moment it stayed there rearing up on its hind legs trying to force its way through and then the top of its skull disintegrated in a spray of blood and bone as someone shot it through the head the dog flopped back on the floor and the young officer smiled through the window at them gently tapping his right cheek with the barrel of a automatic now dont lets have any more fuss old man he said to hagen pleasantly were pushed for time as it is hagen looked across at hoffa despair on his face youll never get away with this ben all youll collect is another ten years i wouldnt count on that hoffa said now make it easy on yourself jack these blokes mean business hagen hesitated for only a moment longer and then he sighed all rightits your funeral he took the keys from his pocket moved to the door and unlocked it he was immediately pulled outside and hoffa followed him parker was lying on his face unconscious wrists handcuffed behind his back from then on the whole affair rushed to its climax with the same military precision that had been a characteristic of the entire operation someone unlocked hoffas handcuffs and transferred them to hagen while someone else gagged him with a strip of surgical tape parkers unconscious body had already been lifted into the rear of the landrover and hagen was pushed in after him the door closed the key turned in the lock with a grim finality there was blood on his face from the dead alsatian and as he rolled away from it in disgust swallowing the bile that rose in his throat the landrover started to move lurching over the rough ground away from the road through the side window above his head he was aware of the trees as they moved into the wood crashing through heavy undergrowth and then the vehicle braked suddenly so that he was thrown forward striking his head against the wall he lay there fighting the darkness that threatened to drown him a strange roaring in his ears it was a minute or so before he realised it was the helicopter taking off again and by the time he had managed to scramble to his knees and slump down on to the bench the sound was already fading into the distance it was fifteen minutes later and thirty miles on the side of the moor when the helicopter put down briefly in a clearing in a heavily wooded valley hoffa and the young officer jumped to the ground and the helicopter lifted into the sky again and flew away to the west hoffa was dressed as a hiker in denim pants and green quilted anorak a rucksack slung over one shoulder and the young officer wore an expensive grey flannel suit minus the camouflage cream his face was pale and rather aristocratic and he had about him the air of a man who has long since decided that life is obviously a rather bad joke and not to be taken seriously how long have we got hoffa demanded his companion shrugged an hourtwo if were lucky it depends how soon the party at the quarry notice how long its taking the principal officer to return is an hour long enough certainly but it wont be if we hang around here much longer all right hoffa said just one more thingwhat do i call you anything you like old man he grinned amiably what about smith yes i think id like that ive always wondered what it must be like to be called smith and where in the hell did the baron pick you up hoffa asked smith smiled again youd be surprised old man you really would he led the way across the clearing into the wood following a narrow path through the trees which later joined a broad dirt track a few yards further on they came to a derelict water mill beside a stream and in a courtyard at the rear behind a broken wall a black zodiac was parked a moment later they were driving away bumping over the rutted track finally energing into a narrow country road lets get one thing clear smith said as he changed into top gear and drove rapidly away well be together in this car for approximately forty minutes if anything goes wrong youre a hitchhiker and ive never seen you before in my life all right hoffa said where do we go from here all in good time weve some business to settle first i was wondering when youd get round to it hardly likely to forget a thing like that your share of the peterfield airport robbery was exactly ps where is it how do i know im going to get a fair shake hoffa demanded now dont start that sort of nonsense old man the baron cant stand welshers weve kept our part of the bargainweve got you out you tell us where the cash is and that completes what we call phase one of the operation once weve got our hands on the money we can start phase two which includes getting me out of the country with a new identity nicely documented plus half the money id say that was a fair exchange for twenty years on the moor how can i be sure youd better be old man you arent going to get very far on your own youve got a point there okaythe moneys in a steamer trunk at prices furniture repository pimlico in the name of henry walker smith gave him a look of blank amazement you must be joking why should i they specialise in clients who are going overseas for a lengthy period i paid five years in advance even if it isnt collected on time its safe enough theyve got to hang on to it for ten years before they can do anythingthats the law is there a receipt you wont get it without one who has it nobodyits at my mothers place in kentish town youll find an old salvation army bible amongst my gear the receipts hidden in the spine fair enough it should be ill pass the information along and what happens to me youll be taken care of if everything goes according to plan theyll start phase two but not before the baron has seen the colour of your money who is the baron anyway anyone i know that sort of question just isnt healthy old man smith shrugged and for the first time the slight characteristic smile was not in evidence you may meet him eventuallyyou may not i honestly wouldnt know the rest of the journey was passed in silence until twenty minutes later when they arrived at a crossroads and he slowed to a halt this is where we part company on either hand the main road was visible for a good quarter of a mile a narrow ribbon of asphalt falling across wild and rugged uplands it was completely deserted and hoffa frowned what happens now stand at the edge of the road like any normal hitchhiker and youll be picked up in approximately ten minutes if our mans on time whats he driving i havent the slightest idea his opening words will be is there anywhere in particular youd like me to take you you must answer babylon for gods sake what is all this hoffa demanded angrily some sort of game depends how you look at it doesnt it old man hell tell you babylons too far for him but he can take you part of the way then what happens i wouldnt know he leaned across the opened the door on your way theres a good chap and the best of british luck to you a moment later hoffa found himself standing at the side of the road a bewildered frown on his face the zodiac a fastdwindling noise in the distance it was quiet after a while the only sound the wind whispering through the long grass and a cloud passed across the face of the sun so that suddenly it was cold and he shivered there was a desperate air of unreality to everything and the events of the afternoon seemed to form part of some privileged nightmare he checked the watch smith had given him on the helicopter an hour and ten minutes since the ambush of the landrover from now on anything might happen there was sweat on his forehead in spite of the cool breeze and he wiped it away with the back of his hand what if some wellmeaning farmer drove by and decided to offer him a lift what was he going to say somewhere in the distance an engine sounded faintly and when he turned to look a vehicle came over the crest of the hill as it approached he saw that it was a tanker a great sixwheeler its body painted a brilliant red and it rolled to a halt beside him the driver leaned out of the cab and looked down a craggyfaced man of sixty or so in an old flying jacket and tweed cap a grey stubble covering his chin for a long moment there was silence and then he said with a pronounced scottish accent is there anywhere in particular youd like me to take you babylon hoffa told him and the breath went out of him in a long sigh of relief well now thats a step too far for me but i can take you part of the way he opened the door and stepped on to a ladder that gave access to the filling point on top of the tanker to one side was a steel plate about two feet square painted black which carried the legend dangerhandle with carehydrochloric acid he felt for a hidden catch at the base of the plate and it swung open hoffa climbed up and peered inside the compartment was about eight feet by three with a mattress as its base and he nodded briefly how long six hours the driver said no light im afraid and you cant smoke but theres coffee in the thermos and some sandwiches in a biscuit tin best i can do can i ask you where were going the driver shook his head face impassive not in the contract that one all right hoffa said lets get rolling he went through the hatch headfirst and as he turned to face the light the cover clanged into place plunging him into darkness panic moved inside him and his throat went dry and then the tanker started to roll forward and the mood passed he lay back on the mattress head pillowed on his hands and after a while his eyes closed and he slept at that precise moment some ten miles away the man who had called himself smith braked to a halt in the high street of the first village he came to went into a public telephone box and dialled a london number a woman answered him her voice cool and impersonal worldwide exports ltd simon vaughan speaking from the west country the voice didnt change nice to hear from you how are things down there couldnt be better our clients on his way anything on the news yet not a murmur the lull before the storm youll find the goods in a steamer trunk at prices furniture repository pimlico in the name of henry walker the receipts in the spine of an old salvation army bible amongst his gear at his mothers place in kentish town i shouldnt think a nice young lady welfare officer would have too much trouble in getting that out of her ill handle it myself i wouldnt waste too much time its almost five oclock the furniture repository probably closes at six might be an idea to give them a ring just to make sure theyll stay open for you leave it to me youve done well hell be pleased anything to oblige old girl thats me vaughan replaced the receiver and lit a cigarette a slight faraway look in his eyes oh what id like to do to you sweetie he murmured softly and as he returned to the car there was a smile on his face hoffa came awake slowly and lay staring through the heavy darkness trying to work out where he was and then he remembered and pushed himself up on one elbow according to the luminous dial on his watch it was a quarter past ten which meant they had been on the go for a little over five hours not much longer to wait and he lay back again head pillowed on his hands thinking of many things but in particular of how he was going to start to live againreally live in some place of warmth and light where the sun always shone and every woman was beautiful he was jerked out of his reverie as the tanker braked and started to slow it rolled to a halt but the engine wasnt turned off the hatch opened and the drivers face appeared a pale mask against the night sky out you get it was a fine night with stars strung away to the horizon but there was no moon hoffa stood at the side of the road stretching to ease his cramped limbs as the driver dropped the hatch back into place what now youll find a track leading up the mountain on the other side of the road wait there someone will pick you up he was inside the cab before hoffa could reply there was a hiss of air as he released the brake and the tanker rolled away into the night hoffa watched the red tail lights fade into darkness then picked up his rucksack and moved across the road he found the track without any difficulty and stood there peering into the darkness wondering what to do next the voice when it came made him start in alarm because of its very unexpectedness is there anywhere in particular youd like me to take you it was a woman who had spokena woman with a pronounced yorkshire accent and he peered forward trying to see her as he replied babylon too far for me but i can take you part of the way she moved close her face a pale blur in the darkness then turned without another word and walked away hoffa followed her the loose stones of the track rattling under his feet in spite of his long sleep he was tired it had after all been quite a day and somewhere up ahead there had to be food and a bed they walked for perhaps half a mile climbing all the time and he was aware of hills on either side of them and the cold chill in the wind and then the track turned a shoulder and below in a hollow beside a stream was a farmhouse a light in the downstairs window a dog barked hollowly as she pushed open a fivebarred gate and led the way across the cobbled yard as they approached the front door it opened suddenly and a man stood there framed against the light a shotgun in his hands you found him then molly for the first time hoffa had a clear view of the girl and realised with a sense of surprise that she couldnt have been more than nineteen or twenty years of age with haunted eyes and a look that said she hadnt smiled in a long time will you want me for anything more tonight she said in a strange dead voice nay lass off you go to bed and look in on your mother shes been asking for you the girl slipped past him and he leaned a shotgun against the wall and came forward hand outstretched a real pleasure mr hoffa im sam crowther so you know who i am hoffa said theyve been talking about nowt else on the radio all night any chance of finding out where i am crowther chuckled three hundred and fifty miles from where you started off they wont be looking for you round here you may be certain of that which is something i supppose hoffa said what happens now do we move into phase two yet i had a telephone call from london no more than an hour ago everything went as smooth as silk youll have no worries from now on mr hoffa he turned and called over his shoulder billywhere are you billy lets be having you the man who appeared in the doorway was a giant at least six feet four in height he had the shoulders and arms of an ape and a great lantern jaw he grinned foolishly a dribble of saliva oozing from the corner of his mouth as he shambled into the yard and crowther clapped him on the shoulder good lad billy lets get moving theres work to be done he turned and smiled this way mr hoffa he led the way across the yard hoffa at his heels billy bringing up the rear and opened a gate leading into a small courtyard the only thing it seemed to contain was an old well surrounded by a circular brick wall about three feet high hoffa took a step forward now what his reply was a single stunning blow from the rear delivered with such enormous power that his spine snapped like a rotten stick he lay there writhing on the ground and crowther stirred him with the toe of his boot in he goes billy hoffa was still alive as he went headfirst into the well his body bounced from the brickwork twice on the way down but he could feel no pain strangely enough his last conscious thought was that hagen had been right it had been his funeral after all and then the cold waters closed over him and he plunged into darkness cops and robbers when the noon whistle blew a steady stream of workers began to emerge from lonsdale metals in the cafe opposite the main gates paul chavasse got to his feet folded his newspaper and went outside it was precisely this busy period that he had been waiting for and he crossed the road quickly the main entrance itself was blocked by a swing bar which was not raised until any outgoing vehicle had been checked by the uniformed guard but the workers used a side gate and crowded through it slowly to a chorus of ribald comments and good humoured laughter undistinguishable from the rest of them in brown overalls and tweed cap chavasse plunged into the crowd working against the stream he met with some good natured abuse as he forced his way through but a moment later he was inside the gate he moved through the crowd glancing quickly through the window of the gatehouse on his left noting the three uniformed security guards at the table coffee and sandwiches spread before them an alsatian squatting in the corner the workers were still moving towards the gate in a steady stream and chavasse passed through them quickly crossed the yard to the main block and entered the basement garage he had spent the previous night poring over the plans s had provided until the layout of the building was so impressed on his mind that he was able to move with perfect confidence there were still one or two mechanics about but he ignored them mounted the ramp walked behind the line of waiting vehicles parked in the loading bay and pressed the button for the service lift a moment later he was on his way to the third floor it was strangely quiet when he stepped out and he paused listening before moving along the corridor the door to the wages office was on the third from the end and marked private he glanced at it briefly in passing turned the corner and opened a door which carried the sign fire exit concrete stairs dropped into a dark well beneath him and on the wall to his left he found what he was looking fora battery of fuse boxes each box was numbered neatly in white paint he pushed the handle on number ten into the off position and returned to the corridor he knocked on the door of the wages office and waited this was the crucial moment according to his information the staff went to lunch between noon and one oclock leaving only the chief cashier on duty but nothing was certain in this lifehe had learned that if nothing else in seven years of working for the bureau and there were bound to be days when someone or other decided to have sandwiches instead of going out two he could handleany more than that and he was in trouble not that it matteredit all came down to the same thing in the end and he smiled wryly on the other hand it might be amusing to see just how far he could go a spyhole flicked open in front of him and he caught the glint of an eye mr crabtree chavasse said im from maintenance theres been a partial power failure on this floor and im checking each office to find the cause is everything all right here sir just a moment the cover of the spyhole dropped into place a moment later there was the rattle of a chain the door opened and a small white haired man peered out the lights dont seem to be working at all youd better come in chavasse stepped inside noting in that first quick moment that they were alone and crabtree busied himself in locking and chaining the door again he was perhaps sixty and wore neat goldrimmed spectacles when he turned and found the muzzle of a automatic staring him in the face his eyes widened in horror his shoulders sagging so that he seemed to shrink and become visibly smaller chavasse stifled a pang of remorse and tapped him gently on the cheek with the barrel of the automatic do as youre told and youll come out of this in one pieceunderstand crabtree nodded dumbly and chavasse produced a pair of handcuffs from a pocket in his overalls and gestured to a chair sit down and put your hands behind you he handcuffed crabtree quickly secured his ankles with a length of cord and squatted in front of him comfortable the cashier seemed to have made a remarkable recovery and smiled thinly relatively chavasse warmed to him your wage bill here runs you between forty and fifty thousand pounds depending on the amount of overtime worked whats the figure this week fortyfive thousand crabtree replied without the slightest hesitation or to put it another way just over half a ton dead weight somehow i dont think youre going to get very far chavasse grinned well see shall we there was money everywhere some of it stacked in neat bundles as it had come from the bank a large amount already made up into wage packets in wooden trays the strongroom door stood open and inside he found a trolley with canvas sides containing several large money bags which from their weight held silver and copper he removed the bags quickly wheeled the trolley into the office and pushed it along the line of desks sweeping in bundles of banknotes and wage packets together crabtree was rightit added up to quite a load yet it took him no more than three minutes to clear the lot he pushed the trolley to the door and crabtree said i dont know if youre aware of it but we do a great deal of work for the raf here so our security systems rather special i got in didnt i but not while you were pushing half a ton of banknotes in front of you and its impossible for any vehicle to get through that gate until its been thoroughly checked something of a problem i should have thought sorry i havent time to discuss it now chavasse said but dont fail to buy an evening paper theyve promised to print the solution for me he produced a large piece of sticking plaster and pasted it over the cashiers mouth before he could reply can you breathe all right crabtree nodded something strangely like regret in his eyes and chavasse grinned its been fun somehow i dont think youll be on your own for long the door closed behind him with a click and crabtree sat there in the silence waiting feeling more alone than at any other time in his life it seemed an age before he heard heavy feet pounding along the corridor and the anxious knocking started on the door the previous wednesday when it all started was a morning of bright sunshine and chavasse had chosen to walk through the park on his way to bureau headquarters life for an intelligence agent is a strange and rather haphazard existence compounded of short often violent periods of service in the field followed by months of comparative inactivity often spent in routine antiespionage investigations or administration for almost half a year chavasse had clocked in each morning as ordered to sit behind a desk in a converted attic in the old house in st johns wood to spend the day sifting through reports from field sections in all parts of the globedemanding highly important work that had to be done thoroughly or not at alland so damned boring but the sun was out the sky was blue the dresses were shorter than hed ever known them so that for once he took his time and strolled across the grass between the trees smoking a cigarette discovering and not for the first time in his life that after all a man didnt need a great deal to be utterly and completely happyfor the moment at any rate somewhere a clock struck eleven he glanced at his watch swore softly and hurried towards the main road it was almost half past the hour when he went up the steps of the house in st johns wood and pressed the bell beside the brass plate that carried the legend brown amp coimporters and exporters after a few moments the door was opened by a tall greying man in a blue serge uniform and chavasse hurried past him im late this morning george george looked worried mr mallory was asking for you miss frazers been phoning down every five minutes for the past hour chavasse was already halfway up the curving regency staircase a slight flicker of excitement moving inside him if mallory wanted him urgently then it had to be for something important with any kind of luck at all the pile of reports that overflowed from his intray were going to have to be passed on to someone else he moved along the landing quickly and opened the whitepainted door at the far end jean frazer turned from a filing cabinet a small attractive woman of thirty who wore a red woollen dress of deceptively simple cut that made the best of her rather full figure she removed her heavy library spectacles and shook her head you would wouldnt you chavasse grinned i went for a walk in the park the sun was shining the sky was blue and i seemed to see unattached young females everywhere you must be getting old she said and picked up the telephone oh i wouldnt say that skirts are shorter than ever i was often reminded of you a dry remote voice cut in on them what is it mr chavasse is here mr mallory send him in no calls for the next hour she replaced the receiver and turned a slight mocking smile on her mouth mr mallory will see you now sir i love you too chavasse said and he crossed to the green baize door opened it and went in prison escapes have always been a problem black said they never average less than two hundred and fifty a year i must say that seems rather a lot mallory helped himself to a turkish cigarette from the box on his desk although by nature a kindly man as a detective chief superintendent with the special branch at new scotland yard charlie black was accustomed to his inferiors running to heed his slightest command indeed there was a certain pleasure to be derived from the sudden nervousness noted in even the most innocent of individuals when they discovered who and what he was but we are all creatures of our environment moulded by everything and anything that has happened to us since the day we were born and black branded by the years spent below stairs in the mansion in belgrave square where his mother widowed by the first world war had been cook stirred uneasily in his chair for he was in the presence of what she god rest her soul would have termed his betters it was all therethe grey flannel suit the old etonian tie the indefinable aura of authority ridiculous but for the briefest of moments he might have been a small boy again returning the old lords dog after a walk in the park and receiving a pat on the head and sixpence he pulled himself together quickly its not quite as bad as it looks about a hundred and fifty men each year simply walk out of open prisonsnothing to stop them i suppose you could argue that the selection procedure has been faulty in the first place another fifty are probably men released on parole for funerals and weddings and so on who simply take off instead of coming back which leaves you with a hard core of about fifty genuine escapes a year thats itor was during the past couple of years theres been an increase in the really spectacular sort of escape i suppose it all started with wilson the train robbers famous break from birmingham the first time a gang had actually broken into a prison to get someone out real commando stuff and brilliantly executed which is where this character the baron comes in black nodded to our certain knowledge hes been responsible for at least half a dozen big breaks during the past year or so added to that he runs an underground pipeline by which criminals in danger of arrest can flee the country on two occasions weve managed to arrest minor members of his organisationpeople whove passed on men weve been chasing to someone else have you managed to squeeze anything out of them not a thingmainly because they honestly hadnt anything to say the pipeline seems to be organised on the communist cell system the one resistance used in france during the war each member is concerned only with his own particular task he may know the next step along the route but no more than that it means that if one individual is caught the organisation as a whole is still safe and doesnt anyone know who the baron is the ghost squad have been trying to find out for more than a year now theyve got nowhere one things certainhe isnt just another crookhes something special may even be a continental mallory had a file open on the desk in front of him he examined it in silence for a moment and shook his head it looks to me as if your only hope of finding out anything about him at all would be to get a line on one of his future clients which in theory should be impossible there must be something like sixty thousand men in gaol right nowhow do you find out which one it is a simple process of elimination really if theres a pattern to his activities its to be found in his choice of clientele theyve all been long term prisoners and have had considerable financial resources black opened a buff folder took out a typed sheet of foolscap and a photo and passed them across have a look at the last one mallory examined it for a moment and nodded ben hoffai remember this one the affair on dartmoor last month a gang disguised as royal marine commandos ambushed a prison vehicle during a military exercise and spirited him away any news of him since not a word hoffa and two confederates george saxton and harry youngblood were serving sentences of twenty years apiece for the peterfield airport robbery do you remember it i cant say i do it was five years ago now they hijacked a northern airways dakota which was carrying just under a million pounds in old notes a special consignment from the central scottish bank to the bank of england in london a beautiful job i have to admit that only the three of them involved and they got clean away what went wrong hoffa had the wrong kind of girl friend she decided shed rather have the ps reward the central banks were offering than ben and his share of the loot plus an uncertain future and the money was never recovered not one farthing black handed across another photo thats george saxton he escaped from grange end last year it was a carbon copy of the wilson affair half a dozen men brokein under cover of darkness and actually brought him out not a word of him since then as far as were concerned he might as well have ceased to exist which leaves youngblood presumably only just or i miss my guess black said grimly and pushed another file across the face that stared up from the photo was full of intelligence and a restless animal vitality one corner of the mouth lifted in a slight mocking smile mallory was immediately interested and quickly read through the details on the attached sheet harry youngblood was fortytwo years of age and had joined the navy in at the age of seventeen finishing the war as a petty officer in motor torpedo boats after the war he had continued in the same line of work but on more unorthodox lines and in was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for smuggling a charge of conspiracy to rob the mails had been dropped for lack of evidence in between then and his final conviction in may he had served no further terms of imprisonment but had been questioned by the police on no fewer than thirtyone occasions in connection with indictable offences quite a character mallory said he seems to have tried his hand at just about everything in the book to be honest with you i always had a sneaking regard for him myself and i dont usually have much time for sentimentality where villains are concerned if hed taken another turning after the war instead of that smuggling caper things might have been very different and now hes doing twenty years thats the theory were not too happy about what might happen considering the way his two confederates have gone hes at fridaythorpe now under maximum security but theres a limit to how harshly he can be treated anyway he had a slight stroke about three months ago mallory glanced at the photo again i must say he looks healthy enough to me are you sure it was genuine an electroencephalograph cant lie black said and it definitely indicated severe disturbance to wave patterns in the brain another thingyou can apparently simulate a heart attack by using drugs but not a stroke he was very thoroughly checked they had him in manningham general infirmary for three days wasnt that dangerous i should have thought it a perfect situation for someone to break him out black shook his head he was unconscious most of the time they had him in the enclosed ward with two prison officers at his side night and day couldnt he be treated at the prison they havent the facilities like most gaols fridaythorpe has a sick bay and a visiting doctor anything serious is treated in the enclosed ward of the local hospital if a prisoner is likely to be ill for an extended period hes transferred to the prison hospital at wormwood scrubs that doesnt apply to youngblood with a complaint like his in any case the home office would never sanction his transfer the very fact that its a hospital means that it cant possibly offer maximum security theyd be frightened to death that one of the london gangs might seize their opportunity to try to break him out mallory lit another cigarette got to his feet and walked to the window all very interesting of course the commissioner sent me a very full report but i must say your personal account has clarified one or two things he turned frowning reflectively as i see it it all boils down to one thing you want us to supply you with an operative someone who could be introduced into prison in the normal way and who at least in theory might be able to win youngbloods confidence why cant you use one of your own men most crooks can spot a copper a mile awayjust one of those things and it works both ways of course thats why the commissioner thought of your organisation sir you see the man we need for this job wouldnt last five minutes if there was even a hint that he wasnt a crook himself so his personal attitude and temperament would be of primary importance what youre really saying is that my operatives have what might be termed the criminal mind superintendent black looked slightly put out and mallory shook his head youre quite right they wouldnt last long in the field if they hadnt you think you could find us someone mallory nodded sat down at his desk and looked at the file again oh yes i think we can manage that as it happens i have someone available who should be more than suitable he flicked the switch on the intercom and said sharply any sign of chavasse yet im afraid not mr mallory jean frazer said chavasse black said sounds foreign his father was a french officer killed during the last war his mother is english she raised the boy over here you might say hes traveled extensively since black hesitated and said carefully hell need all his wits about him for this one mr mallory as it happens he has a phd in modern languages superintendent mallory answered a trifle frostily and he was once a lecturer at one of our older universities is that good enough for you blacks jaw went slack then how in the hell did he get into this game an old story the important thing is why does he stay mallory shrugged i suppose you could say he has a flair for our sort of work and when called upon he doesnt hesitate to squeeze the trigger most human beings do you know he smiled thinly come to think of it i dont think you would approve of him at all black looked rather stunned to be perfectly frank sir he sounds as if he should be behind bars to me rather an apt comment under the circumstances a moment later the intercom buzzed and jean frazer announced chavasse he paused just inside the door sorry im late sir he said to mallory never mind that now id like you to meet detective chief superintendent black of the special branch hed like you to go to prison for a few months now that sounds interesting chavasse said and he moved forward to shake hands he was a shade under six feet with good shoulders and moved with the grace of the natural athlete but it was the face which was the most interesting feature it was handsome even aristocraticthe kind that could have belonged equally to the professional soldier or scholar and the heritage of his breton father was plain to see in the high cheekbones as he shook hands his face was illuminated by a smile of great natural charm but thirty years of police work had taught charlie black the importance of eyes these were dark and strangely remote and remembering what mallory had said he shivered slightly suddenly feeling completely out of his depth straightforward police work was one thing but this he heard mallorys next words with an almost audible sigh of relief i think we can manage from here on in superintendent many thanks for coming as i said before youve clarified several things for me you can tell the commissioner ill be in touch later in the day miss frazer will see you out he put on his glasses and started to examine the file in front of him again black got to his feet awkwardly started to put out his hand and thought better of it he nodded to chavasse and went out rather quickly chavasse chuckled god bless the british bobby mallory glanced up at him whoblack oh hes all right digging in his own patch he was like some wretched schoolboy leaving the headmasters studycouldnt get out fast enough nonsense mallory tossed a file across to him ill talk to you when youve read that he occupied himself with some other papers while chavasse worked his way through the typed sheets and the documents from criminal records office at the yard after a while mallory sat back well what do you think could be interesting but since when have you been so keen to help the police there are one or two things about this affair that the yard dont know such as remember what a stink there was last year when henry galbraith the nuclear physicist who was serving fifteen years for passing information to the chinese escaped from felversham gaol chavasse nodded i must admit i was surprised at the time galbraith was hardly my idea of a man of action hes turned up in peking you mean the baron was behind that mallory nodded and chavasse whistled softly they must have paid plenty on top of that on at least three occasions this year just when weve been about to close in on someone important whos been working for the other side theyve been spirited away a foreign office type disappeared last month and turned up in warsaw and i can tell you now he knew too damned much the prime minister was hopping mad about that onehe had to go to washington the same week which all tells us something interesting about the baron chavasse observed whatever else he is hes no patriotjust a hardheaded businessman he looked down at the file again and mallory said what do you think about the general idea chavasse shrugged i am not too sure im to go to gaol and share a cell with harry youngblood thats about the size of it are you sure it can be arranged mallory nodded the home office could handle that part of it direct with the prison governor he might not like it but hed have to do as he was told hed be the only one who would know well fix you up with a new identity something nice and interesting exofficer cashiered for embezzlementrecently deported from brazil as an undesirable and so forth it might be just a colossal waste of time have you considered that chavasse said it may seem logical that harry youngblood should be next for shaving but its far from certain mallory shook his head i think it is take this slight stroke hes hadthats as fishy as hell no previous history and hes always enjoyed perfect health according to the report it was a genuine attack i know and black pointed out that a stroke cant be induced artifically by use of a drug is he wrong lets say misinformedofficially there is no such drug but they have been experimenting with one in holland for a year now a thing called mabofine it disturbs the wave patterns in the brain in the same way as insulin or shock treatment they hope to use it with mental patients what youre really saying is that you suspect that some sort of plot is already in operation to get him out what am i supposed to do find out what i can and stop him or try to go along for the ride it could be an interesting trip it might lead us straight to the man were looking for another thingit might be a year or more before they move and you dont fancy spending that long as a guest of her majesty chavasse tossed youngbloods record card across the desk its more than that look at that facenotice the eyes to hell with those jolly newspaper stories about harry youngblood the smuggler with the good war recordthe modern robin hood with a heart of corn for a tale of woe in my book hes a man with a mind like a cutthroat razor whod sell his grandmother for cigarette money in the right situation hed smell me out as a phoney for sure i wouldnt last a week and prisons can be dangerous places or hadnt you heard but what if he had to accept you what if he didnt have any choice in the matter chavasse frowned i dont get it all you have to do is pull the right job and get yourself five years a reasonably spectacular holdup for preference something that will spread your face all over the front page for a day or two youre not asking much are you actually ive already got something lined up mallory continued calmly i got it from one of our contacts at the yard whenever they find a firm that isnt taking adequate security precautions they step in and offer some sound advice in this case it might have more effect coming from you youll have to let them catch you of course nice of you to put it that way what if i show them a clean pair of heels an anonymous phone call to the yard telling them where you are should do the trick he smiled im sure jean frazer would enjoy handling that bit chavasse sighed well i did say i wanted a little more action whats the firm mallory opened another file and pushed it across lonsdale metals he said the guard on the gate stretched and took a couple of paces towards the gatehouse easing his cramped muscles a long morning but only ten minutes to go he turned and a red works van shot out of the garage and roared across the yard gears racing as he jumped forward in alarm it skidded to a halt the bonnet no more than a yard away from the swing bar that blocked the entrance the young man who scrambled out of the cab looked considerably shocked and there was blood on his face he lost his balance falling to one knee and as the guard helped him to his feet he was joined by his three companions the driver seemed to have difficulty in speaking he swallowed then flung out an arm dramatically in the general direction of the main block wages office he managed to gasp he started to sag to the ground and the gate guard caught him quickly better get up there fast he said to the other three ill get this lad inside and phone for the police they went across the yard on the run the alsatian at their heels and the gate guard tightened his grip around the van drivers shoulders you dont look too good come in and sit down the driver nodded wiping blood from his face with the back of a hand and together they moved into the gatehouse the guard could never afterwards be quite sure about what happened next he eased the driver into a chair and moved towards the desk he was aware of no sound but as he reached for the telephone was struck a stunning blow at the base of the skull that sent him crashing to the floor he lay there for a few moments senses reeling aware of the clang of the swing bar outside as it was raised of the sudden roar of an engine as the van was driven rapidly away and then darkness flooded over him when chavasse went up the stairs of the dingy house in poplar and opened the door at the end of the landing jean frazer was lying on the bed reading a magazine she swung her legs to the floor a slight frown on her face is that blood on your cheek chavasse wiped it away casually something else entirely i assure you did you get in and out again her eyes widened with the money he nodded its downstairs in the yard in an old ford van i bought this morning presumably the law isnt far behind chavasse moved to the window wiping his face with a towel and peered into the street i shouldnt think so i switched vehicles miles away on the other side of the thames in fact if i hadnt shown my face around as much as i did ive a shrewd suspicion i could have got away with this dangerous talk she pulled on her shoes seriously paul how on earth did you manage it you know what the newsboys say read all about it i wouldnt want to spoil your fun she sighed ah well i suppose id better go and put in that call to scotland yard as she moved round the bed he pulled her into his arms i could be away for a hell of a long time jean he said mockingly i dont suppose youd care to give me something to remember you by she pulled down his head kissed him once and disengaged herself the best i can do at the moment ive got my delilah bit to take care of if mallory lets me ill come and see you on visiting days the door closed behind her and chavasse locked it nothing to do now except wait for them to come for him he placed the automatic to hand on the locker by the window lit a cigarette and lay down on the bed it was not more than twenty minutes later that he heard sounds of faint movement on the landing outside there was a timid knock on the door and mrs clegg the landlady called are you in mr drummond what do you want he said theres a letter for you came while you were out just a minute he took a deep breath and unlocked the door it smashed into him instantly and he was carried back across the bed which collapsed under the combined weight of four very large policemen he put up a semblance of a struggle but a moment later handcuffs were snapped around his wrists and he was hauled to his feet a large amiable looking man in a fawn gaberdine raincoat and battered homburg paused in the doorway to light a cigarette then moved in all right son wheres the loot why dont you take a running jump chavasse told him carefulyoull be making sounds like a man next there was a pounding on the stairs and a young constable entered the run we found it inspector he said struggling for breath back of an old ford van in the yard the inspector turned to chavasse and sighed fortyfive thousand quid and what bloody good has it done you ill let you know chavasse said ill have to think about it youll have plenty of time for thatabout seven years or i miss my guess he nodded to the constables go on get him out of here chavasse grinned impudently see you in court inspector he was still laughing as they took him downstairs maximum security the governor of fridaythrope gaol put down his pen and switched on the desk lamp it was just after eight with darkness drawing in fast and he went to the window and watched the last light of day touch the rim of the hills across the valley with fire before night fell there was a firm knock on the door and as he turned atkinson the principal officer entered a large buff envelope in one hand sorry to bother you sir but the new man is heredrummond you said you wanted to see him personally the governor nodded and moved back to his desk so i did is he outside atkinson nodded thats right sir whats he like atkinson shrugged a gentleman gone nasty if you follow me he opened the envelope and placed the documents it contained in front of the governor youll remember the case sir it was in all the papers at the time fortyfive thousand and he almost got away with it didnt someone inform on him thats right siran anonymous tip to the yard but he was going to seed long before that he was a captain in the royal engineerscashiered for embezzlement seven or eight years ago since then hes been knocking around south america getting up to god knows what the governor nodded not a very pretty picture stilla man of some intelligence im thinking of putting him in with youngblood atkinson was unable to conceal his surprise might i ask why sir the governor leaned back in his chair frankly im worried about youngbloodhave been ever since he had that stroke sooner or later hell have anotherthey always doand hell need specialised medical treatment very very quickly can you imagine what would happen if he had such an attack in the middle of the night and died on us thats hardly likely sir hes checked every hour a lot could happen in an hour on the other hand if someone was there all the time he shook his head im certain a cell mate is the best answer from our point of view and this chap drummond should do very nicely lets have a look at him the principal officer opened the door and stood to one side all right lad he barked look lively now stand on the mat and give your name and number the prisoner moved into the room quickly and stood on the rubber mat that was positioned exactly three feet away from the governors desk drummond sir paul chavasse said and waited at attention the light from the desk threw his face into relief it had fined down in the past three months and the hair closecropped to the skull gave him a strangely medieval appearance he looked a thoroughly dangerous man and the governor frowned down at his records in some perplexity this was not what he had expectednot at all what he had expected but then the governors paradox was that he knew nothing of prison life at allwhat he saw each day was only the surface of a pond which chavasse in three short months had plumbed to its depths in undergoing what was known in the legal profession as the due process of the law in the three months he had made seven separate court appearances and had already experienced the life of three different gaols he had spent a month on remand in a place so primitive that the only sanitary arrangements in the cell consisted of an enamel pot each morning he had formed one of the queue of men who shuffled along the landing to empty the nights slops into the single lavatory bowl at the end prison officers were now screws men who like the rest of the humanity were good bad and indifferent in about the usual proportions there had been some who had treated him with decency and humanity others who punctuated each command with the end of a staff jabbed painfully into the kidneys he had learned that there was little romance in crimethat most of his fellow prisoners were persistent offenders who could have made a better living if they had spent their lives in drawing the unemployment benefit he had learned that murderers and rapists looked just like anyone else and that often the most masculine prisoners in appearance were sexual deviants most important of all like any jungle animal intent only on survival he had quickly acquired the customs and habits of his new surroundings so that he might fade into the background with the rest and he had survived he would never be quite the same man again but he had survived six years the governor looked up from the record card that means four if you keep out of trouble and earn full remission yes sir the governor leaned back in his chair its really quite distressing to see a man like you end up in this sort of a mess but i think we can help you but youve got to help yourself as well you know are you willing to try chavasse resisted a strong temptation to lean across the desk and smash his fist into the centre of that florid wellfed face and wondered whether the governor could possibly be putting on an act on the other hand that was hardly likelywhich must mean that he had accepted the introduction of an undercover agent into his establishment with the greatest reluctance anyway you can best help yourself by helping me the governor said im going to put you in with a man called harry youngblood hes a longterm prisoner who suffered a stroke some time ago now the odds are that he might have another and it could be at night if that happens i want you to ring for the duty officer at once speed is vital in these cases so im told do you understand perfectly sir youngblood works in the machine shop doesnt he mr atkinson thats right sir car number plates fine the governor looked up at chavasse again well put you in there for training and see how you like it ill follow your progress with interest he got to his feet as a sign that the interview was over and for the briefest of moments there was something in his eyes it was as if he wanted to say something more but couldnt think of the right words in the end he nodded brusquely to the principal officer who led chavasse out into the corridor the other gaols chavasse had been in had been constructed during the reform era in the middle of the nineteenth century on a system commonly found in her majestys prisons of four three tiered cell blocks radiating like the spokes of a wheel from a central hall but fridaythorpe was only two years old a place of quiet and smooth concrete airconditioned and warmed by central heating with not a window to be seen they reached a central hall and entered a steel lift which rose ten floors before it halted they stepped out on to a small concrete landing and chavasse could see a long white corridor stretching into the distance on the other side of a steel gate they stood there for a moment and then the gate opened smoothly and silently they moved inside and it closed again impressed atkinson demanded as chavasse turned to examine it youre meant to be its operated electronically by remote control the man who pressed the button is sitting in the control centre on the ground floor at the other end of the prison hes one of a team of five who watch fiftythree television screens on a shift system twentyfour hours a day youve been on view ever since we left the governors office wonderful what you can do with science these days chavasse said nobody escapes from fridaythorpejust remember that atkinson said as they proceeded along the corridor behave yourself and youll get a square dealtry to act tough and youll fall flat on your face he didnt seem to require an answer and chavasse didnt attempt to give him one they paused outside a door at the far end of the passage atkinson produced a key and unlocked it the cell was larger than chavasse had anticipated there were three small slit windows glazed with armour glass and in any case too small to admit a man there was also a washbasin and a fixed toilet in one corner there was a single bed against each wall and youngblood was lying on one of them reading a magazine he looked at them in an almost casual fashion and didnt bother getting up ive got a cell mate for you youngblood atkinson told him the governors afraid you might pass away on us one night without any warning hed like someone to be here just in case well thats nice of the old bastard youngblood said i didnt know he cared you just mind your bloody lip careful mr atkinson youngblood smiled theres a thin line of foam on the edge of your lips you want to watch it atkinson took one quick step towards him and youngblood raised a hand im not a well man remember thats right i was forgetting atkinson laughed gently you may be a big man in here youngblood but from where i stand you look pretty damned small i laugh myself sick every time i lock the door something moved in harry youngbloods eyes and for a moment the habitual mocking smile was erased and he looked capable of murder thats better atkinson said thats much better and he went outside the door clanging behind him with a grim finality bastard youngblood said and turned to examine chavasse so youre drummond weve been expecting you for a week now word certainly gets around thats the nick for youwere all just one big happy family youll like it hereits got everything central heating air conditioning televisionall we needed was a bit of class and now weve got you whats that supposed to mean come off ityou were a captain in the engineers before they kicked you out sandhurst and all that i read about it in the papers when you were up at the bailey ive read about you too youngblood sat on the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette where was that then a book called great crimes of the century came out last year there was a whole chapter devoted to the peterfield airport job written by a man called tillotson that clown youngblood said contemptuously he didnt get the half of it came to see me by special permission of the home office i gave him all the griffno reason not to nowbut did he get it right gave all the credit for the planning to ben hoffa and he couldnt tell his arse from his elbow it was your idea then thats it youngblood shrugged i needed ben im not denying that he could fly a dakota that was his main function what about saxon a good lad when he had someone to tell him what to do any idea where they are now somewhere in the sun spending all that lovely lolly if theyve any sense you never know your luck chavasse said they might be making arrangements for you to join them right now youngblood stared across at him blankly get me out you mean out of fridaythorpe he exploded into laughter have you got a lot to learn no one gets out of here didnt they tell you that theyve got television cameras and electronic gatestheyve even constructed special walls of reinforced concrete with foundations twenty feet deep thats just in case anyone ever thought of tunnelling he shook his head this is itthe big cagethere is no way out theres always a way chavasse said what have we got here then a brain big enough it didnt do you much good on that lonsdale metals caper youre here arent you so are you only because of ben hoffa and that bloody bird of his for a moment youngblood was genuinely angry he tried to drop her and she shopped him that was the end for all of us but they didnt get the money thats it boy youngblood grinned more than you can say i know chavasse said feelingly i had the same trouble as hoffa he sat there on the edge of the bed staring down at the floor as if momentarily depressed and youngblood produced a twenty packet of cigarettes and offered him one dont let it get you down between you and me that was quite something you pulled off a pity you still had your amateur status a bit more knowhow and you might have got away with it you seem to be doing all right for yourself chavasse said holding up the cigarette youngblood grinned and lolled back against the pillow im not complaining i get as many of those things as i want and dont ask me how when the blokes in here want snout they come to me and no one else you fell on your feet when old man carter decided to put you in here he told me youd been ill how bad is it i had a slight stroke a month or two back nothing much youngblood shrugged just one of those things i got the impression he was afraid you might peg out on him one of these nights if hes as worried as that why doesnt he have you transferreed to the scrubs youngblood chuckled harshly the home office would never wear that theyd be frightened to death one of the london mobs might have a go at breaking me out in the hopes of getting their hot little hands on the lolly he shook his head no here i am and here i stay for another fifteen years youngblood turned his head and smiled softly that remains to be seen doesnt it he tossed the cigarettes across have another he quite obviously wanted to talk and chavasse lay there smoking and let him he covered just about everything that had ever happened to him starting with his years in a camberwell orphanage and dwelling particularly on his time in the navy he wasnt married and apparently had only one living relativea sister youve got to look out for yourself boy he told chavasse i learned that early theres always some bastard waiting to take away what youve got when i was a po in mtbs i had a skipper called johnsonyoung sublieutenant bloody useless i carried himcarried him we took part in the st laurent commando raid he got hit early on he just sat there helpless in the skippers chair on the bridge bleeding to death there was nothing we could do for him i took over pressed home the attack and put two torpedoes into an enemy destroyer and what happened when we got back johnson got a posthumous victoria crossi got a bloody mention in dispatches funny how a story changed according to ones point of view chavasse stared up at the ceiling remembering the official report of the action in the file on youngblood which had been compiled by s at the bureau the plain unvarnished truth was that johnson had signed his own death warrant by staying in command on the bridge and undoubtedly aggravating his already serious injuries youngblood had done welland behaved steadily under firethere was no question about his personal courage but at all times he had acted under johnsons direct orders he wondered now if youngblood really believed his own account of the action but then he had probably told it to others and himself so many times over the years that what might have been had become reality somehow in the fantasy version there was even an implication that the vc had gone to the wrong person although he himself would probably have indignantly denied the fact according to tillotson you were hit for smuggling first thats right youngblood grinned worked in the channel run in a converted mtb for a couple of years following the war what were you runningbrandy anything that would sell and almost anything would in those days booze fags nylons watches what about dope i hear theres a lot of money in it what in the hell do you think i am youngblood demanded i wouldnt dirty my hands on that sort of rubbish it seemed a perfectly genuine reaction and was completely in character with the facts of his file harry youngblood would never touch drugs or prostitution two of the biggest moneyspinners there werea nice moral touch that the newspapers had made a lot out of it at the time of his trial and the public had responded well forgetting about the pilot of the dakota hijacked at peterfield who in attempting to put up a fight had been beaten so savagely by youngblood that his eyesight was permanently affected and there were others over the years the police had pulled in harry youngblood again and again in connection with indictable offenses mainly robbery which had too often included use of violence at no time had they been able to make a charge stick and on one occasion the night watchman of a fur warehouse clubbed into insensibility had afterwards died chavasse surfaced and realised that youngblood was still talking those were the days boy we really gave the coppers a thing or two to think about i had the beast team in the smoke one job after another and every one planned so well that the busies could never put a finger on us that must have taken some doing oh they pulled me inevery time there was a big tickle they tried to pin it on me i spent half my time on the steps at west end central being photographed i was never out of the bloody papers until now youngblood grinned you wait boyjust wait ill be smiling right off the front page again at the bastards one of these days and there wont be a thing they can do about it chavasse lay there on the bed thinking about the whole business what was it tillotson had said about youngblood in his book that he had a craving for notoriety that almost amounted to a death wish excitement and danger were meat and drink to him he had enjoyed playing the gangster being pulled in by the police timeaftertime for questioning having his picture in the papers one thing was certain here was no robin hood this was a brutal and resourceful criminal whose easy smile concealed an iron will and a determination to have what he wanted whatever the cost chavasse started to unlace his boots think ill turn in its been a long day youngblood glanced over the top of the magazine you do that boy he grinned and dont let the bastards grind you down chavasse hitched the blanket over his shoulder and closed his eyes he wondered what it was going to be like in the machine shop car number plates atkinson had said well that was a damned sight better than sewing mail bags for a living if only the screws were decent life might be quite reasonable he frowned suddenly so now he was even thinking like a con a fine touch of irony there mallory would like that chavasse turned his face to the wall and slept rough justice rehabilitation youngblood shouted above the roar of the machine shop marvellous isnt it just think of all those clever bastards sitting in their private suites at the home office persuading themselves that just because theyve given you the opportunity of learning a trade youll go out into the world a better and wiser man and lead a life of honest toil making car number plates for ten quid a week chavasse positioned the plate he was holding carefully in the die stamping machine and pulled the lever there was a slight hiss from the hydraulic press and he raised it to examine the number now etched firmly in pressed steel he picked up a file and started to clean the rough edges of metal thinking about what youngblood had just said he was right that was the damnable thing after four weeks in the machine shop chavasse had learned that lesson at least he glanced across at charlie harker a onetime chartered accountant doing seven years for embezzlement and his machine partner rodgers the mildmannered little schoolmaster who was doing life for murdering his wife after finding her in bed with another man how on earth did you rehabilitate such men by teaching them one of the lowest paid forms of semiskilled work in industry such thoughts were dangerous but difficult to avoid he had after all become one of these menwas in fact treated with some deference in a society where the scale of ones crime determined position in the social structure as paul drummond serving six years for armed robbery and the theft of fortyfive thousand pounds chavasse could easily have found himself on the top rung of the ladder had that not already been occupied by harry youngblood rodgers came across and put another batch of blank plates on the bench all yours drum he said and moved away he looked tired and there was sweat on his face so that his spectacles kept slipping down his nose and chavasse was aware of a sudden sympathy the man wasnt fit for this kind of workwhy on earth couldnt the screws see that but there was no time to consider individual needs herelife was cyclical revolving around a timetable that must be observed at all costs but to hell with that he wasnt here to do a survey for the society for prison reform he was here to watch harry youngbloodto worm his way into the mans confidence and to find out as much about him and his future plans as possible strangely enough they had become good friends youngblood like most great criminals was a highly complex individual flawed clean down the middle like a bell that looked fine until you tried to ring it even his fellow prisoners had difficulty in understanding him he had an ability to adapt to the company in which he found himself that was uncanny and the death wish was present in everything he did the reckless reaching out to crash head on with danger which had probably contributed to his downfall more than any other single reason there was a story told of him that on one occasion when casing a mayfair mansion prior to a robbery he had attended a soiree there uninvited charming everyone in sight and leaving with the purse from his hostesss handbag stopped by a downandout with a hard luck story on the pavement outside youngblood had presented him with the twentyfive pounds the purse had contained and had gone on his way cheerfully kind and considerate he could be generous to a fault as chavasse had already discovered especially when there was no danger of any personal inconvenience he could also be hard brutal and utterly ruthless when crossed and in the final analysis was only interested in his own well being he grinned across at chavasse cheer up drum it may never happen chavasse smiled back avoiding a frown by only a fraction of a second youngblood was normally goodhumoured but for the past two days he had positively overflowed which must indicate something his train of thought was interrupted by the arrival of a convict called brady pushing a trolley loaded with finished plates anything for me he demanded chavasse nodded brusquely at the pile on the end of the bench he didnt care for brady who was serving ten years for housebreaking which had also involved the rape of a woman of sixtyfive he had the sort of face that went with the average citizens conception of a thieves kitchen and his voice was roughened by years of disease and liquor how about some snout harry he asked youngblood as he started to load the trolley you owe me for three weeks already youngblood said no more till youve paid something on account have a heart harry brady grabbed his arm i havent had a fag for two days im going crazy dont kid yourself youngblood said coldy youre already there they should have had you in for treatment years ago now clear off youre bothering me with a man like brady it didnt take much chavasse had moved to the end of the bench to get some rivets and as he turned caught sight of bradys face contorted with uncontrollable rage he snatched up a rats tail file the end pointed sharp as any stiletto and swung it above his head ready to plunge it down into youngbloods unprotected back there was no time for any warning and chavasse snatched up a hammer and threw it with all his force it caught brady in the chest and he cried out in pain and dropped the file as he staggered back youngblood swung around taking in the file and the hammer the expression on bradys face and when he turned and glanced at chavasse his eyes were like pieces of black stone he picked up the file and held it out this yours jack brady stood there staring at him sweat on his face quite suddenly he grabbed the trolley and pushed it away hurriedly work had not flagged the noise had remained at the same level and yet there wasnt a man at that end of the room who had failed to note the incident and chavasse was aware of two things youngbloods slight nod to nevinson a tall heavily built scot on the other side of the room and the approach of meadows one of the screws whats going on here he demanded not a thing mr meadows sir youngblood said were all working like the clappers meadows was young and not long out of the army the dark smudge of moustache on his upper lip an indication of his desperate attempt to always appear older than he was he turned to chavasse who stood at the end of the bench hands at his sides meadows had never risen above the rank of lance corporal and excaptains fallen on hard times were meat and drink to him and what the devil do you think youre supposed to be doing drummond he demanded i know the idea of soiling those lilywhite hands of yours doesnt appeal but work is the object of the exercise youngblood moved in very close and said softly he is working mr meadows sir hes working very hard now why dont you go back to the other end of the room like a good little boy and meadows took it that was the important thing his hesitation was only momentary his face quite white and he was afraid which was all that mattered from the other end of the room there came a sudden cry of agony meadows turned glad of the excuse and hurried away everyone stopped working all noise dying as the machines were switched off onebyone nevinson appeared walking close to the wall wiping his hands on an oily rag what happened jock youngblood called jack bradys just had a nasty accident nevinson said calmly spilt a bucket of boiling water over his legs in the blacksmiths shop youngblood shook his head as he glanced at chavasse now that was careless of him wasnt it chavasse said nothing and moved forward with the others brady was groaning in agony and kept it up till the first aid men arrived and one of them gave him an injection he lay there writhing his great ugly face soaked in sweat as they got him on to a stretcher he moaned again and lost consciousness as they lifted him up but it was difficult to feel any sort of compassion for him he had broken the code of the society in which he lived and had received in return justice of a sort more screws had arrived atkinson among them and he rapped his staff on a bench get back to work all of you he turned to meadows ill want a report on my desk in an hour mr meadows ill send someone to relieve you he walked to the door and paused you can bring drummond with you when you comehis sisters here to see him the last thursday in every month was a general visiting day and when the duty officer took chavasse into the main hall it was already pretty full a row of cubicles stretched from one wall to the other and in each one prisoner and visitor faced each other through a sheet of armoured glass and spoke through microphones they sat chavasse in a cubicle and he waited impatiently the voices on either side a meaningless blur and then the door opposite opened and jean frazer came in she was wearing a white nylon blouse and a neat two piece suit in donegal tweed with a pleated skirt strange but he had never realised before just how attractive she really was her ready smile faded as she sank down into the chair opposite paul what have they done to you her voice sounded slightly distorted over the amplifier and he smiled do i look that bad i wouldnt have believed it possible he cracked suddenly a savage cutting edge to his voice for gods sake jean what do you think its like in here im not paul chavasse playing a part and going home nights im paul drummond doing six years for armed robbery ive been inside four months now i think like a con i act like one most important of all im treated like onetell graham mallory to stuff that in his blasted pipe there was real pain in her eyes and she reached out to touch him forgetting about the glass i feel so damned inadequate he grinned a good thing theres glass between us you look good enough to eat never mind the other thing she managed to smile do i now dont go making any rash promises theyd only get you into trouble after all i do anticipate getting out of here sometime how is mallory by the way his usual charming self he told me to tell you to get a move on apparently he could use you elsewhere and thinks this business has gone on long enough the answer id like to send him is completely unprintable chavasse said but never mind wed better get down to business were only allowed ten minutes how are you and youngblood getting on finein fact i managed to stop someone sticking a sharp implement into him this morning i thought they put people in prison to prevent them doing that sort of thing thats the theoryworked out by people who dont know what theyre talking about as usual have you found anything out about the baron he shook his head ive heard his name mentioned in general gossip amongst the other prisoners but hes as much a question mark to them as he is to me i tried to talk about him with youngbloodtold him id heard the baron had got saxton and hoffa out he seemed to think the whole idea was fairy tales for the kiddies so youve really wasted your time not on your life youngbloods on his way out of here ive never been so certain of anything in my life he hasnt said so in so many words but everything about him confirms it his general manner the remarks he makes and so on youve no idea how or when he shook his head not a clue there is one thing he seems to be feeling his oats a bit at the moment i think somethings in the air she shook her head it doesnt make sense paul ive read the file on this place he couldnt get out nobody could hes going to go theres nothing surer and id like to be there when he does youll stop him of course not on your life angel chavasse grinned he doesnt know it yet but im going with him there was immediate dismay in her eyes but as she opened her mouth to reply a prison officer approached times up miss she got to her feet goodbye paul look after yourself you too he said and turned and followed the duty officer out meals at fridaythorpe were taken in a small canteen on the second floor of each tower block and when chavasse arrived lunch had already started the officer in charge signed for him and he went down to the counter and filled a tray quickly youngblood was sitting at the first table near the wall and he waved pointing to a vacant place next to him a sister eh he commented as chavasse sat down youve been holding out on me i wasnt sure shed want to know me any more chavasse said i must take a lot of living up to i hear she looked pretty good chavasse had long since got over being surprised at youngbloods apparently inexhaustible supply of information is there anything you dont hear if there is it isnt worth knowing atkinson arrived on one of his periodical tours of inspection and a few minutes later the bell rang for the end of the session they queued to return their plates and then stood in line at the lift to be returned in batches to their cells for the rest period before the afternoon session in the workshops began smoking was allowed as they waited and youngblood produced a cigarette put it in his mouth and searched unsuccessfully for a match atkinson stopped beside him took a box from his pocket and held it out you can keep those youngblood but make em last he shook his head as he moved away i dont know what some of you blokes would do without me there was a certain amount of dutiful laughter particularly from those who wanted to stay in his good books a moment later the lift arrived and as they moved forward youngblood put his cigarette away and slipped the matches into his pocket chavasse was conscious of a sudden surge of excitement the whole incident was completely out of character there was no love lost between atkinson and youngblood both men made that quite plain and yet the principal officer had gone out of his way to do youngblood a kindness it just didnt make sense during the rest period the cell doors were left open and there was a certain amount of coming and going but any prisoner was at liberty to lock himself in if he didnt feel sociable you dont mind if i close the door do you youngblood said to chavasse when they reached their cell im not in the mood for fraternising today suits me chavasse stretched out on his bed whats wrongarent you feeling so good restless youngblood said lets say i feel like cracking the walls wide open and leave it at that chavasse opened a magazine and waited and after a while youngblood got to his feet and moved to the washbasin he lit a cigarette keeping his back turned and then placed the box of matches on the side of the basin chavasse took a cigarette from one of his shirt pockets got to his feet and moved forward quickly reaching for the matches youngblood was staring down at his open palm he closed it quickly but not before chavasse had seen the small brown capsule mind if i have a match harry help yourself youngblood said chavasse lit the cigarette and returned to his bed so atkinson was the contact man they must have paid him a small fortune but then there was a lot at stake he lay down and behind him youngblood filled a plastic cup with water and drank it slowly there was a strange fixed expression on his face as he sat on the edge of his bed and chavasse said you sure youre okay harry you dont look too good to me maybe you should go sick im fine youngblood said just fine probably the spring and all that jazz i always get restless at this time of year its the gypsy in me who wouldnt in a dump like this chavasse said but youngblood didnt seem to hear him and sat there staring at the wall a strange faraway look in his eyes it was hotter than usual in the machine shop that afternoon mainly because the air circulating system had broken down and most of the men had stripped to the waist chavasse worked at one end of the bench cutting plates with a hand guillotine and youngblood was grinding steel clips to size on a high speed wheel he had been sweating profusely for some time now and there was a strange dazed expression in his eyes you all right harry chavasse called but youngblood didnt seem to hear him he paused for a moment leaning heavily on the bench rubbing sweat away from his eyes and when he reached out to pick up another clip from the stack on the bench beside him his hand was trembling he groped ineffectually for a moment and then the whole pile went over one of the clips ricocheted from the wheel like a bullet in a shower of sparks and then youngblood started to shake he staggered back rebounding from the bench behind driving headfirst into the mass of working machinery opposite chavasse got to him just in time youngbloods eyes had retracted sweat poured from his body and his limbs jerked convulsively there was no question but that he was undergoing a perfectly genuine fit however it had been inducedthe second stroke for which the governor had been waiting the one which would earn him a fast trip in an ambulance to manningham general hospital and afterwards there were cries of alarm from all parts of the workshop a rush of feet and as youngbloods body was racked by another convulsive spasm chavasse did the only possible thing and allowed himself to fall backwards across the bench still holding him when he ran his left forearm along the edge of the grinder the flesh split open in a nineinch streak and blood spurted across the bench in a satisfying stream he started to slide to the ground clutching at his arm letting youngblood fall and nevinson caught him just in time strangely enough there was no pain and chavasse sat there pressing his thumb in to the brachial artery in an attempt to stop the bright flow for a while there was considerable confusion and then atkinson arrived pushing his way through the crowd what in the hell happened here he demanded of the duty officer youngblood threw another fit hed have gone into the machinery if drummond hadnt caught him he opened up his arm on the grinding wheel atkinson inspected it briefly doesnt look too good does it he turned to the duty officer i want a couple of stretchers up here fast from sick bay and tell them to ring through to manningham general tell them youngbloods had another stroke and were on our way what about drummond him too of course you dont think we can deal with an injury like that here do you hes going to need a dozen stitches in that arm now get moving strangely enough it was at that precise moment that chavasses arm started to hurt like hell nightwatch when he opened his eyes the room was festooned with cobwebsgiant grey cobwebs that stretched from one wall to the other and undulated slowly he closed his eyes fighting the panic that rose inside him when he opened them again the cobwebs had almost disappeared he was lying in a narrow hospital bed and his left arm felt strangely numb when he looked down he saw that it was heavily bandaged and then he remembered and looked around him the ward was smallno more than half a dozen beds two of them were occupied one by brady who lay with a cage over his legs the other by youngblood both men seemed to be either sleeping or unconscious two prison officers were sitting at a small table by the door playing cards as chavasse stirred they glanced across and one of them got to his feet and walked over how do you feel terrible chavasse tried to moisten dry lips what happened they gave you an anaesthetic and stitched you up he turned to his companion better get the doctor he said he wanted to know when he came round chavasse closed his eyes as the other officer picked up the telephone his mouth was bone dry and he felt curiously lightheaded but otherwise he was fine he looked down at the arm he could feel nothing except that curious numbness which indicated the use of painkilling shots and he wondered how bad it was hed taken one hell of a chance back there at the machine shop what if hed severed a tendon for instance he closed his eyes sweat springing to his forehead and opened them again in time to see one of the prison officers unlock the door the doctor who came in was african a tall cheerful nigerian with tribal caste marks prominent on one cheek and a ready smile he sat on the edge of the bed and took chavasses pulse how are you feeling a bit lightheaded and my mouths very dry aftereffects of the anaesthetic thats all nothing to worry about the nigerian poured water into a glass from a jug on the bedside locker drink thisyoull feel a lot better chavasse did as he was told and then lay back what about my armis it serious the nigerian shook his head and grinned youll play the violin again isnt that what they would say on television thirteen stitchesi hope you are not superstitious but i couldnt find room for an extra one are you sending me straight back to fridaythorpe there was something close to compassion in the nigerians eyes when he replied no i think well hang on to you for a day or two chavasse tried hard not to show his relief but in his weakened state found it impossible what about youngbloodis he very ill the nigerian shrugged a second stroke is never a good thing well know more after our tests tomorrow but weve talked long enough now you must sleep again he went out and they locked the door behind him the two screws went back to their card game and chavasse turned and looked at youngblood he was sleeping peacefully his face in repose looking strangely innocent chavasse took a deep breath sothe stage was set he wondered what the next act would be and still wondering drifted into sleep when he next awakened it was night and the ward was a place of shadows rain drumming against the windows one of the prison officers slept soundly on an unoccupied bed the other read a magazine at the table he glanced across as chavasse stirred are you all right chavasse nodded i think ill take a walk he swung his legs to the floor sat there for a moment and then got to his feet and walked to the washroom at the other end of the ward it could have been worsemuch worse and on the way back he felt even better when he sat down again on the edge of his bed he realised with something of a shock that youngbloods eyes were wide open he stared at chavasse strangely a slight frown on his face and chavasse pulled a chair forward and sat down beside him how are you feeling harry what is this youngblood said whats going on youre in the closed ward at manningham general you had another stroke what are you doing here when you blew your top at fridaythorpe you almost went headfirst into the machinery i caught you just in time opened up my arm on the grinding wheel in the process is it bad thirteen stitchescould be worse theyre keeping me here for a couple of days the prison officer at the table make a quick phone call and then came over ive sent for the doctor how do you feel hungry as hell youngblood said any chance of a meal well see what he says a moment later there was a knock at the door and he opened it to admit the nigerian he crossed to youngbloods bed sat down and made a quick examination goodvery good you feel better for your sleep what he really needs is something to eat chavasse said and so do i were both starving the nigerian smiled ill see what i can do but you must get back into bed he turned to the prison officer ill tell the kitchen to send something up mr carter im going off duty now but my colleague dr mackenzie will be taking over if you need anything ring through to night sister but in any case hell be looking in later on carter locked the door behind him and returned to the bed he was a middleaged rather kindly man who was thought by most of his colleagues to be too soft anything i can do for you i could manage a visit to the washroom youngblood said i never could stand these damned bedpans maybe you and drummond could give me a hand they took him between them chavasse on the left so that he could use his good arm he walked very slowly like an old man and they had to support almost his whole weight chavasse was sure he was bluffing yet on the way back there was sweat on his forehead and when they got him on to the bed again he seemed exhausted on the other hand that might be the aftereffects of the drug there was a knock on the door and when carter opened it a male nurse came in pushing a trolley he served them with scrambled eggs toast and tea and went out again chavasse took his time over the meal watching youngblood intently he showed little desire for conversation and ate slowly apparently still weak and yet there was a slight air of tension about him and he kept glancing at the electric clock on the wall when they had both finished carter took the trays and put them back on the trolley which the nurse had left by the door what about a smoke mr carter youngblood said carter looked dubious im not sure thats such a good idea just onethats hardly likely to kill us i suppose not he gave them a cigarette each and a light and went back to his magazine it was just five minutes to nine and to chavasse the atmosphere seemed to crackle with electricity youngblood lay back against the pillow staring up at the ceiling the cigarette held loosely between the fingers of his left handa hand that shook slightly each time he raised it to his mouth betraying his inner tension as the second hand swept round towards nine he crushed his cigarette into the ashtray on the bedside locker and looked across at chavasse id like to say thanks while i still have the chance for what you did up there in the machine shop first brady and then the other thing thats okay i wish there was something i could do for youi dont like being in debt to anyonebut there isnt whatever happens i want you to get that straight what in the hell are you talking about before youngblood could reply there was a knock on the door carter opened it on the chain and chavasse heard a pleasant cultured voice dr mackenziejust making my rounds the man who stepped into the room wore the conventional white coat of the staff doctor and a stethoscope dangled from one pocket like a badge of office he had a pale aristocratic face and a fixed smile to the average person he might have seemed a slightly effeminate rather upperclass young man but not to chavasse who knew a real pro when he saw one how are things then he said pleasantly and as carter turned to lock the door took a automatic from one pocket and delivered a stunning blow to the base of the prison officers skull carter groaned and fell heavily to the floor there was a cry of anger and the second prison officer who had been sleeping on one of the spare beds flung himself forward and landed squarely on mackenzies back before he could turn he lurched into the wall the gun flying from his hand to skid across the polished floor they went down together mackenzie underneath and then youngblood arrived on the run he grabbed the prison officer by the collar and pulled him off with a tremendous heave swinging the man round driving his clenched fist into his stomach the prison officer doubled over and youngbloods knee lifted him back against the wall he slid to the ground and mackenzie moved in fast and kicked him expertly in the side of the head almost fouled things up for us didnt he old man he said to youngblood as they stood over the two prison officers breathing heavily a remarkable recovery harry chavasse said i must say you put in quite a performance back there in the machine shop he was standing three or four yards away one hand behind his back as youngblood turned to face him that was genuine enough thanks to a drug called mabofine all the symptoms but none of the aftereffects it must have taken quite some planning a fascinating exchange mackenzie interrupted but im sure you wont mind if we postpone it and get to hell out of here that suits me just fine chavasse said mackenzie smiled patiently im afraid youll have to sit this one out old man weve only catered for one thats right drum youngblood said fare paying passengers only this trip chavasse took his hand from behind his back and held up mackenzies automatic this tells a different tale it says we all go or nobody does mackenzies habitual slight smile disappeared and he slid one foot forward tentatively i wouldnt youngblood said heavily he means it mackenzie shrugged the baron isnt going to like this to hell with the baron he can put it on the bill cant he now how do we get out of here suit yourself mackenzie opened the door and pulled in a wheelchair which had been standing outside a nice authentic touch just in case we meet anyone we take the service elevator at the end of the corridor to the basement and go out through the staff entrance theres no one about at this time of night ive got transport waiting and clothes for one he turned to chavasse i dont know how far you think youll get in hospital pyjamas and a dressing gown no problem there chavasse gestured towards carter hes about my size get him stripped ill manage just fine with his trousers and shirt and that pullover hes wearing under his uniform jacket they didnt argue and a few moments later youngblood tossed the clothes across chavasse withdrew to the end of the ward placed the gun within easy reach and dressed quickly it isnt that i dont trust you harry he explained its just that i know youd cut my throat if you thought there was even a remote possibility that i might spoil your chances youngblood chuckled and shook his head in frank admiration a pity we didnt meet up years ago drum we could have taken them all on he sat in the wheelchair arranging a blanket over his legs and mackenzie took off his white coat and threw it at chavasse you wear that and push the wheelchairill swing the stethoscope in one hand arent we gong to tie these two up not worth it the real mackenzie could turn up at any time now lets get moving weve got a tight schedule it was quiet in the corridor and when mackenzie pressed the button the lift rose to meet them at once when the doors opened in the basement he walked out without hesitation and chavasse followed him pushing the wheelchair the basement was deserted except for two ambulances parked by a loading bay and they kept on going through the staff door at the end and out into the night rain drifted in a fine spray through the light over the porch an old commer van was parked at the bottom of the steps and mackenzie peered out cautiously two nurses uniform caps swinging from their shoulders against the rain were walking down towards the main gates but otherwise the drive was deserted mackenzie went down the steps opened the rear door of the van turned and nodded chavasse and youngblood went after him the door slammed a key turned and they were driven rapidly away a few moments after starting an interior light came on and youngblood discovered a pile of clothing in one corner there was everything he needed from shoes to a raincoat all obviously carefully chosen for size the van was not being driven at any particular speed and he had little difficulty in changing he had barely finished when they braked to a halt the engine was switched off mackenzie jumped out came round to the rear and unlocked the door lets be having you they were in a large towncentre car park and buildings lifted into the night on either side where are we youngblood demanded manningham a change of transport thats all mackenzie handed chavasse a burberry trenchcoat and a silk scarf much as i regret having to part with them youd better have these do you think i could possibly have my gun back now a fair exchange chavasse handed him the automatic and pulled on the raincoat mackenzie withdrew the magazine then snapped it back into place with an ominous click im awfully tempted old man i really am im sure you are chavasse said on the other hand it would make a hell of a dent in your plans to have me lying around in a ditch somewhere now that really would have every copper in the country straining at the leash somehow thats what i thought you might say mackenzie said another time perhaps shall we go the car waited in the shadows of the far side of the park a vauxhall brake and mackenzie drove away at once taking a road which had them out of manningham and into the countryside within ten minutes he switched on the radio and as music drifted out leaned back in the driving seat his eyes on the road and now we can get down to business mr youngblood i was wondering when youd get round to it mackenzie laughed gently do you know something thats exactly what ben hoffa said youngblood turned to look at him you handled bens break but of course the baron always gives me the big ones where is he now hoffa mackenzie chuckled a long long way away mr youngblood i can assure you of that and they wont get him back thats all part of our guaranteed service but lets dispose of the sordid cash angle first you know our termsthey were fully explained weve kept our part of the bargainweve got you out you tell us where the cash is and that completes phase one of the operation there is no cash youngblood said calmly the car swerved and mackenzie fought to regain control youre joking of course not at all i did a deal with some dutch money changers in amsterdam and converted my share into diamondstwo hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth not badnot bad at all prices have risen a lot in five years where are they a safe deposit in jermyn street in london in the name of alfred bonner one of those places where the manager keeps one key and the customer the other you need both to open the box and who has yours my sister she lives at wheeler court bethnal green shell hand it over with no trouble i put her in the picture when she last visited me three months ago that all sounds perfectly straightforward mackenzie said ill pass the information along to the right quarter and what happens to us youll be well taken care of if everything goes according to plan theyll start phase two when the baron has his hands on those diamonds i should point out by the way that mr drummond here is very definitely going to come extra and when do we get to see the baron chavasse said when hes ready and not before under our system youre passed on from hand to hand as it were we find that much safer for all concerned with the baron waiting at the end with my money i hope youngblood said plus a new identity a new life a passport to anywhere in the world i should have thought that was quite a bargain old man ahead was an intersection and he turned left into a quiet secondary road and braked to a halt about a mile further on it had stopped raining and a full moon had appeared from behind a bank of heavy cloud so that they could see quite clearly a five barred gate and a ruined farmhouse beyond all out mackenzie said this is where i leave you youngblood and chavasse stepped on to the grass verge and looked around them what is this youngblood demanded mackenzie slipped off his watch and gave it to him through the window its now nine thirtyfive in approximately ten minutes someone will pick you up whats he driving chavasse asked ive no idea his opening words will be is there anywhere in particular youd like me to take you you must answer babylon hell tell you babylons too far for him but will offer to take you part of the way have you got that youngblood stared at him in amazement are you crazy if i am then youve made a damned bad bargain old man mackenzie said and he released the handbrake and drove rapidly away they stood there listening to the engine fade into the distance and when it had finally died youngblood turned to chavasse face white in the moonlight what do you think are they just stringing us along i shouldnt have thought so theyve too much to lose i suppose youre right better have a cigarette and hope for the best it was chavasse who heard the sound of the approaching vehicle first and he moved out into the road and looked down to the shadows at the bottom of the hill where headlights flared through the darkness could this be it youngblood demanded chavasse watched for a moment eyes narrowed and then shook his head i shouldnt imagine so it looks like a petrol tanker to me in a lonely place the man who had impersonated mackenzie turned on to the great north road pulled up at the first roadside cafe he came to and went into a phone box he made two calls and the first took some getting as it was apparently routed through a manual exchange it was at least five minutes before a blunt yorkshire voice sounded on the other end of the line and he cut in at once that you mr crowther look weve run into a little difficulty that package youve been expectingyoull actually be receiving two think you can handle them well double your fee naturally crowther might have been discussing the price of cattle and his voice was completely matteroffact when he replied i dont see why not it might take a bit longer thats all well have to go careful another thing my wife died yesterday sorry to hear that were burying her in the morning and that wont help still leave it with me im sure well manage ill be in touch he replaced the receiver and found some more change this time he dialled a london number the receiver was lifted at once at the other end and a woman said world wide exports hello sweetiesimon vaughan speaking from dear old county durham what happened ive just been watching the news on television it seems two birds have flown the coop not one couldnt be helped im afraid im not too happy about the additional package something about him seems wildly wrong to me still it doesnt matter crowthers agreed to take on both of themfor twice his usual fee ill pass the word along what about the merchandise its in a safe deposit in jermyn street under the name of alfred bonner not what we expected by the way but something equally as good what about a key the sister has it at wheeler court bethnal green there shouldnt be any hitch there shes expecting a caller goodwell pick it up right away and simon yes sweetie id check on crowther tomorrow if i were you exactly what i was thinking ill see you in church as he walked back to his car he whistled softly and there was a smile on his face when chavasse climbed out of the tankers secret compartment it had stopped raining and he waited for youngblood to join him shivering slightly in the chill wind the driver dropped the hatch back into place and looked down at them theres a track on the other side of the road youll be met good luck he climbed back inside the cab there was a hiss of air as he released the brakes and the tanker faded into the night chavasse watched the red tail lights dwindle away and turned to youngblood what time is it just coming up to half one which means we were inside that sardine can for almost four hours i reckon we must have covered the best part of a hundred and fifty miles i know one thing youngblood said with feeling it was never intended to hold two somewhere in the distance a dog barked hollowly and then a bank of cloud rolled away from the moon and the countryside was bathed in a hard white light the night sky was incredibly beautiful with stars strung away to the horizon and hills lifted uneasily into the darkness all round where in the hell are we youngblood demanded on the other side of the road a stone rattled and a young woman moved out of the shadows is there anywhere in particular youd like me to take you chavasse recognised her accent at once and turned to youngblood some part of yorkshire thats certain the girl wore a headscarf and an old raincoat and waited patiently her face calm touched with an impossible beauty by the hard white light of the moon babylon youngblood said too far for me but i can take you part of the way she said in her strange dead voice she moved back up the track and youngblood turned to chavasse in exasperation this whole bloody affair is getting more like something out of alice in wonderland every minute well be meeting the white rabbit next or the mad hatter chavasse said with a grin and went after the girl quickly sam crowther watched them coming along the track clear in the moonlight from the loft of his barn here they are he said softly there was a stirring in the darkness at his side and billy leaned forward excitedly saliva dribbling from the corner of his mouth two nuts to crack this time billy crowther said but well manage wont we all in good time he patted billy on the shoulder and went down the ladder as he emerged from the barn the girl turned in through the gate chavasse and youngblood followed her good lass molly crowther said you go in and make em some ham and eggs the girl moved off without a word and crowther turned with a big smile holding out his hand mr youngblood and mr drummond i presume there was so much about you two on the eleven oclock news that i feel ive known you all my life im sam crowther youngblood ignored the hand and whats that he nodded to billy who had just shambled out of the shadows of the barn only billy mr youngblood only billy crowther chuckled and tapped his forehead significantly hes not got all he needs upstairs but hes as good as two ordinary men round the farm but what are we standing round here for you come on in and ill show you your room by the time youve washed up molly will have a meal on the table ive no doubt your daughter chavasse said as they went into the porch thats it mr drummond a good girl our molly she doesnt seem to have much to say for herself not so surprising crowther said piously and her mother barely twentyfour hours cold there was a door to the left and he opened it to disclose a cheap deal coffin with gilt handles standing on a table were putting her under at the village church at ten oclock in the morning its eight miles away so that means the hearse will be here at nine you gentlemen will have to lay low till its gone he closed the door and led the way up a flight of narrow wooden stairs covered in cheap linoleum worn smooth by the years the landing was long and narrow and he opened the door at the far end and switched on the light i think youll be comfortable enough here there was an old double bed with a brass frame a wardrobe and dressing table in victorian mahogany and a marble washstand youngblood unbuttoned his raincoat and threw it on the bed and how long do we stay here until i get the right telephone call could be tomorrow the day after at the latest but dont worry youre safe enough here were miles from anywhere and where exactly would that be chavasse asked crowther gave him a sly grin that would be telling now wouldnt it mr drummond no i couldnt do that ive got myself to protect you gents come down when youre ready therell be food on the table the door closed behind him and youngblood took off his jacket and draped it over a chair what do you think i wouldnt trust him out of my sight for very long chavasse moved to the window and peered outside this place is like a bad film set for wuthering heights youngblood poured water from a large jug into a cracked basin and swilled his face and neck i know one thing he said as he towelled himself briskly he only has to make one wrong move and ill break his bloody neck chavasse took off his raincoat and moved across to the basin ive a feeling that might not be so easy where our boy billys concerned youve got a point there but why cross bridges youngblood grinned right now im more interested in ham and eggs ill see you downstairs the door closed softly behind him and chavasse stood frowning into the cracked mirror above the washstand there was something wrong here he had never been more certain of anything in his life it spoke aloud in the girls silence in the slyness in crowthers eyes when he glanced sideways in the great shambling imbecile that was his shadow but if something sinister was intended what could it be crowther was no fool that was obvious and must realise that together chavasse and youngblood presented a formidable combination separated on the other hand with a sudden exclamation he hurled the towel from him wrenched open the door and hurried downstairs when youngblood went into the parlour there was no one there and he moved along the passage and entered the kitchen molly was standing at the stove in an old cotton dress that was a size too small so that the skirt seams had split in several places she wore no stockings and when she turned to look at him he realised with considerable disappointment that the moon had lied she was at best plain and with her high cheekbones olive skin and overfull lips many people would have considered her ugly its almost ready she said in that strange dead voice of hers and smoothed her hands over her thighs im just going out to the shed to get some more wood for the stove she took a lantern down from a hook above the sink lit it and moved towards the back door youngblood was there before her here ill take that he said you could probably do with some help she hesitated gazing up at him a strange uncertain expression in her eyes and then she handed him the lamp all right its across the yard the cobbles were damp in the night air and treacherous underfoot and youngblood picked his way carefully cursing when he stepped into a puddle and water slopped into one of his shoes when the girl opened the door of the shed he could smell mouldy hay old leather and wood shavings and damp where the stars gleamed through a hole in the roof over here she said he went towards her lantern raised and paused a trick of the lamplight he knew that but for a moment she looked exactly as she had done down there on the road in the moonlightas old as eve and more beautiful than he had thought any woman could be she turned leaning over the woodpile one knee forward so that the old cotton dress tightened across her thighs like a second skin five years five long years youngblood moved forward reaching out to touch and she turned to face him it was there in her eyes the sudden shock the knowing for a moment they stayed that way and then she seemed to sway towards him from somewhere in the house chavasse called harry where are you youngblood smiled reached forward and gently stroked her face with the back of one hand some other time perhaps you take the lantern ill carry the wood she moved back clutching the lantern in both hands the knuckles gleaming white betraying her inner tension youngblood piled half a dozen logs in the crook of one arm and led the way out as they crossed the yard chavasse appeared in the kitchen doorway so there you are there didnt seem to be anyone around i got worried just helping with the chores youngblood turned to molly wheres your father got to here i am mr youngblood crowther moved out of the shadows on the other side of the yard just settling the animals wheres billy never you mind about him he sleeps in the barn best place for him are we all ready then he turned to the girl rubbing his hands together and said jovially by gum i dont know what youve got for us lass but i could eat a horse it was a good hour later when billy shambled out of the darkness across the yard and approached the rear door he opened it carefully and moved inside crowther was sitting at the kitchen table smoking his pipe and reading a newspaper he looked up and nodded calmly there you are then billy he went to a cupboard under the sink and came back with a tenpound hammer you know what to do billy gripped the hammer tightly in his right hand and nodded eagerly saliva glistened on his chin good lad best get started then crowther opened the door led the way along the passageway and mounted the stairs to the landing he paused outside the end door a finger on his lips and tried the knob gently the door remained immovable and he turned calmly and pushed billy back along the corridor at the bottom of the steps he paused and put a hand on the big mans shoulders never mind billy theres always tomorrow he said in the bedroom chavasse and youngblood stood in silence watching the door knob turn when the soft footsteps had faded along the passageway youngbloods breath left his body in a long sigh my god im glad youre here he said to chavasse i feel like a tenyearold kid thats looking for a bogie in every cupboard in this house youd probably find one still theres one good thing whats that chavasse grinned its nice to know im wanted something nasty in the woodshed rain drifted against the window with the dismal pattering and chavasse looked out across the farmyard morosely in the grey light of early morning it presented an unlovely picture great potholes in the cobbles filled with stagnant water archaic rusting machinery and a profusion of rubbish everywhere have you ever seen anything like it youngblood asked in disgust talk about cannery row chavasse went to the table and poured himself another cup of tea what time is it just coming up to nine fortyfive and crowther said the funeral was at ten they should be back here by half past he nodded at the table had enough to eat yesyou fry a good egg chavasse opened the kitchen door and looked up at the hill on the other side of the yard there was a small grey stone hut on top and a scattering of grimy looking sheep think ill take a walksee what i can see youngblood looked out over his shoulder at the rain rather you than me ill search the house there might be a gun around the place youll be lucky chavasse said crowther may be primitive but he has all the cunning of the fox he took an old oilskin coat down from behind the door and went outside buttoning it up to his chin there was a pile of rusting tin cans against the outhouse wall the accumulation of the years and he kicked one of them across the yard and followed it into the barn it was in the same state of decay as the rest of the place planks missing from the door rain drifting down through several holes in the roof an old cattle truck which still seemed to be in working order was parked by the rear door and the tractor beside it its metal parts red with rust in the damp atmosphere looked as if it hadnt functioned for years chavasse kicked the tin can carelessly out of his path it landed in a pile of mouldy hay in one corner and a couple of brown rats shot into the open to poise in the centre of the floor watching him strange how you could never get over some things his face wrinkled in disgust and he picked up a stone and threw it with all his force sending them running for the shadows on the other side of the barn he went out through the other door passed through a wilderness of brambles and nettles that had once been a kitchen garden and found the beginnings of a path beyond the crumbling boundary wall it lifted through a scattering of alder trees following the curve of the hillside climbing steeply to the summit quite suddenly he found that he was enjoying himself there was a fine fresh smell to the rain and the hard physical exercise was something to be enjoyed for its own sake after the long weary months of prison life he negotiated a high drystone wall by climbing an ingenious stone stile and found himself on the final slope sheep wandered amongst a jumble of great boulders and outcrops of stone carved by the winds of time into a thousand strange shapes above him to the rear of the hut a clump of thorn trees stood together their branches twisted and unnatural and pointing like the fingers of a gnarled hand in the same direction forced by the prevailing wind the hut was larger than it had looked from the farmyard and in reasonable condition there was fresh hay inside dry and sweet and sacks of feedstuffs probably for the sheep he lit a cigarette went back outside again and crossed to the scattering of rocks that formed the spine of the hill from there he had a clear view of the main road in the valley below shrouded in mist a gleam of water beyond a reservoir perhaps a lake he turned away and with something of a shock found that molly crowther was standing watching him she made a strange melancholy figure fitting perfectly into that dead landscape in an old black coat with the padded shoulders fashionable during the war years a scarf was bound tightly around the strong peasant face hello there chavasse said walking to meet her did everything go all right she nodded with a curious indifference the priest didnt waste much time he was getting wet wheres your father gone into the next village with billy he dropped me down there on the road its quicker to walk over the hill and i wanted to check on the sheep do you look after them most of the time billy helps me when hes in the mood the trouble is he doesnt know his own strength one minute hes fondling a lamb the next its neck is broken he isnt very reliable i see your point chavasse hesitated and went on im sorry about your mother im not she said with brutal frankness she had cancer of the stomach during the last year of her life and refused to go to hospital i had to look after her it wasnt much of a time for either of us shes well out of this place anyway dont you like it here she turned on him in surprise who could like a place like this she flung out an arm that seemed to embrace the whole windswept landscape even the trees grow crooked here its a dead world i sometimes think the only living things in it are the sheep and theyre like billywitless why dont you leave i couldnt beforethere was my mother to consider now its too late im squeezed dry i wouldnt know where to go there was real pain in her voice and chavasse felt genuinely sorry for her perhaps your father could help he may intend to now that your mother has gone theres only one thing he wants to do for megod knows hes tried that often enough she laughed harshly my father died when i was three he was a gypsy like my mother she met sam crowther at skipton market ten years ago and married him within a week the worst days work she ever did in her life you sound as if you hate him and this placeall i ever wanted was to get away where would you like to go ive never really thought about it she shrugged some place where i could get a decent job wear nice clothes meet peoplelondon maybe from her vantage point it must have seemed as remote as the moon and just about as romantic distance lends enchantment he told her gently london can be the loneliest place on earth id take my chances they had reached one of the boundary walls and she leaned against it arms folded under her breasts it must be marvelous to be able to go placesdo exciting thingslike mr youngblood for instance five years in gaol chavasse said another fifteen to go if they catch himperhaps more now nothing very romantic there i mean before that she said with a slight trace of impatience he was a smuggler you know amongst other things she rushed on looking animated for the first time since he had known her i read an article about him in one of the sunday papers last year they said he was a modern robin hood i suppose thats one way of looking at it depends what the original was like but its true she insisted they published an interview with an old lady whod been treated with eviction because she couldnt pay her rent somebody told mr youngblood he gave her a hundred pounds and hed never even met her before chavasse could have told her that the incident had taken place just after a successful payroll snatch in essex which was known to have netted youngblood and his associates thirtytwo thousand pounds and had put two armoured car guards in hospital one with a fractured skull but he knew when he was wasting his time he grinned crookedly hes certainly quite a man she nodded i hope he gets away clear out of the country i hope you both do do you get many people through here like us he said about half a dozen this year what about george saxton and ben hoffa harrys friends did you see anything of them suddenly it was as if shutters had dropped squarely into place and when she glanced at him the eyes were blank the face devoid of all expression yes they were here for how long she hesitated and then said slowly i dont know i didnt see them go chavasse was aware of a sudden coldness in the pit of the stomach and his throat seemed to go dry was that unusual yesyes it was she said hesitatingly the others were here for two or three days i always saw them leave my stepfather took them in the car let me get this straight chavasse said you met saxton and hoffa down there on the road at night just like us and you brought them up to the farm thats right did you ever see either of them again after that never they stood staring at each other dumbly in the rain the ceaseless sighing of the wind the only sound what happened to them molly chavasse said i dont know before god i dont know she cried you mean you dont want to know dont you she shuddered violently as if at some secret unpleasant thought and he gripped her arms above the elbows gentling her like a fractious mare all right mollytheres nothing to worry about ill handle it he started to walk away paused and turned towards her are you coming down ive the sheep to see to her hands were shaking so hard that she had to clasp them together laterill be along later he didnt bother to argue and went down the hill on the run his face grim the possibilities implicit in what she had said were monstrous and yet if he was honest some sort of suspicion had been there at the back of his mind from the moment he had met sam crowther and his sinister shadow he remembered the knob on the bedroom door turning silently in the night and his flesh crawled he climbed the stone stile vaulted the wall and found himself face to face with youngblood find anything chavasse said youngblood shook his head not even a shotgun i know where we are though found an old envelope this is wykehead farm near settle he frowned suddenly you look excited anything happen im not really sure chavasse said but ive just had a chat with molly and ive a hunch there could be something very nasty in the woodshed what in the hell are you talking about no time to discuss it now ask her about saxton and hoffa yourself and see what you make of it you get a clear view of the main road from the top the moment you see crowthers car come down and warn me youll have plenty of time he went down the hill quickly leaving youngblood standing there a frown on his face after a while he turned climbed the stile and went up the hill although he had developed and especially in his navy days a genuine love of the sea harry youngblood was a city animal and he paused to survey the strange twisted landscape with distaste there was nothing here that appealed to him nothing at all and he climbed on until he reached the spine of rocks on the crest of the hill and looked down to the road below a truck moved along it matchbox size but there was no sign of crowthers old black ford he turned and started towards the hut and suddenly realised that the girl was standing there looking at him a lamb cradled in her arms she disappeared inside and when he reached the doorway he found her crouched down on the floor mixing some kind of bran with milk in a feeding bowl hello there youngblood said what happened to your father he went into the next village with billy i came up here to check the sheep she had spoken without looking round and he lit a cigarette aware of a sudden unbearable tightness in his chest that threatened to choke him she had taken off her coat and the black woollen dress she wore was like the cotton one of the previous night a size too small and stretched tightly across her buttocks and thighs outside thunder echoed faintly and the rain increased with a sudden rush she glanced briefly almost furtively over her shoulder and again he was conscious of that same strange trick of the light as the shadows of the hut smoothed away her plainness softened the harshness of that strong ugly face making her beautiful she stood up reaching to a rack on the wall and youngblood his throat dry dropped his cigarette and moved close his arms sliding around her pulling her against him when he turned her around she stood there woodenly her face expressionless making no move to stop him as his hands crawled across her body five years five long hard years forgetting about saxton and hoffa and chavasses strange behaviour youngblood hot with desire threw every other consideration to the winds and pushed her back on to the pile of hay in the corner it was only when he penetrated her that she came to life her hands tightening in his hair her mouth fastening on his with great bruising kisses that were almost frightening in the intensity of their passion below in the valley sam crowthers old ford turned off the road and started along the track to the farm youngblood surfaced his face damp with sweat and stared up at the roof there had been no finesse about what had happened nothing gentle and now it was over she lay beside him eyes closed breasts heaving moisture beading her upper lip and he was filled with something very close to disgust she was uglygod dammit everything about her was ugly from the unkempt hair and sallow face to the dowdy black dress and darned stockings he eased away and she turned at once opening her eyes he forced a smile you all right kid oh harry i love you i love you so much she clutched his hand and turned her face into his shoulder it was a cry from the heart of someone who had never known love or kindness or any kind of affection in her life before but youngblood had neither the perception nor the sensitivity necessary to understand that for her he had become the only real thing in a world of illusion he patted her on the shoulder awkwardly and pulled away taking out his cigarettes and lighting one looking for a change of subject he remembered what chavasse had said what went on between you and paul when he passed me on the way down he seemed pretty excited about something she got up took a comb from the pocket of her coat and ran it through her hair he was asking me questions about the other people who came here thats all like george saxton and ben hoffa thats right and what did he want to know if id seen them leave youngblood frowned and did you she shook her head the others who came used to stay two or three days but i never saw either of your friends again after i brought them up here youngblood stared at her in horror as the full implication sank in jesus christ he whispered in the same moment both barrels of a shotgun were fired in rapid succession the sound echoing flatly through the rain as it drifted up from the valley below he turned to the door and the girl grabbed his arm dont go harrydont go she screamed he struck her across the face with the flat of his hand sending her backwards into the hay you bitch he said you dirty little bitch youve sold us out and then he was gone and she picked herself up and stumbled after him crying hysterically when chavasse reached the farmyard he paused suddenly uncertain not even sure what he was looking for if his suspicions were correct if saxton and ben hoffa had never left this place alive their bodies could be anywhere tossed into a peat bog or simply buried a foot under the surface somewhere out there on the moors they could lie for five hundred years without being discovered he went inside the farmhouse and stood in the stone flagged passageway for a moment wondering what to do next conscious of the eerie silence there was a door to his left and one on the right leading to the parlour and living room respectively and the kitchen was at the far end and then he noticed another under the stairs when he opened it unpleasant dank odour drifted up to meet him from the darkness below he fumbled for the light switch and clicked it on to disclose a flight of stone steps he went down cautiously and found himself in a narrow whitewashed passage that turned into another various storerooms leading off on either side there was the usual accumulation of rubbish that was to be found in the cellars of any old house and many of the rooms had obviously been used to store provisions in other days he was wasting his time so much was obvious and he turned and went back along the passage doing a bit of exploring eh sam crowther said from the top of the stairs he was standing in the doorway a doublebarrelled shotgun under one arm chavasse paused fractionally at the bottom of the steps and kept on going thats right hope you dont mind not at all crowther moved back into the passageway a jovial smile on his face and wheres mr youngblood somewhere around and molly crowther chuckled somehow contriving to make even that sound obscene happen theyre together eh and he dug his elbow into chavasses ribs i wouldnt know about that in spite of crowthers unctuous smile an indefinable air of menace hung around him and danger crackled in the air like electricity chavasse waited tense and ready for anything that was to come uncomfortably aware of the dull ache from his stitches knowing that to all intents and purposes he might as well be onearmed crowther leaned forward and winked in a conspiratorial fashion theres summat you might find very interesting out back summat i wouldnt show to everybody seeing as how were alone this might just be the time he turned walking ahead along the passageway and chavasse followed him out through the kitchen he led the way across the yard and opened a gate leading into a small courtyard the only thing it seemed to contain was an old well surrounded by a three foot circular brick wall billy stood beside it a stupid fixed grin on his ugly face his great hands curved slightly as if he was waiting for something lets have it off then billy lad crowther chuckled nothing like a piece of female flesh for splitting the opposition mind you my mollys no oil painting ill grant you that but shes got the necessary and after five years inside mr youngbloods not going to be too choosy now is he the barrel of the shotgun jabbed chavasse in the back and as the cover came off the well with a crash he pivoted sharply his left arm trapping the barrel against his side the edge of his right hand slashing crowther across the side of the neck so that he cried out in pain and staggered back chavasse pulled the shotgun from under his armpit with his right hand thumbing back the hammers awkwardly as he ran for the gate as he started to turn billy gave a cry of rage and lurched forward he was like some primeval beast lumbering in for the kill the nightmare face contorted with rage great hands outstretched to rend and tear chavasse didnt even let him get close he swung up the shotgun onehanded resting the barrels across his left arm and fired the first shot caught billy in the chest stopping him dead in his tracks the second blew away half his face scattering blood and brain across the cobblestones driving him back against the well he hit the wall jackknifed and disappeared without a cry there was a single splash and then silence crowther lay on his face moaning softly and chavasse dropped to one knee beside him and searched his pockets he found a handful of cartridges and reloaded the shotgun then he gave crowther a kick in the ribs and stood back on your feet crowther scrambled up backing against the wall of the courtyard chavasse moved in and rammed the muzzle of the shotgun under the mans chin saxton and hoffa theyre down there arent they crowther hesitated and the muzzle dug painfully into his flesh arent they crowther nodded fearfully thats right how many more again he hesitated and chavasse thumbed back the hammers of the shotgun for gods sake dont shoot crowther cried fourthats all thats all chavasse said in disgust fighting back the inclination to pull the trigger then other people were passed through safely thats right i was only obeying orders i bet you were the people you passed on where did they go to next i wouldnt know the barrel of the shotgun was raised menacingly and he cried out in alarm its the truth i tell you i used to drop them ten miles from here at a crossroads to be picked up by someone else there was the sound of running feet and youngblood called through the rain from the house drumwhere are you out here chavasse replied youngblood arrived a moment later and paused in the gateway what happened here they thought i might be more comfortable down the well but billy decided to try it instead youll be interested to know thats where saxton and ben hoffa are youngblood crossed to crowther you dirty bastard very slowly but with infinite menace he searched the older man tossing the contents of his pockets carelessly onto the cobbles he found a wallet which appeared to contain fifty or sixty pounds and nodded to chavasse this should be useful whats he told you everybody didnt end up down the well most of the clients were passed on where to he doesnt know says he drops them at a crossroads about ten miles from here to be picked up youngblood turned on crowther and laughed harshly are you trying to tell me you never hung around to see what happened never followed anybody in a pigs ear you didnt he sank his fist into the pit of crowthers stomach so that he screamed and doubled over falling to his knees a foot caught him a glancing blow on the shin and he fell over backwards now try him youngblood said chavasse dropped on one knee beside crowther and raised his head he means businessid talk if i were you crowther nodded a dazed expression in his eyes and wiped blood from his cheek all right ill tell you i did follow clients twice what happened they were picked up by a furniture van and dropped off on the outskirts of shrewsbury then what they waited on a certain bench and were picked up by the same person each timea blind woman with a guide dog her names hartmanrosa hartman and she lives at alma cottage bampton shes some sort of a clairvoyante at that moment the girl arrived panting and out of breath her face flushed she poised in the gateway and looked around her wildly are you all right harry youngblood turned and went towards her if i am its no thanks to you you rotten little bitch i could have been at the bottom of that well by tonight and no questions asked she was crying her face looking uglier than ever and pawed at his chest i didnt know harry i didnt know do you think i came over on a banana boat or something youngblood said and he grabbed her hair viciously wrenching back her head chavasse moved across the courtyard in three quick strides and pulled him away leave her alone harry shed nothing to do with it all she ever had were suspicions and if she hadnt mentioned those i probably wouldnt be here now behind them crowther saw his chance and ran for a gap in the wall where the brickwork had crumbled youngblood turned with a cry of alarm but he was too late and chavasse grabbed his arm to hold him back as crowther ran for his life through the undergrowth on the other side of the wall never mind himweve got to get out of here they went out into the main courtyard and the girl plucked at youngbloods sleeve youll take me with you harry do me a favour youngblood said and pushed her away violently but you cant leave me she pleaded not now whats she talking about chavasse demanded how the hell should i know youngblood said impatiently ill get some food from the house and well get moving i suppose wed better take the ford please harry the girl was crying bitterly and chavasse looked at her a frown on his face he didnt like leaving her if only because crowther might return on the other hand she would be nothing but a hindrance or would she he put a hand on her shoulder molly can you drive she looked up eagerly of course i can what are you up to youngblood demanded i was just thinking chavasse said what if we run into a road block somewhere its always possible if the girl drove a mile in front in the ford and we followed in the cattle truck thered be time for her to turn back and warn us youngblood nodded slowly you know i think youve got something there he turned to molly and put a hand on her shoulder think you can do it kid she gazed up at him an expression of pure joy in her eyes just try me harry just try me five minutes after the truck had rolled away down the track sam crowther emerged from the trees at the back of the farm and limped across the yard his mouth was badly swollen and his chest hurt so that he could hardly breathe he leaned over the sink holding his head under the cold tap and when he straightened reaching for a towel he found simon vaughan standing in the open doorway hello mr smith crowther said uncertainly i didnt expect to see you just thought id look in to see if everything had gone off smoothly vaughan said you look as if youve been in the wars old man nothing i couldnt handle crowthers brain worked overtime youve brought the money with you i hope youve disposed of them already vaughan said i must say thats very efficient of you where are they in the well at the rear mind if we take a look crowther hesitated you wont see much stillsuit yourself it was still raining when they went into the courtyard and approached the well the stench was appalling but such was the depth of the shaft that it was impossible to see what lay at the bottom so you put them down there did you vaughan said thats right vaughan sighed you know you really are the most awful liar ive just walked over the hill old man i saw youngblood and drummond drive away in that cattle truck of yours which was true although he had missed mollys departure in the ford by five minutes you have a daughter dont you where is she i reckon shes cleared off crowther whispered i see did you tell our friends about alma cottage at bampton and rosa hartman crowthers face was his answer and he shook his head gently you shouldnt have done that old man you really shouldnt his right hand came out of his pocket and swung up the blade of a flicked knife springing into view the point catching crowther under the chin and shearing through the roof of his mouth into his brain he died instantly and vaughan pulled out the knife holding him upright cleaned the blade carefully on crowthers jacket then pushed him over the wall into the well he turned and walked away through the rain whistling tunelessly distant thunder vaughan passed the cattle truck within fifteen miles travelling fast in a green triumph spitfire a mile further on he overtook the old black ford with molly at the wheel but it meant nothing to him he had never met crowthers stepdaughter and had certainly no reason to think she was in any way linked with the fugitives on the other side of blackburn he pulled in at a roadside cafe found a telephone box and called world wide exports in london hello sweetie just thought id let you know i checked on our friend and he hadnt managed to come up to scratch im afraid the two packages are on their way to bampton thats a great pity what are you doing about it i closed our account with this branchseemed no point in carrying on and i can be in bampton before the merchandise thought id ensure it gets a suitable reception im not certain thats such a good idea id better check give me your number and ill ring back in fifteen minutes vaughan left the phone box sat on the high stool at the counter and ordered coffee the young waitress smiled when she gave it to him impressed by the handsome stranger in the expensive clothes but vaughan seemed to look right through her and she moved away feeling rather disappointed he lit a cigarette and frowned at himself in the mirror at the back of the counter it was not that he was remembering what had happened at the farmhe had already dismissed it from his mind as unimportant he was only interested in what lay ahead in whether the baron would decide that he wanted him to dispose of youngblood and drummond personally simon vaughan was thirtythree years of age the son of a regular army colonel whose wife had deserted him when the boy was eight months old from then on life had been a long round of other peoples houses boarding schools and army stations abroad for short periods he had developed into a handsome smiling boy strangely lacking in any kind of emotional response to life but pleasant and popular with everyone after sandhurst he was commissioned into the parachute regiment and the first rather unpleasant incident had occurred lieutenant vaughans fanatical insistence on discipline and hard training had included the use of pack drill to punish those who failed to meet his standards in spite of the physical collapse of four men and a slashing report from the battalion medical officer he had escaped with only a reprimand in cyprus he had been awarded the military cross for personally killing two eoka members who had holed up in a farmhouse in a village in the troodos and had defied all attempts to get them out he had gone in through the roof and had shot it out at close quarters in a manner which had certainly left no doubts about his personal courage although the discovery that the two insurgents had only one gun between them had left uneasy doubts in some quarters these were finally confirmed when vaughan by then a captain was once again in action this time in the radfan mountains of southern arabia playing a savage game of hideandseek with dissident yemeni tribesmen in an effort to extract information from a bedouin vaughan had pegged him out in the sun and employed methods more popular amongst the tribesmen themselves than the british the man had died vaughan had been relieved of his command and quietly retired to avoid any scandal his father acting on the advice of the army medical authorities had persuaded him to enter a private institution for rest and treatment but after two weeks vaughan walked out disappearing off the face of the earth as far as his family was concerned the psychiatrists had experienced little difficulty in making their diagnosis simon vaughan was a psychopatha mental cripple a man who was incapable of any ordinary emotion who lived outside any moral frame of reference whatsoever the taking of human life affected him no more than would the crushing of an ant underfoot by any average human being he was the perfect weapona blunt instrument with a brilliant and incisive mind and the work he engaged in for his present employer suited his talents admirably a middleaged woman came into the cafe ordered a coffee and made for the phone box vaughan beat her to it removing his hat and giving her his most charming smile would you mind awfully if i asked you to hang on for a minute or two im expecting a call the woman smiled her heart fluttering unaccountably and put a hand to her hair not at all so kind vaughan was still smiling at her through the glass when the phone rang and he picked it up instantly hello sweetie whats the good word carry on to bampton and ensure that the merchandise is forwarded to our contact in gloucester give him a ring and tell him what to expect the full treatment absolutely and simon he doesnt want you to get involved personally unless it becomes absolutely necessary if the occasion calls for it then you have a free hand but for the moment simply keep an eye on things and report progress will do sweetie he came out of the phone box and smiled cheerfully at the middleaged woman terribly sorry if ive held you up you must allow me to put your coffee on my check she blushed like a young girl that isnt necessaryreally it isnt oh but i insist he left a generous tip and went out whistling softly and the woman sighed and said to the girl behind the counter it isnt often you meet young men with manners like that these days the girl nodded still hes a real gentleman isnt he anyone can see that outside vaughan gunned the motor of the spitfire and drove rapidly away the needle on the speedometer of the old cattle truck obstinately refused to move past thirtyfive and it was coming up half past three when they approached bampton chavasse tapped youngblood on the shoulder and pointed to where molly stood beside the old ford in a layby and youngblood drew in beside her it was raining hard but there was colour in her cheeks and she seemed cheerful and excited when he dropped down to join her how did it go kid fine she said no trouble at all he turned to chavasse who came round the front of the truck what was that address again alma cottage could be anywhere truemolly had better go in on her own we dont want to make ourselves too conspicuous youngblood nodded took out crowthers wallet and extracted five pounds you must be running low on petrol fill her right up while youre at it and get me some cigarettes and a newspaper if you can she drove away quickly into the heavy rain and the two men climbed back into the cab of the cattle truck no road blocks so far thats one good thing youngblood said chavasse shrugged were more than two hundred miles away from fridaythorpe now they arent looking for us herenot yet anyway then there was no need to trail along in this old crate youngblood said we could have ditched the girl and used the ford chavasse managed to restrain his anger with difficulty maybe youd prefer to wander round bampton showing your face all over the place while you try to find alma cottage he said not me if we arent spread across page one by now then we ought to be he shook his head shes earning her keep as far as im concerned maybe youre right at that youngblood said grudgingly you can put money on it chavasse sprawled back in the passenger seat smoked one of his last cigarettes and went over things in his mind so far so good crowthers treachery to his employersthe fact that he had followed clients through to the bampton addresshad been a major stroke of luck without it they wouldnt have stood a chance and the whole business the long weary months in prison would have been all for nothing but what happened now was even more important he wondered just how much rosa hartman the blind woman crowther had mentioned had to tell them possibly very little the ford appeared round a bend in the road and drew in beside them when molly got out she was carrying a carton of cigarettes and a newspaper alma cottage is on this side of the village she said ive just driven past it theres a narrow lane on the right hand side of the road its about two hundred yards beyond the bend the cottage is almost halfway along its very pretty youngblood opened the newspaper and his face seemed to jump out to meet him it wasnt a prison photo but one taken at the time of his trial on the steps of the courthouse and he smiled out at the crowd one hand raised in a careless wave on the evidence of that photo alone thousands of ordinary people throughout the country had thought him hard done by just as today they must be hoping in their hearts that he would escape not bad eh youngblood said unable to keep an edge of pride out of his voice were making the bastards sit up and take notice it was still there the old need for notoriety at any price the same subconscious urge towards self destruction but chavasse said nothing beneath youngbloods picture there was one of himself but much smaller youngblood chuckled theyve almost missed you out drum it doesnt even look like you chavasse shook his head you can have all the publicity you want harry as far as im concerned i wont be happy till were both a threeline story at the end of column eight on page twelve and that wont be for a week at least these newspaper boys know a good story when they see one youngblood folded the paper and tossed it into the cab of the cattle truck anyway lets get moving ive been thinking about that chavasse said we could run into troubleno way of telling silly for both of us to go fair enough youngblood grinned and put an arm around the girl ill stay here and look after molly suits me chavasse said calmly if im not back in an hour youd better come looking if im still here youngblood said sardonically chavasse nodded come to think of it that does seem to be a distinct possibility under the circumstances ill have half the bank rolljust in case i have to fend for myself youngblood hesitated perceptibly and then produced crowthers wallet why not he counted out twentyfive pounds and gave it to chavasse together with a handful of loose change and how do i know you wont decide to take off on your own you dont chavasse said and he turned and walked away quickly through the heavy rain youngblood looked down at the girl who gazed up at him shyly her face was wet with the rain the eyes shining strangely enough she didnt look half bad and he slipped his arm around her waist and squeezed gently come on kid we could have a long wait might as well get into the back of the truck and make ourselves comfortable all right harry she moved ahead of him and when he helped her up over the tailboard his hands were shaking with excitement the cottage stood well back from the lane an old greystone building halfcovered by ivy the long narrow garden was wet with rain the only flowers a few early daffodils and he went along the flagged path to the porch a brass plate at one side of the door said madame rosa hartmanconsultations by appointment only chavasse knocked there was a sudden patter of feet inside like wind through dry leaves a low growl and then silence after a while he heard the tapping of a stick the door swung open and a woman looked out at him she was at lesat seventy her hair drawn back from a yellowing parchment face in an oldfashioned bun she wore a tweed suit with a skirt which almost reached her ankles and carried an ebony cane in her left hand her right hand had a secure grip on the collar of one of the most superb dogs chavasse had ever seen in his lifea black and tan dobermann a growl started deep down in its throat like distant thunder and she jerked hard on the collar be quiet karl yes who is it she had spoken with a slight austrian accent and as she leaned forward he got a clear look at the cloudy opalescent eyes i was wondering if you could spare me a few moments of your time you wish to consult me professionally thats right i only take clients by appointment i have to be very careful the law is most strict in these matters im only passing through he said id really be most obliged you were very highly recommended i see she appeared to hesitate your name is of no importance he said only my destination and what would that be babylon there was a moment of stillness and then she moved back slightly i think youd better come in young man the hall was oak panelled and very pleasant with hyacinths growing in a bowl on a polished table that stood before a long gilt mirror she closed the door releasing her hold on the dobermann and the dog moved to chavasses side this way she said and walked to a door at the other end of the hall the room was obviously a study with books lining the walls but a cheerful fire burned in an adam grate and through the diamond paned window he glimpsed trees through the rain and a river beyond the woman sat on the other side of a small round table and indicated the vacant chair opposite chavasse took it and the dobermann subsided on the floor its eyes fixed on his unwinkingly who are you young man rosa hartman said does that matter she shrugged perhaps not give me your hand chavasse was momentarily bewildered might i ask why for me it is always necessary i am clairvoyant surely you were aware of that he took her hand holding it lightly it was cool and flaccid making him remember for no accountable reason his breton grandmother clean linen sheets rosemary and lavender and then she tightened her grip and he was aware of a sudden tingle as from a minor electric shock the strange thing was that suddenly her eyes widened and she reached out and ran the fingers of her free hand lightly over his face is anything wrong he asked she shook her head still frowning i expected something a little different thats all she held his hand a moment longer and then released it who sent you here does that matter no you have the password but i was not expecting you then you cant help she spread her hands in a vaguely continental gesture no arrangements have been made to take you to the next stage there is no transport ready i have transport i seeyou are alone he hesitated yes the strange creamy eyes seemed to gaze through him and beyond so that he knew instantly that she was aware that he had lied you can help me then yesyes i think so at least i can show you where to go whether that will give you what you are looking for is something else again it was as if in some strange way she was trying to warn him and he smiled ill take my chances then go to the desk behind you and open the top right hand drawer beneath the pigeon holes you will find several copies of the same visiting card take one i should add that i do not know what is on the card nor do i wish to know chavasse got up and the dog stirred uneasily he ignored it walked to the desk and opened the drawer she had indicated the visiting card was edged in black and carried the legend long barrow crematorium and house of resthugo pentecostdirector in neat gothic script the phone number was phenge now please go young man rosa hartman said chavasse paused frowning the card between his fingers there was something wrong heresomething very wrong and then the dog stood up and growled softly chavasse took a cautious step backwards if there was one dog on earth capable of killing a man it was a dobermann pincher once launched on target only a machine gun would stop it you can let yourself out she said karl will see you to the door the dobermann moved forward at once as if it understood every word she said and chavasse took the hint id like to thank you madam hartman youve been of very real assistance to me that remains to be seen young man she said calmly now go there was a public telephone box at the end of the lane and he went inside and dialled bureau headquarters in london quickly he was through within a matter of seconds and asked for mallory a moment later janet frazers voice sounded on the line im afraid mr mallory isnt available this is his secretary speaking can i help janetpaul here there was a sudden sharp intake of breath at the other end where is he foreign officea nato intelligence conference where are you shrewsbury and hot on the trail ever heard of a place called phenge no but i can soon look it up for you she was back within a couple of minutes just outside gloucester thats where were making for now the whole things going perfectly so far from now on i must have mallory standing by next time i ring it could be to give him the news hes been waiting for and ill probably only have seconds ill tell him good girl ill have to be off look after yourself dont worry about me ill challenge the gods and make a date with you for next wednesday well do a show and go on to the saddle room afterwards ill look forward to that he dropped the receiver and hurried along the road through the heavy rain when he reached the layby the girl was sitting in the van and youngblood was standing by the truck smoking he moved to meet chavasse quickly what happened nothing much she gave me this card youngblood read it and looked up quickly was she on the level how in the hell would i know then we could be walking into trouble naturally youngblood nodded thoughtfully on the other hand theyre not going to scream for a copper are they thats the last thing theyll want to do exactly chavasse said which makes it a nice private fight there was an old aa book in the ford and youngblood leafed through it quickly phenge is just outside gloucester he announced thats about seventyfive miles we could be there in a couple of hours if we used the ford just what i was thinking chavasse said i noticed a gate barring a cart track into a wood a little way back if we ran the truck in there it could stand for a day or two before anyone discovered it especially in this weather fine youngblood said ill handle this you follow on in the ford he was suddenly like a kid on an outing cheerful and smiling as he clambered up into the truck and drove away hes certainly pleased with life isnt he chavasse said as he slid behind the wheel of the ford the girl blushed looking for a moment almost pretty and he was suddenly reminded of an old breton saying love makes even an ugly woman beautiful my god as if this business wasnt complicated enough he sighed heavily as he released the handbrake and drove away as the front door closed behind chavasse simon vaughan stepped from behind the floor length velvet curtain at the window and came towards the table glad you were sensible old girl i think the whole thing went off very well dont you that depends entirely on your point of view he was lying of courseabout being on his own i mean that was quite obvious i suppose youngblood was waiting at the end of the lane to see what happened do you mind if i use the phone you used me how can i stop you using my phone now dont be like that he dialled a number long distance on std and cut in the moment he heard a voice at the other end hugo just to confirm your two packages are on the way yes the full treatment ill see you later he put down the telephone took out his gloves and pulled them on i must be off ill be seeing you rosa the dobermann brushed past him like a dark shadow and nuzzled her hand she shook her head i dont think so now dont be silly he said youve been living here on a false passport since on a false identity which is even worse a word in the right quarter you mistake me she said it isnt that ive grown brave all of a sudden im too old for the kind of courage that would take i simply meant that you wouldnt be seeing me again he was obviously curious may i ask why because you are going to die she said simply he stared at her that slight fixed smile firmly in place you really mean that dont you i have another kind of sight mr smith or whatever your name is death has already marked you out i can feel it and he believed her that was the strange thing she knew quite suddenly that he believed her completely and a shiver ran down her spine as he started to laugh youre bad luck old woman why shouldnt i send you on before me he produced the spring blade knife with which he had murdered crowther and the blade jumped out of his fist with an audible click the dobermann growled the hair lifting on its neck and she patted it soothingly because karl would kill you first proving your prediction in the process what an admirable pet vaughan chuckled as he folded the knife and slipped it back into his pocket no rosa we mustnt make it too easy for you death must find meill not go looking for him weve met before he knows my face she heard him go along the corridor outside whistling tunelessly to himself and the door banged somewhere a small trapped wind circled the room looking for a way out then died in a corner ashes to ashes it was very quiet in the embalming room and hugo pentecost worked alone his rubber apron smeared with blood there was no need for him to engage in the more practical work of the establishment but he liked to keep his hand in and in any case there was always a certain pleasure to be derived from a job well done the cadaver on which he was engaged was that of a young woman and he was in the process of withdrawing her viscera it was usual to wear rubber gloves but pentecost never could preferring the additional sensitivity to be found in bare hands he had successfully removed the contents of the abdomen and was now on the throat whistling softly his arms dappled with blood up to the elbows the door opened behind him and a tall gaunt man with sunken cheeks and dull eyes came in like pentecost he wore a heavy rubber apron anything i can do mr pentecost im all through here for tonight george pentecost said her cranium will have to wait till tomorrow ive got rather a lot of paperwork to get through help me put her in the tank will you he hosed the body down quickly flushing away the blood and they lifted her between them into a large glass tank of formaldehyde the body slid under the surface with a soft splash and turned over several times before settling a foot or so from the bottom the long hair fanning out in a most lifelike manner a shame isnt it mr pentecost george said she was really beautiful beautiful or ugly young or old this is what they all come down to in the end george pentecost said cheerfully has everyone else gone yes sir no need for you to hang around as i said ill be here for quite some time ill go then if thats all right with you mr pentecost i did promise to take my wife out for a meal try the golden dragon on michener street pentecost advised they do a really excellent chow mein well thank you sir i think we will george withdrew and pentecost went to the sink and washed the blood from his arms he removed his rubber apron went into the private bathroom at the other end of the embalming room stripped and showered the warm water made him feel pleasantly relaxed and afterwards he stood in front of the mirror humming softly as he changed into a soft white shirt black tie and a beautifully tailored suit in dark worsted with his snow white hair and gold rimmed spectacles he looked remarkably as one might have expected the director of long barrow crematorium and house of rest to look certainly there was no resemblance to harry marks the second rate confidence man who had served three terms of imprisonment as a young man before learning the facts of life things were very different now and he went through the embalming room and moved along the corridor his feet silent on the thick carpets an indefinable aura of dignity pervaded the whole establishment there was no question of that there was polished wood and brass everywhere and flowers and cut glass winking in the soft light from the shaded lamps which was as it should be this was after all the last earthly resting place for so many people strange that its fortunes should have been founded on murder morally at least although a court of law would probably have found that there was no case to answer poor alice tisdale on the other hand might have thought otherwise a lonely old widow of seventy with a pension and ps in the bank she had been captivated by the considerate stranger who had offered her his umbrella one rainy morning on the front at brighton once installed as chauffeur and general handyman at the house in forest hill harry marks had put into operation a programme scientifically designed to break first the old womans spirit and then her health she had died of the combined effects of malnutrition and senile decay leaving faithful harry all she possessed and the two cousins and a nephew who had attempted to contest the will got nowhere but harry marks belonged to another world now there was only hugo pentecost and long barrow had been at least until the arrival of smith the previous year with his quiet cultured voice and distressingly accurate knowledge of harry marks and his past activities so when the whip cracked he had to jump still one could only be philosophical about these things and life had an interesting habit of turning full circle his chance would come and when it did as he went down the beautiful marble staircase he was thinking of the new incinerator installed only the previous week which could consume a human body in fifteen minutes not like the older ones which took up to an hour and a half and were so inefficient that it was usually necessary to pound up the skull and pelvis afterwards come to think of it smith wasnt particularly big it would probably take no longer than ten minutes in his case as he crossed the foyer at the bottom of the stairs and walked towards his office he became aware of a young woman standing at the reception desk she turned awkwardly im looking for mr pentecost i am he what can i do for you pentecosts habitually soft tones carried a sharper edge than usual the young woman was plainin fact rather ugly he could have forgiven her for that but the shabby coat and poor quality shoes the scarf bound round the head peasantfashion reminded him too much for his peace of mind of a childhood spent amidst the poverty of whitechapel and then there was her voice with its broad northern vowelsan accent which had always offended him it was a relative i really wanted to see you about my great aunt she has just passed on this morning id like to arrange for her to be taken care of you are mr hugo pentecost yes i am he mr pentecost sighed my dear child you have my deepest condolences but i must point out that we offer a very specialised service here and one that is rather expensive searching desperately for an answer to keep the conversation going molly remembered her own mothers recent death and something crowther had mentioned there was an insurance may i ask how much two hundred pounds would that be enough pentecost warmed to her his voice deepening appreciably and he placed an arm around her shoulders im sure we can manage something perhaps you could return in the morning id hoped to settle things tonight is it too late my staff have all gone home im completely alone here he hesitated and greed won but why not it wont take long to settle the essential details come into my office he opened the door and showed her inside it was furnished in excellent if rather sombre taste and he motioned her to a chair and sat down behind his desk he opened a large desk diary produced a black and gold fountain pen just a few detailsyour name crowthermolly crowther address im not sure he looked up with a frown and molly said hesitatingly its on the road that leads to babylon in the silence which followed he sat staring at her his slight polite smile wiped away i see he closed the desk diary opened a drawer and put it away at the same time taking out a revolver with his other hand and slipping it into his pocket an act which completely escaped the girls notice he stood up would you kindly come this way molly got to her feet panic moving inside her she hadnt the slightest idea what to do next and reached out to touch his arm timidly as he brushed past her theres nothing to worry about pentecost said reassuringly well talk upstairs she followed him up the stairway and along the quiet corridor at the top he paused outside a leather covered door opened it and stood back for her the room was a place of shadows and she moved inside uncertainly the first thing she noticed was the heavy smell of formaldehyde and then she saw the body floating in the tank tinged with green in the subdued light hair trailing like seaweed her throat went dry and she turned with a gasp as the door clicked shut pentecost paused beside a bench to open a large mahogany case of surgical instruments he selected a razor sharp scalpel and held it up to the light examining the edge of the blade with a slight frown quite suddenly he reached out grabbing her by the coat pulling her so close that their faces were only an inch or two apart the smoothness the suavity had disappearedeven the voice had changed as he touched the edge of the blade to her skin i dont know what in the hell youre playing at but there should be two of you that i do know wheres your friend quick now or ill slice your throat and molly pushed beyond endurance shoved him away wildly and screamed the ford was parked in the shadows beneath a clump of beech trees a hundred yards up the road from the main gate of the long barrow estate through the trees youngblood could see the dim bulk of the house a light shining in the porch it was the sort of gothic pile built on the high tide of victorian prosperity by some selfmade pillar of empire in the darkness and rain it was impossible to see much of the grounds but from the size of the house they were obviously extensive footsteps approached through the darkness and chavasse joined him according to the notice on the gate the place closes at six what time is it now youngblood checked the luminous dial of his watch sixfifteen someone drove out while i was down there but theres still a car parked in front of the house i could see it from the gate a mercedes from the look of it only the boss man could run a car like that youngblood said that sounds logical chavasse frowned i still feel something stinks about this whole thing maybe youre right youngblood said impatiently but where does that get us weve got to take a chance we dont have any choice perhaps youre right but i always like to hedge my bets chavasse leaned in at the window of the ford and said to the girl you could help a lot here molly like to try anything she said getting out into the rain just tell me what you want me to do walk right up to the front door and ask for hugo pentecost once youre alone with him spin him some yarn tell him your great aunts died and you want to arrange cremation at some point in the conversation introduce the word babylon i dont care how you do it so long as you say the word his reaction should be very interesting what about us youngblood demanded well take a look from a different direction ill try the back of the house you the front or one of the sides chavasse turned to molly well be right behind you molly think you can handle it she nodded and youngblood moved close to her dont worry kid if he lays a finger on you ill break his back they were empty words brash and arrogant and yet she reached out to clutch his arm at once i know i can rely on you harry even youngblood could not avoid what was implicit in that remark and there was a kind of uncertainty in his voice as he patted her on the shoulder awkwardly and replied just yell if you need me and ill come running chavasse could have laughed out loud if the whole thing hadnt been so damned tragic in any case there was no time for tears and he took command with an assumed briskness lets get moving you go straight up the drive to the front door molly and remember what i saidwell be right behind you the rain passed through the trees with a great rushing sound and chavasse and youngblood stood in the shadows by the gate and watched her mount the steps into the porch beyond through a wall of glass lay the deserted foyer and she pushed open the door and moved towards the reception desk chavasse turned to youngblood quickly thats it ill go round to the rear you look after things from this end he disappeared into the trees and youngblood walked toward the house keeping to the shelter of rhododendron bushes that grew in such profusion on one side of the drive he could still see right into the glassfronted entrance hall and suddenly a man came down the stairs darksuited and with striking white hair he stood talking to molly for a moment or two and youngblood crouched in the shadows and waited after a while they moved through a door to the left and he got to his feet and went closer he stood in the shadows at the bottom of the steps and waited behind one of the pillars within a few minutes the door opened and molly and the white haired man came out and went upstairs youngblood stood there a frown on his face wondering what to do next realising for the first time and with a kind of wonder that up until now drummond seemed to have been making all the decisions it was something as prosaic as a sudden increase in the force of the rain that decided him he ran up the steps quickly pushed open the heavy glass door and went inside it was as quiet as the grave and he hesitated for a moment and then crossed the foyer and went up the marble stairs he reached the landing above and had only taken a couple of steps along it when molly screamed youngblood turned instinctively to run and then she screamed again and this time called his name perhaps what happened next was a reflex actionperhaps it was a product of pride or even shame or of the colossal vanity that knowing her good opinion refused to let her find him wanting he flung open the leathercovered door and went in crouching aware only fleetingly of the macabre backdrop to what was taking place pentecost had molly back across the bench a hand at her throat the scalpel raised threateningly as she screamed again youngblood grabbed pentecost by the shoulder swung him round and knocked him backwards across the bench the girl flung herself into his arms her face twisted and ugly with fear and as he patted her reassuringly pentecost scrambled to his feet and pulled the revolver from his pocket the first clear emotion that exploded in youngbloods brain was one of anger at his own stupidity in getting involved and yet in the same moment the overriding instinct for selfpreservation at all costs that was his most outstanding characteristic made him hurl the girl from him and start for the safety of the door pentecost fired once the bullet drilling a neat hole in the thick glass plate of the tank and formaldehyde jetting out in a bright stream youngblood straightened slowly and pentecost said thats better hands on head he gave the girl a quick push forward now start walking both of you id like to say do as youre told and you wont get hurt but my old granny always taught me to tell the truth youngblood moved along the corridor the girl at his side her face white there was no sign of drummond but that was only to be expected he told himself bitterly the sound of that shot was enough to make anyone run for cover they went down the stairs under pentecosts direction and through a large iron barred door at the back of the hall when pentecost switched on the light youngblood found himself standing on a landing at the top of a flight of steps dropping down into what obviously had been a wine cellar at one time now it was painted neatly in white and black there was a complicated switchboard on one wall and several steel oven doors in another youngblood didnt need anyone to draw a picture for him this was undoubtedly the crematorium and in spite of the oppressive warmth he was suddenly cold as he went down the steps that will do nicely pentecost said and he moved round to face them a slight smile on his face you know where you are i dont need any blueprint youngblood said pentecost reached for a switch on the wall there was a sudden roar and when he swung back one of the oven doors they could see flames shooting from all sides of the brickwork through a heavy armoured glass door ten minutes he said thats all it takes and afterwards a handful of ashes the girl gave a sudden desperate sob and half collapsed against youngblood so that he had to catch her pentecost circled them warily and stood with his back to the stairs this is what i call the full treatment he said for most people its a privilege that costs two hundred guineas youre getting it for free behind him chavasse vaulted the rail landing with a soft thud pentecost started to turn but he was too late chavasse moved in fast sliding an arm around the mans neck and wrenched the revolver from his grasp he staggered forward gasping for breath as chavasse released him with a shove and youngblood swung him round his face white with rage and fear you bastard he said you dirty bastard he grabbed pentecost by the shirtfront and hit him again and again in the face with his right solid heavy punches that drove him to his knees chavasse forced his way in between them pushing youngblood back against the wall all rightthats enough we want to talk to him you took your own sweet time getting here didnt you youngblood said furiously chavasse ignored him he heaved pentecost to his feet and shoved him into a chair that stood beside a small deal table pentecost seemed completely dazed and wiped blood from his mouth mechanically with the back of one hand my names drummond and this is harry youngblood chavasse said perhaps youve heard of us pentecost nodded youre the two who escaped from manningham hospital yesterday i read about it in the paper were you expecting us pentecost hesitated and youngblood took a step forward right fist clenched let me speak to him pentecost shrank back defensively one arm raised theres no need for that ill tell you anything you want to know chavasse nodded to youngblood all right give him a chance he repeated the question were you expecting us pentecost shook his head i had a phone call this afternoon so i was expecting somebody i didnt know it was going to be you two who gave you the order he calls himself smith thats all i know about him can you describe him good looking well spoken he shrugged youd think he was uppercrust until he starts to work youngblood frowned across at chavasse mackenzie it certainly sounds like it chavasse looked down at pentecost again are you expecting him he didnt say anything definite youngblood had walked across to inspect the ovens and now he turned do you treat everyone smith sends you like this pentecost shook his head i pass most of them straight through youngblood stared at him in genuine horror most of them he turned to chavasse for christs sake find out what we have to know and lets get out of here this bloke gives me the creeps the people you passed on chavasse said what was their destination pentecost didnt even hesitate i used to leave them at a crossroads five miles from here they were usually picked up by the same van you stayed to watch pentecost nodded i wasnt supposed to know the destination but i took the registration number and got a friend of mine with the right contacts to check it for me the van belongs to a bloke called bragg he runs a small boatyard at a little place on the dorset coast near lulworth called upton magna its about ninety miles from here youngblood turned to chavasse excitedly that sounds promising drum it could be the end of the line chavasse nodded slowly never taking his eyes off pentecosts face quite suddenly he rammed the barrel of the revolver against the mans head and thumbed back the hammer you bloody liar pentecost panicked completely his face turning grey its the truth i swear it on my mothers grave i swear it you never had a mother youngblood said in disgust and he hooked away the chair with a foot so that pentecost fell to the floor he lay there shaking with fear and chavasse looked down at him coldly there was an account to be settled here but that would have to wait until a more appropriate time he slipped the revolver into his pocket and took mollys arm come on lets get out of here what about this youngblood asked stirring pentecost with a foot theres nothing he can do chavasse said if he tries to warn them were on our way theyll want to know how we found put where to head for in the first place how long do you think hed last after that pentecost looked at him over his shoulder eyes widening as the significance of what chavasse had said sank home and youngblood laughed harshly youve got a point there no reason he shouldnt take a rest for a little while though and he kicked pentecost in the side of the head pentecost rolled over struggling for breath aware of the clang of the door closing at the top of the steps and then he plunged into darkness pain exploding in a chain reaction brought him back from darkness as someone slapped him across the face and a voice repeated his name over and over again he opened his eyes and stared up into simon vaughans pale face you do look a mess old man presumably theyve been and gone pentecost pushed himself up on one elbow there were three of them he croaked not two like you said two men and a girl so thats where she got to dear me i have been careless unfortunately i had a little mechanical trouble with the car on the other side of worcester i was delayed for the best part of an hour he helped pentecost to his feet and sat him in a chair when did they leave pentecost looked at his watch and found that it was almost seven oclock it cant be more than half an hour i see you told them where to go did you braggs boatyard upton magna pentecost stared at him uncertain of what to say so confused by the pain in his head that he was unable to think straight and vaughan sighed you shouldnt have done that you know i couldnt help it pentecost said wearily theyd have killed me if i hadnt told them you could probably still catch them im sure i can vaughan said i have two considerable advantages a very fast car and the fact that i know exactly where im going they on the other hand will have to stick to the backroads and check every signpost and the dorset countryside can be very confusing at night pentecost stirred uneasily as vaughan moved round behind him you know your trouble old man you think youve got brains but you haventjust a certain amount of low cunning i cant say its been a pleasure his clenched right fist rose and descended in a hammer blow that splintered the bone at the base of penetcosts skull he gave a strange choking cry and would have tumbled from the chair if vaughan hadnt held him upright he walked round to the front of the chair quickly dropped to one knee and then straightened pentecost draped across his right shoulder in the firemans lift vaughan crossed to the oven pentecost had turned on and switched it off as the flames died away he opened the glass door and the sevenfoot base plate rolled out smoothly on its castors he dropped pentecost on to it arranging his limbs neatly pushed the plate with its burden back inside and closed the glass door he paused to light a cigarette then pulled the switch pentecosts body seemed to jump out of the darkness as great tongues of flame sprang from the brickword to envelop it his clothing ignited in a second and then incredibly an arm was half raised flaring like a torch and the body moved vaughan watched with interest for a couple of minutes then closed the outer steel door turned the dial up to maximum and went up the stairs quickly a mile the other side of gloucester he pulled up at a phone box and dialled world wide exports in london hello sweetie im afraid things didnt go according to plan at all here our friends are now on their way to dorset thats a great pity what are you going to do about it i think id better handle things personally from now on ill see they get the usual transportation but somehow i dont think theyre going to manage to raise a landfall that sounds promising ill pass the message along you do that ill follow in another boat to report personally should be there for breakfast ill let him know the line went dead and vaughan moved out whistling softly got into the spitfire and drove rapidly away three to four rain squalls upton magna was a fishing village which in other times had enjoyed a considerable importance but now its population had dwindled to little more than two hundred and there were few boats in the small harbour braggs boatyard was out on the point beside an old stone jetty a collection of dilapidated clapboard buildings untidy stacks of ageing timber and a line of boats hauled clear of the water that looked as if they never expected to sail again it was just after half past nine when vaughan entered the village and drove along the main street there was a small whitewashed public house about half way along with a car park behind he left the spitfire there well out of sight in the shadows and went the rest of the way on foot there was a light at the window on the right of the front door of the house directly underneath the faded board sign that carried the legend george braggboatbuilderyachts for hire he went up the steps to the rickety porch and peered in through the window the room was half office half living quarters and hopelessly cluttered and untidy beyond the wooden reception desk beside the entrance george bragg was reading a newspaper at a table which seemed to be covered with a weeks accumulation of dirty dishes he was well into his sixties a great bear of a man with a grizzled untidy beard he got to his feet and to vaughans surprise reached for a crutch he picked up an enamel mug and hobbled to the coffee pot on the stove his right foot dragging awkwardly in a plaster cast vaughan pushed open the door and went inside bragg turned quickly in surprise still holding the mug in one hand and the coffee pot in the other i wasnt expecting you mr smith what happened to the foot vaughan said bragg shrugged bloody silly really tripped and fell over a pile of scrap on my way through the yard the other night tanked up to the eyeballs as usual no doubt vaughan said how bad is it ive broken a couple of bones good as it happens that suits me very nicely is the pride of man ready for sea as always just like you ordered are you taking her out he was a man stamped with failure it showed clearly in the broken veins on his face the bleary drinksodden eyes but he was desperately eager to please this strange dark young man with the white face who was the one thing which had stood between him and ruin for almost two years not this time vaughan said but some people will be arriving within the next hour at the outside two men and a girl theyll give you the usual password and theyll expect to be passed on bragg looked dubious id like to oblige but im not too sure i could make the trip with this foot of mine as i said before that suits me fine the foot gives you an excuse not to go make it seem even worse than it is one of the men is a small boat expert anywayan expetty officer in mtbs he could probably sail the pride of man round the world if he had to you mean you actually want these people to go out on their own thats right theyll ask you for a route and destination and youll give it to them he smiled they wont get there of course but theres no reason why they shouldnt travel hopefully for a while what about you as far as youre concerned i dont exist im going down to the boat now to arrange things ill come back along the shore just in case they turn up early he produced his wallet took out five ten pound notes and dropped them on the table fifty now and fifty after theyve goneokay bragg scooped up the money and stuffed it into his hip pocket fine by me mr smith ill handle it just the way you said see that you do vaughan said and the door closed behind him bragg hobbled across to a cupboard by the sink opened it and took out a bottle of whiskey there was little more than an inch left in the bottle when he held it up to the light and he cursed softly he swallowed what there was tossed the bottle into a corner and sat down at the table to wait for what was to come vaughan went down the stone steps and jumped for the desk of the pride of man wet with rain in the sickly yellow light of the single lamp at the end of the jetty there was no time to waste and he went straight below peeling off his raincoat as he descended the companionway he opened a locker beneath one of the padded bench seats and took out an aqualung and several other pieces of skindiving equipment which he laid on the centre table he knelt down and reached inside the now empty locker there was a sudden click and the base of the cupboard lifted right out to disclose a secret compartment there were several interesting items inside a sterling submachine gun two automatic rifles several grenades and half a dozen limpet mines in a straw filled box each about the size of a dinner plate they were harmless until activated but it was only the work of a minute or so to prime the fuse on one of them he checked his watch saw that it was just coming up to ten oclock and turned the time switch through four complete revolutions he stripped to his underpants quickly pulled on the aqualung and went on deck he lowered himself over the side clutching the mine to his chest with one hand paused to adjust the flow of air from his aqualung and sank beneath the surface the water was bitterly cold but there was no time to worry about that and he worked his way along to the stern of the boat at that depth there was enough diffused light from the lamp on the jetty to enable him to see what he was doing and he chose a spot close to the propeller the limpet mines powerful electromagnets fastening instantly to the steel hull he smiled through the visor of his mask and surfaced well satisfied as he crossed the deck to the companionway a van turned into the yard and halted by the house as he watched the lights and engine were switched off and he went down to the saloon quickly he replaced the skindiving equipment in the locker dressed hurriedly and went back on deck pulling on his raincoat as he paused in the shadows he heard low voices at the end of the jetty as someone approached and went along the lower boardwalk quickly jumped down to the beach and hurried into the darkness it was quiet and still when chavasse cut the fords engine and they sat there in the darkness of the boatyard rain drumming on the roof of the van well this is it the end of the line with any kind of luck it looks like the last place god made youngblood said and then the front door opened suddenly beside the lighted window and bragg appeared leaning on his crutch whos out there chavasse and youngblood moved forward molly a pace or two behind and they halted in a little group at the bottom of the step were trying to get to babylon chavasse said we heard you might be able to help bragg stared at them for a long moment a frown on his face and then he nodded slowly youd better come in he made hard weather of his passage across to the table and sank into his chair with an audible sigh of relief he wiped sweat from his face with a soiled handkerchief and looked them over curiously i wasnt expecting anyone they usually give a weeks notice were something special chavasse said there wasnt time to let you know well im not sure bragg sounded dubious the boats ready to goalways is but i broke two bones in my foot the other day takes me all my time to get to the door and back never mind make the run to longue pierre longue pierre chavasse said and where would that be about twelve miles southwest of alderney in the channel islands youngblood broke in and grinned as chavasse turned to him in surprise youre forgetting boy the channel was my stamping ground during the war and after it i know it like the back of my hand hes right bragg said it aint much of a place about a mile across with cliffs three or four hundred feet high on one side theres only one possible anchorage thats on the south side of the island theres an old jetty and not much else who lives there dont ask me mister i do what im paid to do which is run people across leave em on the jetty and come right back again theres a house i know that cos ive seen it from the sea but not much else who pays you a fella called smith drops in maybe once in every two or three months but usually he just gives me a ring on the phone he shook his head and looked worried funny i havent heard from him about you people you will youngblood said and youll get paid i promise you what kind of boat is it a motor cruiserthe pride of man thirty footer built by akerboon twin screw steel hull youngblood whistled thats some boat how is she powered penta petrol engine shell do about twentytwo knots at full stretch but not tonight the weathers not too good whats the report wind force three to four with rain squalls and fog in the morning a cakewalk think you can handle her chavasse asked handle her i could sail her across the atlantic if i had to youd have a job mister bragg put in her range is only six hundred including the reserve tank youngblood grinned enough and to spare forpassage to the islands your troubles are over you can stay home and watch your foot i dont know bragg shook his head its mr smiths boat not mine youngblood sized him up quickly taking in the stale whiskey breath the watery eyes he pulled out crowthers wallet selected a five pound note and dropped it on the table i noticed a nice little pub up the street as we came in i bet you could drag that leg of yours up there if you really tried bragg looked down at the note hesitatingly then sighed and stuffed it into his pocket i only hope im doing the right thing he opened a drawer and produced a copy of the channel pilot youd better have this three lights on your way out keep em in line and you cant go wrong youngblood picked up the book and turned to chavasse his face alive with a new kind of light what are we waiting for the door banged behind them rattling the frame and bragg sat there staring into space a frown on his face after a while he sighed put a hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of money he looked at it blankly for a moment then got to his feet and reached for his crutch a drink thats what he neededperhaps two something to make him forget the people he had just met something to shut out the thought of what was going to happen to them out there in the rain and darkness most of all something to make him forget smith he hobbled to the door took down an oilskin and left the pride of man waited at the end of the jetty and youngblood took in her flared raking bow and long sloping deckhouse with a conscious pleasure he was as excited as a schoolboy with a new toy my god i cant wait to get my hands on her chavasse shook his head its too damned easy what is youngblood demanded impatiently the way bragg took everything we said it doesnt make sense i think ill go back and see what hes up to suit yourself youngblood said but im making ready for sea anything over ten minutes and youve had it he meant every word so much was obvious but chavasse didnt waste time in arguing he turned back and ran back along the jetty into the darkness of the boatyard there had certainly been something indefinable in braggs manner which had made him feel uneasy that was true enough for one thing the old mans story had been too pat and he carried about him an aura of unctuous villainy impossible to eradicate but more important than that was the fact that he had to get in touch with the bureau if he was to stand any hope of survival at all once he reached the island and this was his last chance he passed the house silently moved out of the entrance to the yard and paused in the shadows bragg was swinging along the pavement in front of him looking considerably more agile than he had earlier in spite of his crutch he crossed to the little pub and went in and chavasse moved along the street to the telephone box on the corner he dialled his number quickly and was answered almost at once there was a brief moment when jean spoke to him and then graham mallory was on the line paul where are you upton magnaa little fishing port near lulworth now get thiswere about to leave by boat for an island called longue pierre which is twelve miles southwest of alderney in the channel islands i want to know anything you can tell me about the place and i can only spare you three minutes were already hooked into information mallory said keep on talking while theyre checking youll want to pull in a lump of dirt called sam crowther who runs a place called wykehead farm near settle in yorkshire god knows how many hes seen off then theres a woman called rosa hartman she lives at bampton outside shrewsbury im sorry for her but she shouldnt have joined anyone else a man called pentecost who has a place called long barrow house of rest outside gloucester and the old villain ive just been dealing with name of bragg runs a boatyard here mallory cut in on him your information on longue pierre is coming through now the island and the only house on it are owned by the states of guernsey theyve been leased for the past two years to count anton stavru havent i heard of him very probably shady financier always floating big deals that come to grief investigated by fraud squad a few times but hes always managed to get out from under hes managing director of a firm called world wide export is any of this helpful ill not know till i get there ill want some help standing by preferably something that can get in fast like a couple of naval mtbs ill get on to naval intelligence straight away mallory said if you want to reach them by radio use our usual frequency your call sign will be strongarm best of luck ill need it chavasse dropped the receiver into place left the box and hurried back along the street to the boatyard he paused suddenly dropping into the shelter of an old upturned boat as the door opened and vaughan stepped out into the porch he closed the door behind him cutting off the light and came down the steps chavasse recognised him at once and took pentecosts revolver from his pocket and waited vaughan moved past him and paused a match flaring in his cupped hands as he lit a cigarette chavasse stood up behind him surprise surprise he said and drove the butt of the revolver into the back of vaughans skull he caught him before he could fall twisting around bending so that vaughan fell across his right shoulder as the engine of the pride of man shattered the night he half ran through the darkness toward the jetty as he went down the steps youngblood was casting off at the stern and he came forward to help chavasse across the rail wth his burden well ill be damned he said looking down into vaughans unconscious face as he sprawled on the deck our old friend dr mackenzie or smith or whatever his name is chavasse said he was just coming out of braggs place i thought it might be nice to ask him along for the ride stick him in one of the cabins for now youngblood advised we can have words later i wont be happy till were out of here molly can give you a hand chavasse went down the companionway holding vaughan under the armpits and molly took his feet they put him on a bunk in one of the three cabins and chavasse found a length of cord and tied his wrists and ankles securely when he turned from locking the door the girl looked pale and wan as if suddenly everything was too much for her and he put a hand on her shoulder there should be a galley along here somewhere why dont you make us some coffee she brightened a little as if this was something she could at least understand and moved along the passageway chavasse watched her go a frown on his face a lot had happened and so fast that hed had little time to speculate about the outcome of things but what about the girl for whom the events of the past couple of days must have seemed like some dark nightmare what on earth was going to happen to her however things turned out she was in for a whole lot of heartbreak the poor ugly little bitch he turned with a sigh and went up the companionway as the pride of man drifted away from the side of the jetty the wind had increased scattering the rain in silver clouds through the navigation lights and when he went into the wheelhouse harry youngblood turned and grinned at him his head disembodied in the light of the binnacle here we go he said with a grin and boosted power suddenly taking the pride of man round in a long sweeping curve and out through the harbour mouth the masthead started to buck as they met the swell and spray scattered across the windows a couple of points to starboard the red and green navigation lights of a steamer were visible and youngblood reduced speed to ten knots and they pushed on into the dark everything all right chavasse said bloody marvellous there was sheer delight in youngbloods voice this is the life eh with any kind of luck we should have a clear run it was just coming up to midnight when chavasse went below to check on vaughan when he opened the door and switched on the light he was at once conscious of the dark eyes staring at him fixedly how do you feel he asked how do you expect me to feel vaughan said in a surprisingly strong voice the back of my skull crushed in or something very close to it and blood all over my best shirt youre breaking my heart chavasse pulled vaughan into a sitting position and took the mug of coffee that molly handed to him drink this vaughan swallowed then gasped itll never replace tea from the motion i presume were on our way across the channel thats right what time is it round about midnightwhy vaughan started to laugh weakly which means weve passed the point of no return chavasse frowned what in the hell are you talking about its really rather ironic vaughan said you see i knew you were on your way to upton magna because i had words with friend pentecost after youd left and you beat us to it bragg was putting on an act wasnt he im afraid so i stuck a limpet mine to the hull just before ten oclock timed to blow you all to hell in exactly four hours you included to be perfectly honest that wasnt in the plan at all chavasse untied his ankles and pulled him off the bunk up on the deck and be quick about it the pride of man was lifting well over the heavy swell that scattered spray in a great cascading sheet as they moved along the deck to the wheelhouse youngblood turned in surprise as chavasse pushed vaughan in ahead of him whats all this chavasse told him and when he had finished youngblood laughed uncertainly hes trying to pull a fast onehe must be suit yourself vaughan said chavasse shook his head he means it harry youngblood stared at him for a long moment and then throttled down the engine until the boat was making no more than three or four knots and switched to automatic pilot all right so what are we going to do about it chavasse turned to vaughan if its fixed to the hull then you must have used an aqualung and skindiving gear to put it there where is it vaughan shrugged why not youll find it without any trouble anyway in a locker under one of the bench seats in the saloon theres your answer drum youngblood said as long as we can reach it it can be defused sorry to disappoint you and all that but not this baby vaughan said it can only be defused after complete dismantling and you have neither the equipment nor the facilities electromagnetic i suppose chavasse said vaughan nodded and this tub has a steel hull so youll never prise it loose not under the conditions youre faced with try too hard and the damned thing might blow up anyway what type is it getting technical are we but of course i was forgettingyou were a captain in the royal engineers werent you never mind the funny stuff youngblood said savagely just answer him martinet mark and much good may it do you chavasse burst into sudden laughter unable to contain the wave of elation that swept through him and the smile died on vaughans face whats so damned funny you are chavasse said youre a hundred thousand laughs he turned to youngblood if youll stop the engines for about ten minutes harry ill find the aqualung he mentioned and go over the side you mean you can fix it youngblood said incredulously to all intents and purposes but ill explain later just look after baby for me will you and chavasse moved back along the deck and went below it was bitterly cold down there in the dark water as he felt his way along the hull until he located the mine he found the time switch and hung there for a moment testing it with his fingers if vaughan had timed the explosion to take place within four hours then he must have moved the switch through four complete revolutions and the maximum was twelve chavasse turned the switch counting slowly only when it refused to turn any more did he release his hold and drift up to the surface youngblood and molly helped him over the rail and he swore softly as the girl hauled on his left arm and pain coursed through him like fire you all right drum youngblood said anxiously i am now chavasse turned to vaughan who stood by the companionway wrists tied in front of him simple when you know how the martinet is a short term time bomb extensively used by both the army and navy the timing device operates up to a maximum of twelve hours all i had to do was move it on from the time of your choice right round the clock till we reached neutral again you mean youve defused it youngblood demanded to all intents and purposes vaughan sighed and shook his head we learn something new every day what time do we reach longue pierre seventhirty or thereabouts youngblood said why its just that i cant wait to get there old man vaughan said im sure its going to be a barrel of laughs for everyone he turned and disappeared down the companionway whistling cheerfully fog in the morning chavasse came awake to find molly leaning over him her hand on his shoulder he had gone to sleep on one of the bench seats in the saloon and he swung his legs to the floor and took the mug of coffee she offered he swallowed some gratefully thats better what time is it six am my god have i slept that long he went up the companionway his coffee in one hand water slopped over the starboard rail and cold rain lashed his face as he walked along the heaving deck and went into the wheelhouse youngblood turned to look at him briefly how do you feel my arm hurts like hell but i can use it which is something what about you im enjoying myself theres been quite a sea running for an hour or more now likely to get worse before it gets better will it affect our time of arrival if youd like to take the wheel ill have another look at the chart chavasse squeezed past slipping into the pilots seat and youngblood went to the chart table he made one or two calculations and threw down his pencil stretching his arms we could be a little earlier than i thought it all depends on the way the weather goes think you can handle her for a while i dont see why not ill take a breakmaybe molly can find me something to eat afterwards wed better talk things over we still dont know what were getting into maybe its about time we put the squeeze on our friend chavasse nodded well see the door banged and he leaned back in the seat one hand on the wheel and lit a cigarette already the darkness was fading a faint pearly luminosity touching the water and he strained his eyes into the grey waste of morning wondering what lay ahead one thing was certain whatever other difficulties might present themselves in the final analysis his greatest problem was still going to be harry youngblood himself and what to do with him he remembered their first meeting in the cell at fridaythorpe and how it had confirmed the impression he had already gained from a close study of the mans file at bureau headquarters that in spite of the newspaper stories and romanticised magazine features youngblood beneath it all was a brutal and resourceful criminal who would smash down anything or anybody that got in his way and who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted having said that the fact remained that for many weeks they had been comrades of a sort in that strange subworld that is life in any large prison on the other hand if chavasse had not gained possession of smiths gun the night of the break from the hospital and forced the issue youngblood would never have taken him along in spite of the fact that chavasse had saved him from death or at least serious injury on two occasions in the machine shop and then there was molly if shed turned her back at the farm things would have taken their usual course and their journey might have ended at the bottom of crowthers well and yet youngblood had been prepared to ditch her without a qualm until it had become obvious that she might still be useful even at the end and in spite of the fact that chavasse had pulled him out of trouble again at long barrow youngblood had been prepared to leave in the boat without him he was without a single redeeming feature a selfish egomaniac who had never in his life thought of anyone besides himself plenty of men had spent their early years in an orphanage others had known a hard warhow many had taken harry youngbloods road chavasse sighed heavily and dropped his cigarette to the floor all true every word of it which didnt make it any easier to send him back to gaol for another fifteen yearspossibly even more now he looked back on his own four months inside remembering the filth the squalor the grey faces the long empty days and was suddenly almost physically sick so that he opened a window quickly and drew in great lungfuls of damp salt air the door swung open behind him and youngblood came in grinning hugely rain on his face i havent felt like this for years my god drum i realise what id been missing he took over the wheel and chavasse leaned against the door watching him he knew his stuff there was no question of that and he increased speed racing the dirty weather that threatened in the east the pride of man soared over the waves like a living thing water cascading across the prow in a green curtain and youngblood laughed aloud in a kind of ecstasy chavasse found it impossible not to respond a hell of a change from that cell in fridaythorpe fridaythorpe for a brief moment youngbloods smile was wiped clean ill tell you something drum he said his face all iron id send this tub to the bottom and go with her before theyd get me back there he increased power the pride of man lifting out of the water and chavasse feeling unaccountably sad turned and went out on deck he had a bacon sandwich and more coffee with molly and then went to check on vaughan he was lying on his bunk face to the wall and when he turned looked paler than ever whats wrong with you chavasse demanded hauling him into a sitting position some people have the stomach for this kind of life old manothers havent they said nelson was sick every time he put to sea or didnt you know chavasse pulled him off the bunk pushed him along the passage way to the saloon and shoved him down into a chair how about some coffee now that i wouldnt mind chavasse nodded and molly filled one of the enamel mugs and pushed it across the table vaughan lifted it in both hands his wrists still tied i dont know how long it will stay down he said but we can but try chavasse lit a cigarette and put it between vaughans lips and now we talk do we old man thats nice it wont be if you persist in being awkward who are we going to find on longue pierrethe baron god help you if you do what kind of a setup does he have there vaughan smiled pleasantly now you really cant expect me to answer that a breach of faith chavasse sighed you know youre putting me in a very awkward position i may even have to send youngblood down to talk to you and i wouldnt like that he doesnt worry me in the slightest he should do i think youre forgetting an important item im just an amateur compared to youngblood he knows that if they get their hands on him he goes back inside for fifteen years and theyll watch him every minute of the time hell never get out again so what hed cut your throat if he thought it was necessary to prevent that happening vaughan showed not the slightest sign of fear but he stopped smiling and frowned slightly he was in fact remembering rosa hartmans prediction and he smiled again nodding to himself no he would not make it easy for her if death was to come then it must find himhe would not go looking for it all right he said calmly the baron may be on the island or he may noti honestly dont know he doesnt come in by boat usually he has a private helicopter owned by world wide exports of london vaughans eyes widened in amazement then narrowed i say you do know a lot dont you now that is interesting ill be perfectly honest old man and say that i never was very happy about you from the start how big a staff does stavru keep up at the house vaughan shrugged it depends most of the time theres just a caretakera trusted old retainer called gledik the baronor should i say the countis very feudal you know always going on about happy days in dear old hungary loathes the commies but isnt above doing business with them when he has some expensive merchandise to sell just like alicecuriouser and curiouser vaughans eyes flared with a strange green light ive a nasty feeling weve all been had where youre concerned old man isnt that a shame chavasse killed the conversation stone dead at that point by hauling vaughan to his feet running him back along the passageway and locking him in his cabin when he returned to the saloon molly was still sitting at the table it was obvious that the conversation had been completely meaningless to her and he paused and tilted her chin her eyes had dropped back into their sockets and were red and angry from lack of sleep her skin was blotched and unsightly and she seemed completely exhausted i dont like him paul she said he frightens me he cant harm younot now chavasse patted her shoulder why not lie down for a while you look all in she nodded wearily and followed him obediently like a small child when he took her into one of the cabins she lay on a bunk and he covered her with a blanket and left when he went up to deck it was still raining hard but the sea was a lot calmer youngbloods face was lined with fatigue in the grey light of morning but his smile was as indefatigable as ever weve just raised alderney he said and pointed to a greygreen smudge on the horizon how long half an hour im giving her full power now things are calmer the only thing we have to worry about is the fog is it likely to be bad cant say but its coming in fast on the other hand it does give us some kind of cover for the approach ive just been having words with our friend below get anything out of him apparently the baron comes in and out by helicopter is he there now says he doesnt know youngblood shook his head i cant believe that maybe wed better try a little persuasion youd be wasting your time i get a distinct impression that hes the type which doesnt crack easily and i think he was telling the truth most of the time theres just a caretaker in residence up at the house then what do we do youngblood said ive had a good look at the chart and bragg was right the jetty is the only possible anchorage if we go in there we could run slap into trouble ive been thinking about that and ive had an idea of sorts lets have another look at the chart youngblood switched to automatic pilot and joined him youre wasting your time if youre hoping to find somewhere else we can land ive been over that chart a dozen times chavasse nodded i had something different in mind the house is in a hollow on the western slope if we approached from the east where the highest cliffs are we wouldnt be seen especially in the fog youngblood shook his head there isnt any possible anchorage on that side maybe not but it looks to me as if there are plenty of places where a small boat could land youngblood looked dubious it sounds all right in theory but i know these waters its more than probable that a small boat couldnt survive in the kind of surf youll find at the bottom of those cliffs it could well be that we just dont have any choice chavasse shrugged well just have to wait and see they crept in towards the island through a grey shroud that seemed to go on forever and somewhere the surf boomed angrily like distant thunder the pride of man was making no more than two or three knots her engine muted and youngblood stood at the wheel straining anxiously into the fog feeling for the cross currents that would tell him he was getting close chavasse was in the prow and suddenly he pointed dead ahead and called excitedly in the same moment the wind which had been strengthening noticeably for at least half an hour tore a great hole in the curtain giving a breathtaking view of the cliffs dead ahead they were perhaps two hundred yards away the tops completely shrouded in grey thousands of sea birds nesting on their rocky ledges and beneath them the surf pounded in across jagged rocks chavasse moved back to the wheelhouse as they went closer what do you think youngblood shook his head it doesnt look too good to me he approached to within fifty yards of the base of the cliffs and turned as the waves started to pull them in chavasse pointed to a horseshoe amongst the rocks and the strip of shingle beyond it that looks something like youngblood shook his head i still say the dinghy wouldnt last five minutes in that surf what if i wore the aqualung youngblood turned quickly now youre talking id give you a better than even chance always remembering that arm of yours well you cant go thats obvious chavasse said it looks as if im elected he went below opened the locker in the saloon and took out the skindiving equipment whatever else happened it was going to be cold out theredamned cold and he stripped quickly and pulled on the close fitting diving suit in black rubber he slipped pentecosts revolver into one of the pockets zipped it up and went back on deck carrying the aqualung youngblood stopped engines and joined him hurriedly lets make it quick the current could have us on those rocks before you know it give me an hour chavasse said as they unshipped the dinghy from its davits then come back for a look if i stay back on the shingle that means i want you to sail round to the jetty if i stand in the surf then the whole think stinks youd better let me have your watch youngblood unstrapped it and handed it across what will you do then ill try to swim back to the boat youngblood laughed harshly rather you than me lets have her over then the dinghy was constructed of fibreglass and was therefore extremely light they put her over the stern between them and youngblood held on to the line while chavasse struggled into the straps of his aqualung he pulled the visor down over his face adjusted the air flow and went over the side youngblood waved the line went slack and as he reached for the oars the current jerked him away the wind was freshening lifting the waves into whitecaps and as he reached for the oars the dinghy heeled and water poured in over the gunnl he adjusted his weight and started to row the engines coughed into life and the pride of man started to move away but he had no time to watch its progress he glanced over his shoulder and through the curtain of spray the cliffs loomed larger the surf boiling in over ragged dangerous looking rocks there was a hollow drumming on the hull of the dinghy and it spun round several times grazing a black razor edge that would undoubteldy have split it neatly in half it was no goodhis left arm simply didnt have the strength to haul on that oar under such extreme conditions he tried desperately to control the dinghy with just the right hand but it was no good the oar was snatched away by a sudden fierce eddy and he grasped the sides and waited the cliffs were very close now the sea breaking over great ledges of rock in a dirty white foam and behind him a great heaving swell rolled in sweeping the dinghy before it he went over the stern water closing over his head for only a moment or so he surfaced in time to see the dinghy smashed down against the first line of rocks another wave lifted it high into the air then it bounced across the reef twice and disintegrated there was a great smooth funnel in the rocks to the right and as another great swell lifted behind him he dived and started to swim towards it his webbed feet driving him through the water there was turbulence all around him thousands of white bubbles and a great curtain of sand and grit and then he was lifted up as if by a giant hand he surfaced aware of the smooth black sides of the funnel on either side of him and suddenly found himself lying arms outstretched sprawled across a great moving bank of sand and shingle a giant hand seemed to be trying to pull him back and he crawled forward on hands and knees again the sea washed over him in a green curtain and as it receded he staggered to his feet and stumbled forward a moment later he was safe on the strip of beach at the foot of the cliffs the pride of man on automatic pilot cruised at a steady three knots four hundred yards out from the cliffs and youngblood stood at the rail watching chavasse through a pair of binoculars he had found in the wheelhouse the tiny black figure on the beach waved once and then the curtain of mist dropped into place hiding him from view youngblood lowered the binoculars so far so good he said softly and now we wait he turned from the rail and went down the companionway to the saloon there was no sign of molly but when he called her name she answered from the galley and he found her at the stove making more coffee i thought you were trying to get some sleep he said she shook her head i just couldntive got a splitting headache pauls gone ashore to see how the land lies he told her so well be just cruising around for the next hour till we hear from him bring me up some coffee when its ready he moved back along the passageway and paused as a thunderous kicking commenced on one of the cabin doors and vaughan called to him i say old man have you got a moment youngblood unlocked the door what do you want he said ungraciously wheres drummond gone ashore has he indeed now that was enterprising of him on the other hand he seems a very resourceful sort of chap altogether our mr drummond i must say id love to know how he found out who the baron is youngblood frowned what in the hell are you talking about count anton stavruthe baron vaughan said drummond seemed to know all about him when we were having words half an hour or so ago youngblood grabbed him by the front of his jacket pulled him into the passageway and pushed him along to the saloon he flung him down into a chair and stood over him threateningly now lets get this clear you say drummond told you he knows the baron was this bloke stavru thats right old man he even knew about our london frontworld wide exports to be perfectly honest he seemed remarkably well informed to me so it would seem youngblood said his face dark vaughan registered innocent surprise dont tell me he didnt take you into his confidence youngblood didnt seem to hear him his face had gone white and a vein bulged in his forehead just above one eye he turned suddenly plunged towards the companionway and went up on deck vaughan started to laugh his bound hands stretched out before him across the table and molly who had just come in from the galley stood staring at him a mug of coffee in one hand now i call that very very funny indeed he looked at her enquiringly dont you think so she eased past him on the other side of the table a look of fear on her face and went up the companionway quickly vaughans smile disappeared and he was on his feet in an instant and moving towards the galley he went straight to the cutlery drawer next to the sink opened it and searched for the bread knife he closed the drawer on the handle so that the blade stood up and set to work on the rope that linked his wrists he was free within a couple of minutes and hurried back into the saloon he dropped to one knee opened the locker beneath the bench seat and felt for the secret catch he had made his choice in advance and stood up the sterling submachine gun in his hands he checked the action quickly then went up the companionway to the deck youngblood was at the rail binoculars raised as he searched for chavasse through the mist and molly stood at his left side holding his mug of coffee can you see him she said youngblood nodded hes still on the beach must be looking for a way up there was an audible click behind them as vaughan cocked the sterling and youngblood swung around nice and easy vaughan said and dont try anything silly and heroic theres a good chap the girl gave a tiny cry of alarm and dropped the mug of coffee on the deck clutching at youngbloods sleeve he pushed her away violently get off me you stupid bitch now then old man dont lose your temper just walk along to the wheelhouse and get this tub moving and where are we supposed to be going youngblood said straight into harbour as fast as we can i want to be on hand when your friend drummond turns up at the house just to see the look on his face when he finds us all waiting for him chavasse shrugged off the aqualung stripped the great rubber fins from his feet and left them in a crevasse in the rocks which seemed to be well out of reach of the sea the cliffs towered above him into the mist black and green glistening with rain and spray certainly completely unclimbable at this point and he started to work his way along the narrow strip of beach clambering over boulders in one place wading waistdeep hanging on to the rocks for dear life as the sea threatened to pull him out again he spent at least twenty minutes in this way and at last found a section where several great fissures and gullies presented an easy if strenuous route to the top he climbed steadily pausing for a breather halfway up turning to look out to sea the mist seemed to have thickened again and he could see no sign of the pride of man and he turned and started to climb the sound of the sea faded behind him but in spite of the coldness of the rain and wind he sweated heavily in the close fitting rubber suit and the pain in his left arm was constant and nagging refusing to go away even when he didnt use it blood trickled from beneath the rubber cuff of the sleeve in a thin stream indicating the probability that some of the stitches had burst but there was nothing he could do about that now he scrambled over the edge a moment or two later and lay face down in the wet grass for a while finally he sat up and looked at youngbloods watch it was almost half past eightlater than he had imagined and he got to his feet and started up the gentle turf slope he reached the top and crouched suddenly below him was a large natural crater about fifty feet deep and two hundred across and a helicopter was parked squarely in the centre the other side of the crater was fringed by a line of pine trees but there was no sign of the house which from what he recalled of the map was lower down the slope towards the other side of the island he went down into the crater and ran toward the helicopter quickly it stood there waiting for him strangely alien in that grey world of mist and rain and he clambered up the side ladder and unscrewed the engine canopy quickly there were several things he could have done to put the machine out of action without damaging the engine but he had no time for such niceties he selected a large and jagged stone clambered back up the ladder and proceeded to smash as much as he would within the space of thirty seconds paying particular attentin to the fuel supply as the fumes of the high octane petroleum drifted into the damp air he dropped to the ground and moved across to the shelter of the trees the house stood in another hollow a couple of hundred yards down the slope on the other side of the trees but he was unable to see the inlet from that position there was a path over to the left and he cut across to join it and started to run down towards the house he crouched beside a bush on the edge of the wood the revolver in his hand and looked across a neglected lawn at the rear of the house towards a stone terrace and french windows one of them stood slightly ajar the end of a red velvet curtain billowing out into the rain he crossed to the house keeping to the line of a hedge for shelter and moved to the french windows the curtains were completely drawn so that it was impossible to see inside he hesitated for only a moment then pulled the curtain back and stepped in the room seemed to be in complete darkness which was only an illusion of course but before his eyes had a chance to become accustomed to the change of light something hard was rammed against the side of his head a familiar voice said ill take that old man and the revolver was plucked from his grasp a light was snapped on in the same moment there were five other people in the room besides himself vaughan who stood on the right a sterling submachine gun in his hands and youngblood and molly over by the door guarded by a greyhaired ageing man whose brown face was a patchwork of wrinkles the man who got up from the easy chair by the empty fireplace to come forward was one of medium height and wore a thighlength hunting jacket with a fur collar a green tyrolean hat slanted across a surprisingly amiable face he was obviously somewhere in his sixties and carried himself with the assurance of the natural aristocrat come in mr drummond or should i say mr chavasse weve been waiting for you he laughed lightly welcome to babylon alas babylon youngblood pushed forward bewilderment on his face what is all this you might well look puzzled mr youngblood stavru said allow me to enlighten you your friend drummond is in reality an agent of the special branch at scotland yard his name is chavassepaul chavasseand he was apparently put into fridaythorpe gaol to keep an eye on you it would seem your bid for freedom was anticipated a copper youngblood said him he laughed incredulously not in a thousand years i can smell one upwind a mile away if hes a copper im a monkeys uncle so stavru turned to chavasse eyes narrowed i value your expert opinion it would seem mr chavasse may well be an agent of another sort he nodded to the grey haired man take mr youngblood and the young lady down to the cellar gledik then i want you to go and make the helicopter ready for flight we leave in thirty minutes now look here youngblood started but gledik simply stepped back and took careful aim with the luger he was holding youll have to excuse gledik stavru said a session with the avo in budapest involved him in the loss of his tongue but hes extraordinarily efficient i would do what he says if i were you the door closed behind them and he turned with a smile and produced his cigarette case do have one my dear chap and lets get down to business you and i are how would you put it professionals we know the score chavasse accepted the cigarette and a light depends on how you look at it what are youmi or chavasse didnt reply and stavrus eyebrows raised fractionally something special eh a compliment i must say i like the fake robbery touch to get you into prison highly ingenious actually it was the real thing chavasse said deciding for the moment to keep things on the same level we felt that only the best was good enough i must say youve got quite an organisation as the advertising types are so fond of saying we try to give our customers a service some service an early grave for the suckers like george saxton and ben hoffa who were mug enough to fall for the glossy brochure and allowed their cash to pass over in advance strange as it may seem mr chavasse there is no one quite as gullible as your professional criminal their capacity for swallowing any kind of a tall story hook line and sinker never ceases to amaze me and the onesthe ones you pass on who ended up east of the iron curtain they must have been gold on the hoof very much so i assure you in fact it occurs to me that certain parties on that side of the political fence might be more than interested in bidding for you my friend every man has his price in more ways than one chavasse flicked his cigarette out into the rain in the circumstances im sure youll appreciate my understandable curiosity as to how you found out about me stavru crossed to an oak sideboard and poured himself a brandy from a cut glass decanter a very recent discovery i assure you but like a good journalist i never disclose my sources and now you must excuse me i have certain preparations to make before we leave he nodded to vaughan take him down to the others simon then come back here youngblood and the girlwhats going to happen to them chavasse said as vaughan pushed him towards the door they will be well taken care of i assure you stavru turned dismissing him completely and vaughan opened the door dont take it to heart old man they wont feel a thingreally they wont i give you my word the cellar into which vaughan pushed him was in almost total darkness a patch of light showing from a tiny window on the other side which was far too small to be used as an exit as the door closed behind him there was a rustle on the other side of the room and youngblood came forward whos that its mepaul there was a moment of stillness during which chavasse prepared himself for some sudden blow but it never came and when youngblood spoke he sounded strangely subdued those things he said about you upstairsthey were all true thats right youngblood turned away exploding angrily me harry youngblood taken in by a bloody copper chavasse could have pointed out that without his assistance youngbloods journey would have come to an abrupt halt at wykehead farm but he knew that he would be wasting his time if you want to know i couldnt care less about you and your friends and im not a policeman stavru happens to run a nice little sideline in the sale of state secrets and traitors to people who arent on exactly friendly terms with our government the department i work for has one main interestto see that hes stopped which would include making sure that i went back to gaol for fifteen years youngblood said or did you intend to let me go free that kind of decision isnt mine to make my god after all ive done for you youngblood turned away shaking with rage and molly moved out of the darkness to clutch at his arm whats going to happen harry he turned on her angrily shoving her violently from him so that she hit the opposite wall get away from me you stupid little whore she sank on to a bench crying steadily and chavasse lit a cigarette does that make you feel any better why dont you get stuffed youngblood peered out of the window for a moment and turned suddenly what happens now did he give you any idea do i have to draw you a picture maybe i could make a deal youngblood said eagerly with what hes got your diamonds hasnt he what does he want with you youre supposed to be at the bottom of the well back there at wykehead but there must be something youngblood cried and there was an edge of hysteria in his voice chavasse moved past him pulled himself up to the window and looked out at ground level across the courtyard as he watched gledik appeared from the trees and ran across to the house quickly chavasse dropped to the ground and turned with a faint smile i think well see some action soon it came within three or four minutes footsteps hurried along the passageway the door was thrown open and light flooded in as vaughan appeared he had discarded the machine gun and now held a revolver in his right hand strangely enough he seemed rather amused count stavru would like a word with you if you can spare a minute old man he said to chavasse and be warnedhes very annoyed chavasse glanced at his watch it was almost nine and he shrugged my time is your time ive certainly nothing better to do he turned to youngblood if im not back in fifteen minutes send out the dogs but youngblood failed to respond turning away with an angry exclamation and chavasse sighed and moved out into the passage ahead of vaughan stavru was standing by the fireplace talking to gledik in hungarian and he turned quickly as chavasse and vaughan came in he was like a different man the skin drawn tightly over his cheekbones the eyes cold and hard i understand from gledik that the engine of the helicopter has been damaged beyond repair presumably this was your doing thats right that was very foolish of you i dont think so chavasse walked to the sideboard and calmly poured himself a glass of brandy youre not going anywhere stavru youre finishedall washed up before we left upton magna last night i phoned through to my headquarters in london i told them about longue pierre and they did a quick check and came up with you so now everyones happy by the way i shouldnt waste your time trying to get hold of world wide exports todayi dont think theyll be open for business stavru turned to vaughan you think he is telling the truth very probably which means his friends may come down on us at any time thats right chavasse said smoothly courtesy of the royal navy stavru shrugged the situation is certainly inconvenient but not impossible the pride of man is a very fast boat we can be in french territorial waters within ten minutes of leaving here you can always try chavasse said inventing freely but i think youll find that the french coastguard and police are prepared in advance for just such a move it would seem you have thought of everything stavru walked to the french windows and stood there looking out at the rain suddenly he swung around and there was something close to excitement on his face but perhaps not he said softly and turned to vaughan get youngblood up here simon and quickly theres no time to lose theres no way out you know chavasse said you have a saying do you not mr chavasse desperate situations breed desperate remedies he poured himself another drink and a moment later youngblood was pushed into the room he stood there hands clenching and unclenching nervously a wary expression on his face and stavru moved to meet him mr youngblood i have just discovered some rather unpleasant news mr chavasses wolves could apparently descend on us at any moment thats your hard luck and yoursor do you look forward to your return to your cell at fridaythorpe for the next fifteen years youngbloods face was his answer and stavru laughed gently then we can do business i understand that at one time you were a petty officer on torpedo boats in your royal navy and that after the war you were engaged in the running of contraband across the channel so what you brought the pride of man over from england by night in not very pleasant weather which would seem to indicate your competence could you sail her to portugal he turned to chavasse i should perhaps explain that the boat is registered in liberia it would therefore be completely illegal for even the royal navy to attempt to board her at sea her range is only six hundred youngblood said youd need enough extra juice for another three or four hundred miles just to take care of contingencies there is plenty of petrol on the jetty in twenty gallon drums all rightwhats in it for me your continued freedom and of course your diamonds or their equivalent in swiss francs as a matter of interest i would be setting up a new organisation in tangiers i think we might do very well together dont listen to him harry chavasse said youd never get across the bay of biscay in a boat like that its the wrong time of year who says i wouldnt youngblood smiled recklessly id take that tub to hell rather than go back to fridaythorpe he turned to stavru how do i know i can trust you stavrus hand came out of his pocket clutching a luger he held it out a slight smile on his face would this constitute a satisfactory token youngblood satisfied himself that the weapon was loaded and grinned as he pushed it into his hip pocket okay lets get started the sooner we get those drums on board the sooner we get out of here stavru nodded and turned to vaughan take mr chavasse back to the young lady and come back as quickly as you can i want you to help me clear up the essentials in the house gledik can go down to the jetty with mr youngblood to load the fuel is it in order to ask what youre going to do with us chavasse said vaughan smiled im sure ill think of something old man as he was pushed towards the door chavasse turned in appeal to youngblood theyre going to kill us harry you know that thats your hard luck what about molly she shouldnt have joined nobody asked her to and thats your last word youngbloods face was suddenly suffused with passion well what do you expect me to say for christs sake youve got to look out for number one in this life he turned angrily and went out through the french windows gledik at his heels and stavru came forward sad isnt it but thats life my friend even sadder is the fact that a man only ever reaps what he sows chavasse told him and he turned and went out vaughan a couple of paces ahead of him as the cellar door closed behind him molly got up from the bench and came forward anxiously wheres harry what have they done to him hes fine chavasse said soothingly hes gone down to the jetty she stared at him blankly i dont understand he pushed her gently down on the bench theyre leaving molly and harrys going with them they need him to run the boat but what about me she said he wouldnt leave me hell take me with him i wouldnt count on that she got to her feet her eyes wild theyre taking him by force arent they she turned without waiting for an answer what can we do paul there must be something there was obviously nothing to be gained from any further discussion and chavasse didnt try it was almost half past nine now and he lit a cigarette and sat down on the bench vaughan would be coming very soon and there was nothing he could do about that either whatever happened it would be handled with icecold efficiency and with no chances offered for sudden grabs or infighting the man was too much of a professional to make silly mistakes no point in telling the girlit would only make it harder for her there was a footstep in the passage outside the rattle of the bolt and the door opened vaughan stayed well back the gun in his right hand as steady as a rock outside were taking a little walk i want to speak to stavru chavasse said tell him im ready to make a deal he doesnt need one old man and youre too late anyway hes gone down to the boat in fact were just about ready for off the girl seemed completely bewildered by all this whats happening paul where are we going just do as youre told sweetie vaughan said much better in the long run they went up the steps from the basement vaughan staying well back and somehow there was a terrible inevitability about everything when they reached the study chavasse paused and said desperately how do you know they wont clear off without you with what ive got stored away up here vaughan tapped his forehead and smiled cheerfully dont be silly and keep moving theres a good chap we havent got much time it was raining harder than ever as they went out through the french windows and crossed the lawn it was very quiet in the wood the only sound the rain hissing down through the branches and the girl stumbled along in front chavasse behind her vaughan bringing up the rear there would be no sudden warning no order to halt and turn round chavasse knew that just a bullet in the back of the head there was really nothing to lose no matter how suicidal the situation was and stavrus words came back into his mind desperate situations breed desperate remedies molly pushed a branch out of the way as she ploughed through the wet grass chavasse caught it held it for only a moment and ducked allowing it to sweep back into vaughans face he staggered back with a cry of alarm and chavasse gave molly a violent push to one side that sent her tumbling down the slope and ran a bullet chipped bark from a tree to one side of him two more sliced branches over his head and he zigzagged desperately he stumbled and fell and another bullet kicked dirt in his face and he rolled to one side screaming in sudden agony as stitches tore loose in his left arm he staggered forward head down aware of the sound of rushing water somewhere ahead and burst through a final screen of bushes to find himself on the banks of a small stream of clear water that brawled its way down to the sea over a bed of smooth stones two more shots sounded flat and sinister on the damp air and his right leg doubled up suddenly as if kicked and he went headfirst into the water he turned over aware of the blood drifting in a brown cloud from the hole in his leg and tried to get up he was too late there was a tremendous crashing in the undergrowth and vaughan emerged on the bank above his face was very pale icecold intent only on the job in hand he said nothing simply raised the revolver and took careful aim the hammer clicked on an empty chamber without a word his eyes never leaving chavasse for a moment he slipped the revolver into one pocket and produced the flick knife from the other as the blade jumped out of his hand he stepped into the water and waded forward chavasses right hand fastened over a large round stone in the stream bed and he brought his arm up and round hurling it into vaughans face with all his remaining strength it caught him high on the right cheek and he cried out sharply and staggered back the knife flying from his hand it fell into the water a yard or two away plainly visible on a bed of pebbles and chavasse rolled over and grabbed for it desperately he got to one knee turning just in time to meet vaughans forward rush splitting him cleanly on the razor sharp blade vaughan poised on the edge of eternity a look of blank amazement on his face and then he actually smiled well ill be damned so the old bitch was right after all blood erupted from his mouth in a sudden bright stream and he turned took a single hesitant step forward and fell on his face in the water chavasse waded forward and crawled up the bank he paused to examine his leg and found two holes in the rubber diving suit indicating that the bullet had passed clean through it wasnt painful until he stood up and tried to walk and then the pain was badreally bad flowering inside him like fire sweat springing to his forehead there wasnt much bleeding which was one good thing and he staggered forward clutching at the pine trees for support as he passed calling mollys name aloud he was almost at the edge of the wood when he found her huddled under a bush soaked to the skin she got to her feet and ran to meet him thank god paul are you all right only just wheres mr smith face down in a stream a little way back the words meant nothing to her and she clutched at his arm excitedly well have to hurry if were going to get down to the jetty in time he stared at her blankly the jetty what for theyll be leaving soon and taking harry with them weve got to stop them chavasse held her arms lightly and tried to find the words hes going because he wants to go molly hes agreed to take stavru to portugal in the boat in return he gets his freedom and his money she laughedfor the first time since hed known her she laughed but that doesnt make sense he left us molly he left us behind to be executed you never at any time had even a remote prospect of a place in his future youre lying she said in a low desperate voice i dont believe a word of it she struggled to free herself let me go if you wont help him i will no one on top of earth can help harry youngblood now she went completely rigid caught by the gravity of his words and chavasse held up his wrist so that she could see the time the limpet mine molly i didnt switch it through to neutral like i said i left it on maximum timingtwelve hours its the only thing thats kept me going for the past hour her head moved slightly from side to side and there was an expression of real horror on her face and then she exploded into action she kicked at his shins fingers hooking at his eyes and suddenly his leg doubled up beneath him as he fell she turned and ran he lay there for a moment or so his senses swimming and then forced himself to his feet and staggered after her dragging his wounded leg the rain still hammered down remorselessly but the mist had cleared a little so that when he went over the edge of the hollow on the other side of the house he could see the tiny harbor below the boat tied to the jetty stavru and youngblood standing in the prow watching gledik lash half a dozen drums of petrol together molly was halfway down the hill and running as she had never run in her life before there was no chance on earth of catching her but chavasse gritted his teeth and started down the path she called youngbloods name once high and clear and the three men turned to look up towards her and then she was at the bottom of the path and ran forward shouting and waving her arms as she put foot on the jetty the pride of man blew up with a tremendous bang that echoed from the cliffs like thunder a second later the fuel tanks went up with a rush and great fingers of fire lashed out in all directions pieces of the hull drifting through it all in a crazy kind of slow motion chavasse ducked as small pieces of debris whistled through the air above his head rattling against the stones of the hillside incredibly he started to run all pain forgotten sliding down the slope in a shower of earth and stones picking himself up at the bottom and running into the dense pall of black smoke that enveloped the jetty molly he called molly where are you but there was no replyonly the crackling of the flames and the stench of burning oil and petrol the pride of man had vanished completely taking the three men with her only the incredibly twisted pieces of steel and superstructure bearing witness to the fact that it had ever existed at all but molly was there lying face down half way along the jetty there wasnt a mark on her that was the strange thing but she was just as dead and he turned her over gently to her back and slumped down beside her for her it was over all doubts resolved all passion spent but not for him there were people who had to be taken care ofatkinson the principal officer at fridaythorpe for one and somewhere in the organisation of the bureau or of the special branch at scotland yard there was a weak linkthe person who had leaked his identity to stavru he would have to be found and he would have to be dealt with but not nownot now somewhere in the distance he could hear the sound of engines probably the mtbs mallory had promised to lay on coming in fast to see what all the fuss was about but it didnt seem to matter any more and he looked down at the dead girl who stared past him into eternity a look of faint surprise on her face poor ugly little bitch he said aloud and for no reason he could ever satisfactorily explain to himself afterwards took her hand and held it very tightly as the first torpedo boat swept in towards the jetty
