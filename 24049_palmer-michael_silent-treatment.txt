michael palmer silent treatment the doctor will see you now the moment ray santana heard orsino saythe words he knew he was going to die and die horribly ten hours or so had passed since hisadhesive tape blindfold had been ripped away ten hours of being gagged andlashed to a highbacked chair his head and chin taped so tightly soexpertly that he could not move at all ten hours of listening to the mariachibands and singers in the street above and knowing that for all the good theywould do him the revelers might as well be celebrating their fiesta de nogaleson mars ten hours without seeing any movement except the comings and goings ofa huge roach the roach was an inch and a half longmaybe two it padded out of a crack in the mildewed basement wall and made itsway in no particular hurry to the floor ray followed the insect with hiseyes until it left his field of vision and waited for its return for a timehe wondered about roaches how they had sex whether they chose one mate forlife for a time he pictured his own family eliza singing as she whippedtogether her incredible paella ray jr diving headfirst into third for atime he thought about his life before eliza the road warriors the drugs his decision to leave the gang and try college the irony of his ending upas an undercover agent for the dea now after ten meticulously careful yearson the job he was about to meet the doctor and soon very soon he suspected he would be dead for no reason that he could understandthings had blown completely apart the end of nearly three years of work was athand and it was time to put together federal indictments and call in thetroops his cover was as deep as airtight as it had ever been the meeting toturn his evidence over to sean garvey from the home office had been set up withpriority one precautions four hours of steady movement half a dozen decoysand backcheckers and a route along which it was impossible to be followedbut suddenly alacantes men were all over them and in seconds just likethat it was over not one shot in defense not one punch just overgarvey had been hauled away to god only knew where and ray had beenblindfolded crammed in the trunk of a mercedes and driven back into townafter an hour he was dragged to the cellar of a house and then through a longdamp tunnel to this basement ray wondered if the doctor had alreadybeen to see garvey ol garves might hold off for a littlewhile in naming names ray figured but underneath his slick veneer he was awimp the first sight of his own blood the first hit of real pain theelectric cattle prod or knife or vise or whatever the hell they used and hewould be spilling his guts he would give up every fucking name he could thinkof believing in his heart of hearts that if he didnt cause alacantes peopletoo much trouble they might let him live wrong tijuana oh that would be aguy named gonzales hes had a little fruit stand downtown for the past threeyears but hes really a us fed vera cruz yeah i know that guy too shit garves im sorry santana thought suddenly i understand what the hell im a field man you re a suit i can sit here like kingtut thinking youre trash for giving in to them but they havent touched meyet besides you dont know a tenth of what i do about the mexicanundercover organization and i dont plan on telling that part no matter whatmy goddamn initiation into the road warriors was worse than anything thesecreeps can do to me here for chrissakes just do your best garves just doyour best try not to make it too easy for them another half hour passed possibly longersantana closed his eyes and wished he could just will himself dead or at leastasleep the air in the basement was stagnant and heavy with mold sucking it inthrough his nostrils took so much effort that sleep was impossible how ironicafter three years he had amassed enough information for several dozen majorindictments his only real failure was not pinpointing the famous alacantepipeline the tunnel connecting one or more houses in nogales arizona withcounterparts in nogales mexico now unless he was sorely mistaken he had notonly found the pipeline he had actually been dragged through it eliza wasright as usual he should have gotten out while he could started up thelandscaping business he was always talking about and left the heroics to thecrazies now there was a scraping noise behind him aportion of the wall was being swung aside seconds later orsino came intoview an alacante lieutenant and a remorseless killer orsino had survived ashotgun blast that had left him without half of his lower lip and jaw whatremained of his mouth was all on the right side of his face ray wondered ifperhaps orsino liked it that way it is time he growled with theinflated pride of a small man thrust into the company of a legend time foryou to meet the doctor an averagelooking man in his earlyforties medium height stepped forward his face was remarkable only for howcompletely unremarkable it was not handsome but not unattractive nounusual features no tics no scars brown hair cut short hairline not recedingno glasses he was wheeling a stainless steel cart on top of which was atattered leather valise his back was turned to ray as he flipped the suitcaseopen rays knuckles blanched as he clutched thearm of the chair my name is perchek dr anton perchekthe man said santanas stomach tightened bile shot upinto his throat the name was a death sentence the doctor everyone inthe agency everyone in washington knew who perchek was but as far as rayknew no one had ever seen so much as a photograph of him i can tell from your expression that myname is one you recognize perchek said favoring ray with an enigmatic smilethats good thats very good rays mouth had gone dry anton perchekmd sovietborn and trained had long ago left his native country now hebelonged to no country and to every country a true son of the world for overthe years the doctor had built a reputation for being the best in the world atwhat he did which was to keep torture subjects alive awake and responsivehe was seldom without employment sri lanka bosnia paraguay iraq southafrica haiti wherever there was conflict or political repression there wasa demand for his services there were even rumors unsubstantiated that he did occasional jobs for the cia a us federal grand jury hadindicted perchek in absentia for complicity in the deaths of several americanundercover operatives two of whom ray knew well so senor santana he said his spanishunaccented but sterile would you prefer i address you in english he waitedfor a response then he turned and noticed the adhesive tape pulled tightlyacross rays mouth he chuckled at his own oversight my apologies senorsantana senor orsino his half mouth twisted in what might havebeen a grin orsino stepped forward and viciously tore the tape off firstfrom across rays face then from under his chin so perchek asked again spanish orenglish what will it be ray flexed the tightness and spasm out ofhis jaw your spanish is better than mine he said ive been led to believe your mexicanspanish is quite good actually especially for someone from the bronx butvery well english it will be his english with perhaps the slightestbritish tinge was no less fluent than his spanish ray suspected that the mancould have conversed in any number of languages i speak twelve others actually hesaid as if reading santanas mind although my arabic and swahili may begetting a bit rusty his average face smiled down at ray butin that moment ray noticed something that wasnt the least bit average it wasthe mans eyes the irises were as pale as any he had ever seen almosttranslucent ice blue was the closest he could come to labeling them infact ice blue was a near perfect description for they were as hard and ascold as a humans eyes could be i dont know what this is all about rayforced out the words the iceblue eyes sparked otherwise percheks demeanor remained unchanged then we shall help you learn he said he handed orsino a length of twine andmotioned to the light fixture overhead once the twine was secured and danglingdown perchek turned to his valise he produced a plastic bottle of intravenoussolution connected it to a plastic infusion tube and suspended it from thetwine zero point nine percent sodium chloridehe said pulling on a pair of rubber gloves normal saline he tightened a latex tourniquet just abovesantanas left elbow waited a few seconds for the veins to distend and thenslipped in an intravenous catheter with the ease of one who had performed themaneuver hundreds of times next he wrapped a blood pressure cuff around theother arm and secured it in place listen to me ray said struggling for atone of calm and reason orsino youve got to listen i was setting up thatfed garvey he was about to sell me some information on the new dea strategyagainst alacante you are lying orsino said no its the truth we shall see what is the truth and whatis not perchek said drawing up a slightly turbid solution into a largesyringe he inserted the long needle through a rubber port into the infusiontubing and taped the syringe to rays forearm we shall see very soon mrorsino orsino knelt positioning himself so thathis face was just a foot or so from rays santana mentally recoiled from themans breath heavy with the odor of cigarettes and garlic and stared withrevulsion at the yellowed half rows of teeth names orsino said a small bubble ofspittle forming at the good side of his mouth the mexican undercover agentsall of them ray looked past the man to where perchekstood he wondered what awaited him within the tattered valise truth serumperhaps reputedly perchek usually left the dirty work to his employers hisjob was to use his drugs to keep subjects alive and awake but it seemed hardto believe the crass slowwitted orsino would have the patience and skillrequired to do an effective job of inflicting just the right increments ofpain i dont know any of them orsino raysaid youve got to believe that during his year of training with theagency there were a number of classes the cadets had shared with their ciacounterparts one of them was formally entitled dealing with hostileinterrogation the trainees referred to it as torture the instructor aformer fighter pilot named joe dash had spent four years in a vietcong prisoncamp he had no eyes there are three things you must alwaysbelieve when being hostilely interrogated dash stressed he believed thatthere were always three points essential to any subject three no more noless first that anything you are promised in exchange for answers isbullshit second that if you dont give them what they want they may decide tohold off killing you and try again another day and third and most importantthat as long as you are alive theres a chance youll be rescued we want those names orsino said iswear i dont know any of them youve got to believe me there are three stages you should gothrough in responding to hostile interrogation each stage should be draggedout as long as humanly possible first deny knowing anything and keep denyingit next admit that you know some things but give them misinformation especially if theyll have to spend time verifying what you say the longer ittakes them to determine youre lying the better the chance that youll berescued take it from one who was the third stage is telling them what theywant to know whether you are forced to that stage or not depends a little onwhat youre made of and a lot on how good your interrogators are orsino reached out a meaty hand andsqueezed rays cheeks so tightly their insides touched im glad you didnttell us he rasped he stepped back immediately ray was transfixed by theice blue eyes do you know any chemistry at all mrsantana perchek asked no matter you may be interested to know the chemicalname for the contents of that syringe it is fourchloryl fourhydroxytrimethyl sixfluorodimethyl carbamate actually there are two chemical sidechains as well so the name is even longer im impressed ray said the short chemical name is hyconidolhydrochloride a chemist friend did the synthesis but my own research producedthe concept bravo you see mr santana at the end of everypain nerve in the human body is a chemical transmitter that connects it withthe next nerve and fires it off the impulse shoots up that nerve and anotherjet of transmitter connects it with the next et cetera et cetera eventually quite rapidly actually the message is transmitted from the point of injuryto the pain center of the brain and ouch nicely put santana already knew where perchek washeading he was sure his understanding showed in his eyes hyconidol almost matches atom for atomthe pain fiber neurotransmitter chemical that means i can fire those nervesoff all at once and at will every single one of them think of it mrsantana no injury no mess no blood just pain pure pain except in thework i do hyconidol has absolutely no clinical value but if we ever do marketit i thought an appropriate name for it might be agonyl its incrediblestuff if i do say so myself a small injection a little tingle a larger onewell im sure you get the picture rays mouth had become desert dry thepounding within his chest was so forceful that he felt certain the doctor couldsee it please dont do this he screamed silently please percheks thumb tightened on the plunger i think well start with somethingmodest he said equivalent perhaps to nothing more than a little coolbreeze over the cavities in your teeth the last voice ray heard before theinjection was joe dashs there are three ways a man canchoose to handle dying ii years later for twelve years the jade dragon on theupper west side of manhattan had prided itself on exceptional food at veryreasonable prices as a result on an average weekday its seat capacityturned over twice and on weekends as many as five times tonight a warmfriday in june the wait for a table was half an hour seated in his customary spot ron farrellwas commenting to his wife susan and their friends jack and anita harmon on howthe place had grown since he and susan had first eaten there almost a decadeago now although they had moved three times they made a point of coming tothe jade dragon alone or with friends every other friday almost likeclockwork they were nearly done with a meal that theharmons had proclaimed as good as any chinese food they had ever eaten when ronstopped in midsentence and began rubbing his abdomen with no warning severecramps had begun knotting his gut accompanied almost immediately by waves ofnausea he felt sweat break out beneath his arms and over his face his visionblurred ronnie are you all right his wifeasked farrell took several slow deep breathshe had always handled pain well but this ache seemed to be worsening i dont feel well he managed ive ive just gotten this pain right here it couldnt be what you ate susan saidwe all shared the same susans face suddenly went ashen beads ofperspiration sprang out across her forehead then without another word shelurched sideways and vomited on the floor standing by the kitchen door of thecrowded restaurant the young assistant chef watched the commotion grow as one byone the four customers at table became violently ill finally he reenteredthe massive kitchen and made his way nonchalantly to the pay phone installedfor the use of the hired help the number he dialed was handwritten on athreebyfive file card yes the mans voice at the other endsaid xia wei zen here yes the chef read carefully the words printedon the card there are four leaves on the clover very good you know where to go afteryour shift the man in the black car will take the empty vial from you inexchange for the rest of what you are now owed the man hung up without waiting for areply xia wei zen glanced about to ensure no onewas watching and then returned to his station work would not be nearly sotaxing for the rest of his shift for one thing there was a good deal of moneyawaiting him and for another there would be many fewer orders coming in fromthe dining room tonight the call came into the emergency room ofgood samaritan hospital at four priority two patients were beingtransported by rescue squad from a chinese restaurant twenty blocks awaypreliminary diagnosis was acute food poisoning priority two potentially serious illness orinjury nonlifethreatening at the moment it was a typically busy friday night thenurses and residents of the large teaching hospital were already three hoursbehind the twenty available treatment rooms were full as was the waitingroom the air was heavy with the odors of perspiration antiseptic and bloodall around were the sounds of illness misery and pain moans babies cryinguncontrollable coughing ever eat at a place called the jadedragon the nurse who took the call from the rescue squad asked i think sothe charge nurse answered well next time you might want to consider italianone rescue is on the way in with two probable food poisonings two more will be leaving shortly altogether two men two women all in theirforties all on ivs all vomiting vital signs the numbers are okay for the moment butaccording to the crew on the scene none of them are looking all that good fun and games times four where do you want them what do we have seven can be cleared if you can talk drgrateful dead or whatever the hell his name is into writing a fewprescriptions perfect put whoever looks worst in thereand the rest in the hall well move them into rooms as we can might as wellorder routine labs and an ekg on each of them too chop chop ron farrell grunted in pain as his litterwas set on the emergency bay platform and telescoped up into transportposition he was on his side in a fetal position the pain boring into hisstomach was unremitting jack harmon who had quickly become even sicker than susanhad been transported in the ambulance with him now ron saw him wave weakly asthe two of them were wheeled through the automatic doors and into the commotionand fluorescent glare of the intake area the minutes that followed were a blur ofquestions needles spasms of pain and examinations from people dressed insurgical scrubs ron was wheeled to a small room with open shelves of suppliesand a suction bottle on the wall the staff had addressed him courteouslyenough but it was clear that everyone was harried rons personal physicianwasnt affiliated with good samaritan as far as he knew there was reallynothing he could think of to do except wait for the medication he had beenpromised to take the pain away you are feeling better yes a mansvoice said in a thick foreign accent that ron could not identify still in the fetal position that gave himthe least discomfort ron blinked his eyes open and looked up the mandressed in blue surgical scrubs like most of the er staff smiled down at himthe overhead light eclipsed by his head formed a bright halo around him anddarkened his face i am dr kozlansky he said it appearsyou and the others have developed food poisoning goddamn jade dragon is my wife allright oh yes oh yes i assure you she is mostfine great listen doc my stomachs killingme can you give me something for this pain that is exactly why i am here he said wonderful the physician produced a syringe half fullof clear liquid and emptied it into the intravenous line thanks doc farrell said you may wish to wait and thank me when when we see how this works okay have it your farrell was suddenly unable to speakthere was a horrible consuming emptiness within his chest and he knew in thatmoment that his heart had stopped beating the man continued smiling down at himbenignly you are feeling better yes he asked ron felt his arms and legs begin to shakeuncontrollably his back arched until only his heels and the back of his headtouched the bed his teeth jackhammered together then his consciousness beganto fade his thought became more disjointed his dreadful fear lessened andthen finally vanished his body dropped lifelessly back on to the bed for a full minute the man stood therewatching then he slipped the syringe into his pocket im afraid i must leave you now hewhispered in a voice free of any accent please try to get some rest year later chapter harry corbett was on his fifteenth lap aroundthe indoor track when he first sensed the pain in his chest the track abalcony just under an eighth of a mile around was on the top floor of the greybuilding of the manhattan medical center ten feet below it was a modestlyequipped gym with weights the usual machines heavy bags and some mats thefitness center unique in the city was exclusively for the hospital staff andemployees it had been created through the legacy of dr george pollock acardiologist who had twice swum the english channel pollocks death at ageninety had resulted from his falling off a ladder while cleaning the guttersof his country home at the moment of his awareness of thepain harry was actually thinking about pollock and about what it would be liketo live until ninety he slowed a bit and rotated his shoulders the painpersisted it wasnt much maybe two on the scale of one to ten thatphysicians used but it was there reluctant to stop running harry swallowedand massaged his upper abdomen the discomfort was impossible to localize onemoment it seemed to be beneath his breastbone the next in the middle of hisback he slowed a bit more down from an eightminutespermile pace to abouttenandahalf the ache was in his left chest now no it was gone no not gone somewhere between his right nipple and clavicle he slowed still more then finally hestopped he bent forward his hands on his thighs it wasnt angina he toldhimself nothing about the character of the pain said cardiac he understoodhis body and he certainly understood pain this pain was no big deal and ifit wasnt his heart he really didnt give a damn where it was coming from harry knew his logic was flawed diagnostic deduction he would never ever apply to a patient but like mostphysicians with physical symptoms his denial was more powerful than any logic steve josephson jogging in the oppositedirection lumbered toward him hey you okay he asked still staring down at the banked corktrack harry took a deep breath the pain was gone just like that gone hewaited a few seconds to be sure nothing the smidgen of remaining doubtdisappeared definitely not the ticker he told himself again yeah yeah im fine steve he saidyou go ahead and finish hey youre the zealot who goaded me intothis jogging nonsense in the first place josephson said ill take anyexcuse i can get to stop he was sweating more profusely than harryalthough he had probably run half as far like harry steve josephson was ageneral practitioner family medicine specialists the bureaucrats haddecided to name them they were in solo practice but shared night and weekendcoverage with four other gps it was just after sixthirty in the morning earlier than usual for their run but this would be a busy and important day at eight following morning rounds and anemergency meeting of the family medicine department the entire mmc staff wouldbe convening in the amphitheater after months of interviews and investigationthe task force charged with determining whether or not to reduce the privilegesof gps in the hospital was ready to present its findings from the rumors harryhad tapped into the recommendations of the sidonis committee would be harsh the professional equivalent of castration with a portion of harrys income and asignificant chunk of his professional respect on the line the impendingpresentation was reason enough for the ulcers or muscle spasms or whatever thehell had caused the strange ache and even the committee report was not theforemost concern on his mind weve been running together three or fourtimes a week for almost a year josephson said and ive never seen you stopbefore your five miles were up well stephen it just goes to showtheres a first time for everything harry studied his friends worriedface and softened listen pal id tell you if it was anything believe me iwould i just dont feel like running today ive got too much on my mind i understand is evie going in tomorrow the day after ben dunleavys herneurosurgeon he talks about clipping her cerebral aneurysm as if he wasremoving a wart or something but i guess its what he does they moved off the track as the only otherrunners in the gym approached hows she holding up josephson asked harry shrugged all things consideredshe seems pretty calm about it but she can be pretty closed in about herfeelings closed in the understatement of the weekharry mused ruefully he couldnt recall the last time evie had shared feelingsof any consequence with him well tell her cindy and i wish her welland that ill stop by to see her as soon as that berry is clipped thanks harry said im sure shellappreciate hearing that in fact he doubted that she would aswarm bright and caring as steve josephson was evie could never get past hisobesity did you ever listen to him breathe shehad once asked as harry was extolling his virtues as a physician i felt likei was trying to converse with a bull in heat and those white narrowstrappedtees he wears beneath his white dress shirts pulleese so then josephson said as they enteredthe locker room before we shower why dont you tell me what really happenedout there i already harry i was halfway around the trackfrom you and i could see the color drain from your face it was nothing you know i spent years learning how toask nonleading questions dont make me regress for the purpose of insurance applicationforms or the occasional prescription harry and josephson served as oneanothers physician and although each persistently urged the other to schedulea complete physical neither of them had the closest they had come was anagreement made just after harrys fortyninth birthday harry alreadyobsessive about diet and exercise had promised to get a checkup and a cardiacstress test steve six years younger but fifty pounds heavier had agreed tohave a physical start jogging and join weight watchers but except forjosephsons grudging sessions on the track neither had followed through i had a little indigestion harryconceded thats all it came it bothered me for a minute it left indigestion huh by indigestion do youperhaps mean chest pain steve id tell you if i had chest painyou know i would slight correction i know you wouldnthow many men did you lug back to that chopper although harry rarely talked about itover the years almost everyone at the hospital had heard some version of theevents at nhatrang or had actually composed one themselves in the storiesthe number of wounded he had saved before being severely wounded himself hadranged from three which was in fact the number for which he had beendecorated to twenty he once even overheard a patient boast that his doctorhad killed a hundred vietcong while rescuing an equal number of gis stephen i am no hero far from it if ithought the pain was anything anything at all id tell you josephson wasunconvinced you owe me a stress test when do youturn fifty two weeks and whens the date of that familycurse oh come on harry youre the one who told me aboutit now when is it september september first youve got four weeks i okay okay as soon as eviessituation is straightened out ill set one up with the exercise lab promise im serious you know in spite of what everyone saysabout you i always thought that harry stripped and headed for the showershe knew that steve josephson in spite of himself was staring at the patchworkof scars on his back thirtyone pieces of shrapnel half a kidney and a ribthe design left by their removal would have blended into the pages of a randmcnally road atlas harry flashed on the incredible sensation of eviesbreasts gliding slowly over the healed wounds in what she used to call herpatriotic duty to a war hero when was the last time that heacknowledged sadly he couldnt remember he cranked up the hot water until he wasenveloped in steam two weeks until fifty fifty he had neverexperienced any sort of midlife crisis that he could think of but maybe thedeep funk he had been in lately was it by now the pieces of his life shouldhave fallen into place instead the choices he had made seemed to be underalmost constant attack and crumbling he thought about the day halfway throughhis convalescence when he had made the decision to withdraw from his residencyin surgery and devote his professional life to general practice something hadhappened to him over his year and a half in nam he no longer had any desire tobe center stage not that he minded the drama and intensity of the operatingroom in fact even now he truly enjoyed his time there but in the end he hadrealized he simply wanted to be a family doc simply if there was oneword that was most descriptive of the life harry had chosen for himself simplymight well be it get up in the morning do what seems right try to help afew people along the way develop an interest or two outside of work andsooner or later things would make sense sooner or later the big questionswould be answered well lately things werent making muchsense at all the big answers were just as elusive as ever more so hismarriage was shaky the kids he had always wanted just never happened thefinancial security that he had expected would gradually develop over the yearswas tied to a brand of medicine he was not willing to practice he neverallowed his office to become a medical mill he never sent a collection agencyafter anyone he never refused anyone care because the patient couldnt pay henever moved to the suburbs he never went back for the training that would havemade him a subspecialist the result was a car that was seven years old and aretirement fund that would last indefinitely as long as he didnt try toretire now his professional stature was beinghauled up on the block his wife was facing a neurosurgeons scalpel and justfour weeks from the first of september his fiftyfirst year he hadexperienced pain in his chest the hastily called family medicinedepartmental meeting accomplished little each physician who spoke during theemotional fortyfiveminute session seemed to have different information aboutwhat the findings of the sidonis committee were going to be in the end nomotions were passed no actions of protest approved aside from presenting aunified front at the amphitheater there was nothing to do until the specificsof the task forces recommendations were known harry you didnt say a word in theresteve josephson said as they left there was nothing to say sidonis and his vigilantes are on a witchhunt and you know it everyones scared you could have calmed them downyoure youre sort of the leader of the pack the unofficial kahuna a kind way of saying im older than mostof the others thats hardly what i mean i deliverbabies sandy porter strips veins and does other stuff in the or the kornetskybrothers are better in the ccu than most of the cardiologists almost every oneof us does some procedure or activity that might be taken away today youreabout the only one who does all of them so steve what are we going to dochallenge the specialists to a medical olympics oh this is crazy harry i dont knowwhats come over you lately i just hope its not permanent harry started to respond that he didntknow what josephson was talking about instead he mumbled an apology he hadnever been a fiery orator but over the years his directness and commonsenseapproach to resolving conflicts had earned him respect in the hospital and hecertainly had never backed away from a fight he could have should have said something members of the department especially the younger ones weregenuinely worried about their futures the crisis at mmc was the direct result ofthe hospital being named as codefendant in three successive malpractice suitsover a period of a few months all three suits involved gps harry felt theepidemic of litigation was nothing more than coincidence in the new medicalorder of sue first ask questions later similar numbers could probably beproduced to show that specialists were equally vulnerable but the medicalstaff had panicked and the committee on nonspecialty practice had beencreated caspar sidonis a charismatic widely known cardiac surgeon had beenmade its chairman sidonis and harry had never hit it offalthough harry never really understood why now they were on opposite sides ofthe table playing a highstakes game for a pot that was of value only to thegps and sidonis held all the cards steve im sorry harry said again asthey turned down the passageway that cut through the emergency room i guess ihave been down lately and i really dont know why malemenopause or something i feel like maybe i need i dont know some sort ofwindmill to charge the corridor a shortcut from the roomwhere their meeting was held to the amphitheater was closed to the public butnot to hospital staff today the er was humming the rooms to either side ofthem were all occupied major surgery minor surgery orthopedics entpediatrics minor medical major medical cardiac each one a story harry said as theywalked through yeah steve mumbled well after todaywe better get used to having to read the cliffs notes a nurse rushed past them from behind andinto one of the two cardiac rooms give him another three of morphine theyheard a resident say as they neared the room how much lasix has he gotten eighty doctor this is v tach im almost certain ofit his pressures dropping doctor dammit someone was supposed to havecalled cardiology i put a page in for them they haventanswered the two gps stopped at the doorway thepatient a husky black man probably in his early seventies was in extremissitting nearly upright on the litter gasping for breath loud gurgling wellingup from within his chest accompanied each inhalation his heart rate was nearlyone hundred and seventy the young resident managing the case was a decentenough doctor but he had developed a reputation for losing his cool indifficult situations what is his pressure he asked maybe seventy doctor its quite hard tohear there was undisguised urgency in thenurses voice her repeated use of the residents titlewas a demand that he do something we cant wait for cardiology he saidget ready to shock him someone please page cardiology again janice i wantthree hundred joules steve josephson his eyes wide lookedover at harry pulmonary edema josephson said right you are harry replied but thats not v tach on the monitor i agree plain old garden variety sinustachycardia i would say due to the stress of the situation we cant let him shock that harry hesitated for just a moment thennodded the two of them moved to the bedside sam thats sinus tach harry whispered softlyenough so that no one but the resident could hear try to shock that and youmight kill him the resident looked first at the monitorand then at the nurses and technicians surrounding his patient in seconds hisexpression went from confusion to anger to embarrassment and finally torelief you want to take over he askedsuddenly please go ahead without answering harry picked up a toweland dried the perspiration that was pouring off the patients brow he glancedat the plastic identification bracelet mr miller im dr corbett squeeze myhand if you understand good youre going to be okay but youve got to tryand breathe slower i know its hard and i know youre frightened right nowbut you can do it were going to help you ekg steve maybe a small anterior mi josephsonsaid hes beating too fast to tell for sure hematocrit fifty percent if hes not a smoker hisblood is concentrated big time they looked over at the resident whoshook his head lifetime nonsmoker he said but whats his red blood cellconcentration got to do with all this harrys exam disclosed no ankle swellingand no other signs of excessive fluid heart failure from whatever cause wasproducing back pressure throughout the pulmonary circulation serum thenoncellular part of blood was being forced through the blood vessel walls andinto the mans lungs as a result of the serum shift the red blood cells toolarge to pass through the vessel walls were becoming sludge harry checked themans pupils for the constriction that would signal marked narcotic effect thepupils were small but not yet pinpoint three more of morphine he said pleaseget me a phlebotomy bag were going to take some blood off him get ready tointubate him if we have to he toweled the man off again mr miller youredoing great try to slow it down just a little bit more excuse me the resident whisperedastonished but youre going to take blood off him we are but but nobody does that anymore youre doing better and better mrmiller harry said he turned to the resident no one does this anymore huhwell we do sam he said especially when someones hematocrit is aselevated as this mans just because a methods not hightech doesnt mean itsuseless trying to get fluid off him with diuretics often isnt as effective aswhat were about to do and in someone whose blood is already thisconcentrated diuretics are quite a bit more dangerous any fluid you get offwith diuretics will just concentrate his red cells even more if those redcells get thick enough sooner or later a vessel could clot off pressureplease holding at eighty easier to hear thenurse said harry nodded to steve josephson who insertedthe large phlebotomy needle into a vein with a dexterity belied by his thickfingers instantly a column of blood glided down the tubing and began to fillthe plastic collection bottle the reversal of clayton millers pulmonaryedema was spectacular i im breathing a little better he managed after just a minute or so what do you think steve another hundredccs if his pressure stays up i would saymaybe even two hundred harry adjusted the needle slightly andthe flow of blood increased for another minute there was only silence oh my god miller said suddenly fillinghis lungs with a long grateful swallow oh my god im better muchbetter he was still breathless but much less sothe cardiac pattern on the monitor had slowed to one hundred the shape of thecomplexes now appeared quite normal two nurses exchanged looks of exuberantrelief the resident stepped between the two gps this is incredible he said i dontknow what to say mr miller dr corbett and dr josephson really came throughfor you for me too the older man managed a weak thumbs uplisten the resident went on i heard about that committee they formed toalter your privileges if you need me to write them about what went on herethis morning ill be happy to it may be a little late for that harrysaid but why dont you drop dr sidonis a note just the same he mightactually read it as long as it starts with the greeting yourgrace there was a soft noise behind them thethree of them looked toward the doorway just as a stonyfaced caspar sidonisturned and stalked off toward the amphitheater chapter green dolphin street the wes montgomeryarrangement the tune started up in harrys head almost as soon as he hadsettled into a seat in the last row of the amphitheater green dolphinstreet harry tapped out a riff with his fingers on the metal armrest heloved music of all kinds but he was a fanatic for jazz he had played basssince junior high school and still sat in with a combo when he had the timeover the years he had come to appreciate that green dolphin street tended topop into his head when he was keyed up tense but ready for action he hadhummed it heading into organic chemistry exams and later on throughout hisfamily practiceboards and of course during the war it seemed he was alwayslistening to it either on tape or in his imagination now for the first timein a hell of a while it was back full house harry doug atwater saidgesturing toward the rapidly filling amphitheater youd think they weregiving away free stethoscopes mmc was the largest of the three hospitalscontracting with the manhattan health cooperative as the vice presidentresponsible for marketing and development of the rapidly expanding hmo atwaterhad an office at each of them he had come to the company six or seven yearsbefore from someplace in the midwest there were many including harry whobelieved that without atwaters creative energy and business sense thecooperative and its hospitals might well have gone under some time agoinstead manhattan health had captured a decent share of the market and becomea real force in the business like harry atwater was a devoted jazz fanalthough he didnt play himself the two of them managed to hit a club everythree or four months and from time to time doug would stop by ccs cellarwhen harry was sitting in with the combo that regularly played there did sidonis or anyone on his committeespeak to you about all this atwater asked of course dan twersky the psychiatrist got assigned to interview me you know him he couldnt havebeen more pompous or condescending if he had tried he wanted to know how marvlorello could have sewn up that guys thumb so badly i told him that as far asi could tell marv didnt sew up anything badly twersky asked why lorellodidnt call in a hand surgeon i told him that all anyone could do was clean upthe gash and suture it closed the most skillful hand surgeon in the worldmight easily have gotten the same unfortunate result marv did sometimescirculation to a wound isnt all it should be and there is some tissue losshe said i sounded a bit defensive of gps i told him that a thousandtimes out of a thousand i would choose to repair that cut without calling in ahand surgeon and that nine hundred and ninety nine of those times the twohalves would heal perfectly twersky just sat there and smiled it was an anythingyou say doc as long as you dont count on ever fixin my thumb kind ofsmile atwater reached over to give him asupportive pat on the shoulder harry youre a hell of a doctor hesaid and nothing sidonis or his committee can do is going to change that steve josephson maneuvered down the rownodded a greeting to atwater and settled into the seat next to harry they just took clayton miller up to theunit he said the mans doing great a save of the highest order after youleft once his breathing was back near normal he started talking baseballnonstop he was a pro a teammate of satchel paige in the negro baseballleagues and get this apparently his son works for the yankees he says thatany time you or i want tickets weve got em my kind of patient harry said what gives atwater asked harry deferred to josephson who detailedthe event with all the drama of a fighter pilot recounting a dogfight atwaterlistened enthralled too bad sidonis doesnt know what youdid he said he does i dont think hes impressedenough to call off the vigilantes though in fact i dont think hesimpressed at all well just the same you guys are reallysomething i listen to you and i honestly wish i could be on the front linesinstead of sitting up there pushing pencils say harry whats the story withevie shes coming in later this week probablythe day after tomorrow atwater pulled out a black memo book andwrote down evies name and flowers shes a hell of a gal he said i knowshell do great evies headaches which she had firstattributed to allergies then to stress from her job and finally to stressfrom harry had proven to be caused by something far more structural andvirulent harry spent several frustrating weeks trying to convince her to see adoctor and get a ct scan finally she ended up on the neuro ward with thickspeech and a weak right arm the tests revealed a large berry aneurysm on heranterior cerebral artery which had bled and then sealed over evie was luckyrapidly her neurologic symptoms had resolved a period of rest coupled withserial cts was her neurosurgeons recommendation now it was time for thebulge in the vessel wall to be repaired harry atwater said be sure and let meknow if theres anything anneke or i can do to help the two of you out anneke dougs smile was mischievous when he andharry went out to hear music he invariably showed up with a date always adifferent one and each it seemed younger and more attractive than the last shes half swedish and half german heexplained he thought for a moment and then added i guess its the top halfthats swedish hail caesar we who are about to diesalute you steve josephson said gesturing toward the small stage at thelower end of the amphitheater caspar sidonis had just taken his place at themicrophoned table in the center of his sixmember committee could i have your attention pleasesidonis said tapping at his microphone lets get started we have a gooddeal of important material to cover please would you all take your seats if people keep talking i wonder if hellstart throwing things like he does in the or josephson whispered to harryive heard hes had enough complaints filed by scrub nurses to fill the phonebook the hospital doesnt do anything about his tantrums because theyreafraid hell take his act somewhere else the guy brings in millions ofdollars whatever caspar wants caspar getsharry sang to the lola tune i dont have very good vibes about thisat all harry i cant think of any reason you should caspar sidonis in his early forties hada matinee idols good looks which he augmented by being impeccably andexpensively dressed at all times he had been first in his class at harvard medand never ever let anyone forget it he had also won mmcs tennis and squashchampionships several years running and was rumored to have been a collegiateboxing champion green dolphin street intensified inharrys head funk or no funk he did not want to be told what he could andcould not do as a physician not by hmos not by insurance companies andespecially not by a pompous overblown crankemthrough supertechnician likesidonis he glanced around the hall at the other gps thinking about all thoseyears of study the countless hours of continuinged courses their willingnessto endure the low prestige and even lower reimbursement that went with being afamily practitioner they deserved to be rewarded not restricted harry for chrissakes say somethingtheyre crucifying you doug atwater seated to harrys rightclenched his fist in frustration as one by one the sidonis committeesrecommendations were presented to the medical staff to harrys left stevejosephson was shaking his head in disbelief he had tried arguing against thefirst of the committees proposals which required that a boardcertifiedobstetrician be present for all deliveries josephson had once made headlineswhen as a passenger stuck in a disabled subway car he had successfullydelivered the twins of one of the other passengers now it seemed possiblethat deliveries in such situations would be the only ones he would be allowedto perform the vote despite josephsons emotionalarguments and wellpublicized heroics was nearly unanimous only the three gpswho still did deliveries voted nay the rest abstained perhapsbelieving that the staff would conclude they were responsible enough to policethemselves and back off from supporting the other restrictive resolutions there goes the new refrigerator harrysaid the next resolution requiring gps to turnover their coronary care unit patients to a cardiologist or internist passedeasily the cardiologist who had taken over clayton millers care was one ofthe few dissenters who wasnt a gp then came the vote to limit surgicalparticipation by gps to first assisting only again sidoniss committeeprevailed history will refer to this next one asthe marv lorello proviso harry whispered as discussion began on the last ofthe committees proposals it is recommended sidonis beganadjusting the ben franklin reading glasses that harry sensed he wore more forhis image than for his vision that all suturing done in the manhattan medicalcenter emergency ward by a nonsurgical specialist be approved in advance bythe senior emergency physician on duty the murmur around the amphitheatersuggested that many were surprised by this final and perhaps most humiliatingproposal harry had had advance warning but the words stung nevertheless there have been sidonis went on anumber of cases reported to our complaint committee and to our liabilitycarrier in which improper technique was used or faulty judgment displayed bycertain nonspecialists mrs brenner of our riskmanagement office has assuredme that developing some sort of internal pretreatment screening policy couldsignificantly reduce the number of claims against our nonspecialty staffmembers he glanced vaguely in marv lorellosdirection and several dozen pairs of eyes followed lorello had joined thestaff just a few years before after serving three years on a reservation in theindian health service he had impressive academic credentials and a refreshingidealism about practicing medicine the malpractice suit his first and thesubsequent fallout from it had hurt him deeply harry did his best to remainexternally placid but green dolphin street was playing on uptempo now andlouder then suddenly the music stopped it tookseveral seconds before harry realized he was on his feet his sixone frame thecenter of attention of everyone in the amphitheater he cleared his throat thefaces stared up at him waiting if its all right with the chairman heheard himself saying i um i guess there are a few things i need to getoff my chest before we vote on this last and for the family practitionersmost degrading proposal of this commission he paused for objections andhalf felt sidonis was about to voice one the silence however was totalokay thanks its not my intention to belittle anyones specialty by implyingthat someone with less training might be able to do exactly what it is they dobut i do want to stress that we generalists are well trained to do some ofthose things we are boardcertified in family medicine not halfassedmedicine we went to medical school just as you did we had residencies just asyou did we care about our patients and continue our education just as you doand most important we recognize our limitations just as i hope you do most of us can handle being treated withthe sort of disdain ive heard expressed here today he looked pointedlyacross the auditorium toward sidonis the impressive silence continued not acough not a clearing of a throat not a creaking of a seat we can handle itbecause we believe in the specialty of medicine we have chosen now wevebecome something of a convenience to the insurance companies and hmos theycall us primary care physicians by that they mean medical traffic copsscreening the mundane and insignificant complaints so that the much moreexpensive specialists wont have to deal with them and thats okay most of ushave adjusted to that new order too just as well adjust to first assistingon simple appendectomies and other operations we have performed dozens of timesourselves or turning our coronary care patients over to someone they dontknow but this harry gestured to the hugescreen behind sidonis on which was displayed the last of the committeesrecommendations this i simply cannot accept you know we doctorspersistently lay the blame for the malpractice crisis on lawyers there are toomany lawyers the contingency system is wrong the way they advertise isinflammatory well that may be so but that is hardly the whole storypatients dont know us anymore we dont portray ourselves as partners in thebusiness of keeping them healthy instead most of us come across as just whatwe are specialists interested only in making sure that the body part we havebecome expert at works properly hey lady im sorry you have to get tobrooklyn i never drive past fortysecond street well i know how to sutureive sutured wounds you wouldnt believe in situations you wouldnt believeim damn good at it so is dr josephson here and marv lorello and every oneof the rest of us who chooses to sew up our patients when they cut themselvesi dont need to be told what i can and cannot fix none of us does so i say enough the return tothe kinder gentler days of the rumpled overworked family practitioner makesfor great conversation around the medical cocktail party circuit but when thechips are down no one s ready to challenge the great god science and to saythat theres still a place for doctors who know their patients as whole peopleand want to care for them regardless of what is wrong i wish that instead oflimiting this session to medical staff members you had invited some of thosepatients to be here once you understand what having a doctor means tothem perhaps you will remember what being a doctor should mean to usthese proposals are all humiliating and unnecessary but this one is even worsethan that dont pass it harry hesitated and then sank to his seatthe heavy silence continued finally steve josephson reached over and took hishand thank you he said hoarsely thanks fortrying then from across the amphitheater the applause began it spreadquickly around the hall until nearly everyone had joined in then they werestanding several of them cheered out loud others rapped on the woodenseatbacks in front of them caspar sidonis sat rigidly in his seat crimsonbeneath his perpetual tan the other members of the committee shifteduncomfortably it appears there is a great deal ofsentiment surrounding this proposal sidonis said after he had finally managedto reestablish his authority i would suggest that perhaps we should tablefurther discussion until our committee can meet again with the riskmanagementpeople and reconsider this issue no lets vote someone shouted out how about another vote on all thoseproposals another yelled suddenly the entire medical staff seemedto be talking and arguing at the same time sidonis bewildered and unsure ofhow to handle the situation looked about for help he was bailed out by thechief of the medical staff a burly orthopedic surgeon who had twice been anailamerican linebacker at penn state okay everyone cool it he barked outthats it thanks i want to thank dr sidonis and his committee for a jobwell done it seems this last issue is controversial enough that we ought tosit on it for a while i know this whole business of who does what is not easyand would like to praise the staff for its courage and the nonspecialtypractitioners for their understanding two physicians booed come on growup the chief snapped we gave dr sidonis and his committee a mandate andthey have lived up to it now i think we owe them a round of applause grudgingly the staff complied thesession ended with a word of praise for the hard work of the sidonis committeeand a plea for understanding and unity among the staff you primary care physicians are still thefoundation of our medical delivery system he said never forget that harry accepted the handshakes andcongratulations of doug atwater steve josephson and a number of the otherstaff members but he knew that while he had helped the gps save face theirloss of stature was severe the groundswell of support following his speech hadnot changed that he worked his way free and headed down toward the exit by theamphitheater stage he was nearly there when caspar sidonis stepped in front ofhim for a moment harry thought the former boxer was going to take a swing athim enjoy your little show while you cancorbett he said its not going to make a bit of difference around here youvealways been a wiseass but this time youve picked the wrong person to fuckwith he whirled and stalked away asking you over for tea doug atwaterasked harry recovered and forced a smile theres something going on with that guyand me something beneath the surface that i donteven know about he said forget about him doug replied comeon let me buy you a coke youre a hell of a guy harry a hell of a guy chapter it was midmorning when harry finisheddictating two discharge summaries and left the hospital for the sixblock walkto his office on west th street the day was cloudless and just cool enoughto be invigorating still despite the weather he sensed the return of thepersistent flatness that had been dogging him for months it was a feelingunlike anything he had ever experienced before even during his year of painand disability and his failure to simply will it away was becomingincreasingly frustrating distracted harry stepped on to lexington avenueagainst the light and narrowly missed walking into a federal express truck hola doc over here the cabby dropping off a fare waved tohim from across the street it took a moment but harry recognized the husbandof one of his obstetrics patients one of his last obstetrics patientshe thought grimly hola mr romero hows the baby heasked once he had made it across the man grinned and gave an aokay sign you need a ride anyplace no no i dont mr romero thanksanyway the man smiled and drove off the brief exchange gave harry a boost hestarted walking again picking up his pace just a little the canary yellow mercedes convertible wasparked by the hydrant in front of the building where harry had a groundflooroffice phil corbett was grinning at him from behind the wheel shit harry whispered it wasnt that he disliked his youngerbrother quite the contrary it was just that phil was harder for him to takeon some days than on others and today was one of those days a mint condition vintage sl withsixteen thousand miles on her phil said motioning him in i just picked herup at my midtown showroom do you have any idea what this babys worth phils formal education had ended onemonth into community college when he gave up trying to compete with harry andjoined the navy three years later he was back in civilian clothes sellingcars the profession was tailormade for his ingenuous smile unclutteredpsyche and perpetual optimism five years after his first sale he bought outthe owner of the agency after that he began to expand now six agencieslater he had two daughters and a son in private school a lovely wife whocouldnt spend what he made even if she wanted to and a three handicap at oneof the most exclusive country clubs in new jersey he also had no troubledealing with lifes big questions he never asked them eight hundred and seventythree thousandfour hundred and ninetytwo dollars and seventythree cents harry said plustax destination and dealer preparation charges you been to see mom tomorrow how do you know how much thiscost i dont thats my total lifetime grossincome i went down to the home last tuesday she didnt know who i was i guess thats the upside of having all thosestrokes very funny phil studied his older brother harry you okay you look terrible thank you well you do bags under your eyes thatthumbnail chewed down again ive got a lot on my mind phil heglanced at his watch listen ive only got a couple of

she calls me a selfish bastard whos threatenedby my brothers moving up in the world and she says maybe a dozen words to mesince why should i have anything bad to say about her she was right phil i

rattled the big five thats okay phil you dont have to sayit harry had discussed the corbett curse withhis brother but only once phils dismissal of the theory was as emphatic asit was predictable on a september first their paternal grandfather just a fewmonths past his seventieth birthday had dropped dead of a coronarytwentyfive years later exactly twentyfive years later their fatherhad his first coronary he was precisely sixty years and five weeks oldon that september first that he didnt die on the spot was both tragicand to harry immaterial the two years he lived as a cardiac cripple werehell for everyone september first the date had been circled onharrys mental calendar since his fathers heart attack but after oneparticular lecture at a cardiology review course he had highlighted it in red it may be due to societalfactors or to genetics the cardiologist had said possibly both but we frequentlysee a pattern in families which i call the law of decades simply put a sonsfirst cardiac event seems often to occur precisely ten years earlier than didhis fathers obviously there are exceptions to the law but check it out ifyou have a fiftyfouryearold man with a coronary and a positive familyhistory theres a good chance his father will have had his first event at agesixtyfour not sixtythree or sixtyfive ten years on the button but physically youre feeling all rightharry phil said right sure sure phil im fine its probablyjust that i havent had a twoweek vacation in almost three years my car isfalling apart and hey believe it or not thats actuallyone of the reasons i stopped by i have a great deal for you on a new cdealers cost not the dealers cost we tell everyone were selling to them atthe real dealers cost a new mercedes just think how much eviell loveit who

with evie okay and dont worry harry if youreally need it im sure something will come along for you to push against after twentyone admissions to parksidehospital joe bevins could close his eyes and tell time by the sounds andsmells coming from the hallway outside his room he even knew some of thenurses and aides by their footsteps especially on pavilion more often thannot he was able to get the admissions people to send him there the staff onthat floor was the kindest in the hospital and knew the most about caring forchronic renal failure patients who were on dialysis he also liked the rooms onthe south end of the floor best of any in the hospital the rooms with viewsof the park and in the distance the empire state building it wasnt a great life having to getplugged in at the dialysis center three times a week and having to be rushedto parkside every time his circulation broke down or an infection developedor his blood sugar got too far out of whack or his heart rhythm becameirregular or his prostate gland swelled up so that he couldnt pee but atseventyone with diabetes and nonfunctioning kidneys it was a case of beggarscant be choosers outside his door two litters rattled byreturning patients from physical therapy one of them a lonely old gal with nofamily had lost both her legs to gangrene now they were just keeping heraround until a nursing home bed became available it could be worse joereminded himself much worse at least he had joe jr and alice andthe kids at least he had visitors he glanced over at the other bed in hisroom the guy in that bed twenty years younger than he was was down having anoperation on his intestines a goddamn cancer operation oh yes joe thought no matter how badit got for him he should never forget that it could always be worse he sensed the presence at his door evenbefore he heard the man clear his throat when he turned a whitecoated labtech was standing there adjusting the stoppered tubes in his square metalbasket you must be new here joe said i am but dont worry ive been doingthis sort of work for a long time the man somewhere in his forties smiledat him he had a nice enough face joe decided not a face he took to all thatmuch but not one that looked burntout or callous either what are you here to draw he asked joes doctors almost always told him whattests they had ordered they knew he liked to know all three specialists hadbeen by on rounds that morning and none had said anything about blood work this is an htbr antibody titer theman said matteroffactly setting his basket on the bedside table theres aninfection going around the hospital everyone with kidney or lung problems isbeing tested oh the technician had an accent of somesort it wasnt very marked and it wasnt one joe could place but it wasthere wherere you from he asked the man smiled at him as he prepared histubes and needle the blue plastic name tag pinned on his coat read gturner phlebotomist trying not to be obvious joe looked down at hisclipon identification badge it was twisted around so that it was impossibleto read you mean originally the man respondedaustralia originally but ive been here in the us since i was a child youhave a very astute ear mr bevins i taught english before i got sick aha i see turner said glancingswiftly at the door which he had partially closed on his way in well thenshall we get on with this just be careful of my shunt turner lifted joes right forearm andgently ran his fingers over the dialysis shunt the firm distended vesselcreated by joining an artery and vein his fingers were long and finelymanicured and joe had the passing thought that the man played piano andplayed it well well use your other arm turner saidhe tightened a latex tourniquet three inches above joes elbow and took muchless time than most technicians did to locate a suitable vein you seem totake all this in stride i like that he said as he gloved then swabbed theskin over the vein with alcohol all those doctors dont keep me alivejoe said my attitude does i believe you im going to use a smallbutterfly iv needle its much gentler on your vein before joe could respond the fine needleattached to a thin clearplastic catheter was in blood pushed into thecatheter turner attached a syringe to the end of the catheter and injected asmall amount of clear liquid this is just to clear the line he said he waited for perhaps fifteen secondsthen he drew a syringeful of blood pulled the tiny needle out and held thesmall puncture site firmly perfect just perfect he said are youokay im fine joe was certain he had said the words buthe heard nothing the man standing beside his bed kept smiling down at himbenevolently all the while keeping pressure on the spot where the butterflyneedle had been im fine joe tried again turner released his arm and placed theused needle and tube in the metal basket good day mr bevins he said youvebeen most cooperative with the first icy fingers of panicbeginning to take hold joe watched as the man turned and left the room hefelt strange detached floating the air in the room was becoming thick andheavy something was happening to him something horrible he called out forhelp but again there was no sound he tried to turn his head to find the callbutton from the corner of his eye he could see the cord hanging down towardthe floor he was paralyzed unable to move or even to take in a breath thecall button was no more than three feet away he strained to move his handtoward it but his arm was lifeless the air grew heavier still and joe felthis consciousness beginning to go he was dying drowning in air and there wasabsolutely nothing he could do about it nothing at all the pattern on the drop ceiling blurredthen darkened then faded to black and with the deepening darkness joespanic began to fade from beyond the nearly closed door to hisroom he heard the sound of the cart from dietary being wheeled to the kitchenat the far end of the hallway next he caught the aroma of food and after twentyone hospitalizations atparkside most of them on pavilion he knew that it was exactlyelevenfifteen seven of the ten chairs in harrys waitingroom were occupied although three of them were taken by the grandchildren ofmabel espinoza mabel an octogenarian graced him with the smile that noamount of pain or personal tragedy had ever erased for long she had high bloodpressure vascular disease hypothyroidism fluid retention a love affairwith rich foods and chronic gastritis for years harry had been holding hertogether with the medical equivalent of spit and baling wire somehow thetherapeutic legerdemain continued to work and because of it mabel had beenable to care for the grandchildren and her daughter had been able to keep herjob harry reminded himself that there were nomabel espinozas connected with the position of director of physician relationsat hollinsmccue pharmaceuticals mary tobin harrys officemanagercumreceptionist oversaw the waiting room from her glassenclosedcubicle she was a stout black woman a grandmother many times over and hadbeen with harry since his third year of practice she was notably outspokenregarding those subjects on which she had an opinion and she had an opinion onmost subjects how did the meeting go she asked as heentered her small fiefdom to check the appointment book meeting that bad huh lets just say that all these yearsyouve been working for a baritone and from now on youll be working for atenor harry said mary tobin grinned at the image what do they know youll make do drc she said youve been through tough times before and you always find theright path keep telling me that any calls i need todeal with just your wife she called a half an hourago is she okay i think so shed like you to call her atthe office harry headed past his three examiningrooms to his office in addition to mary tobin he had a young nursepractitioner named sara keene who had been with him for four years and amedical aide who must have been the twentieth he had hired from the nearbyvocational tech one of that group he had fired for stealing the rest had leftto have babies or more often for better pay sara looked up from her desk andwaved as he passed i heard about the meeting dr c shecalled out cheerily dont worry if one more person tells me not to worryim going to start worrying he said his personal office was a large space atthe very back of the once elegant apartment building in addition to an oldwalnut desk and chairs it contained a trotter treadmill which he had used forcardiac stress tests until the associated malpractice premiums made performingthe tests prohibitively expensive now he used the mill for exercise thewalls of the office once paneled with what evie called elks club pine hadbeen sheetrocked over at her request and painted white they held the usualarray of laminated diplomas certifications and testimonials plus somethingonly a few other physicians could put on their walls a silver star fromvietnam there were also three original oils evie had picked out allcontemporary all abstract and none that harry would have chosen had he beenleft to his own tastes but the majority of his patients seemed to like them there were three pictures in frames on thedesk one was of harry and his parents at his medical school graduation onewas of phil gail and their kids and one was of evie it was ablackandwhite headandshoulders publicity shot taken by one of the citysforemost photographers there were several dozen snapshots of her in his deskthat harry would have preferred in the frame but evie had insisted on theportrait now as he settled in his chair harry cradled the frame in his handsand studied her fine high cheekbones her sensual mouth and the darkintensity in her eyes the photo was taken just before their wedding nine yearsago evie twentynine at the time was then and remained the most beautifulwoman he had ever known he picked up the phone and dialed hernumber at manhattan woman magazine evelyn dellarosa please he saidsetting her likeness back in its spot its her husband evie had been the consumer editor for thestruggling monthly for five years harry knew it was an unpleasant comedown forher from the network television reporting job she had once held but he admiredher tenacity and her commitment to making it back into the spotlight in facthe knew something good was going on in her professional life she wouldnt tellhim what but for her even to mention that she was working on a story with bigpotential was unusual it was three minutes before she came onthe line sorry to keep you waiting harry shesaid i had this technician ready to blow the whistle on the dog lab in thebasement of a building owned by inskin cosmetics and the bastard just wimpedout are you all right if you mean do i spend one minute out ofevery hour not thinking about this damn balloon in my head the answer is imfine they had that meeting at the hospital meeting the sidonis committee report oh oh yes how did it go lets just say i should have taken thatjob with hollinsmccue dawn breaks on marblehead please evie i admitted it what morecan i say he knew there was in fact nothing hecould say that wouldnt make matters worse his decision a little over a yearago to turn down the offer had nearly been the final nail in the coffin oftheir marriage in fact considering that he could count on one hand the numberof times they had made love since then the fallout was probably continuing i got a call from dr dunleavys office alittle while ago she said and a bed on the neurosurgical floor andoperating room time have become available he wants me to come in tomorrowafternoon and be operated on thursday morning the sooner the better as long as its not your headright evie come on listen i know i had promised to come hearyou play at the club tonight but i dont want to now thats fine its no big deal i donthave to play he took care to keep any hurt from hisvoice throughout their dating and the early years of their marriage she hadloved his music loved hearing him play now he couldnt recall the last timehe had been looking forward to this small step back toward the life they hadonce shared but he did understand harry i need to talk to you evie saidsuddenly can you come home early enough for us togo out to dinner of course what gives ill ill talk to you tonightokay should i be worried harry please tonight all right evie i love you there was a pause i know you do harry she said chapter kevin loomis first vice president of thecrown health and casualty insurance company slipped a folder of notes into hisbriefcase straightened his desk and checked his calendar for the followingday he was a meticulous worker and never left for the evening without tying upas many loose ends as possible he buzzed his secretary and turned on a mentalstopwatch in six seconds she was in his office yes mr loomis brenda was fabulous smart organizedloyal and an absolute knockout she was a legacy to him from burt dreiser nowthe president and ceo of the company kevin suspected she and dreiser hadsomething going outside the office but it really didnt matter dreiser hadbumped him up to the corner office over a number of others who had moreseniority and in some cases more qualifications than he did and as far askevin was concerned if dreiser was sleeping with brenda wallace more power tohim do we have anything else we need to takecare of he asked im just getting set to leave for the day second and fourth tuesdays i know shesaid a smile in her eyes i wish you well the poker game for years dreiser whowas a legendary workaholic had uncharacteristically left the office at fouroclock on the second and fourth tuesdays of every month some sort ofexplanation seemed called for brenda was far too efficient and observant notto wonder the poker game fit the bill perfectly now kevin had taken over notonly dreisers former title office and secretary but as far as brendawallace was concerned his seat at the highstakes card game as well secondand fourth tuesdays four oclock in fact dreiser had made a point ofcorroborating the poker story to kevins wife nancy the necessary rite ofpassage up the corporate ladder comfortably explained her husbandstwicemonthly overnights in the city the avowed secrecy surrounding the gameslocation explained the need for her to communicate with him by beeper only ive won maybe once in the four monthsive been playing kevin told brenda dryly i think that might be why burtinvited me into the game in the first place he could tell i was a greenhornlisten seeing as how oak hills has decided to renew with us i think we oughtto do something for them you have the names of the members of the school boardand the head of the union send them each some champagne better still make itchocolates godiva about a hundred dollars worth for each should do fine putsomething nice on the cards right away mr loomis she left after favoring him with a smilethat would have melted block ice his successes were hers and the oak hillsschool system renewal was a triumph the system was huge one of the largest onlong island and by and large its teachers were young and healthy young andhealthy the golden words in any group medical coverage it was a featherin kevin loomiss cap to be sure but the victory really belonged to theroundtable the oak hills system had been apportioned by the society to crownany competition for the contract would come from nonmembers and of coursedealing with nonmember competitors was what the roundtable was all about the oak hills coup was meaningful onanother level as well kevins first four months as burts replacement on theroundtable had been marked by controversy a troubling situation had developedthat had resulted in the groups moving their meetings from the camelot hotelto the garfield suites and the situation had involved kevin but in truthnothing that had happened was his fault hopefully the others saw it that waytoo he had no idea what would happen if they didnt he picked up his briefcase and overnightbag and took some time to survey the panorama of the city the river and thecountryside beyond kevin loomis jr had risen from gofer to first vicepresident from a gerbilvillage corkboard cubicle to a corner office hisparents had they lived would have been proud damn proud of the way he hadturned out he swallowed against the fullness in his throat that memories ofthem always seemed to bring then he headed out toward the elevator bank histransformation to sir tristram knight of the roundtable had begun the garfield suites was on fulton a blockand a half from the world trade center the cab ride downtown from the crownbuilding took twenty minutes kevin rode quietly staring out at the passingcity but seeing little the remarkable changes in his life could not have comeabout much more abruptly had he won the lottery to be sure he was good verygood at what he did which for years had been to sell insurance he had beena member of the industrys million dollar roundtable for sales five yearsrunning a branch manager and then a successful department head at the homeoffice for a relatively young man from the far wrong side of newark thosewere accomplishments enough but suddenly burt dreiser had started invitinghim out to lunch and soon after that to dinner what do you think of what would you do if supposing you were asked to first came the questionsphrased and rephrased over and over again then with kevins responsesapparently acceptable came the secrets the sales forces wellpublicizedroundtable had a counterpart burt explained at the high executive level butunlike the million dollar roundtable which was an industry honor to beextolled in ads on letterheads and on business cards membership in this roundtablewas not only very exclusive but very secret by the time kevin had agreed to become sirtristram replacing burt dreiser as crowns representative he realized that healready knew too much to refuse and remain employed his rewards for acceptingthe appointment were the promotion a generous raise and an annual bonus ofone hundred thousand dollars or one percent of what the roundtable saved ormade that year for crown whichever was higher the deal was dreiser assuredhim on a par with that accorded the other knights following the recent scare a number ofsteps had been instituted by the knights to protect their small organizationand its members adhering to one of them kevin paid off the cabby at gold andbeekman and made a twoblock detour to the garfield suites cutting through astore and doubling back once as well certain he was not being followed heentered the hotel lobby his reservation under the name george trist wasalready paid for anyone trying to backtrack from that name to the source ofpayment would find only a dummy business account with a set of directors who hadlong ago died sir galahad in charge of security did his job well he wasparanoid about details and after the undercover reporter had been discoveredhe had become if possible even more obsessive across the lobby kevin saw sir percivalewaiting for the elevator percivale was with comprehensive neighborhood healthcare the largest managed care operation in the state kevin knew that muchabout the man but no more not his name not his title at cnhc burt told himnot to worry about such things it had been three years before he knewthe names of all six of the other knights their eyes met for just a momentthen percivale was gone kevin glanced at his watch in three hours they wouldbe meeting along with the others on the nineteenth floor he crossed to the registration desk thesecrecy the code names the nature of their projects kevin thoroughlyenjoyed the intrigue and mystery that surrounded their small society andgradually he was learning to cope with the less appealing aspects of it aswell some of the methods employed to achieve their goals and of course theconstant risk of discovery number was a tworoom suite with adecent view of the world trade center kevin stopped in the living room andtwisted open a heineken from the ample supply in the refrigerator then hestripped off his tie and laid his suit coat over the back of a chair he hadjust kicked off his shoes when he tensed he was not alone someone was in thebedroom he was absolutely certain he took a step toward the hallway doorthere were house phones by the elevator he could call galahad or hotelsecurity hello a feminine voice called outanybody out there kevin crossed to the bedroom doorway thewoman in her early twenties if that stood by the edge of the kingsize bedshe had obviously been sleeping and now was brushing out her waistlengthjetblack hair she wore a bit too much makeup for kevins taste but in everyother regard she was perfect her asian features her slender body her highfull breasts her legs perfect her emerald dress was wetsuit tight slit upthe right side to her hip who are you he demanded she set the brush down smoothed the frontof her dress and moistened her lips before she spoke my name is kelly who sent you here i i dont understand kevin glared at her after what happenedwith the reporter surely this was either a joke or some sort of test where did you come from thats a simpleenough question how did you get in here thats another simple question fear sparked in the womans dark eyes a man met me outside the door and let mein each of us was given a room number to wait at i im here to please youin any way that you want just sit down there and stay therekevin said motioning to the bed no he snapped as she reached behind herback for her zipper just sit he stalked to the living room slammingthe bedroom door behind him according to burt dreiser the women hadbeen part of second and fourth tuesdays for most of the roundtables sixyearexistence lancelot who had been there from the beginning was responsible forthem and until two months ago there had never been a problem those knightswho wanted sex had it those who wanted nothing more than a massage or a lovelycompanion for dinner got that the escort service lancelot employed was one ofthe most upscale and discreet in the city but somehow they had beenpenetrated not by a cop but by a reporter kevin snatched up the phone mr lances room please lancelot pat harper of northeast life andcasualty was the only member of the roundtable whom kevin had met beforejoining in stature and appearance harper was anything but a lancelot with anexpansive gut ruddy complexion fat cigar and highpitched laugh that werefar closer to dickens than to camelot kevin had once played in the samefoursome with him during an industrysponsored charity gold tournament and hadbeen beaten by a dozen strokes harper had a wife and three or four grown kidsbeyond that fact kevin knew nothing of the man except of course that heliked young beautiful women lancelot this is tristram kevin saidi thought we decided no more women ah kelly what do you think of hera ten and a half dont you agree yes except shes not supposed to behere oh lighten up my friend life is tooshort we decided no more women from the old escort service kelly andthe others are from a new one dont worry every one of them has beenchecked out there wont be any more screwups the name the reporter had used wasdesiree she had spent two tuesdays with sir gawaine and two with kevin theowner of the escort service had learned of desirees duplicity from one of theother women whom the reporter had tried to interview and who was certain thatthe impostor had recorded her sessions with her two clients at galahadsinsistence the escort company was terminated immediately and roundtablemeetings were moved during the tense questioning that followedthe discovery kevin learned a bit about gawaine the last member admitted tothe group before he was from the very beginning kevin had found the mansbuttondown composure and varsity club accent threatening gawaine seemed tofit right in with the others while kevins hardscrabble newark upbringing madehim an instant outsider now kevin knew that he and gawaine had at least onething in common both were contented family men who had never wanted orreceived more than a massage and some conversation from their escorts apparently however lancelot had beengiven the green light to start up again with a new service kevin was about totell the guy that no more women were to be sent to his room but he rememberedone of burt dreisers warnings about the roundtable so much is at stake dreiser had saidthat nobody trusts anybody the best thing you can do is not to stand out inany way look and act like everyone else and youll do fine kevin had drawn the conformity line atscrewing the women lancelot brought in but he had never mentioned that toanyone in fact if he and gawaine hadnt been asked during galahadsinvestigation whether or not they were actually having sex with desiree no onein the group would have known listen lance he said now dont takeit personally kellys beautiful im very pleased with her i was just makingsure there werent any problems thats all he set the receiver down and returned tothe bedroom kelly slowly stroking her thick mane of ebony hair smiled up athim from the bed is everything okay she asked the sight of her sitting there her rightleg exposed to the hip sent an uncontrollable surge of blood to kevins groin everythings fine he said listen howabout calling room service and ordering dinner get anything you want foryourself ill have a filet medium rare and then maybe a massage are yougood at that i am very good at that she said harry had lived in manhattan for much ofhis adult life but until today he had never been in tiffanys with marytobins help he had freed up the last hour and a half to makeearlierthanusual rounds at the hospital and head home the idea of doingsomething special for evie had been his the suggestion to do it at tiffanyshad been marys now silently humming joe kincaidsrendition of moon river harry tried for george peppards breakfast attiffanys nonchalance as a saleswoman laid one prohibitively expensive gemafter another on the black velvet display cloth this tennis bracelet is quite charmingshe said it has alternating beautifully matched rubies and diamonds each aneighth of a carat my wife doesnt play tennis too often um how much is it though thirtysix hundred sir well then perhaps i could seesomething in a pingpong bracelet eventually he settled on a halfcaratdiamond pendant flanked by two small rubies evie loved precious stones withthe help harry suspected of her exhusband and exsuitors she had amassed asizable collection by the time he started dating her i want to sell every piece i have shesaid soon after they were married so we can buy a camper and drive acrossthe country harry knew that evie had never beencamping in her life and suspected that she would not be too enamored of blackflies and blackened burgers the declaration was part of her commitment tomoving her life out of the fast lane and into whatever lane she perceived himto be traveling eventually though she stopped talking about the simple lifeand put her jewels into a safedeposit box they never did go camping theres nothing to worry about i hope this will mark a new beginning for us everythings going to beall right believe it or not there are places i want to take you whereyou can actually wear this harry considered then rejected any number of messages forthe card before writing simply i love you i need to talk to you withevies words playing over and over in his mind he took a cab to the coop theyhad owned since shortly after the wedding the sixthfloor apartment fivedecentsized rooms and a tiny study was in a wellmaintained building on theupper west side a block from central park over evies eightplus years therethe flat had changed in her words from exquisite to adequate to smalland most recently to depressing i need to talk to you healthmoney the marriage her job could she possibly be pregnant it had been solong since she had needed to speak with him about anything maybe shefinally wanted to clear the air and start over again there were two apartments on the sixthfloor the narrow hallway between them always seemed imbued with evie possibly some combination of her perfume shampoo and makeup as usual thescent evoked powerful impressions of her but this evening harry was toodistracted to pay much attention he knocked once and then used his key harry she called out from the bedroom yes ill be right out from her tone he knew she was on thephone harry set the tiffanys box on thediningroom table and paced idly the apartment was immaculate brightened byseveral vases of freshcut flowers evies trademark an eric clapton albumwas playing on the cd player clapton was one of harrys favorites he wonderedif evies playing it now was significant you want a drink he asked i have a vodka and tonic on the kitchencounter just add a little ice for me she must be off the phone ill be out in a minute i madereservations at the seagrill if thats okay fine harry tried unsuccessfully to readsomething anything into her voice she emerged from the bedroom wearing blackslacks and a red silk blouse the colors looked smashing on her then againmost colors did she kissed him on the cheek nearly an air kiss was it hard getting away from theoffice she asked retrieving her drink not really mary cleared my schedule andcanceled me out with the band she can do anything she sets her mind to hows she doing mary yes harry couldnt remember when evie had lastasked about his office staff or for that matter the guys in the band or hiscoworkers the arthritis in her hips is pretty badbut in general shes doing fine are you okay as well as can be expected i guess she sipped her drink harry gave up tryingto see behind the small talk and instead handed her the necklace she seemedgenuinely charmed and impressed by the gift and immediately replaced the goldchain she was wearing with it this is really very sweet of you shesaid glancing again at the card i just wanted to be sure you know thateverythings going to be okay her smile was enigmatic but there wasunmistakable sadness in her eyes you always tell me that things have ahabit of working out the way theyre supposed to thats me harry corbett mildmanneredgp by day impenetrable philosopher by night well i think this time youve got itright impenetrable one things do have a way of working out she gazed out the window absentlyfingering the pendant the early evening light glowed against her pale skin andhighlighted her flawless profile she was if anything even more strikinglylovely than she had been when they first met you um said you needed tospeak with me even as he heard his voice saying thewords harry cursed himself for not having more restraint if she felt ready tosay something she would have said it she glanced at him and then turned back tothe window ii just wanted to spend some time talking together tonightshe said after all medical science may have broken through the envelope butbrain surgery is still brain surgery i understand harry said but in truthhe was not at all certain that he did so are are you hungry i will be by the time we get there want to walk the question was almostrhetorical evie was invariably in too great a rush to get wherever she wasgoing to walk lets do that she said suddenly letswalk harry this is a beautiful necklace im really very touched harry searched for the cynicism he hadgrown used to from her but found none his fantasies about a return to the lifethey had once had began to simmer evie had already turned and started towardthe bedroom when he realized the phone was ringing ill get it she called out hurryingdown the hall i want to get my purse anyhow harry shrugged and still feeling uneasywent to the kitchen and set his glass in the sink through the eight bosespeakers mounted throughout the apartment eric clapton was reminding him thatnobody knows you when youre down and out down in the hall in the bedroom her handcupped over the mouthpiece of the phone evie was holding a brief hushedconversation no no i havent told him about usyet she said but im going to she set the receiver down and held thediamond pendant up where she could see it at least i think im going toshe murmured chapter galahad gawaine merlin tristram they arrived at the nineteenthfloor conference room atprescribed times in prescribed order and by prescribed routes galahad hadchosen the hotel and meeting room and set up the protocol he had also checkedthe room for listening devices and cameras although the women from the escort servicewere hired to stay the night kevin loomis sir tristram had sent kelly awayan hour or so before he left his room he loved his wife and was satisfied withtheir sex life but every man had his limits nancy did not like givingbackrubs as much as she liked receiving them five minutes of uninspiredkneading was about the best effort she could muster but kelly was tirelessand the sweetsmelling oils she produced from her bag would have pleased apotentate spending an entire night with her would have stretched his willpowerbeyond the breaking point now reasonably relaxed from the perks ofpower kevin checked the time dialed merlins room and allowed the phone toring six times certain that merlin had left he took the elevator to thesecond floor then a different elevator up to the eighteenth the securitymeasures seemed excessive to him but they did heighten the sense of alwaysbeing on the edge of danger and discovery and from games of highway chicken inhigh school to several dozen jumps in his thirties with a skydiving club kevinhad always been drawn to that feeling he took the stairs to the final storychecked the corridor and slipped inside room the stuyvesant suite threeother knights were already there seated at places marked with their roundtablenames on small gold plaques they greeted him with businesslike smiles andnods percivale lancelot and kay arrived next exactly three minutes apart except for galahads having taken absolutecontrol over security there was no leader of the knights they took turnschairing the meetings which began at seventhirty and continued until therewas no more business to transact in tristrams four months with the group twosessions had already gone well past midnight both of them had focused on thesecurity breach by the reporter calling herself desiree for an exhaustingthree hours the knights had grilled kevin and gawaine dissecting theirrecollected conversations with the woman word by word did she ask you about what yourbusiness was what did you say did you mention any of our names what did she seem the most interested in did she ask your lastname did you tell her did you make love with her getundressed with her fall asleep while she was with you did you leave heralone in the room with your wallet your clothes how about yourbriefcase is there any way she could have drugged you throughout the questioning galahad asprime inquisitor had never been antagonistic but there was a coldness abouthim a professionalism that kevin found unnerving even more disconcerting waskevins feeling that the interrogation focused much more on him than ongawaine who radiated selfassuredness entitlement and breeding kevin hadkept himself on red alert during the session and felt indescribable relief whenit was over tonight at some point galahad would bring them up to date on hisinvestigation of the woman kevin hoped it would be the last he ever heard ofthe matter he surveyed the group as the men settledin and readied their notes at thirtyseven he was probably the youngest withgawaine a close second lancelot pat harper was probably the oldest midtolate fifties he guessed every one of the men was accustomed to power andstatus less than half a year ago kevin was nothing more than the employee ofa roundtable member now he was their comrade in arms and he felt certain thatin time as they came to know his resourcefulness and commitment they wouldcome to accept him as their equal okay campers merlin said lets getstarted merlin who was leading the augustmeetings was in his forties and prosperously endomorphic he was intelligentand insightful but his flippant sense of humor seemed to kevin to be out ofplace given the seriousness of the business of the roundtable if anything wenthaywire each of them risked disgrace unemployment fines even prison and whilethe ceos of their companies certainly knew of the existence of their smallsociety there was no proof whatsoever of that connection any comments anecdotes new jokes orbawdy stories before we begin merlin continued okay then finances firstlancelot lancelot put aside the unlit panatela hewas chewing cleared his throat and distributed computer printouts around thetable from the top of a small stack such printouts were the foundation onwhich the roundtable was built our private account currently stands atjust under two hundred and sixtytwo thousand dollars he began that meanswere going to need fifty thousand dollars per member company to bring us backover the sixhundredthousanddollar operating capital we have agreed on everyonesstayed pretty much within his budget except percivale youll have a report onthat yes there was a silent tense exchange betweenthe two men which kevin was in a perfect spot to observe clearly percivalethe man from comprehensive neighborhood health care did not enjoy beingsingled out this was tristrams eighth roundtable session but he was only nowgetting a handle on the various knights the one most respected and perhapsmost feared was galahad an officer with a managed care company percivale onthe other hand seemed to have less influence and carry less responsibilitythan the rest if there was a clique the insiders seemedto be galahad lancelot merlin and possibly kay a wizard with numbers whowas the groups actuarial expert tristram and gawaine still undermiscroscopic scrutiny were regarded as fraternity pledges and percivalethough tolerated seemed like an outsider kevin had once asked his sponsorburt dreiser whether or not there was an inner circle of knights on theroundtable dreisers reply had been a reassuring pat on the back and anenigmatic reminder that total trust takes time ive put the figures together from thepast two months lancelot went on they are excellent as youll see foryourselves perhaps the most significant statistic provided courtesy of sirkay is that the average age of our companies subscribers now is four pointone years below the average for the rest of the companies doing businessin the metropolitan area the knights acknowledged approval of theinformation by tapping their pens on the table kevin did not know the exactfigure but he did know that each of those years translated into tens ofmillions of dollars in payout savings annually the trick was to avoid groupsubscribers who were slow to terminate their older employees or worse thosewho actually hired people over forty weeding out such groups was a skill theroundtable had mastered one by one the other knights made theirreports gawaine was applauded for obtaining the names of at least percentof the women in southern new york state who had had abnormal pap tests in thepast year the tests even those showing only minimal inflammation and nosuspicious precancerous cells would be used to label as a preexistingcondition any cervical cancer occurring within the twelve months allowed bystate law or to exclude those women from coverage altogether other insurersor perhaps medicaid might take them on but that was their problem percivale distributed a printout givingupdated information on the benefits managers of the largest businesses andunions in the area not only such data as income marital status educationautomobile make home value and religious affiliation but also hobbies alcoholconsumption cocaine and marijuana use sexual preferences and a grade on aonetoten scale of approachability the knights voted to court seven of themanagers aggressively merlin called on sir tristram next kevinstill selfconscious in the spotlight felt he stammered far too much in hispresentation his area of responsibility political action had been burtdreisers the insurance industry already had strong lobbies in bothwashington dc and albany so dreiser had concentrated his efforts on a fewkey state legislators the insurance commissioner and one of his deputies inmost cases the only leverage needed was money but the commissioner had been aharder nut to crack it took dreisers private investigator nearly six monthsto get decent photos of the man videos actually sharing his hunting cabinwith a seventeenyearold summer intern from oneonta the information merlin presented at thelast meeting proved correct kevin reported now the commissioner had spokenwith some aides about retiring i have contacted him through our channels andmade it clear that this would be an unwise decision at the present time at themoment he is reconsidering i think he will see things clearly kevin had no idea how the roundtable wouldhandle matters if the commissioner decided to call their bluff according toburt dreiser such a situation had never arisen the secret he said wasmeticulous research and preparation that and never making a request that wastoo far beyond the previous one there were nods of approval from aroundthe table kevin tried for the matteroffact expression with which the olderknights acknowledged success despite the desiree debacle their regard for himwas clearly on the rise and he loved it next to nancys saying shed marryhim dreisers offer of a seat at the roundtable was the most significant eventin kevins life the fact that the group was breaking the law meant little tohim in a highly competitive industry the strong grew stronger and the weakwere doomed collaboration among corporations while technically illegal madeperfect business sense okay brethren merlin said any othercomments on tristrams information suggestions good enough excellent jobtristram excellent now if theres no further business lets have an updatefrom galahad the security chief cleared his throat seta portable tape player on the table and took over the meeting kevin hopedthat his expression at that moment did not reflect the anxiety he was feelingat having the subject of desiree come up again let me bring all of you up to speed onour mysterious escort lancelot has spent a good deal of time interviewing pageproctor the woman who runs the escort service my own man has spoken with severalof proctors employees weve been trying to identify this desiree but so farwith no luck she never gave proctor a phone number instead she called in oncertain nights to see if work was available for her somehow she learned thatproctor had found out she was a reporter she didnt call in for almost amonth then last week she called to see if proctor would grant her anexclusive interview unfortunately page lost her cool completely and cost us achance to find out who desiree is the only thing she did right was to recordthe conversation heres a portion of it he switched on the tape player ive got to know why youve donethis to me i did nothing to you my clients are very upsetive lost an account that was paying over ten thousand dollars a month somevery angry and anxious people are still after me to find out what you havelearned and what you intend to do with the information page i told you im workingon a story about upscale escort services yours was just one of several iworked for what are you going to do withthe story i cant tell you that justyet those people want to know then tell me who they all areand ill invite them to come and ask me you re a very selfishperson do you have any otherquestions she goes on galahad said but thatsthe gist of it all the woman ever admits is that shes working on a storyabout escort services she didnt mention us or the insurance industry once topage weve checked with people at the local tv stations newspapers andmagazines and even a friend at minutes no one knows anything aboutan escort service story i was certain you would have found outwho she is by now percivale said nervously do you think were safe what options do we have lancelot chimedin how can we buy her off if we cant find her first of all kay said we dont haveany idea whether she even knows about us second were not going to allowanyone to blackmail us that is inevitably a losing proposition kay had aristocratic features and a gentlebut persuasive voice from the expressions around the table it was clear hisopinion carried weight galahad shrugged tristram and gawaineswear she didnt ask more than a few passing questions about their line ofwork but neither of them has recordings of their sessions and you can betthis woman does my sense is that shes probably telling the truth when shesays shes working on an escort service story and nothing more but obviously icant be certain so percivale said i dont see how she could have any harddata on us kay said before galahad could answer my guess is the wholethings a coincidence even so maybe we should hold off meetingfor a while percivale offered in fact i move we suspend operations for twomonths no one bothered commenting on the motionmerlin handled the vote which was initially six to zero in favor of continuingon the second and fourth tuesdays percivale at first abstained and then madethe decision unanimous so were done then merlin saidgalahad do you intend to keep trying to find out who this reporter is i do weve come too far to allow anyoneto threaten our work just dont do anything too rash merlinsaid he smiled and added at least not until youre certain none of ourcompanies is carrying a policy on her chapter harry had seen and experienced enough ofwhat could go wrong in hospitals to fear ever being a patient in one each dayevery day thousands of patients were cared for at hospitals in and aroundmanhattan most physicians nurses aides and technicians were dedicatedcompetent and focused but invariably on any given day some werent therewere simply too many patients too many illnesses and too many caregivers withhuman frailties for the system ever to be perfect over his twentyfive years in medicineharry had confronted or heard about all manner of disasters many of thembeyond anything he could have imagined orange juice given intravenously by anurse who had misunderstood a physicians telephoned orders and was toointimidated to call back and question them a lethal dose of medicationadministered to a child because a harried physician omitted a decimal pointbpositive blood inadvertently finding its way into the bloodstream of ananegative patient then there were the countless ivs that emptied far morerapidly than they were supposed to the bedrails carelessly left down and theunanticipated psychoses in response to tranquilizers or sleeping medication along with the preventable disasters werethe socalled complications the documented and accepted percent or percent or percent adverse reactions to medications and invasiveprocedures that were enumerated in the textbooks pdr and packageinserts and were only of concern if they happened to happen to you with such thoughts refusing relegation tothe back of his mind harry made his way through the corridors of mmc to theneurosurgical unit on alexander it was five past eight in the eveningvisitors were streaming toward the exits he had hoped to make it up to thefloor earlier but a longstanding patient of his had been brought to the ervomiting blood now having stabilized the mans bleeding ulcer he had finallybeen able to sign out to the doc on call earlier in the day he had met evie at themain lobby and walked with her to the admissions office he offered to staywith her during the preadmission ritual but she declined she seemedpreoccupied and distracted just as she had the night before certainly thesurgery was on her mind but there was something else harry felt certain ofit the evening before they had walked fromtheir apartment to the seagrill in virtual silence although they talked someduring dinner only one topic of substance was discussed evie made him promiseto fight any attempt to prolong her life if there was brain damage of any kindand as they were walking back to the coop she apologized for not having putthe energy back into their marriage that she might have there was abittersweet finality to the way she said it harry acknowledged the apologybut could not read its significance alexander an l with fifteen rooms oneach arm was in transition from evening to night the corridors were emptyexcept for a nurses aide wheeling a patient back from the lounge and a janitorreadying his large metalenclosed floor buffer the nurses station was midwaybetween the elevators and evies room an attractive redheaded nurse withhighgloss crimson nail polish was seated behind the counter writing notesharry had never seen her before hi im dr corbett he said i know the woman said your wifesdoing fine thats great i spoke to her on the phonea while ago and she sounded okay except she was a little distressed about herroommate the nurses face wrinkled in distasteshes not the only one weve all just about had it up to here with maurahughes i really think there ought to be a hefty tax on alcohol to pay for themedical treatment of people like her dont you i dont understand alcoholics oh i thought your wife toldyou her roommate mauras in the dts unfortunately there are no other emptybeds on the floor evie said she wasnt too bad as long as the librium is working sheisnt she came to the floor from the or three days ago she was on a bigbender and fell down the stairs of her building and fractured her skull the ctscan showed a collection of subdural blood so she had to have it drained shedid great until yesterday when she suddenly began complaining about the spiderscrawling along the ceiling and the ants under her sheet that certainly sounds like the dts oh it is believe me shes disruptedthe whole floor those people are so selfcentered and inconsiderate theynever stop to think of the consequences of their drinking if you know what imean harry had heard enough where had thiswoman been for the last fifteen years sorry to get here after visitors hourshe said but i had a man in the er with a gi bleed is it okay if i visit withevie for a while sure if maurathemoaner gets to be toomuch for you well just tighten her restraints and move her into the hall asa matter of fact shes due to have a visitor soon too her brother called alittle while ago hes a policeman of all things he doesnt get off duty fora while and he wanted to see her i almost told him to bring in a whip and achair well miss he checked her name tag jilson i appreciate your bending the rules for me anytime your wife is very beautiful drcorbett yes yes thank you harry hurriedaway from the woman and down the hall to room so theyre just mean to me meanand nasty they dont like me because they think this goddamn floor is clean asa whistle and i keep pointing out the bugs that are crawling everywhere god ihate bugs i hate them stuckup snobbish knowitalls several doors from the room harry couldhear maura hughess steady stream of babble he had treated every form ofalcohol withdrawal during his residency at bellevue and over his years ofprivate practice in one of the more indigent areas of the city dts deliriumtremens while at times amusing was potentially lethal heart rate uprespiration up core temperature up nervous system irritability marked fluidloss through perspiration and hyperventilation intense fluid intake minimal tonone he had seen studies showing a mortality rate from dts as high as percent and maura hughes was three days post craniotomy as well she was amedical time bomb the last roommate he would have chosen for evie harry glanced down the hall at thejanitor placidly working his buffer from wall to wall he had on a walkman andwas bobbing his head in time to the music totally oblivious to thelifeanddeath dramas being played out all around him harry wondered what itmust be like to have a shiny floor be the extent of ones professionalresponsibility evie had the bed next to the windows andfarthest from the door the curtain separating the two beds was pulled harryglanced at maura hughes as he passed she was restrained to the bed with acloth posy harness her wrists were secured to the bedrails by broad leatherstraps she wasnt old he could tell that much about her but little morebelow her turban bandage dense violet bruises enveloped both of her eyes andran down to the corners of her mouth her oxygen prongs had dislodged from hernose and were ventilating her left ear her cracked arid lips were drawn backin a strange twisted rictus harrys first impression was that she wassnarling at him then he realized that she was smiling hi he said im evies husbandharry double double toil and trouble fireburn and cauldron bubble she replied harry managed a smile of his own andstepped beyond the curtain evie accepted his kiss on her forehead withoutreaction she knows shakespeare he whispered actually she knows a lot of things itsjust that the insects and snakes and spiders keep getting in the way the creepy crawlies it would be sort ofhumorous if the insects and such werent so damn real to her she should bethrough this in another day or so ouch get off my sheet you filthy bughey will someone please come over and help me go say something evie urged try andcalm her down harry walked back around the curtain youre too late gene maura said tohim it bit me and its gone sorry harry realized now that she waseven younger than he had originally thought possibly in her midthirties mynames harry not gene well you look like gene hackman thanks i like gene hackman so do i i thought you were an actor im not why would you think that your pin for a moment harry had no idea what thewoman meant then he remembered the pin his niece phils oldest daughterjennifer had given him it was a tiny depiction of comic and tragic faces aprize she had won for drama at school a year or so ago he had helped her placeit on the lapel of this particular sports coat and there it had remained herarely even thought about it being there maura hughes had identified it fromeight feet away im impressed that you saw this hesaid i notice things suddenly she began squirming and fightingher restraints dammit gene she snapped do you haveany southern comfort on you or not you promised and shit gene watch outright there on the wall by your head what is that a scorpion a shrimp in spite of himself harry glanced at thewall try and get some rest he said he returned to his wife who was lyingalmost flat in bed staring up at the ceiling dont shut me out he wanted to insist afternine years on this of all nights why cant you share some of whats going oninside you there are no empty beds on the wholefloor he said instead no place to move either of you if the nurses cantmedicate her anymore perhaps they can give you something i dont want anything she said withoutturning her gaze from the ceiling i want my brain functioning at maximumcapacity right up until the last possible moment i understand youre going to do fineit was then harry saw the iv a bag of percent dextrose in water hangingfrom a ceiling hook nestled in the dividing curtain delivering tiny dropletsthrough flowcontrol tubing when did that go in a few hours ago i didnt even notice it i wonder whythey put it in tonight and not in the or tomorrow do you know who ordered it the anesthesiologist i think the ivnurse said hmm what difference does it make none i guess a prolonged uncomfortable silencefollowed look harry she said suddenly i thinki need to be alone the words hit him like a slap he staredat her uncertain how to respond could you please tell me whats goingon he said finally nothings going on i i just have alot on my mind she took a deep breath her tension seemed to ease a bitlook they said i could eat until midnight ill tell you what im dying foran extrathick chocolate malt from alphanos pick me up one then well talkokay alphanos ice cream emporium was twoblocks beyond their coop a fifteenminute drive from the hospital if thetraffic was reasonable but harry felt grateful to have something anything to contribute done he said rising ill be backwithin the hour and we dont have to talk ill be happy just to hang with youfor a while he bent to kiss her but again there was noresponse he settled for another peck on her forehead gene gene lean and mean keep him looseand keep him clean maura hughes sang as he passed out in the hall the buffer man hadstopped his work and was kneeling down walkman still in place scowling at themotor of his machine when harry walked by harry felt strangely pleased to seethat the mans life wasnt so uncomplicated after all farther down the hall the nurse suejilson smiled up at him as he approached leaving so soon my wife asked for a milk shake thatsonly made at a place on west ninetieth i can be back by ninethirty if thatsokay no problem would you like one thanks but no thanks i made a deal withmy jeans to keep fitting in them hows the moaner agitated and a bit disoriented she couldprobably use some more medication if its ordered ill check theres nothing any of uslike better than sedating maura thanks see you in an hour harry drove to the west side through a mistyrain and fairly heavy traffic the line in alphanos was longer than usual theservice slow enough to be irritating he ordered an extrathick chocolate maltthen wondering if maura hughes might be lured out of orbit he ordered asecond one if she couldnt handle it he would make the sacrifice it was ninethirty by the time he left theicecream parlor and close to ten when he reentered the hospital aftervisitors hours only the main entrance was open harry crossed the desertedlobby and flashed his plastic id at the security guard whose desk blocked themain corridor to the hospital ive got to have you sign in doc theman said after nine harry scribbled his name and destinationthe guard glanced at it alexander nine he said you going upthere for the code ninetynine at that instant the overhead page beganurgently summoning dr richard cohen to alexander harry hurried toward the elevatorssomething had happened to maura hughes he was thinking she hadnt looked thatgreat when he left but she certainly hadnt seemed in imminent danger thensuddenly he remembered that richard cohen was a member of the sameneurosurgical group as ben dunleavy evies neurosurgeon cohen was undoubtedlycovering for the night gripped by an intense foreboding harry kept jabbing atthe elevator call button until one of the doors slid open the ride up toalexander took an eternity room was halfway down the far arm ofthe l the nurses station and near corridor were deserted harry set downthe bag from alphanos and sprinted down the hallway his heart pounding in histhroat it took only a moment after he rounded the corner to have his worstfears confirmed there were half a dozen nurses and med students standing outsideroom craning to catch a glimpse of the action maura hughes stillrestrained in her bed had been pulled to the far side of the corridorstanding beside her stroking her hand was a young uniformed policeman harry raced past them all and into theroom the scene was one he had witnessed orparticipated in hundreds of times over the years the monitors the lines thecrash cart the defibrillator the nurses physicians and technicians movinggrimly from equipment to bedside and back like a platoon of army ants onlythis time at the center of the controlled chaos intubated through her noseand being ventilated by a rubber bag was his wife the cardiac monitor showeda regular rhythm every ten seconds or so though her arms extended to the maximumand rotated inward turning her palms away from her body in an eerily unnaturalposition decerebrate posturing a horrible prognostic sign almostcertainly her aneurysm had blown he moved to the bedside the nurse suejilson was the first to realize he was there when did this happen he asked the neurosurgical resident who was runningthe resuscitation looked up this is dr corbett her husband thenurse explained oh sorry the resident said heraneurysm appears to have ruptured dr cohen is covering for dr dunleavy ijust got word that hes on the way up what happened harry asked i left herjust a little over an hour ago and she was fine sue jilson shook her head about half an hour after you left i wentin to medicate maura i heard a moan from behind the curtain when i lookedyour wife had vomited and was barely conscious the initial blood pressurereading i got was three hundred over onefifty one pupil was already largerthan the other harry stared down at evie his mindunwilling to connect what he was seeing with what he knew of cerebralhemorrhaging he reached down and gently lifted her eyelids both of her pupilswere so wide that almost no iris color could be seen he felt numb dreamlikeit was already over dr richard cohen rushed into the room healready knew the patients history he breathlessly told the resident theresident gave him a capsule summary of the past thirtyeight minutes youve done everything right cohen saidas he examined the inside of evies eyes with an ophthalmoscope he quickly checked her reflexes andresponse to pain then he used the end of his reflex hammer to firmly stroke anarc along the soles of her feet from heel to great toe the babinski reflex the great toe pulling up instead of curling down was a grave grave sign thather cerebral cortex the thinking part of her brain was no longer influencingthe movements of her body harry watched stunned well get a ct scan cohen said grimlybut in all honesty i dont think we can get her to the or the brain swellingis enormous both of her optic discs are showing severe papilledema papilledema the optic nerve engorgementcaused by marked usually irreversible pressure within the skull the findingmade the evolving scene even more surreal she she doesnt want any heroicmeasures harry heard himself saying arterial lines in another residentcalled out her systolic is still twoninety thats very strange cohen said wevegiven her a huge amount of antihypertensives already but her pressure hasntbudged but wouldnt you expect her pressure tobe up like this with a large hemorrhage harry asked temporarily maybe most cns bleeds dohave a period of marked rise but they almost always respond to conventionaltreatment and the residents have already gone well beyond that oh god harry whispered still feelingdetached and unreal well keep trying to get her pressuredown the neurosurgeon said and well get a ct to document what we alreadyknow meanwhile harry difficult as it is under these circumstances theressomething you should be thinking about i understand harry murmured evie was a young completely healthywoman whose only organic problem was her aneurysm at the moment she was thesort of prize coveted by every organ transplant specialist a source of lifeor sight for any number of people lets get the scan and then ill let youknow harry said meanwhile go ahead and begin tissue typing chapter after half an hour the battle to controlevies astronomical blood pressure was finally won but everyone involved inthe case knew that the war had already been lost harry stood helplessly by thedoor as the respiratory technician adjusted the controls on the ventilator thatwas now evies only link to life there were ivs in both her arms and tubesinto her stomach bladder and lungs every minute or two in response tonothing in particular her entire body would tighten and extend into a decerebrateposture this nightmarish scene was one he had witnessed many times in hisprofessional life and in nam but emotionally he had never become very adept atdealing with it there was inevitably a part of himunwilling to accept the simple truth that it was over wait give me another fiveminutes just be patient this womans going to get right up and walk out ofhere youll see no thank you he replied to a nurse whooffered him coffee i ive got to call evies folks he glanced at the corridor behind himmaura hughes seemed calmer her brother a carrottop with a face too youthfulfor the uniform he wore continued stroking her hand as he watched theunfolding horror in room it was quarter of eleven the ct scanner would befree in five minutes blood samples had been sent off to the lab for tissuetyping on the way back from the ct scan assuming nothing had come up thatwould send her to the operating room evie would get the first of what would probablybe a series of electroencephalograms two flat or near flat eegs twelve hoursapart were considered to be the electrophysiologic equivalent of death harryreached up unaware and brushed aside a tear that had worked its way to the topof one cheek corbett what in the hell is going onhere still halfdazed harry turned toward thevoice caspar sidonis stood several feet away hands on hips his expressionpinched and angry i dont know what youre talking aboutharry managed but right now im a little busy you see my im talking about evie dammit sidonissnapped oh never mind he pushed past harry and into the roomrichard cohen the neurosurgeon was again checking evies eyes sue jilson wason the other side of the bed adjusting the iv dick what happened here sidonis asked oh hi caspar this woman a patient ofyours no shes shes a close friend well her husband is right over th i dont want to hear from him dick iwant to hear from you tell me what happened it was a demand not a request cohentaken aback by the physicians aggressiveness quickly regained his composure you know she was preop for repair of aberry yes yes of course i know well a little while ago sue jilsonhere came in and found her unresponsive with one blown pupil and a systolicpressure of over three hundred weve thrown the whole pharmacy at her andweve still had a bitch of a time getting her pressure down to onethirtywhere it is now meanwhile her other pupils blown she has bilateralpapilledema indicative of massive intracranial pressure and shes posturing jesus sidonis looked shaken from the doorway harry watched stunnedas the cardiac surgeon reached down and took one of evies hands gently in histhen with his other hand he caressed her cheek richard cohen looked onnonplussed sue jilson was wideeyed dick does she have any chance at allsidonis asked to any physician let alone one ofsidoniss pedigree the answer to the question was inescapable theneurosurgeon looked at him queerly i um i dont think so casparhe said were waiting to take her down for a ct and an eeg was he in here with her sidonisgestured toward the doorway pardon it was only now that harry shook off hisown reluctant fascination with what was transpiring and moved into the room asfar as he knew sidonis and evie might have met in passing at some staff partyor other but certainly she had never spoken of the man caspar do you know my wife sidonis whirled like a startled cat youknow damn well i do were you in here with her before before thishappened of course i was with her shes my wifenow just what in the hell dick was anyone else in here after him what i said was anyone else in here with evieafter corbett sidonis was nearly shouting caspar calm down calm down cohensaid lets go out in the hall and talk leaving the respiratory technicianbehind the three physicians left the room followed by sue jilson now whats this all about cohenwhispered does this have something to do with the meeting this morning sidoniss fury was barely under controlhe spoke loudly without regard for maura hughes her brother or the tworesidents standing nearby all i asked was whether anyone else cameinto this room between the time corbett excuse me dr corbett leftand the time evie was found i think i can answer that question suejilson said there was no one else dr corbett didnt leave untileightfortyseven thats in my notes the only way on to the hall after eightis through the elevators and past the nurses station officer hughes thatsmauras brother the man with her over there arrived on the floor aroundninethirty but we were already in with mrs corbett you can check with alicebroglio the other nurse on the floor but im sure shell confirm what ivesaid i knew it sidoniss fists wereclenched caspar will you please tell us what thisis all about cohen demanded ask him harry i have no idea whats going on harrysaid bullshit sidonis snapped evie wasleaving you to be with me and you know it she told you so last night at therestaurant she took you to the seagrill see i even know the place now whatdid you do to her you son of a bitch harrys burst of anger and hatred wasalmost immediately washed away by a consuming despair there was no reason forhim to doubt what he was hearing evie and goddamn caspar sidonis suddenly somuch made sense the months and months of coolness and distance the odd hoursshe kept the trips out of town the excuses for avoiding sex yesterdayscryptic call harry i need to talk to you sidonis youre lying he wanted to shout you sonof a bitch youre lying but he knew the man wasnt for months he hadfelt as if he was battling a persistent inexplicable sadness now heunderstood what he was really responding to without another word he left thegroup and walked back into room give me a minute will you he said tothe respiratory technician ill call you if theres any problem he turned off the bright overhead lightpulled a chair to evies bedside and sat down beside him the ventilatorwhirred softly then delivered a jet of oxygenenriched air into evies lungspaused then whirred again it had been nearly ten years since they first met tenyears they had been fixed up by a mutual friend who felt certain that eachwas exactly what the other needed harry would acquire adventure spontaneityand some stamps in his nearly barren passport evie would get some desperatelyneeded serenity and stability she would be the sail he the rudder and it hadworked too at least for a while in the end though she never was able tochange in the ways she had hoped to she just just wanted more thatsall dammit evie he said softly whycouldnt you at least have talked to me told me what was going on whycouldnt you have given us a chance he reached through the bedrail and tookher hand it had been stupid and naive to believe she could become a differentperson or even that she truly wanted to a hand settled gently on his shoulder harry are you okay doug atwater looked down at him withconcern huh oh hi doug actually no no imnot okay at all whats with sidonis hes over at thenurses station right now phoning the medical examiner and the police i askedhim what was going on and he just glared at me for a moment i thought he wasgoing to tell me to go screw myself harry shook his head this was anightmare the medical examiner the police doug i dont know whats going onevies aneurysm has blown shes not going to make it oh god sidonis just announced that hes beensleeping with her and that she was going to leave me for him he thinks shetold me so last night but she didnt oh harry im so sorry pal yeah what are you doing here at thishour anyway anneke and i were at a film i just stoppedby to pick up some papers and the guard downstairs told me what was going oni left anneke in my office and came up here why is sidonis calling thepolice harry loosened his grasp and moved awayfrom the bed the thought of caspar sidonis touching his wife was at oncesaddening and repulsive i was the last one in with her he mustthink actually i dont give a shit what he thinks he left the room with doug atwater closebehind transportation had just arrived to bring evie down for her scanrichard cohen looked at harry and shrugged harry caspars gone to call the me andthe police hes sure you gave your wife something to cause her pressure toskyrocket some sort of pressor drug i think maybe i should call bob lord andowen let them know whats going on lord was the chief of the medical staffowen erdman was president of the hospital call anybody you want harry said thisis ridiculous ill call owen atwater offered issidonis crazy or what richard i dont know about crazy theneurosurgeon replied but hes definitely furious harry he says he spoke toyour wife just as you two were leaving the house last night and that she sworeshe was going to tell you about the two of them she didnt tell me anything well listen weve got to get goingill call lord from x ray stick around here will you as soon as ive seenthe ct ill be back up to speak to you the eeg tech is on the way in but shelives in the bronx with the respiratory technician breathingfor evie with a rubber ambu bag the transportation worker guided her bedtoward the elevator cohen and sue jilson followed along with the tworesidents who had remained nearby at cohens request doug atwater glanced over at maura hughes evies roommate harry explained thecops her brother shes in the dts in the dts right now i think theyve got her pretty heavilymedicated doug i just dont believe this is happening atwater led harry over to a molded plasticchair and motioned him to sit you going to stay here in the hospitalhe asked lowering to one knee i i guess so at least until thestudies are all back cohen wants my permission to have evie donate her organsim probably going to have to decide before morning oh shit atwater knew them as a couple about aswell as anyone at the hospital did he had been a dinner guest at their hometwice and had doubledated with them on at least two other occasions althoughthe last time was probably two or three years ago he was charming outgoingand at times especially when he had had a few drinks extremely witty morethan once evie had spoken of fixing him up with one or another of her friendshowever harry recalled now as their marriage deteriorated she had stoppedsuggesting a fixup and instead frequently encouraged him to join doug for aboys night out small wonder i thought sidonis was married harrysaid not as long as ive been here he has akid or two somewhere i know that much but mostly hes married to the or plushis stockbroker his publicity agent and of course his mirror i had evenheard rumors he was gay harry laughed bitterly guess not he said listen harry id better go call owen ineed to check on anneke too do you want me to say something to sido nevermind here he comes sidonis bore down on them the medical examiners called the lab andordered some blood samples on evie he announced triumphantly and theres adetective dickinson on his way over hed like it if you could stay until hegets here im not going anyplace but i havenothing to say to him or anyone else you bring in caspar doug said why are you doingthis sidonis eyed the executive suspicouslyclearly he had placed atwater among the enemy you really dont know he said finallyevie and i have been seeing each other for over a year last night she toldharry she was leaving him tonight she checks in here with perfectly normalblood pressure and not one symptom of her aneurysm for a month he goes intoher room shes fine he leaves and not half an hour later her bloodpressures three hundred plus and her aneurysm has blown wouldnt you besuspicious atwater held the surgeons gaze if i didnt know harry corbett i mightbe he said but youre way off base and if what you say is true about youand this mans wife someone ought to kick the shit out of you for busting uptheir marriage now if youll excuse me im going to phone owen erdman andlet him know what youve been up to harry ill be back a little later becool now just a second sidonis protestedhurrying after him if youre calling erdman i want to talk with him he was still railing when he and dougatwater disappeared around the corner of the hallway suddenly the corridorwas silent um excuse me huh harry looked around maura hughessbrother still by her bedside cleared his throat and selfconsciously smoothedhis uniform shirt harry noticed the three stripes on his immaculate uniform asergeant then im tom hughes he said his speech freeof all but a hint of new york mauras my sister hi harry said flatly he feltembarrassed that the policeman had been witness to sidoniss outburst anddisclosure but in truth not that much i um im sorry for what youvebeen going through thanks maura says youve been very kind to herhe looked back at where his sister lay she was asleep and snoring somewhatunnaturally i guess the sedation has kicked in it would seem so look i dont mean to butt in butstanding where ive been it was impossible for me not to hear yeah harry felt suddenly awkward sitting healso felt incapable of maintaining a conversation even one as superficial as thishe stood up and pushed the plastic chair away with the toe of his shoe hestill hadnt called evies family maybe he should call steve josephson aswell in anticipation of evies surgery he had already canceled his morningpatients and signed out to steve until one maybe he should call and make itthe whole day look im sorry for blabbering on likethis hughes said i know youve got a lot on your mind and the weight of theworld on your shoulders but theres something i really need to tell you harry hesitated then crossed thecorridor that doctor hughes went on in a nearwhisper the darkhaired one the one who claims yes yes i know who you mean sidonis well dr sidonis seems to be making abig deal over the report from the nurse that you were the last one in with yourwife before she got so yes well you werent what you werent the last one there was a manin with her shortly after you left a doctor in fact are you sure tom hughes thought for a few secondsbefore he responded pretty sure he said finally no makethat very sure but but how do you know that again the policeman hesitated his gazefixed on one of the bed wheels when he looked at harry again his expressionwas sheepish my sister told me so he said chapter im sure she doesnt look it to you rightnow but maura really is a very special very talented very good person after just a few minutes of conversationwith tom hughes several things had become quite clear to harry althoughyoung hughes was very intelligent and as sharp as any policeman he had evermet and despite his older sisters obvious problems he was absolutely devotedto her he was also convinced that the man she claimed to have seen enter herhospital room had actually been there a doctor in a white clinic coat came inshortly after you left hughes related to harry maura was apparentlyhollering at the time she said something to me about the nurses never payingany attention to her unless she makes noise the doctor smiled at her strokedher forehead leaned over and whispered to her to just relax then he wentaround the curtain spoke with your wife for a short while and left he was inhis thirties or early forties five foot eight or so with brown hair closelycut unusually dark brown eyes a large diamond ring on the little finger ofhis left hand and a blue and green clipon tie a clipon how could she know that im telling you drunk or sober or evenin the dts my sister is a remarkable woman shes an artist a painter andshe has an incredible eye for detail harry recalled the quickness with whichshe had spotted his lapel pin i notice things she had said well maybe some doctor came up the backway or slipped past the nurses slipped past the nurses maybe tom saidbut not came up the back way the door is locked and alarmed after eight thenurse warned me about that when i called to ask if i could come in latetonight anyone who comes on or off any floor in this building after eight hasto come by elevator and check in at the nurses station i guess i knew that harry said i meanive only worked here for a decade or two why didnt you say something aboutthis mystery doc to sidonis or the nurses the way things were going down therereally wasnt much chance for me to say anything to anyone besides theyrenot very fond of my sister here on alexander nine i hardly think they wouldgive much credence to anything she has to say especially if it conflicts withwhat they say i think youre probably right it was after eleven now rather thandisturb the overextended staff on alexander the two of them had wheeledmaura back to her spot in room fifteen minutes later the call harrydreaded had come from neurosurgeon richard cohen evie was still in the ctscanner but the initial images were as bad as they had feared the hemorrhagewas massive the rapid swelling and pressure had forced a portion of her brainthrough the bony ridge at the base of her skull totally and irreversiblycutting off circulation to her cerebral cortex the gray matter responsiblefor all thought surgery was no longer even a longshot possibility all thatremained was a series of eegs and a decision as maura hughes continued her stertorousunnatural sleep harry sat opposite her brother in the dimly lit room as muchas he wanted to be alone to sort out what had transpired with sidonis and todeal with the decision he would shortly be asked to make he was grateful forthe mans company no ones been able to explain to me whatthe dts is or why my sister got it hughes said she definitely was on abender when she fell but i know a lot of people who are much heavier drinkersthan she is and never seem to get into trouble most alcoholics coming off alcohol justget the shakes and some intestinal stuff harry explained there are tworeally frightening things they can get seizures and dts seizuresusually happen in the first day or two the dts come on later two days to aweek or even more after the last drink we have no way of predicting whethertheyll happen at all but mauras pretty damn lucid about somethings even while shes seeing the bugs and such all i can say is that is not unusualthe mix of fantasy and reality is unexplainable you know i take care of afairly large number of alcoholics in my practice many of them have been soberfor years some of them against monstrous odds if you and she would like i canhave one or two of them stop by and speak with her you mean aa possibly ive tried to get her to go to aa butshe never would go too much pride i guess maybe you should take some videos orpolaroids of her right now tom hughes grinned at the suggestion maybe i should at that he said drcorbett do you mind if i ask you a little about whats going on between youand that other doctor sidonis harry shrugged i think youveheard most of it already he claims my wife has been having an affair with himand that she planned to leave me for him he thinks she told me all about itlast night at the restaurant we went to he even knew the name of the placenow that i look back on our evening i think evie actually wanted to tell mebut she never did so you believe him i mean there is anotherpossibility he could have been obsessed with your wife and followed you tothat restaurant harry looked down at the floor andswallowed at the fullness that had again begun building in his throat no he said finally i believe him and he thinks that because of what youknew you gave something to your wife to to what to send her blood pressure up high enoughto cause her cerebral aneurysm to rupture god are there such drugs a number of them actually theyrecalled pressors we use them to treat shock which essentially is dangerously lowblood pressure so this stuff this pressor medication is what injected or is it a pill or a liquid of some sort harry smiled grimly no no he said not by mouth thepatients who need a medication like that are in too much trouble to takeanything be what is it dr corbett harry was on his feet maybe nothing he said but it justoccurred to me evie had an iv in her arm dfivew five percent sugar waterit was what we call a ko infusion keep open just fast enough to keep theplastic catheter in her vein from clotting off so it seemed a little unusual to me that sheshould have one in place the night before her surgery especially when she hadbeen so stable for so long i even asked her who ordered it she thought it wasthe anesthesiologist but usually they establish their ivs in the or heheaded out of the room if anyone calls im at the nurses station ill beback in a few minutes the order in evies chart read dw cc ko cchr to dr baraswatti to telephone order harry skimmed through therecord baraswatti had seen evie late in the afternoon for the preoperativehistory and physical required of every patient who was to receive generalanesthesia fourfifteen the nurses note read however the order forthe iv wasnt phoned in until sixthirty harry dialed the hospital operatordr baraswatti was still the anesthesiologist on duty in the hospital he madeno attempt to mask the fact that harrys call had awakened him i dont know what youre talking aboutdr corbett he said in a clipped indian accent i always insert my ivs inthe operating room why should i wish to do otherwise i i dont know harry mumbled heset the receiver down as the anesthesiologist was asking if there were anyother questions he could answer harry sat on the edge of the counter andcarefully reviewed evies chart she had arrived on alexander at onethirtyat fourthirty the anesthesiologist had come up examined her and writtenpreoperative orders at sixthirty someone claiming to be that anesthesiologisthad called the floor nurse and ordered a keep open dextrose infusion to be putin place the nurse had notified the intravenous nurse on duty for thehospital at sixfifty the iv nurses notes stated she had placed an gaugeangiocath in evies left hand a few hours later at least according to maura hughesa physician had entered their room and a short time after that eviesaneurysm had burst either as a result of or resulting in a systolicblood pressure of over three hundred now caspar sidonis was accusing harry ofthe intravenous injection of some sort of pressor that had caused thecatastrophe was it possible harry was being set up by sidonis the physiciandescribed by maura real or figment bore no resemblance to the arrogantcardiac surgeon who was significantly taller than five eight and had thickjet hair and a mustache something was wrong very wrong bewilderedand apprehensive harry returned to room maura hughes was awake and thrashingabout right after you left she started moaninglike she was in pain or maybe having a nightmare tom explained thensuddenly like a shot she woke up shes all over the place right nowfighting the restraints and hallucinating even worse than she was before go ahead and ring for the nurse harrysaid noting that maura was drenched in sweat he toweled her face off andassured himself that her iv was open and running she looked stressed but notin danger its probably just the sedation wearing off none of the medicinewe use actually changes whats going on in a dt patients head all it does isblunt their reaction to it ill check her over gene gene dont be mean maura sangthrashing against her restraints she smiled up at him and suddenly adopted adixie accent that would have made scarlett ohara proud i swear on mymothers grave darlin if youd just get these fuckin bugs off me id be allright id be fine using his own stethoscope and pocketophthalmoscope harry did as good an exam as possible under the circumstancesmaura neither helped him nor fought him instead she kept up a constant verbalstream as she tried to brush away the crawlies the nurse checked in over theintercom she was in the conference room getting the changeofshift reportunless there was real trouble she would be in after they were done i dont find anything to worry aboutharry said to tom i think were just seeing what her condition is likewithout the mask of tranquiliz hey im looking for someone namedsidonis dr cash sidonis something like that harry and tom turned toward the door asallow balding man in a polyester suit stood appraising them he was holding afrayed spiralbound stenographers notepad from which he had read sidonissname his small sunken eyes were enveloped in shadow from six feet away harrycould smell a two or threepackaday tobacco habit lieutenant dickinson tom exclaimed squinting the man bobbed his finger attom trying to place him the yalie right tom grimaced yes i guess you could call me that imtom hughes this is dr harry corbett harry this is lieutenant albertdickinson hes a detective in the twoeight they have an opening for adetective there that ive

imagepeople think being a yalie is to your credit but a lot of us who work thestreets aint so sure a lot of us look for the guy with the degree from thecollege of hard knocks if you know what i mean good ol fuck u his hoarse laugh dissolved into a hackingcough tom remained outwardly unfazed harry wondered if the mans abominablerudeness was some sort of test they call anyone they think graduatedfrom college a yalie tom explained pleasantly enough in my case not thatit matters it happens to be true corbett huh dickinson said yourethe guy sidoniss complaining about after i talk to him i want to talk toyou bastard must have some clout to have them send me here on a night likethis some fucking clout dammit get off me maura shoutedboogery little ants get off im sick of this dickinson glanced over at herdispassionately whozis he said jerking his head toward the bed shes um shes my sistermaura tom said forcing himself to stand just a bit straighter harry noticed that one of toms fists the one out of dickinsons line of sight was clenched dickinson peered at mauraagain in ten seconds his assessment was complete maura hughes was a hopelessdrunk hey do you two know why the irish gotthe whiskey and the arabs got the oil he asked suddenly give up itsbecuz the irish got to pick first he was launching into another mucous laughwhen maura spat at him from eight or so feet away she missed by only a foot bitch dickinson muttered checking tobe sure he hadnt been spattered pinhead maura shot back the nightshift nurse interrupted via theintercom is there a detective dickinson in theroom if there is you were supposed to check in at the nurses station beforegoing into any patient room also dr sidonis is here to see you hes in theconference room by the nurses station dickinson looked at harry dont go awaycorbett he said you neither yalie he shoved his notebook in his suitcoatpocket and left the room tom waited until he was certain the man was out ofearshot this is not going

leading candidate to get the promotion but as you just heard younever know i really couldve done without this little encounter with albertd sorry its not your fault look dont worryabout him albertll annoy you with a few questions from the detectives howtomanual just to have something to put on his report then when he realizesthere isnt any reason to suspect foul play hell leave and spend the nexthour or two at dunkin donuts but there is harry said is what reason to suspect foul play chapter harry recounted in detail for tom hugheshis call to the anesthesiologist and his review of evies chart he was justfinishing when evie was wheeled back in shaken by the sight of her harryrealized that he had already begun to think of her of their life together inthe past tense to all intents the woman he had been married to for nine yearswas dead the eeg showed a little activityrichard cohen reported as she was being reconnected to the monitoring andrespiratory systems but not much certainly not enough to keep the variousteams from moving forward if you give the word as you know time is prettycrucial here organs do begin to break down i know harry said when do you plan todo a second eeg ten in the morning harry looked down at his wife over histwentyfive years as an md he had shared every conceivable experienceinvolving death and bereavement but none of those experiences prepared him forthis a few short hours ago she was the most important person in his life afew short hours ago sidonis or not they still had the chance to turn theirmarriage around to make it work again but suddenly it was over and now hewas being asked to validate evies death by authorizing the donation of hervital organs he had always been supportive to families in such situationswhen he needed them the right words had come but he had never had to make thedecision himself leave the papers at the nurses stationhe heard himself say ill sign them before i leave but i want to see her inthe morning before anyone moves ahead with this ill see to it cohen thanked him murmured a briefsomewhat uncomfortable condolence and left the room moments later heradjustments on the ventilator completed the respiratory technician followedsue jilson checked evies blood pressure and monitor pattern and then turnedto harry the ct tech took this off your wife shesaid coolly handing harry the diamond pendant from tiffanys i didnt seeany sense in putting it back on her harry looked at her stonily i do he said he hooked the necklace back in place whenhe turned around again he and tom hughes were alone with the two patientsmaura continued her almost nonstop prattle pausing only to pick tormentors offthe bedclothes the ventilator connected to evie again was whirring softly asit provided oxygen to organs that were now of value only when consideredindividually tom turned off the overhead light leavingonly the dim overthebed fluorescents im really sorry for everything youregoing through he said harry glanced over at his wife thanks harry managed to say if you want to talk some more about it ihave the time and im not at all tired in the hall maybe harry said not inhere they dragged their chairs outside thedoor the corridor was dimly lit and silent save for the white noise of nightin the hospital you dont have to keep talking about yourwife if its too hard for you hughes said it actually might help okay just dont be embarrassed to tellme to shut up i confess that as a cop what little youve told me so far hasme intrigued what do you think is going on i have no idea theres probably astupid simple explanation for everything the nurse who took the telephoneorder got the anesthesiologists name wrong some md friend of ours wason the floor seeing another patient and stopped by to see evie thats two simple explanations inmy experience when you need to invoke more than one explanation for thingshappening coincidentally none of them is the true story would you mind goingback into the room with me for a minute harry considered the request thenfollowed him in hughes began pacing deliberately aroundfirst mauras bed then evies checking the wails the light switches and thebeds themselves maura watched him curiously rather than assume the most benignexplanation tom said continuing his inspection for the moment lets assumethe worst some doctor or perhaps someone planning to pose as a doctor called in an order to have an iv started in your wifes arm and gave the realanesthesiologistondutys name later he entered this room unseen by thenurses spoke to my sister then administered a pressor drug to your wife thenhe left the floor again managing to avoid being spotted by anyone we need amotive for why he would have done such a thing and an explanation as to how hecould have made it on and off the floor without being spotted dickinson made it in here without beingseen one way he did the nurses were in theirchange of shift report when he came on the floor but having two suchopportunities onto the floor then off again let alone planning on them isasking a bit much so what are you looking for now places where our mystery doctor mighthave left a fingerprint or two too bad we dont have prints of every md onthe okay dr corbett albert dickinson cutin i guess is time you and i had a little talk the detective leaningagainst the doorjamb sighed wearily im required to tell you that you havethe right to remain silent but that anything you choose to say may and will beused against you in a court of law you wait a minute tom said why are youreading him miranda is he being arrested not yet but he will be i just thoughtid get through the formalities lieutenant dickinson hughes went onthere are some things you dont know about whats gone on here you wanna know what i do knowyalie i know that no matter how much they got sex money power drugs orwhatever doctors always want more thats just the way they are give me anunsolved crime where one of ten suspects is a doctor and my moneys on the docevery time now dr corbett if youd like to lieutenant another doctor came in to seemrs corbett after harry left here tonight tom hughes said there was no one the next person to comeon this floor after dr corbett left here was you and by that time mrscorbett was already on the chute i checked with the nurses they have allvisitors logged well the nurses are wrong someone washere a white male in his forties wearing a white clinic coat five eightbrown hair brown eyes who says toms expression suggested that he wasexpecting the question but still had found no easy way around having to answerit my sister he said boldly the manspoke to her then went around the curtain to mrs corbett and then left itwas soon after that her aneurysm ruptured dickinson smirked is that what you sawlittle lady pinhead you know you should firewhoever made you that toupee i could paint a piece of lettuce with shoe polishand have it look more realistic dickinson smiled blandly but it was clearhe had been skewered harry realized only then that the man was wearinga hairpiece score one more for maura hughess power of observation why dont you have another drink littlelady dickinson said maura tom pleaded would you pleasestop with the wisecracks and just tell the detective what you saw maura brushed at something on her shoulderbut said nothing dont bother harry said i dont thinkthe detective is going to pay much attention come on lieutenant lets getthis over with lieutenant dickinson tom asked do youthink it would be worthwhile calling someone over from forensics for what maybe the doctor who was here left someprints fingerprint a hospital room huh soundslike a great idea to me yalie i mean there couldnt have been more than ohone or two hundred people in here over the last day almost everyone whos been in this roomincluding the doctors has a set of fingerprints on file with hospitalsecurity harry said its been hospital policy for years ever since aconvicted child molester lied on his application and got a job as an orderly onthe pediatric unit great im sure forensics will bethrilled to come out on a night like this because a woman in the goddamn dtsclaims she saw someone that not a single other person on this whole floor saw im telling you i know my sister and iknow that there was someone here and im telling you spiders and ants andgiant snakes dont leave fingerprints now corbett lets get this overyoull feel much better when you get everything off your chest it was well after midnight by the timeharry finished responding to albert dickinsons unemotional and uninspiredinterrogation the detective had clearly made up his mind that the scenario fedto him by caspar sidonis was the correct one harry unwilling to allow hiswife to run off with another man had administered a bloodpressureraisingagent to her her death would appear to be due to the rupture of her aneurysmand no questions would be asked now samples of her blood were being sent to thestate lab for analysis if any unusual substances were found especially onesrelated to raising blood pressure there was a good chance that a warrant wouldbe issued for harrys arrest motive method opportunity dickinsonsaid right now all were missing is the method harry saw no point in telling the hostiledetective about the telephone order to start an iv on evie pramod baraswattiwould undoubtedly check with the floor first thing in the morning an incidentreport would be filed and sooner or later word would trickle back todickinson his conclusion would of course be that harry had made the callhimself setting up a port for his lethal injection motive method opportunity he followed harry back to the room yalie i want a cop here as long as shesalive and hes on the floor shes already been pronounced clinicallydead hughes said look are you gonna make me send someoneelse in here or are you gonna show us that youre a fucking team player some team hughes muttered what did you say i said ill stay here and protect her thats what i thought ive already toldthe nurses that i dont want him alone with her as long as shes alive but is that clear sure lieutenant harry followed dickinson down the hall andwatched until the elevator doors closed behind him he gone hughes asked when harryreturned for now he says that as soon as anythingshows up in evies blood ill be arrested do you think something will harry rubbed at the persistent stinging inhis eyes i dont know what the hell to think hesaid what an asshole that man is i mean the least he could have done wascall someone in for the fingerprints i agree its a long shot but its a noshot at all if we dont need him tom said leadingharry back toward the elevators what weve got the dweeb hes on his way upright now at almost that moment the elevator doorsglided open and a slight almost fraillooking black man emerged he waswearing a detroit tigers jacket and a detroit lions cap and was carrying abriefcase in one hand and a large fishingtackle box in the other did he see you tom asked nope walked right past me too i swearalbert wouldnt see a corpse if it was hanging from his ceiling i appreciate this i really do tomsaid harry corbett meet lonnie sims also known as the dweeb sims set his tackle box down and shookharrys hand with a linebackers grip hes with us tom said to thenightshift nurse as they hurried past her another detective they enteredroom lonnie and i were classmates at nyu when i got my masters incriminology he explained hes the best crimescene man that schools everproduced and he loves doing fingerprints thats true my man sims said settinghis tackle box on a chair and snapping it open thats true one of my friends doug atwater has alot of clout here harry said actually tom you probably saw him he washere a while ago tall good looking sort of blondishhair thats him anyhow i think hell be ableto get the print records from security or personnel or wherever theyre kept great sims said slipping on rubbergloves and handing a pair to both tom and harry i have some people at the fbilab in dc who can help us too now were going to play a little actinggame tom do what you can to have your sister direct us and try not to touchanything especially those metal bed railings harry youre going to play themysterious stranger dont you touch anything either okay harry glanced past mauras bed towhere evie lay even her decerebrate posturing had stopped now she had led atleast one secret life with caspar sidonis had there been others had one ofthem led to her death he headed toward the doorway to begin his part in theperformance one thing seemed almost certain to him the laboratory studies ofevies blood which could take days or even weeks to complete were going toturn up something and sometime tomorrow evie would be gone and her roomscrubbed down if they were going to have any chance at picking up thefingerprints of doctor x it had to be done now tell me he said why do they call youdweeb lonnie sims glanced over at tom he um he did pretty well ingrad school hughes explained in fact pretty well doesnt really cover itthe truth is if they had curved the grades in our class only dweeb herewould have passed by the time harry left the hospital thefirst hint of dawn was washing over the city the session with lonnie sims hadtaken over two hours and as far as harry could tell the man was asadvertised a genius the thumbs the ticket the dweeb toldhim that sneaky opposable thumb most forensic socalled experts dust on topof things the key is to dust under them show me a lab man with floor dirtground into the knees of his trousers and ill show you a man who knows whathes about with mauras help he guided harry or tomslowmotion through half a dozen possible scenarios watchingtheir movementsclosely and calling out freeze whenever he wanted to check a spot forprints the mystery doc had not worn rubber gloves maura assured them simsdusted beneath the formica tray tables and along the underside of the bedrailshe did the door handles and the light pulls both sides of the headboards andfootboards of both beds and even the fixtures in the bathroom he used specialpowders and an infrared light magnifiers and a tiny stateoftheart camerahe lifted about fifty prints some quite clear some badly smudged in the end he told them if doug atwatercould arrange access to the hospitals personnel fingerprint files anythingwas possible by the time sims folded his tackle box closed his briefcase andaccompanied tom hughes off of alexander it was three am harry called philand evies family then he sat by evies bedside in the darkened room for atime his thoughts focused on nothing and everything you take care now gene maura said as heheaded out of the room harry had thought she was asleep only nowdid he realize she was quite awake and had been keeping quiet for him for thetime that might be his last alone with his wife perhaps her sedation hadkicked in he reasoned perhaps the horrors of her dts were abating or perhapsshe had just enough willpower to hold them off for a while i will he said you take care toomaura and thanks for your help tonight on the way off the floor he stopped atthe nurses station and signed permission for evies organs to be taken thenotion that somewhere someone was about to receive the heart they haddesperately been praying for did help ease the profound sadness he was feelingbut nothing helped lessen his confusion or his sense of foreboding the streets were virtually desertedemotionally drained harry drove home peering through a film of gritty fatiguehe parked in the indoor garage a block from his apartment as usual rockymartino the coops night doorman was asleep in a worn leather chair in clearview of anyone who chose to look through the glass front doors of the buildingalthough he would never admit it rocky was well past sixty he would also notadmit to drinking more than was healthy or to drinking on the job althoughmost of the residents knew he did both firing him had been on the agenda ofvirtually every coop meeting for as long as harry had been part of thebuilding but since nothing of consequence had ever happened during rockysshift and because he was a sweet guy no action had ever been taken harrydebated knocking on the glass or even ringing the ancient doorbell finallyhe took out his keys with the first touch of metal on metal rocky was on hisfeet doc you scared the crap out of me hesaid opening the inside door i thought everyone in the building was tuckedin for the night when did you go out what do you mean well i didnt see you go out after thatchinese food you ordered was delivered harry felt his pulse jump you sure it was me the food was for of course im sure did you buzz me before you sent thedelivery man up he asked i um i think i did and did the guy go right out rocky was clearly beginning to panic hewas also clearly about to lie sure he said he went right up andcame right down harry headed for the elevator rocky what time was that i dont know doc ten maybe elevenwhy harry stepped into the elevator and heldthe door open because rocky he said more testilythan he had meant i havent been home all night and i didnt order anychinese food the apartment door was locked but thatmeant nothing they had a police lock but he and evie never bothered using itunless they were home once when evie had locked her keys inside the superhad gotten her in with a credit card harry thought about calling the policewithout going inside but he was exhausted and the cops might take hours to getthere he opened the door slowly expectingdarkness lights were on in the foyer and it appeared in every room as welleven from where he stood he could see that the place had been ransacked heconsidered the possiblity that the intruder was still inside a sane personwould definitely retreat to the lobby and call the police from there but atthat moment harry was feeling anything but sane he stalked down the hall halfhoping the man would jump out at him he desperately needed someone to hit the apartment was empty the carnageextensive every painting had been removed from the wall every drawer openedand emptied the mattresses had been moved and all the contents of all theclosets thrown on to them even the rugs had been lifted it was as if theintruder was searching for a safe if so he had to be disappointed they keptlittle cash in the apartment and evies most precious jewels by far theirmost extravagant possessions were in a safedeposit box still it seemedthat a number of the most valuable portable items they owned had been takenevies jewel box had been emptied her mink coat was gone as was their silversome crystal and several small pieces of art including a picasso drawing eviehad taken from her first marriage that was worth maybe fifteen thousanddollars but it was in the small study that themost thorough work had been done the desk drawers had been emptied and thecontents screened and quite carefully set in a pile by one wall the drawersthemselves had been broken apart the seat of the desk chair slashed everybook from the floortoceiling shelves had been opened examined and tossedaside there was something wrong harry thought pushing some of the mess asidewith his foot this was a robbery all right but a robbery with a purpose he wandered into the kitchen that roomhad been ransacked as rudely and thoroughly as the rest of the place hesurveyed the wreckage for several minutes before noticing the four unopenedwhite cartons on the table each contained a chinese dish now cold set atopone of them in a stapled waxpaper holder was a fortune cookie harrys firstimpulse was to heave it and the rest of the food against a wall instead hecracked it open the beacon of good fortune willcontinue to brighten your path it read chapter it was almost eight when harry finallyleft the wreckage of his apartment and took the crosstown bus back to thehospital the two policemen who had been sent in response to his call had triedfor a few fingerprints but in the main their crimescene check wasuninspired a robbery in a manhattan apartment was clearly of little moreinterest to them than a derelict shaking the coins in his cardboard cup atpassersby on the street the officers conclusion arrived at aftera half hour was that this was a runofthemill b and e by a professionalthief who might or might not have known harry would be staying late at thehospital they brushed aside harrys concern that the thief had another agendaand told him that the best he could hope for was that some of the stolen itemssurfaced at a pawnshop or fence known to the police meanwhile harry would bedoing the smart thing to get what he could from his insurance company replacewhatever he wanted to and bank any money left over harry crossed the mmc lobby and headeddown the corridor toward the alexander building elevators all around him itwas business as usual he wondered how many hundreds even thousands offamilies he had passed over the years who were heading into the hospital justas he was today to see a spouse or child or parent for the last time his lifewith evie had been strained and emotionally barren for a long time but untillast night he had never completely stopped believing that they would somehowmake it back to the way it once had been between them as he passed the nurses station onalexander he was aware of the sideways glances and changes in conversationsno doubt the tale of caspar sidoniss accusation had already reached theoutermost branches of the hospital grapevine he had never enjoyed being thesubject of gossip negative or positive now he shuddered to think of thedistortions the sidonis story had undergone from one retelling to the next thesimple truth was bad enough he also knew that unless explanations surfaced forthe telephone order that established evies iv and for maura hughess mysterydoc there would be more tales to come many more evies parents carmine and dorothydellarosa were seated silently at evies bedside a retired postman and anadministrative secretary married well over forty years they were pillars ofthe catholic church in their small new jersey town they were also as ordinaryand reserved as their daughter was vibrant and spectacular evie was their onlychild harry shook hands with carmine and kisseddorothy on the cheek the couple had always been cordial enough toward him butcould not at their most open ever be considered warm new jersey gothic eviesometimes called them we think evelyn moved her arms dorothysaid she might have there are reflexes thatcause muscles to contract they dont really mean anything though dorothy icant let you think they do harry gestured to mauras bed which was emptyand freshly made wheres the woman who was here down the hall in a new room poor souldorothy responded the nurses said a bed just came open they didnt want herdisturbing these these moments harry knew that unless he asked carminedellarosa a direct question and then only one he was uniquely qualified toanswer carmine would let his wife do the speaking for the two of them harryhad decided against sharing news of the breakin sooner or later he might haveto but at the moment they were already upset enough by the tragedy and byharrys decision to have evies organs donated on the bed beside them evie laypeacefully her eyes were taped shut and she remained attached to a ventilatorand iv but the treatments to reduce brain swelling hyperventilation to lowerher carbon dioxide level and raise her blood ph and diuretics to inducedehydration had been stopped a second set of required tests cerebralbloodflow scan eeg and attempts at making her breathe spontaneously hadall confirmed the diagnosis of functional brain death now there was only the matter of sayinggoodbye and having an attending physician pronounce her officially dead thenthe people from the new york regional transplant services would take over hetook evies hand and held it for a time wondering if the dellarosas had heardanything yet of caspar sidonis before long they would with the cause ofevies death clearly established as a ruptured aneurysm there was no need forthe medical examiner to demand an autopsy especially with multiple organdonations at stake but he had ordered extensive toxicology studies father moore just left dorothy said im sorry i missed him he administered the sacrament of the sickto evelyn good evie had not considered herself a catholicfor years and had made no attempt to have her first marriage annulled butneither of her parents would ever admit to the fact im just not sure this organ business isthe right thing to do evelyn was so so beautiful its the right thing dorothy evie willbe just as beautiful when this is all over more beautiful okay yes i i suppose so um aboutthe funeral harry sensed what she wanted him to say would you like to make arrangements heasked thank you i would anything you do in that regard will beokay the funeral people you decide to use can call and make arrangements withthe hospital do you know if evelyn has an address bookof some sort oh yes as a matter of fact she has ithere ill call you later if you want and go through the names with you that wont be necessary i have friendswho will call all the numbers that way anyone who wants to come can do so ourchurch isnt that large but we dont have that much family so there should beroom youll speak to people here of course harry took evies purse from beneath herbedside table she had left her wallet at home but insisted on bringing in hermakeup some money and her address book he withdrew the small leatherboundbook and quickly flipped through it the names were carefully done in eviesmeticulous block print many of them conjured up immediate vivid memories ofthe happier years of their marriage he was about to hand the book over when henoticed two small pieces of paper taped inside the back cover on each was aname address and what looked like a social security number curious harryremoved the slips and dropped them into his jacket pocket taking pains toshield his movements from dorothy oblivious she took the address book andthanked him then she led her husband back to the bedside and out the door she was such a beautiful girl harryheard her say harry waited until he was certain thedellarosas would not be returning for any reason then he opened evies purseagain in addition to some eye shadow lipstick blush and a twentydollarbill there was a gray rabbitsfoot key chain with three keys on it two weredoor keys of some sort fairly new harry checked them against the coop keyson his own ring no match the third was for a mailbox he was about to examinethe two slips of paper when ben dunleavy swept into the room evies neurosurgeon was respectedthroughout the hospital but he was also feared for his volatility andintolerance the decision to delay repair of evies aneurysm although made onsound clinical grounds and decent data had been his now before he couldoperate on his patient she was dead harry he said his handshake and tone were cooler thanthey should have been given the circumstances sidonis had obviously gotten tohim you here to pronounce evie the neurosurgeon nodded and looked down ather with no more drama than that it was done harry glanced at the wallclock ninetwelve am and thirtyfive seconds officially evie was dead needless to say im really sorry thishas happened dunleavy said its been years since i opted to do anythingother than a delayed repair of an aneurysm like hers evie is my firstfatality ive only had two patients even rebleed before i could get them tothe or and both of them did fine harry could read between the lines of whatthe man was saying he saw no sense in not cutting to the chase ben sidonis may have been having anaffair with evie i dont know but hes wrong about what hes accusing me of dunleavys gaze was dispassionate i hope so harry he said let me knowif theres anything else i can do he was gone before harry could evenrespond first the nursing staff now dunleavy even without hard evidencethere were already some unwilling to give him the benefit of the doubt harryfelt an unpleasant tightening in his gut there was going to be trouble he sat down in the bedside chair vacatedby dorothy and took the two pieces of paper from his pocket they were scrapsone torn from the border of a magazine page one from a sheet of stationeryeach had a mans name address phone number date of birth and socialsecurity number written in evies hand but hastily the first was jamesstallings fortytwo years old with an upper east side address the second athirtysevenyearold from queens was someone named kevin loomis harry put the slips in his wallet and therabbits foot and keys in his pocket then he checked the purse one last timeand dropped it into the wastebasket finally he bent over evies body andkissed her gently on the forehead im sorry kid he whispered im sorryabout everything he brushed her cheek with the back of hishand and left the room he was nearing the elevators when from somewhere downthe hall behind him he heard a familiar voice cry out hey will someoneplease get in here get in here and get these damn bugs off of me he winked at me sherry i swear he did gowned and masked nurse mariannerodriguez peered down into the radiant warmer where tiny sherman obanion hadspent virtually every moment of his two and a half weeks on earth the neonatalintensive care unit at new york childrens hospital was the finest inmanhattan and it was currently filled to capacity thirty newborns ranging inbirth weight from just over a pound to ten sherman born at twentyfive weeksweighed one pound five ounces his mother was a housewife staying at home tocare for two other children his father worked the night shift on the assemblyline of a factory considering his birth weight and other problems sherman wasdoing pretty well dont you wonder what some of thesepeanuts are going to grow up to be sherry hiller asked ill bet sherm plays football have youseen his daddy the infant in his pod looked like avisitor from another planet there were tubes wires and auxiliary machinesall around him he was draped in saran wrap to conserve his body heat a panelof phototherapy lights shone on him to lessen jaundice tiny eye shieldsprotected him from the ultraviolet rays a ventilator controlled hisrespiratory rate and volume sensors on his abdomen and legs measuredtemperature heart rate and blood oxygen concentration an intravenous lineplaced in a tiny vein on his head provided fluid and antibiotics a tube intohis stomach through his nose delivered formula marianne moved about the warmer notingdown the infants temperature heart rate and color his oxygen levels wererunning a bit low and his dusky color lab values and exam had indicated asignificant heart defect that would probably have to be surgically correctedbefore long but marianne wasnt all that concerned she had been an nicu nursefor six years and had seen any number of infants worse off than shermanobanion make it out of the hospital in great shape of course there wereothers who were not so fortunate blindness from a number of factors cerebralpalsy mental retardation multiple surgical procedures death either suddenfrom cardiac arrest or prolonged from infection and eventual learningdisabilities were complications that every nicu nurse had to deal with if notaccept there was a tap on the glass from theformula room marianne looked over the woman bringing the specially preparedformulas up from dietary waved at her cheerily with the fingers of arubbergloved hand marianne had never seen the dietary worker before or atleast felt fairly certain she hadnt per protocol the woman wore a haircover mask and surgical gown only her stout frame and her dark brown eyeswere apparent the chestnut eyes had a special spark to them and marianne hadthe sense that this was a cheerful person she motioned for her to set out theformulas on the counter the nurses would be in to pick them up the woman noddedher understanding did as was requested and left the nicu marianne returned to her duties pausingto check each piece of equipment to do her job right required almost as muchmechanical aptitude as medical but each type of apparatus was backed by a teamof specially trained technicians and in some instances an entire departmentthe cost shortterm and longrange of neonatal intensive care was astoundingsomeone had once told marianne the actual numbers which were something likenine thousand dollars a day for difficult cases one infant whose mother hadabandoned her in a dumpster had remained in the new york childrens nicu foralmost nine months before succumbing to infection there was a memorial servicefor the child only her nurses and a few mds attended the cost of keepingher alive for those months had been over a million and a half dollars okay sherm marianne said its chowtime bring jessicas gruel in when you comewill you sherry hiller asked sure thing does anything need to beadded nope the formulas were in labeled bottlescalled gradufeeders a oneday supply for each of the infants some of thefeeders contained supplemented mothers milk others were prepared fromscratch each was sealed with a tamperresistant seal that was essentiallyextrasticky cellophane tape marianne gloved before handling the bottlesthen breaking the seals she unscrewed the cover of shermans bottles andinserted the glucose supplement that had been ordered by the neonatologistnext she resealed all but one bottle using a roll of the tamperresistantsealer that she picked up from the counter as usual she wondered why thedepartment bothered with the tape when it was so easily accessible to so manypeople she checked and doublechecked the labels and placed all but one ofjessica saunderss and sherman obanions formula bottles in the refrigeratorthen she returned to the warmers how do you handle a hungry man she sangas she administered the newborns feeding down his tube the manhandler she held the formula over the infant untilit had drained in completely marianne could you do jessica for mesherry asked little moonface logans monitor alarm keeps going off i thinkthe leads are loose i want to replace them all sure thing marianne said again marianne was focused on delivering formulato the tiny girl when she heard the alarm from one of the nearby cardiacmonitors for half a minute she ignored it certain that it was coming fromthe loose leads on the infant they called moonface the alarm persisted sher thats moonface isnt it shesaid without looking up for a moment there was only thecontinuing drone of the alarm holy shit sherry cried suddenlymarianne its sherman shermans cardiac monitor was showing anabsolutely flat line marianne detached the feeding bottle and hurried back tohis warmer the twoweekolds chest rose and fell in response to hismechanical ventilation he looked as he always did except that his dusky colorhad deepened considerably now the oxygen saturation alarm was sounding aswell marianne checked the leads none loose she slipped her stethoscope on tothe infants chest nothing not a beat quickly she sped up the ventilatoryrate and began cardiac compression hes coded sher she said withcontrolled urgency call it for me and get laura over here damn it all in less than a minute the resuscitationof sherman obanion was manned by neonatologist laura pressman two pediatricresidents and two nurses marianne delivered meds as they were called for butshe had a sinking ominous feeling from the very beginning shermans heartrate had gone from an acceptable straight down to zero no slowing noirregular beats it was the equivalent of a car decelerating from sixty to zeroby hitting a brick wall clearly something within the infants defective hearthad blown possibly a muscle band or one of the fragile dividing wallscontinuing the external cardiac compressions the nicu team began administeringmedications epinephrine atropine more epi bicarbonate theyworked on the baby for more than half an hour but with each passing minutemarianne became more convinced of the hopelessness of the situation finallylaura pressman stopped her cardiac compressions she stepped back from theradiant warmer looked about at the staff and shook her head im sorry shesaid you all did a great job marianne rodriguez accepted a consoling hugand a few words from sherry hiller then battling back the tears she knewwould come sooner or later she set about disconnecting sherman obanionstubes and wires the radiant warmer would be wheeled away and replaced with afreshly cleaned one and before long another newborn would be brought in six stories below the nicu in thesubbasement the stout dietary worker her mask gown and hair cover still inplace knocked on the door of a littleused staff mens room waited thenslipped inside locked the door and turned on the light the cardiac toxin she had used was sopowerful that only a miscroscopic amount had been needed even if shermanobanions formula was analyzed which it almost certainly would not be no onewould know what to look for and nothing would be found the canvas gym bag was concealed beneath amound of used paper towels in the tall trash basket ten minutes later a manemerged from the restroom carrying the gym bag in it were the surgical gownhair cover and surgical mask as well as a pillow a womans wig and acontact lens case the man had closecropped brown hair and was dressed injeans a loose sweatshirt and wellworn nikes his height weight and generalappearance were quite unremarkable chapter st annes was filled to overflowing forevies funeral outside the day was as gray and somber as the mood within thechapel evelyn dellarosa vibrant beautyqueen lovely gifted as a writer andreporter suddenly dead at age thirtyeight there were few in attendance whowerent reflecting on the transience of life and the vagaries of illness andchance the hundredandfiftyyearoldwhiteshingled church fronted on the picturesque village green of sharpstonthe northern new jersey town where evie was raised and where her parents stilllived today harry observed it held a remarkable collection of people really quite a tribute to evie but with each arrival harry felt as though heknew his wife less in addition to relatives a number of harrys friends fromthe hospital and neighbors from the coop there were coworkers from themagazine and various artists and patrons of the arts there were folks from thestation and network where evie had not worked in over ten years and a numberof people whom harry did not know at all shortly before the service eviesfirst husband john cox now a network vp walked in with a gorgeous youngwoman as far as harry knew evie hadnt spoken to her ex since shortly aftertheir extremely hostile divorce was finalized yet here he was the days of mourning following eviesdeath had been marred by visits from albert dickinson to harrys neighbors inthe coop to his coworkers at the hospital and to carmine and dorothydellarosa dorothy had called harry as soon as the policeman left and hadasked about caspar sidonis dorothy i dont know if this man sidonisis telling the truth or not harry had said and frankly i dont care iloved evie and im sure she loved me even if she was involved with this otherman which i strongly doubt im sure we would have worked things out in time oh my was all dorothy could think ofto say as the service was about to commenceharry glanced back and spotted caspar sidonis slipping into the last row thesight of the man brought a strange mixture of anger and embarrassment cuckoldwas a repulsive word and an even more disgusting concept sidonis just walked in he whispered tojulia ransome the literary agent who was evies closest friend in the city do you really care she asked withoutbothering to look back harry thought about it perhaps it was hernature as a literary agent but julia always had a way of slicing to theessence of any situation no he said finally to tell you thetruth i guess i really dont from the moment he turned away from eviesbody and walked out of her hospital room harry had been trying to sort out hisfeelings he thought about moving about just leaving his practice and takingoff perhaps starting over again in one of those eternally warm lowcrimeedens the medical classifieds were always extolling but just as he ultimatelycould not trade in his patients for the hollinsmccue pharmaceutical job heknew he would not leave them now not that albert dickinson would let him leaveanyway evies casket rested on a draped standsurrounded by flowers at the center of a wreath of white roses was a blowup ofthe same flawless sterile professionally done portrait that she had allowedon harrys desk there would be no burial the day her obituary appeared in thetimes a manhattan attorney had contacted harry three weeks earlier evie had made out a new will amending a previous one in it she requestedcremation and changed the beneficiary of her jewels and artwork from harry toher parents another sign that she anticipated the demise of their marriageharry was left as beneficiary on a insurance policy they had taken outjointly some years before but that was all nowhere in the will was there amention of caspar sidonis harry sat in the first row between juliaand evies parents his brother phil gail and their three children were justto julias right doug atwater sat directly behind him harry felt gratefulthat none of them could read his thoughts which at that moment weredominated by the wish that this whole thing would just be over so that he couldreturn home with the help of his associate steve josephson steves wife anda cleaning service the apartment was pretty much back to normal minus a fewshattered drawers and the missing valuables now all he wanted was to spend anight or two sitting in on bass with the combo at ccs cellar and then losehimself in his practice and patients the mass was dignified and reasonablybrief harry had been offered the option of speaking but had declined thepriest who had known evie since childhood did his best to make sense of herdeath but harry heard only snatches of what he said he was preoccupied withtrying to make sense out of her life his thoughts kept drifting toevies iv line and to the doctor or doctorimpostor who had somehow marched onto and off of the neurosurgical unit totally unseen by any of the staff nowfurther complicating the conundrum was another riddle three keys on arabbitsfoot chain you okay julia whispered as the priestwas concluding his eulogy not really he responded listenjulia are you free for a drink tonight theres some things going on id liketo talk to you about although he and evie had occasionally spenta social evening with julia and her husband he had never been alone with hershe was several years older than evie slim attractive and sharplyintelligent her agency was one of the more successful in manhattan she wasworking on her third marriage julia considered his request some minuteslater during holy communion she leaned over and whispered nine oclock atambrosias he nodded thank you although phil julia and doug atwatereach offered to stay with him harry remained alone in the sanctuary until ithad emptied is there anything i can do father francis moore spoke softly butharry was startled nonetheless no no thanks father i was justthinking i understand harry turned and headed out the oldpriest walked alongside him a bible cradled in one hand you will be going over to thedellarosas he asked yes for a while anyhow im prettywornout there was no way he could avoid going tohis inlaws but he was determined to head back to the city as soon as possible i understand father moore said againalthough we havent met before today dorothy and carmine speak very highly ofyou they say youre a very gentle kind man thank you harry said they left the church with harry a few feetahead of the priest several pockets of people were standing around somedistance away talking or waiting for their rides harry had just reached thebottom of the stairs when caspar sidonis stalked over and confronted him you killed her you bastard he raspedhis whisper harsh and menacing you know it and i know it and pretty sooneveryones going to know it you couldnt stand to lose her so you killed her it had been thirtythree years since harryhad last thrown a punch at someones face that time he had barely grazed thecheek of the bully who had been baiting him the larger boys retribution hadbeen swift and memorable this time harrys punch thrown from a much betterangle and with much more anger and authority behind it was more effective itconnected solidly with the side of sidoniss nose sending the surgeon spinningonto his back in some low rainsoaked shrubbery blood instantly spurted fromboth his nostrils shocked father francis moore dropped hisbible harry calmly picked it up wiped it on his trousers and handed it back i guess im not so gentle after allfather he said ambrosias was an eternally packedupscale bistro on lexington near seventyninth harry spent an hour at theoffice reviewing patient lab reports and catching up on paperwork before takinga cab to the club the drizzle that had dominated most of the day was gone andthe dense overcast had begun to dissolve the city seemed scrubbed and renewedit was before nine but julia ransome was already there nursing a drink at oneof the tall black acrylic tables opposite the bar it was relatively early bymanhattan standards even for a thursday but the bar was already three deep julia exchanged pecks on the cheek withhim she was wearing a black silk blouse and an indian print vest and lookedvery much at home among the beautiful people whod you have to pay off to get thistable harry asked sliding on to the stool opposite hers donny the bartender over there has beenwriting a novel for the last ten years or so she said smiling i promisedto read it when he finishes in the meantime i call ahead and he puts one ortwo of his pals on these stools until i get here its one of the perks ofbeing a book agent my seamstress has a first novel in progress too so doesthe plumber i can get at ten minutes notice anytime day or night the trickis being able to tell which people havent got a snowballs chance in hell of everfinishing their book once in a while im wrong when that happens i just haveto read it and then set about finding a new mechanic or dentist or whatever well i appreciate your meeting me likethis if you think for one moment that iwouldnt have i obviously havent done a good job of letting you know youreone of my favorite people thanks i mean it harry julia finished herdrink and motioned the waitress over with a minute shake of her head youdrinking tonight bourbon neat might as well make it adouble whoa double bourbon neat now theres aside of you ive never known dont worry if i actually finish ittheyll have to haul me out of here in a wheelbarrow he waited until thewaitress had returned with their drinks and left julia he said thenplease tell me about evie the agent studied her glass what do youwant to know at this point almost anything you chooseto share would probably be news to me the surgeon i pointed out to you todayat the church the one who claims evie was in love with him is convinced igave her something a drug that caused her aneurysm to rupture hes wrongabout it being me but im not sure hes wrong about the rest of his theory harry reviewed the nightmarish evening on alexander his conversation withthe anesthesiologist and his conclusions julia he said i had no ideaevie was involved with another man even though for a year or so she wasntparticularly involved with me i just thought she might have shared some otherthings with you that that i didnt know about in the silence that followed harry feltcertain julia was going to deny any knowledge of what he was talking aboutsuddenly though the woman looked up at him and nodded you were outmatched from the beginningharry she said you may have been able to handle the vietcong she gavehim a quick ironic smile but you didnt have a chance against eviedellarosa she and i have known each other since she lived with me one summerduring college thats almost twenty years she was an exciting intriguing personin many ways and god knows ill miss her but over all those years ive neverknown her to be content whatever she had whoever she had she alwayswanted more and she didnt particularly care what it took or unfortunatelywho got hurt in the process thats the part of her that seductive charisma that always frightened me it kept us from getting closer than we were johncox was at the funeral today did you see him yes i did what did evie tell you about theirbreakup that she caught him having affairs andthat when she confronted him he got her fired from the news staff andblackballed throughout the industry does that jibe with his showing up at herfuneral today no i have to say i was surprised to seehim john cox was crazy about evie she hadthe affair harry with johns boss i only know what john told me and thatsnot much but it was the boss not john who gave her the boot and blackballedher i think john would even have given her another chance but she wasntinterested was she at all happy with me for a time maybe a year or two harryevie needed to be in the spotlight she needed to be at the center of theaction part of her fought that need thats why she married you i thinkstability but the stronger pull was clearly winning out did you know about sidonis nope not about him or any other menduring your marriage if there were any im not sure that sort of thing wasever important enough for evie to talk about or maybe she didnt trust me thatmuch i know she was dissatisfied with her jobon the magazine but hated it she was born to be in front ofthe camera harry you know that at least you should from the moment shestarted at manhattan woman she was searching for a ticket back into thelimelight ive had the impression lately that shewas working on something special i think youre right do you know what it was julia shook her head i tried to get her to tell me about itthe last time we were together all she would say was that it was big stuffand that the producers of a current affair and some other tabloid showswere already offering her big bucks and onair guarantees just to see what shehad harry stared off at a wall across theclub on it artfully done was a sixfoothigh neon sculpture of a womansprofile and hand she had a twenties look and was smoking a glowing cigarettein a footlong holder although evie smoked only rarely something about therendering reminded him of her he suspected it would be a long time beforethings didnt no further questions your honor hesaid finishing his bourbon i really appreciate your coming to meet with melike this julia nonsense youre a terrific guy andwhether she appreciated it or not evie was lucky to have you harry do youreally think someone purposely killed her i dont know what to think the chemicalanalysis of her blood should be completed within a few weeks sooner if thepolice detective who wants to mount my scalp on his lodge pole has his way imconcerned about what might happen if one of the tests is positive but im alsowondering whether ill trust the results if theyre negative so you believe that woman eviesroommate harry studied the neon smoker as heconsidered the question two days after evies death he had gone back up toalexander but maura hughes had been sent home shaky as hell but notchasing any spiders was the way one of the nurses described how maura hadlooked upon discharge harry was sure that the real reason for the rapiddischarge was the refusal of her insurance carrier to cover any more days atypical scenario companies were shortening stays and refusing coverage withalmost as much vigor as they were denying any responsibility for theconsequences of their policies harry julia was looking at himcuriously i asked you a question about evies roommate in the hospital youseemed like you were about to answer and then you sort of drifted off harry glanced down at his empty glassyears of virtual abstinence had reduced him to amateur status as a drinker heknew that being easily distracted was the first clue that if he wasnt tightyet he soon would be so what he thought the tighter the better yes i believe her he said a doctoror someone posing as a doctor came into that room after i left a short timeafter his visit evies aneurysm burst i think he injected something into thativ you know maybe that story evie was working on has something to do with whathappened i wish to hell i knew what it was all about did you check her office at the magazine no the one in the village what she was renting an office you knowworkspace someplace in greenwich village didnt you know that i um no no i didnt know thateither do you know where it was no idea harry brushed his hand over the pocketwhere he was carrying evies rabbits foot and keys julia i need to find that place hesaid she looked at him with concern you need to go home and get some sleepharry that placell be there tomorrow besides if you dont know where it isfinding it may not be so easy she doesnt have a phone there thats as muchas i remember of what she said about it thanks harry said julia who in thehell was she the book agent set a twenty and a tenbeneath her glass and guided him out of the bar into the cool night air harry if you asked ten different peoplein evies life that question youd get ten completely different answers itwould be like the proverbial blind men trying to describe an elephant bywhatever part they happen to be feeling snake tree wall stone leaf theyreall correct but only up to a point want to share a cab home harry knew that she lived in almostprecisely the opposite direction from his apartment hey listen he said dont worry aboutme i need to walk for a bit to clear some of this old granddad out of myhead ill get some rest i promise they waited until he had flagged down ataxi for her then embraced call if you need me julia said anddont drive yourself too crazy trying to see any more than the rest of theblind men harry watched as the cab disappearedaround the corner then headed slowly downtown chapter harry ambled down lexington tofiftyeighth and then across toward central park south he loved walking thecity at any hour but especially at night that he was in no particular hurrywas just as well the double bourbon was definitely slowing him down for atime he considered simply writing the whole night off by stopping in anotherbar or two but he wanted to think through what julia ransome had told him andhe had never been much of a thinker when he was tight during his eighteen months in nam he hadbecome something of a functional alcoholic often drinking to excess as a meansof coping with the horrors of his job in that regard he was not much differentfrom many of the other officers fortunately he had been able to practicallystop drinking after the war and even more fortunately he had never given into the urge to numb his feelings with narcotics for many of those docs andmedics who did the war was still raging and would be until they died he was crossing by the fountain in frontof the plaza when he glanced down fifth avenue the offices of manhattanwoman magazine were on fortyseventh street it was almost eleven oclockunless some of the staff was preparing for production there was no chance ofhis actually making it up to her office but he couldnt face going home yetand ccs cellar would be uncomfortably crowded the group performing thereright now wasnt one of his favorites anyway a popular progressive quartetwhose music he found pretentious before he had a chance to rethink theonenight bender option he turned downtown toward the magazine office buyinga pack of mints along the way to cover the alcohol on his breath he chewed allof them during the tenblock walk to fortyseventh the guard at the desk in the lobby of thetastefully refurbished building put aside his national enquirer and eyedhim suspiciously harry explained about evies death and his desire to gothrough her things before they were tossed into a carton by someone and putinto storage he took her picture from his wallet and extracted a twenty at thesame time the guard studied the spectacular woman in the photo for a longmoment then slipped the bill into his shirt pocket and made a call threeminutes later harry stepped out of the elevator and into thetwentythirdfloor offices of manhattan woman magazine dr dellarosa were all so sorry aboutevie im chuck gerhardt layout the man in his early thirties withthinning closely cut hair had on tight black jeans and a black turtleneckthe abstract metalandglass sculpture suspended from his neck by a heavy chainreminded harry of a tuba his tepid handshake could not have cost him more thana calorie pleased to meet you harry said andthanks for your condolences i cant believe shes gone dr dellarosa harry felt rapport with evieand those other women who chose not to trade in their surname for theirhusbands there was no point in correcting the man though harry had not beeninvited up to the office in years and he had no intention of setting foot inthe place again after tonight he was searching for a clue any clue as to whatevies secret project was or where her greenwich village hideaway was locatedof course he thought any other tidbits offering insight into the life of thestranger to whom he had been married for nine years would be gratefullyaccepted youre lucky i was here gerhardt saidfirst thing next week we put the rag to bed and i have a ton of work to dowe call it panic mode thats why i wasnt at the funeral today all thebosses went but the peons who actually do the work around here got chained toour desks im sorry you couldnt make it it was abeautiful service and i apologize for disturbing you this way hey no problem i just cant believeevies gone she was the best dr dellarosa shed give you the shirt off herback i know harry said the irony of themans metaphor was not lost on him look i havent been able to sit stillsince the funeral i was just walking around the city and i decided to come insee if i could get evies things chuck gerhardt looked at him strangely dr dellarosa im certain the man yousent did that already yesterday no no the day before i remember because did you see this man harry felt everymuscle in his body tense only for a moment i happened to be bythe front desk when he came kathy the receptionist took him down to eviesoffice whats wrong oh nothing harry said feigning suddenunderstanding i know what happened it was my partner at work his gyms justa few blocks from here he volunteered to come by for me a few days ago witheverything thats been going on i just forgot okay if i just go down thereanyhow sure the end of that hall right no um her office is down thatcorridor there it has been for a couple of years yes yes of course i havent been herefor a while evies name was still on the blond oakdoor harry went inside knowing the gesture was fruitless he was right theoffice had been picked clean nothing on or in the desk nothing in the filecabinet nothing on the walls the books that had been in her small bookcasewere neatly stacked in one corner harry had no doubt that every single volumehad been checked for papers or hollowedout compartments what little doubt hehad about the breakin at the apartment vanished the robbery there was nothingmore than a smoke screen to cover a thorough search but for what just in case he checked the underside ofeach shelf as well as the bottom of all three desk drawers nothing thewastebasket was empty harry tried to imagine how anyone could have simplywalked into the office and stripped it so thoroughly the story presented tothe receptionist had to have been convincing and smoothly told the manhimself must have been iceberg cool this was no amateur were the thefts from the coopand evies office connected with her death how could they not be on impulse harry settled intothe desk chair and switched on evies computer the hard disk prompt came onharry responded to it and waited but nothing else happened there were nofiles not one not a piece of correspondence or an article or even a wordprocessing program the data in the computer had been extracted like coins froma piggy bank anything i can do to help chuck gerhardt stood by the doorwaysmiling understandingly harrys weak bewildered smile was totallygenuine no thanks though thanks foreverything gerhardt set three tendollar bills on thedesk i owed this to evie he said now iguess i owe it to you nonsense please keep it if she thoughtenough of you to lend it im sure shed be happy to have it end at that oh it wasnt a loan she had a friend inthe village who works on unusual jewelry this chain came undone and themedallion fell on the marble in the foyer downstairs it broke into severalpieces i got it in germany on a very special holiday with a very specialfriend i thought it was a total loss but evies jeweler saved the day the village evie never shopped fartherdowntown than saks fifth avenue even ccs seemed bohemian to her the firsttime harry had heard of any connection between her and greenwich village waswhen julia had told him about the secret office now this chuck do you by any chance know who thisjeweler is well evie never really told me but hiscard was taped inside the box that the medallion came back in im almostcertain i kept it come on down to my office harry followed gerhardt to a large studiothat was cluttered with the tools and products of his trade the layoutdesigner rummaged through his desk for a time then triumphantly surfaced witha business card paladin thorvald fine jewels antiques and collectibles harrycopied the information down now you can feel perfectly comfortableabout keeping the money chuck he said patting the man on the back youveearned it harry stopped by a money machine for somecash and then took a cab down to the village the jewelry and antiques shop ofpaladin thorvald was just off bleecker street a couple of blocks from thebowery it was nearly one in the morning but here as in many areas ofmanhattan there were still a fair number of people about some of course theubiquitous shadow people waiting for their portion of the night to begin harry had no clear plan other than to showevies picture to anyone who would look if he had no luck he would go homefor a few hours of sleep and then begin again first thing in the morningspeed mattered whoever had searched the apartment and evies office wasresourceful and desperate enough to commit murder and to make matters muchworse albert dickinson was out there just waiting for a positive coronersreport before pouncing on his only suspect one h corbett thorvalds was a small shop on the firstfloor of a dingy yellow brick building there were iron bars in front of thesingle plate glass window and a small sign announcing that business hours werenine am to seven pm harry peered inside a single shaded bulb illuminated acollection that seemed largely to have crossed the line separating antiquesfrom junk hardly evies kind of stuff there was no chance she would have goneout of her way to visit this particular shop harry felt certain of that heroffice had to be someplace nearby he tried her photo three times oncustomers leaving a nearby convenience store and then on the clerk the clerkpakistani or indian recognized evie as a frequent customer but had no ideawhere she lived he only worked the shift from eleven on harry couldntimagine his wife walking these streets alone at night at least before today hecouldnt as he made his way from one block to the next he sensed the shadowpeople getting a bead on him and moving closer he was either a john or a mark possibly both before long someone was going to make a move on him he glancedat his watch it was stupid to have come down here at such an hour nowchecking over his shoulder several times each block he looped back towardthorvalds two passersby had never seen evie and two more hurried away whenhe approached he decided to catch a cab and head on home as he passed theantique store he looked in again through the bars a large bearded man in aloose shirt or caftan was moving about at the rear of the shop harry rapped on the window the manglanced up then pointed to his watch and waved him off harry knocked againthis time he held up evies photo and two twenties the man hesitated thenshuffled over in his ornately embroidered caftan with a full beard thickponytail and single heavy gold earring he looked like a cross between ericthe red and ivan the terrible but his face while it might have frightened ayoung child was kind and reassuring he peered through the window at thephoto harry could see the recognition in his expression and quickly pointed tohis wedding ring the photo himself and finally to the bills paladinthorvald hesitated then shrugged deactivated some sort of alarm system andopened the door youre desirees husband he asked afterharry had introduced himself i never had any idea she was married let aloneto a doctor harry flashed on the many hours he andevie had spent choosing her engagement diamond and then their wedding bandsthe news that she was wandering about the village late at night using the namedesiree and wearing no ring would recently have surprised him much more than itdid now i assure you mr thorvald i am herhusband at least i was until a few days ago could i please come in and talkto you for a minute although thorvald did step back a fewpaces to allow him in harry could tell that the man had misgivings he decidedthat there was no reason to hold back anything except that evies death wasbeing investigated as a possible homicide he handed over the two twenties here keep these no matter what hesaid thorvald did not have to hear that offertwice he shoved the bills into the deep pocket of his caftan and listenedimpassively to harrys story so exactly what is it you want to knowhe asked when harry finished he still sounded wary if you can tell me where she lived thatwould be wonderful lots of different kinds of people live inthe village for lots of different reasons one of ems a respect for privacywe have around here that doesnt exist in a lot of places live and let liveif you know what i mean if desiree was your wife and if she didnt tell youabout her place here she must have had her reasons harry did not have to try very hard toproduce the urgency in his voice mr thorvald please evies dead shewas thirtyeight years old and shes dead we had a home friends plans forthe future i need to know who desiree was regardless of what she calledherself she was my wife im certain i have the keys to her place pleasejust point me to the right building and im out of here i wont ask any moreof you just that thorvald stroked his beard and stared downat his sandaled feet two doors down he said finally newlypainted red enamel door second floor i think she once said im not sureive never been in the building myself thanks i know you didnt really want totell me harry said i wont bother you again paladin thorvald studied harrys face im sorry your wifes dead he said two small panes of glass were set high inthe red enamel door harry stood on his tiptoes and peered inside the frontentryway was deserted he glanced about to ensure that the shadow people werestill at bay and then withdrew the rabbitsfoot and keys within him thesliver of a notion remained that somehow he had started from a misconceptionand built a secret life for evie around it that last bit of hope vanished asthe first of her keys turned in the lock he slipped inside and closed the red doorbehind him the small poorly lit foyer while not fetid would certainly havebenefited from a cleaning there was a small scarred table for magazines tworows of mailboxes servicing about twentyfive units and two columns ofbuzzers harry scanned the names on the boxes each a first initiallast namedone on a black plastic strip with a labeler a few names were added withtapedon pieces of paper none of the initials were d and none of the nameswere familiar but apartment f had no name at all the mailbox key on eviesring fit that lock the box was empty suddenly there was a soft scrapingagainst the outside door behind him harry whirled his pulse already onalert was jackhammering no one was peering through the window but almostcertainly someone had been harry briefly considered checking thestreet but thought better of it whoever had been outside the door wasprobably no one he wanted to deal with all that mattered was getting up toapartment f the first floor consisted of a dimstuccowalled corridor lined by several apartment doors an uncarpetedstaircase was off to one side narrow enough to make harry wonder how people onthe floors above could get a couch or refrigerator into their places therewas as far as he could tell no elevator still unnerved by the notion thatsomeone had been watching him he ascended the staircase quietly andcautiously apartment f was at the rear of thebuilding harry approached trying to picture evie walking down the same hallstanding by the door he listened there was only silence he knocked softlythen knocked again nothing finally his pulse once more making itself knownharry inserted the second key into the lock turned it and stepped inside theworld of the woman who called herself desiree chapter the apartment was totally dark harry usedthe glow from the corridor lights to locate a lamp turned it on and quicklyclosed the hallway door behind him the small sparsely furnished living roomwas a stark contrast to their immaculate impeccably decorated coop uptown itwas clearly a busy writers retreat cardboard folders and small stacks ofmanuscript pages were set out on the threadbare carpet each was labeled thetitles suggesting to harry that more than one project was going on there wasan electric typewriter on a folding table and next to it a discounthousecomputer desk with a pc and laser printer off to one side on the floor werea tv a vcr and seven or eight videos a halffilled wine rack a cassetteplayer and two dozen tapes there was also a telephone harry listened to thedial tone for a moment and then set the receiver back down there was no numberon it it seemed likely that some people had access to the line but that groupclearly did not include evies best friend julia harry checked the front closet which wasempty and then the kitchen there was a supply of diet soda a brauncoffeemaker and a microwave the cupboards were stocked with snack foods andcanned goods and the freezer had a supply of frozen dinners and half a dozendifferent flavors of ben amp jerrys ice cream evies favorite next to the kitchen was a small bathroomwith a shower stall but no tub the shampoo was evies brand and the mixedscent of powders and soaps reminded him of her there was a mirrored medicinecabinet over the sink harry watched himself reach for it he looked like hell tired drawn and in need of a shave he wondered if gene hackman ever lookedthis bad inside the cabinet were a number of unmarked bottles of pills harryrecognized valium seconol and some type of amphetamine he suspected theothers contained various sorts of painkillers the prescription labels had beentorn off all of them there was also a small bottle of white powder harry tooksome on a moistened finger and rubbed it over a spot on his gums the immediatenumbness it produced meant it almost certainly was cocaine evie had nevershown even the slightest interest in drugs and harry could not remember heraccepting so much as a hit of marijuana if it was offered to her at a party desirees drug use had to have beenrecreational or at most intermittent double identity or not if she wasstrung out on drugs harry would have noticed he opened the single drawer in the vanityand stared down in utter dismay at its contents there was nothing in the smalldrawer but condoms perhaps fifteen different styles and brands in boxes andindividual packets some common and storebought some from exotic specialtyhouses harry picked up one of the packets it was labeled thai tickler onone side and had a lewd drawing printed on the other beneath the promise guaranteedpleasure for him and her harry threw it back angrily and slammed thedrawer shut part of him wanted to leave simply to get out of there andforget the whole goddamn thing he had already learned more about his wife andher alter ego than he ever would have wanted to know and he dreaded having toface the revelations awaiting him in the pages and computer files in the livingroom but he knew he couldnt back off he had been dropped into the middle ofa nightmare and the only way out for him was through it there was barely space in the singlebedroom for a narrow dresser and a neatly made queensize bed double louveredclosets filled all of one wall harry checked beneath the bed and then pulledapart one set of the closet doors the evening dresses fourteen of them were elegant sexy and far from inexpensive on the floor beneath them were anumber of pairs of dress shoes all from the upscale shops evie frequentedbehind the other set of doors was a collection of nightgowns peignoirs teddiesand other extremely provocative bedroom apparel the hardly subtle collectionwas not very appealing to harry he was much more aroused by the feel of eviesbody beneath a flannel nightshirt or even a plain cotton t perhaps his tastewas the reason she rarely wore the few lacy garments she had at home orperhaps evies ways were simply different from desirees bewildered and moresaddened now than angry harry returned to the living room and the writingsthat had very likely cost evie her life betweenthe sheets thepower and extraordinary influence of the sexualunderground in america men call me beautiful womentoo for that matter for as long as i have been aware of that reaction i havebeen able to use it to my advantage i am intelligent welleducated andinterested in many things but what i am most interested in is sex sex andpower throughout the pages of this book you will learn how i and the manymany women with whom i have worked and whom i have interviewed use their looksand sex appeal to attract and control others both men and women you willlearn of business decisions that earned or lost millions which were made forno other reason than to please one of us you will learn of major politicalappointees who were fired and others who were hired simply because one of usdemanded it sometimes there is money paid to us to exert our influence vastsums of money sometimes we exercise our control over judges politiciansbusinessmen and the like simply to prove that we can are we worth it read thisbook and then decide for yourself harry set the folder down and openedanother marked correspondence it contained letters from senior editorsat several of the bigname publishing houses expressing great interest in thesample chapters of between the sheets by desiree the correspondencewas sent to the post office box of an agent in manhattan named norman quimbyharry had never heard evie mention the man and wondered if he existed at all anumber of the other letters were from the producers of syndicated televisiontabloid shows those letters were written to evie in care of a different postoffice box they suggested that if she could deliver desiree and all thematerial she claimed to have on tape and film there could be seriousdiscussion of a longterm oncamera deal the producers also promised toinvestigate how to implement a number of hightech safeguards evie had insistedupon to protect desirees identity and enhance the mystique surrounding herone producer wrote i think its a marvelous idea to makedesirees identity the bestkept secret since pearl harbor by the time theseries airs the book will be out and the hype well generate should create aphenomenon madame x sydney barrows christine keeler and heidifleiss all rolled into one with a dash of marilyn and the kennedys thrown infor good measure i cant give you hard figures yet but let me just say hereand now that if you can deliver what you claim you can we will be able to dobusiness harry picked up one of the videos it waslabeled simply he scanned the folders on the floor one was marked vidsinside were six narratives each two or more pages long and each titled bya single number he kept the one headed and set the rest down thenhe slipped the video into the vcr this tape features a woman whocalls herself briana he read she is thirtyone and a formerhomecoming queen at a large southern university by day she is a physical therapistat a clinic just outside of washington dc at night she works for an escortservice the fee for her services is a night she has only a few clientsand she works only when she wants to the split with her agency is fiftyfiftyrecently she became pregnant by her boyfriend and decided to retire from theescort service the video something of a retirement present from briana to herself wasmade by a camera hidden behind a mirror in her apartment the owner of herescort service knew nothing about it briana was operating on her own but shehad already contracted her services out to a powerful tobacco lobby her payfor influencing the vote of the senator shown with her in this video was and for the video itself another her face and voice as wellas the senators have been electronically obscured harry watched in morbid fascination as awoman with large youthful breasts and the perfect muscled body of a teenagerallowed herself to be undressed by a man whose body was not nearly so wellmaintained calling him senator she teased rubbed dared cajoled andfinally loved him into the promise to drop his support of another stiff tax ontobacco products the woman was incredibly sexy alluring and skilled so muchso that the senator did not last more than two minutes once their actuallovemaking commenced the electronic blurring of faces andvoices made it impossible to identify the man and harry wondered if in factthe tape was the genuine article or something desiree had staged wasdesiree herself in one or more of the videos unfortunately the likelihoodof that seemed quite high harry decided to put off viewing the rest of themuntil he had gone through all the other material he checked the time it was nearly twosilently he thanked his profession for providing him with the hourtohour oreven minutetominute selfcontrol necessary to make it through an allnighterfollowed by a full day of work he would stay here until dawn then stop by theapartment to shower and change before heading to the hospital for rounds assoon as he could clear out his office schedule he would return he scanned the folders and loose paperstrying to decide how best to get organized one small pile caught his eye itwas perhaps five or ten pages bound by a single rubber band the labeltucked beneath the elastic was written in evies hand on a yellow postit itread business execs preliminary notes see also desirees diary they meet every two weeks atthe camelot hotel young handsome and powerful i was chosen by page to joinsix other women each among the most beautiful and desirable in the city the payoff for oneevenings work a thousand in cash one of us was assigned to each of them myfirst night a tuesday i was sent to the room of harry froze there was a sound in thehallway outside the door he was certain of it someone was pressed up againstthe door listening he set the papers down where they had been tiptoed to oneof the windows and carefully raised the shade there was a fire escape andbelow that an alley but the window and the one next to it were protected by agrate of iron bars secured with a padlock harry returned to the table where hehad set down evies keys and was soundlessly picking through them when therewere two gentle taps on the door he moved a few steps forward then stoppedthere was a second pair of raps this time more insistent he looked about himat desirees papers there was no way he could hide everything who is it he heard himself rasp hemoved closer to hear the reply its thorvald paladin thorvald the mansaid in a forced whisper i got to speak to you how did you get in here please its very important harry glanced about him again then witha shrug he undid the dead bolt as soon as he turned the knob two men in darkwindbreakers barged in one was tall and built like a professional wrestlerthe other was much shorter but cinderblock chunky both had nylon stockingspulled over their faces i lied the taller one growled shovingharry back into the apartment harrys reaction was pure reflex heslammed his fist into the center of the taller mans face sending him reelingback heavily against the wall by the door then he lashed out with his foot atthe other one connecting solidly with the side of his knee the man dropped onto his side cursing harry charged past him toward the open doorway but thetaller man whipped his leg across sending him sprawling into the hall help harry cried scrambling to hisfeet before he could push off the huge mantackled him by the ankles harry cried out again as he struggled to freehimself he was a hundred and eighty pounds but the gargantuan man handled himlike a puppet his face beneath the stocking mask was smeared with blood get the stuff out for chrissakes hesnapped dragging harry back into the apartment this guys fucking crazy harry freed one foot and snapped it upagainst the mans jaw his grip loosened just enough for harry to break freeonce again the stockier man unsteady but on his feet tried pinning harrysarms to his sides but harry was possessed he drove his elbow viciously intothe mans throat following through in a dervishlike threesixty turn thatwould have made baryshnikov proud once again the blocky man went down harry stumbled as he headed toward thedoor the hesitation was just enough for the giant to get hold of him againbut harrys arms were still free as he braced himself and twisted to take aroundhouse swing excruciating pain shot through his chest and around to hisback it was the same electroshock sensation he had experienced on the track atthe hospital but magnitudes more severe he felt his knees buckle his visionblurred and in an instant both men were on him pinning him to the carpet the stuff one snapped okay okay ive got it ive got it through the sweaty dull haze ofintolerable pain harry smelled the sickly sweet aroma of chloroform a momentlater a cloth soaked with the rapidly acting anesthetic was pressed tightlyover his nose and mouth the dreadful ache in his chest kept him from all buttoken resistance and in fact as his consciousness began to fade he sensedsome relief that the pain was fading as well he fought for a time the only wayhe could by refusing to inhale but with several hundred pounds pressing downon him his tenacity was short lived i wonder what it feels like tobe dead wasthe last thing he thought before he took a single deep breath what are the names of thefiles you read what names do you remember did you listen to any of thecassettes what did they say the questions floated through the pitchblackness like feathers brushing against harrys consciousness then driftingaway has your wife ever spoken toyou of her work how did you learn of thisapartment have you known about it forlong who else knows the voice a mans was soft patient andnot at all demanding but harry felt powerless to resist answering thequestions droning over and over were interspersed with slow thick answers ina voice that was his and yet was not a human voice at all let us begin again harry tell me everything you read here tonight tell me every name youremember every name every name harry was flat on his back somehow tiedto a bed cotton batting had been taped tightly over each eye he could movehis hands but not his arms his feet but not his legs his head but not hisshoulders let me up he heard himself growl when i am convinced you have told meeverything that you have to tell me you will be freed may i please have somemore pentothal harrys brain had begun to clear thehorrible pain in his chest was gone and he hadnt died at least he didntthink so just hold still harry stop trying tomove your arm youll feel much better in a moment the voice of his inquisitor was culturedand intelligent not that of either of the men who had assaulted him theother two were there though harry could hear them breathing he tried topicture the three of them standing by the bed staring down at him ill need even more than that thecultured voice said and fill half of that syringe with that ketamine overthere i dont believe he has anything more to tell us but we shall see harry sensed the movement by his left armand suddenly knew there was an intravenous line there youre him arentyou his mind screamed youre the doctor on alexander a pleasant warmth washed over thedarkness harry felt himself beginning to drift and once again the questionsand his own answers began to float past him what else do you remember what names what places what tapes what else what else what else from the depths of a warm impenetrably dark sea harrysensed himself rise his head felt swollen his chest was a balloon bubblesswirled about him as bit by bit word by word his encounter with the two thugsand subsequent inquisition by the man with the soft voice drew into focus inhis mind he was tied to a bed and wait gingerly he lifted firstone arm then the other the bonds were gone his legs too were free hereached up and touched the adhesive tape over his eyes slowly uncomfortablyhe pulled the thick patches off the room was pitchblack fighting a suddenwave of nausea he pushed off the side of the bed and raised the window shademidmorning sun exploded into his eyes he buried his face in his arm andwaited finally he was able to look around hewas in desirees bedroom he was fully clothed although his shoes were on thefloor by the bed his watch was gone there was a small closed puncture woundon the skin inside his left elbow almost certainly an intravenous siteexcept for the furniture the room was empty no clothes in the closet noperfume on the bureau nothing the bathroom and living room had been similarlyswept of evies belongings the computer was gone the bathroom vanity draweremptied of its depressing contents the medicine cabinet was bare evies keyshad been taken although his own keys and wallet were on the table harry sank on to the couch aware now of apounding headache that he suspected would not be gone soon he picked up thetelephone and called his office mary tobin was immensely relieved to hear fromhim dr corbett ive called everywhere shesaid even the police what time is it pardon the time mary noon almost noon where on earth areyou ill explain when i see you i need to gohome i wont be in until three can you juggle people ill make up the timesaturday are you okay lets just say ive been better illspeak to you later harry retrieved his shoes made one final fruitless checkof the apartment and headed home the answers had been right there in hishands by not being more careful he had blown the chance to save himself buthe did have much more insight into just who evie dellarosa really was and healso had a voice a gentle cultured voice with just the hint of a britishaccent chapter although it was only five in the morningkevin loomis was already dressed for work he made his way quietly to thekitchen and eased the door closed just because he couldnt sleep was no reasonto wake nancy or the kids he had crawled into bed after midnight and had notdrifted off for at least another hour that made a total of about ten hours ofreal sleep in the days since he had first noticed the picture of evelyndellarosa in the times obituary section one moment he was certain thewoman in the photo was desiree the next moment he was certain she wasntthere were undeniable similarities but the woman in the photo looked youngerand yet not as attractive as desiree he nuked a cup of yesterdays coffee inthe microwave and took it down to his basement office a tiny space he had setup amid the boxes outofseason sporting equipment heating ducts and cinderblocks he hadnt spent much time there since his promotion but it was still agood place to hide out and think besides he thought now it wouldnt be toomuch longer before the makeshift study that had served him so well was a thingof his past their house a small threebedroom on a treelined street inqueens had a sale pending sign on the front lawn it was under offer toa plumber and his wife as soon as that sale went through the offer nancy andhe had made on a fabulous place in port chester would become final twelverooms three fireplaces and four baths on an acre and a half it was the dreamhouse they had thought would never be more than a dream new job new car new house newassociates new secrets it was all happening so fast maybe that was whatwas bothering him not the business with desiree or kelly or the roundtablebut the business with kevin loomis no matter how hard he tried to feelotherwise he couldnt shake the sensation that somehow he was in over hishead most of the knights have been inexecutive positions for years burt dreiser had said on the day he finallymade the offer that had so changed kevins life and theyve forged a uniquebond as members of the roundtable at first youre going to feel intimidated bythem but you neednt be ive been watching you work around here for a longtime now and i would never have tapped you to take my place if i didnt havecomplete confidence in you as long as you believe in what the roundtablestands for as long as you believe that our cause justifies our approach tosolving problems thats all that matters kevin couldnt recall his preciseresponse but it had obviously been the right one it had also been the truththroughout his life he had often cut corners legal moral and otherwise for things he wanted or causes he believed in there was nothing about theroundtable or its various programs that he couldnt accept especially with somuch at stake for his company and himself everything would be perfectabsolutely perfect if only he just felt a little more at ease with the wholething he smoothed evelyn dellarosas obituary onhis desk and reread it consumer editor for manhattan woman magazine fitwell enough with what they knew of desiree but certainly not the part abouther being a doctors wife although she hadnt actually had sex with kevin shecertainly had seemed ready and willing to gawaine had also admitted to somepretty intimate contact he denied having intercourse with her but kevinalways had the notion he was lying about that things like doctors wivesbecoming call girls happened for sure who hadnt read articles about suburbansex rings or watched the reports on hard copy but kevin certainly neverthought he would find himself in the middle of such a thing he read on died suddenly in a manhattanhospital died suddenly what did that mean he wondered if he should say anything togalahad and the others perhaps at the next meeting he decided perhaps heshould what difference does it make he askedhimself out loud even if desiree was evelyndellarosa what of it there was nothing to suggest that her death had anythingto do with the roundtable nothing at all kevins efforts to convince himselfof that had almost succeeded when he fixed on the final exchange of the lastmeeting the one between galahad and merlin weve come too far to letanyone threaten our work wasnt that what galahad said it wasdefinitely something like that he thought and what had merlin responded dont do anything rash atleast not until youre certain shes not a policyholder with one of ourcompanies not an exact quote perhaps but closeenough even at the time kevin had felt there was something creepy aboutmerlins comment not the words but the inflection maybe and theexpression on his face it was as if he and galahad were enjoying an insidejoke and now a woman who might bedesiree was dead suddenly in a hospital kevin was badly startled when the phone beganringing he snatched up the receiver kevin burt here hope i didnt wake youlisten somethings come up that i think we should talk about nothing seriousand nothing for you to worry about but i wonder if you could meet me at myboat at say seventhirty the boat the only place dreiser felttruly safe and secure it had to be roundtable business of course kevin said he cleared sometension from his throat ill leave in just a few minutes he put the dellarosa obituary in anenvelope and pushed it into the recesses of his desk drawer then he wentupstairs left a note on the kitchen table for nancy and the kids and headedfor the garage hey hotshot did you forget something nancy called to him from the doorway shewas holding his briefcase in one hand and a bag of pistachios his mostenduring vice in the other she was dressed in the beige silk robe he hadgiven her for christmas early morning sunlight dappled by the maples acrossthe street shone on her in a most appealing way they had met in ninth gradeat a church picnic and had fallen for one another immediately nancy sealy wasbeautiful then and now twentyfour years and three kids later nancy sealyloomis was beautiful still suddenly the vision of her was intruded upon bythe image of kelly naked astride his thighs stroking him patiently expertlyfor a moment just as it had that night his entire world consisted of herglistening coalblack pubic hair he had let her lick him some and even takehim inside her mouth for a while there was no redblooded man on earth whocould have said no to that but just as with desiree he had drawn the line atintercourse and for that restraint he remained grateful accepting the briefcase and nuts hekissed his wife on the cheek then on the lips then on the lips again thistime more passionately hey is this an invitation she askednibbling at his ear because if it is i can call the office and tell martythat honey i cant ive got a meeting with burtill try to get home early though better yet ill call maybe we can meet atthe starlight motel nancy brightened immediately at the idea you mean that meeting kevin at a motel for sex had beenher oftexpressed fantasy since the one time in college when they had actuallydone it ill call early this afternoon he saidif its possible well do it he kissed her once more and trotted to hislexus that was the last time with kelly or any other escort he vowed he wasfaithful but he wasnt goddamn saint francis sooner or later if he keptplaying with fire he was going to get burned he would discuss his decisionwith burt that was just a courtesy given all the man had done for him buthe had made up his mind lancelot would have to invite one less girl to theparty or else do two himself sir tristram was out of that loop he cut through the neighborhood and headedtoward the midtown tunnel dreisers boat a magnificent fortyfoot bertramwas moored at a yacht club near the seventyninth street boat basin on thehudson river side fortysecond street all the way across then up the westside highway he decided at the last minute he changed his mind and took thefdr he could cross over at seventysecond through central park if he gotlucky and made it there with a lot of time to spare his laptop was on the backseat and he had a ton of paperwork to catch up on the portable computer hadcost crown more than he had made in six months when he was juststarting out he slipped a sinatra disc into the cdplayer and closed the windows the custommade sound system had twelve speakersand a twelveband equalizer what a gas kevin thought the dreammachine the dream job the dream house his life was moving along like awelloiled machine and here he was trying to mess it all up in his mind healways was one to look for the catch in any situation the cloud at the end ofthe silver lining the business with evelyn dellarosa was probably nothing morethan two women with a strong physical resemblance and his overripe imaginationat work traffic in town was lighter than usualkevin made the dock with almost half an hour to spare still burt was alreadyon his boat having breakfast on the stern deck he was a handsome fiftyonewith graying dark hair and patrician features i stayed in town last night heexplained motioning kevin to help himself to coffee and juice in town meant on the boat andkevin strongly suspected that on the boat meant with brenda wallace maybeshe was what this meeting was about burt needed an alibi if you have to stay in town kevin saidmotioning across the hudson this is the way to do it your house go through yet today or tomorrow i think port chester right yes port chesters got some nice sectionsvery nice sections the house is beautiful nancyll becrushed if the deal falls through let me know if any problems do come upim pretty good at finding ways to solve problems thank you dreiser flipped what was left of hisenglish muffin over the stern a seagull snagged it in midair so whats going on with you and theroundtable he asked suddenly kevin felt the color drain from his face i dont know what you mean kevin i was brought into the roundtablefive years ago shortly after it was formed after i accepted the chairmanshipof crown it became necessary for me to distance myself from the group ouragreedupon understanding is that should the roundtable ever be investigatedthe company ceos would have to deny any knowledge of it the knights wantedsimply to eliminate my seat maybe look into bringing in someone from anothercompany i cant tell you how strongly i had to argue for them to allow me tochoose a replacement from within crown im glad you succeeded you should be let me give you an idea ofwhat belonging to the roundtable means to us a year or so ago one of theknights got real bad food poisoning at some damn chinese restaurant and thenhad a coronary at the hospital and died his company ceo wasnt allowed torecommend a replacement there had been some problems with the man theknights myself included felt he lacked commitment to what we were trying toaccomplish nobody trusted him if he hadnt died he probably would havegotten kicked off the roundtable before too long that would have been a firstbut unless he changed his ways and his attitude it would have happened as aresult of losing their representation his company mutual cooperative healthlost something like nineteen million this past year nineteen million is a hiti dont want crown ever to have to take so kevin as i have told you many timesthese men are very careful and very suspicious this thing with that magazinereporter whats her name she called herself desiree but i believeher real name might be dellarosa she yes well that thing with the reporterupset some people they worried about what you might have said to her i didnt say dreiser raised a hand kevin please let me finish sorry kevin mumbled it was no big deal but you were the newkid on the block they didnt know you so of course they didnt completelytrust you thats understandable yes yes okay the operative word here is trustkevin if these men dont feel comfortable with you they dont trust you andif they dont trust you youre out and for all i know crown may be out toothat would hurt us kevin nineteen or twenty million a year and god only knowshow much more in the years to come would hurt us badly i understand then why in the hell did you calllancelot to complain about the girl he sent you dreisers voice raised just abit kevin was stunned that such a full reporthad been given to his ceo he stopped himself at the last instant from makingsome sort of excuse or explanation there was one thing and one thing only thatburt dreiser wanted to hear at this point it was a misunderstanding he said itwont happen again excellent excellent dreiser clenchedhis fist for emphasis and pumped it in the air kevin i dont care what inthe hell you do with those girls once theyre in your room but the more theother knights feel youre one of the gang the quicker you actually will be itmay seem trivial to you but believe me when it comes to this group nothingthat goes on is trivial there is just too much at stake i understand good youll be fine just fine as longas you never forget whats on the line chapter six days after evies funeral and exactlyone day before his fiftieth birthday harry corbett realized he was no longer apotential suspect in a probable murder case he was the only suspect in adefinite one the morning had begun like all of theothers since evies death with harry trying to appear focused and businesslikewhile his thoughts were swirling like a tornado although he felt almostcertain that the man who had drugged and then interrogated him that night wasresponsible for evies death there seemed to be absolutely nothing he could doabout it after leaving the apartment he had stopped by paladin thorvaldsshop the two thugs who had attacked him had used thorvalds name but thejeweler knew nothing about them and his manner suggested that he was becomingincreasingly suspicious of harrys sanity harry sensed that before longthorvald would have company in that boat from thorvalds shop he had gone to thelocal police station he made it inside the front door then knowing what layahead he left and started for home a block away he screwed up his courageprepared for yet another onslaught on his selfesteem and went back to thestation with no keys to desirees apartment all he could do was file a reportand wait an hour and a half for the officer to locate the building managerapartment f had been leased to one crystal glass with six months rent paid inadvance in cash harry wondered if crystal glass was another of eviespersonalities or merely a display of her wit he hoped against hope thatsomething in the apartment might have been overlooked that would at least raisethe possibility that he might not be a head case but there was nothingabsolutely nothing be sure to check with us if you get anyfurther information dr corbett the investigating officer said earning a on the point patronization scale sure thing harry responded the two intruders at the apartment had tohave been following him he reasoned but for how long harry worriedthat he might have inadvertently placed julia ransome in jeopardy and called towarn her but over the intervening days nothing had happened when albert dickinson arrived at hisoffice to announce the new evidence that elevated his status to sole suspectharry was just completing a cardiac treadmill test on a seventysixyearoldretired printer named daniel gerstein gerstein a cantankerous survivor of thenazi camps adamantly refused to see any other doctor for the stress test toevaluate his persistent chest pain so harry had temporarily abandoned hispolicy of not doing them his patient had sailed through the protocol with nosymptoms and no changes on his cardiogram degenerative arthritis of the ribcage and shoulders harry told him gerstein demanded a more impressive diagnosisand the feelgood medicine his friends all got from their doctors hesettled for advanced noncardiac thoracic arthralgia and some motrin as he watched the elderly mans heart rateclimb without any abnormality on the monitor screen harry wondered if his ownstress test would look nearly so good the chest pain he had experienced inevies apartment had prompted him to call a cardiologist but when hewas informed the man was out of town at a meeting he had made no attempt tocontact another instead he ran especially hard during his next few workoutson the track there was no recurrence of the discomfort and each symptomfreeday dulled the memories of the numbing sensation and produced any number ofplausible explanations for it what was really happening he decided wasthat his family history the corbett curse he had created had given him anabnormally high cardiac awareness the minor aches and pains most people wouldsimply ignore were gaining heightened significance in his mind his brother hadto have had some chest discomfort from time to time there wasnt a soul whodidnt yet phil wasnt running around checking calendars and callingcardiologists it was because he didnt believe for one second that hisgenetics had doomed him to an early coronary sometime soon harry was thinking as he wroteout renewals for daniel gersteins bloodpressure pills sometime soon hereally would call someone and set up a stress test but at the moment curse orno curse there were other more pressing concerns in his life that was when mary tobins voice crackledthrough his intercom announcing that he had two visitors an officer graham anda detective dickinson dickinson directed officer graham who wasin uniform to one of the chairs harry offered but remained standing himselfpacing as he talked he still reeked of cigarettes and was dressed in whatlooked to harry to be the same illfitting polyester suit he had had on at thehospital so doc dickinson began surveying thediplomas and artwork i told you that night in the hospital id be back andhere i am here you are harry echoed sardonically thats a pretty full waiting room youhave out there you always that busy lieutenant do you think you could comeback after five a lot of those people out there have gone to a good deal ofinconvenience to make it in for their appointments i try to be on time i wish my doctor cared so much aboutbeing on time dr mcnally on central park west you know him i dont lieutenant how long is thisgoing to take that depends on what on you doc does the name he pulledout his spiralbound pad and read the word a syllable at a time metaraminolmean anything to you harry felt his heart sink the faintglimmer of hope that evies blood analysis might be negative had just vanished its metaraminol he saidcorrecting the pronunciation the brand name we doctors know it by isaramine and you know what it does yes i know what it does lieutenant getto the point you keep any of this metaraminolaround its almost never used by anyone anymorei dont keep it around i never have now would you say what you have to sayand leave i have patients to dickinson whirled on him ill say what i have to say when i amfucking good and ready he snapped his fists clenched if you cant do whatmy fucking doctor does which is to keep everyone sitting around until he feelslike seeing them then call your receptionist out there and have her send themall home get out of here harry said now or what or youll call the copsdickinson sighed ostensibly to calm himself look doc lets try to worktogether on this thing it will be better for everyone that way harry snatched up the phone to call theprecinct house then he hesitated set the receiver back down and sank back inhis chair what do you want he asked i want you to own up to what you did toyour wife what doc i know you did it you know you didit anyone who knows anything about this case knows you did it now all youhave to do is admit it i didnt do anything did evie havearamine in her blood dickinson smiled condescendingly only enough to blow the tops off theheads of the whole new york giants football team the me says no one but anmd or someone in the pharmaceutical business would have known about thisstuff now come on doc how about it i didnt kill her this time it washarrys turn to sigh as unsubstantiated as his information was at this pointthere was no sense in keeping it from dickinson she was killed by a man ibelieve is a doctor probably the man maura hughes saw come into the room eviewas working on a story that was making someone very worried all i know is thatit had to do with highpriced call girls and very important people she waskilled to keep her from finishing it the night after her funeral i found thestuff she had been working on in an apartment in the village and and this doctor and two of his thugs brokein on me before i could read much of it sooner or later he would have todisclose the nature of evies alter ego and her writing but he wasnt readyyet how do you know hes a doctor i dont know for sure i just think he isbecause he knows his way around hospitals and drugs he put an iv in my arm inthe apartment then he drugged me with some pretty sophisticated stuff andquestioned me for several hours finally he cleaned out the apartmentcompletely and left leaving you alive after you had seen hisface i i never did see his face or theother two for that matter he noted the cynicism in dickinsons expressionturn to incredulity the two thugs wore stocking masks he explained by thetime the doctor or whatever he is came on the scene my eyes were taped overmaura hughes is the only one i know of who saw his face it had not taken long for harry toappreciate why the mysterious physician had let him live under the influenceof the potent hypnotic chemicals he had told everything he knew which wasessentially nothing the man knew he had been interrupted before he got morethan a glance at evies material and there was nothing in what he had read orseen that would incriminate anyone no names no dates no places if the mdhad faith in his methods and there was every reason to believe he was expertat such interrogations he knew harry posed no threat to him but now harry understood that there wasanother more logical reason he had been left alive if caspar sidonis had notstormed in with his anger and suspicion no one would have questioned thatevies death was due to natural causes hemorrhage at any stage of the game wasa wellaccepted complication of berry aneurysms the medical examiner wouldhave signed her off without a second thought instead at sidoniss insistencea thorough analysis of her blood was being performed the aramine was bound tobe identified and harry would be available to take the blame his murder ordisappearance now would only ensure an intensified investigation of eviescase he had been spared death at the hands of the gladiators in favor of amore protracted demise from the lions so tell me doc dickinson asked howdo you know this guy from the apartment is the same man who killed your wife i dont at least not for certain nowwould you please go i have a warrant to search this officefor that drug doc your condo too oh this is ridiculous if i had donewhat you say i certainly wouldnt be stupid enough to keep a batch of araminearound doc you were stupid enough to kill yourwife and think you could get away with it thats more than stupid enough tokeep a batch of aramine around see graham i told you these mds never giveanyone credit for having any brains thats why they always fuck up and thatswhy they always get caught the young officer shifted uncomfortably inhis seat and looked away youre going to search this office whileim seeing patients we dont have to if you just tell us thetruth look i know about your wifes affair with super doc i know she wasplanning on leaving you i know about the tidy little insurance policy youstand to cash in i know about the drug you used and i know you were the lastone to see her alive now how about it doc maybe it was just a spur of themoment thing she was a beautiful woman you couldnt stand the thought oflosing her suddenly you pass by the medication room you think about thataneurysm of hers next thing you know the drug is in your hand seconddegree thats what youd get nothing more second degrees not that big adeal doc you could be out in five years maybe even get off entirely youfind yourself a good lawyer dickinson studied the citation framedalongside the silver star killed three of the enemy harry knew thewords were not going unnoticed suddenly a thought occurred to him aquestion complete with its answer lieutenant tell me something he saidif you know all this about me and youre so certain i murdered my wife whyhavent you come here with a warrant for my arrest pardon a warrant some judge or magistrate orwhatever has refused to issue a warrant for you to arrest me for murder unlessyou find ive got a secret stash of aramine isnt that true dickinsons expression the tightnessaround his mouth said that he had been nicked what if it is he said in two weeksthe grand jury sits and i guarantee you that with the evidence i have topresent them they wont have any problem handing down an indictment grahamlets get started wait a minute officer on the offensiveat last harry had no intention of letting up lieutenant theres more isntthere is it maura hughes your magistrate believed her claim about someoneelse being in the room after me thats it isnt it you killed that woman corbett they believed her didnt they not her dickinson said barely able totemper his frustration and anger her goddamn yalie brother that asshole wentover my head filed a report cooked his own friggin goose is what he didbelieve me charles manson will get that goddamn detective slot before he doesand dont think for a moment they bought his story neither he just made themdecide to wait until a few things could be checked out thats all and as foryour drunken sot witness her brother wont be able to take the stand in herplace and as soon as anyone gets a look at her and hears what shes liketheres not a soul wholl believe she saw anything except spiders and fliesnow are you going to let us do our work do i have a choice no corbett you dont have a fuckingchoice youre a smug bastard i hate smug bastards and you killed your wifei hate people who do that too its just begun between us doc mark my wordsim going to put the screws to you like you were a dimestore erector set andsooner or later youre going to fuck up count on it come on graham letsget started it took two hours for dickinson and grahamto finish their roombyroom search of the office harry waited a few minutesuntil he was certain the detective wasnt going to return then he took a cupof tepid coffee and a bagel back to his office fished out the slip of paperfrom his wallet and called maura hughes she answered on the sixth ring miss hughes its harry corbett evieshusband remember i remember though her words werent slurred hervoice was husky and her speech seemed a bit thick harry wasnt sure whethershe was drinking again how are you feeling he tried ive been better sorry but ive been worse he waited for more unsolicitedconversation but quickly realized there would be none have the police beento see you nope well they just left my office and i thinkthey might be contacting you soon they found a drug in evies blood she wasmurdered there was silence on the other end that lieutenant dickinson iscertain i did it i think it must have been the doctor you saw still silencemiss hughes are you still there its maura im still here are you okay you mean am i drinking harry pictured the woman in her robe atthe kitchen table of a small dingy apartment staring at a halffilled glassand a halfempty bottle of southern comfort the image brought a heavy sadnessto his throat yes i guess i did mean that he saidsorry its none of my business listen i want to get together with you itsvery important to me why that cop dickinson is on a mission tonail me for evies murder he just left here after searching my office forhours while all my patients watched in fact there were moments when the onlything that kept me from hitting him over the head with a chair was rememberingwhat you called him pinhead i remember well the only reason they haventarrested me so far is that someone a judge or da or maybe one of dickinsonssuperiors is worried that the man your brother reported you saw was actuallythere he was i know thats why i need to see yousomehow ive got to find out who he is and youre the only one whos seenhim there was a prolonged silence when did you want to see me she saidfinally i dont know tonight cant tomorrow then he considered addingthat it would be his birthday his fiftieth birthday but decided against itmaura listen he said if youre embarrassed about drinking please dontbe seventhirty she replied you have mynumber so i assume you know where i live i do thanks maura and dr corbett yes i cant remember the last time i caredenough about what i did to be embarrassed about it but since you keep askingthe truth is that if it sounds like ive been drinking its because i just gotup from a nap i havent had a drink since the day i was operated on hey thats great but i was about to please dont harry did not have toforce desperation into the words again there was prolonged silence i suppose i can keep it together at leastuntil tomorrow night i think maybe i really dont want to drink maybe imjust bored your brother said you were a painterhave you been able to paint any since youve been home not really i havent done much ofanything except hang around here take naps feel sorry for myself and thinkabout drinking well listen maybe tomorrow night wecould go out for dinner youre the main reason im still a free man i couldpick your brain and you could get away from your place for a while if she was as depressed as she sounded heknew there was no possibility she would agree he could feel her choosing theway to tell him so do i have to get dressed up she askedsuddenly not unless you want to when im not atwork jeans is as dressy as i ever get in that case sure maura said idlike that chapter at midnight when he officially turnedfifty harry celebrated with a glass of champagne and a bag of famous amoschocolate chip cookies he hadnt gotten cancer or been run over by a busduring the past three hundred and sixtyfive days but all things consideredhis fiftieth year had been a pretty lousy one and his fiftyfirst was notbeginning with a great deal of promise he indulged his selfpity for a time byflipping through his and evies wedding album and then read himself to sleepwith half a page of his most dependable soporific mobydick ahabwasnt having such a great year either at when his clock radio kicked inhe had already been awake for nearly an hour and was finishing the set of marinecorps calisthenics he did on the days when he didnt run he had always been anathlete of sorts little league baseball crosscountry and some organizedbasketball in college he lacked the natural ability to be a star in any sportbut his competitive fire had made him a fairly consistent winner for the pastdecade though what intensity he still possessed was focused on holding hisground against the passing years now as he grunted past sixty bentkneesitups on the way to seventyfive he found he was drawing strength from hisconsuming dislike for albert dickinson the previous evening harry had arrived athome to find the detective there along with a new uniformed policeman he wasquestioning armand rojas the dayshift doorman but stopped as soon as harryappeared at the door and produced a warrant to search the apartment following the chinesefood deliveryman fiasco with rocky harry had tippedboth doormen handsomely and implored them to be on their toes still hewondered as the two policemen followed him into the apartment to begin theirsearch if the mystery physician had somehow gotten in there again to plant afew vials of aramine his other concern was that dickinson himself might find away to do it to harrys profound relief theoneandahalfhour inspection unearthed nothing but with each fruitlessminute dickinson became more annoyed and more determined by the time he andthe other cop had left he had reiterated in a variety of colorful and profaneways his threat to put the screws to harry there was a small enclosed terrace offthe master bedroom it had a view of the midsection of another apartmentbuilding and might have been considered a solarium if it ever receivedanything more than token sunlight evie had had many plans for the room whenthey first moved into the apartment but soon lost interest in them there weresimilar terraces all the way up the building those on the upper floors hadexpansive views and hours of direct sunlight over time the room came tosymbolize those things she felt were secondrate in their life and sheabsolutely never went out there eventually harry had replaced the tablechairs and small sofa with his exercise mat stationary bicycle weights anda twelveinch tv now he turned on the early morning news and began a sequenceof lifts with tenpound barbells aimed at maintaining strength in the musclesin his back muscles that had been surgically repaired after being shredded atnhatrang the lead story this morning was about the cascading rumors of sexualimpropriety that continued to plague the president and undermine hiseffectiveness the second story dealt with the republican filibuster that hadall but damned the strict caps on healthinsurance premiums demanded by theadministrations healthcare package the third story was about evies murder evelyn dellarosa consumer editor at manhattan woman magazine and wife of prominent manhattan physician drharry corbett died of a brain hemorrhage last week at the manhattan medicalcenter evies stock photo appeared behind the anchorwoman with the word murderedscrolled across it in crimson now according to reliable police sourcesthe death of the former beauty queen and television reporter is being treatedas a homicide harry set the weights aside and sank toone knee as the details of the medical examiners findings were presented in tvshorthand behind the reporter flashed first a photo of mmc then a closeup ofa vial labeled aramine with a syringe protruding from the top andfinally one of harry himself a twentyyearold shot of him in dress uniformthat someone had resurrected from the photo morgue at the times according to police sources the onlysuspect currently under investigation in dellarosas murder is her husband ageneral practitioner on the staff of the hospital in which she was slainreportedly dr corbett who was awarded the silver star for bravery invietnam was his wifes last visitor before her fatal hemorrhage police claimthe couple was having marital difficulties no other details are available atthis time harry buried his face in his handsweariness and perspiration burned in his eyes as promised dickinson was offand running and aside from remaining as composed as possible before theeruption that was about to occur there wasnt a goddamn thing harry could doabout it at that moment the phone began ringing it was rocky martino thenight doorman a film crew from channel had just shown up in the lobby andthe reporter was demanding to see harry about the murder of his wife tell them to go fuckthemselves harrythought tell them there will be no interviewshe said and dont say anything to them yourself nothing at all can i getout of the building through that metal door in the furnace room greatrocky believe me i didnt do anything to hurt evie thank you thank youfor saying that now remember no matter how much you want to help me dontsay anything at all to anyone seconds after he had hung up the phonewas ringing again this time it was his brother before evies funeral harryhad shared with phil a good deal of what had transpired at the hospital withsidonis and dickinson phil had offered then to put him in touch with atopnotch attorney but harry had decided to wait you been watching tv phil asked yeah you okay would you be when did you know for sure about

cops showed up at your office youhave rights you should have let me call my friend mel hes an animal mostobnoxious son of a bitch ive ever known i mean that as a compliment ofcourse you want me to

think about itokay dont take too long oh and harry yes happy birthday mary tobin was the next to call harry hadmade the front page of two papers he assured her hed be in for a full day atthe office and told her not to argue with anyone who wanted to cancel anappointment or even change doctors rocky then phil now mary and it wasjust half past six he said a silent thanks to evie for insisting their numberbe unlisted he stripped out of his sweats and waswaiting for the shower water to heat up when the phone again began ringingthis time he decided the machine could answer it he hovered close enough tohear the caller hello you have reached the phone of evieand harry the voice was evies it was bothbittersweet and somewhat ghoulish to hear her speaking this way before he leftfor work he told himself he had to remember to record a new greeting dr corbett samuel rennick speaking imchief counsel for the hospital if youre screening calls could you pleasepick up harry leaned against the bathroom doorframe steam from the shower had begun to fill the small room goddamndickinson he was thinking okay then i guess ill leave amessage and then try to reach you at the hospital the lawyer pausedagain it was as if he knew harry was listening dr erdman would liketo meet with you about the developments this morning his office ten oclockif theres a problem with that time please call his secretary dr erdman hasasked that i be there as well as dr lord from the medical staff drjosephson who is acting chief of your department and mr atwater frommanhattan health ill be at dr erdmans office beginning at eight you canreach me there if need be thank you owen erdman a highly politicalharvardeducatedandtrained endocrinologist had been president of mmc fornearly a decade during which time he had overseen the physical transformationof a shabby institution and a turnaround of its shaky reputation the jewel inthe crown of his reformation had been the affiliation with manhattan healthbut harry knew that with the new federal health policies alliances between caregiverswere as fragile as spring ice and an allegiance meant something only so longas it was profitable any piece of negative publicity for mmc had to beworrisome to the ceo harry had heard via the hospital grapevinethat his minor victory against the edicts of the sidonis committee did not sitwell with erdman now he was responsible for more soot falling on the manshouse harry showered quickly and then called his brother phil ive decided to take you up on youroffer about that lawyer he said smart move bro if so it will be the first one ive madein a while attorney mel wetstones retainer markeddown twentyfive percent because phils such a good friend was indeed against an hourly rate of and here the president was harry thoughtknocking himself out and pitting brother against brother across the country toeffect health care reform perhaps a bit of attention was due the legalsystem as well harry decided to borrow the against his pension plan rather than wipe out a large portion of his savingshe met with his new lawyer in the family medicine conference room on theseventh floor of the alexander building at mmc wetstone was a prosperousfortyish a dozen or so pounds overweight with thinning dark hair that lookedas if it had been surgically augmented there was a slight wheeze to hisbreathing hardpressed at times to forget that the meter was running at an hour harry reviewed his complete story in detail for the first timeincluding the encounter in the village with his apparent nemesis wetstone wasa sympathetic listener and only rarely interrupted the narrative with aquestion so wetstone said after harry hadfinished what it boils down to is that you didnt do anything wrong andpeople think you did in my business thats the norm my job will be to keepanyone from hurting you now what do you think this meeting at ten is allabout i dont know for certain ive taken somestands on issues lately that havent been too popular with the administrationnow im publicly giving them a black eye i dont think theyd just boot me offthe staff at this point although i guess they could more likely theyll wantto ask me to take a voluntary leave from the hospital until the situation isironed out you want to do that no of course not then thatll be our goal you told me whothis erdman is and i know sam rennick who are the other guys bob lord is the chief of staff hes anorthopedic surgeon he resents that i led the fight to continue to allow gps toput simple nondisplaced fractures in casts without referring our patients to aspecialist hes very much into whos got the power and who doesnt and ithink hes pretty tight with the surgeon evie was involved with i cantimagine him siding with me on anything josephson and atwater are a differentstory theyre about the best friends i have around here steve thatsjosephson is the acting head of the family medicine department until gracesegal gets back from a maternity leave atwater and i are both jazz nuts we goto clubs together once in a while and sometimes he comes to hear me play harry expected the usual questions like ohwhat instrument do you play or you play professionally where insteadwetstone straightened his notes and stood up i want to see if i can speak with samrennick before we go in there he said i left a message for him to call mypager but he hasnt you said you knew him perhaps hesafraid of you wetstone grinned but his small dark eyeswere cold all business i dont know he said but he shouldbe there were fifteen floors in the alexanderbuilding the elevator down was nearly full when it reached the seventh floorby the time it reached the lobby it was packed a sign on the wall of the carwarned passengers to guard their valuables against pickpockets after thousandsof trips harry had already reflexively shifted his wallet from his hip pocketto the front he thought about what it would be like to work in a scrubbedlittle rural hospital with no crushes of people and no pickpocket warnings hedoubted that there was a single scrubbed little rural hospital this side ofbora bora that would take him should he be removed from the mmc staff the conference room adjacent to owenerdmans office featured a long highly polished cherrywood table with roundedcorners and an inlay of the mmc crest at the center the twelve matchinghighbacked chairs each had an identical crest in miniature inlaid at the topharry had been in the room once some years before but was certain the remarkableset had not been there he tried briefly to guess its value then gave up whenhe realized he had absolutely no reference point evie would have known hethought possibly to the dollar steve josephson doug atwater and theorthopedist bob lord were there when harry and wetstone arrived howre you doing steve asked harry answered with a how do you thinkshrug do you have any idea who could have beenresponsible for doing this to evie doug asked not really harry said careful to stop there wetstone had cautioned him against sharinghis theory with anyone even his allies remember that party game of telephone weused to play as kids the attorney had asked well take it from the voice ofexperience no matter how wellmeaning people are the moment words are out ofyour mouth and into their ears the original version begins to change despite wetstones caveat harry would nothave hesitated to share the details of evies secret life with either josephsonor atwater had bob lord not been there instead there was an uncomfortableminute and a half of silence before erdman and the hospital counsel entered theroom with them was a trim businesslike woman introduced as ms hinkle thehospitals head of public relations harry shook her hand and felt as if he hadgrasped a popsicle dr corbett sam rennick began wewondered if you might start by reviewing the events as you see them fromthe night of your wifes death now just a minute sam wetstonerejoined immediately i thought we decided on what the ground rules were goingto be here feeling strangely distant and distractedharry listened as two attorneys whom he had not even known before today debatedhis situation from time to time one of the others at the table spoke up heeven heard himself once or twice but the voices seemed distorted the meaningof their words often lost the whole situation was just too surreal instead ofbeing keen and focused harrys thoughts were drifting he tried to imagine howmany hours hundreds of hours perhaps he was now destined to spend in onetype of legal proceeding or another he had been thrust through the lookingglass into a world where anything however illogical or bizarre waspossible inexplicably with the discussion of hisprofessional future raging about him he found himself thinking about a patientof his a teenager named melinda olivera whose severe mononucleosis he hadrecently diagnosed and treated so aggressively that within a day she was ableto attend her junior prom doctoring had always seemed so straightforward tohim a patient shows up sick and you do the best you can to fix them up nowsuddenly there were lawyers and administrators and publicrelations directors i absolutely disagree doug atwaterssharp words pierced harrys mental fog harry had no idea what was beingdiscussed i have already reviewed matters with the ceo at manhattan healthand he has spoken with the medical director and several other key personnel therehas never been even one complaint about dr corbett his manner of practicehis fees or his conduct we see no reason why he shouldnt continue to be onmanhattan healths role of providers but what will the public think if doug cut ms hinkle short please i dont mean to be rude barbarabut what we need is some sort of strong statement from the hospital that drcorbett has been formally charged with nothing as yet and we at this hospital harry heard little of what followed butnot because his mind was wandering he had reached inside the righthand pocketof his sports jacket for a pen there was none what he felt instead were twoobjects he knew had not been there when he put the jacket on that morning infact he knew they had not even been in his possession slowly he clenched hisfist around them and brought them out on to his lap its agreed then mel wetstone wassaying the hospitals posture will be one of support for a respected staffmember who has not been convicted of or even charged with a crime for hispart dr corbett will refrain from any public statements without clearing themwith ms hinkle and his admitting and treatment privileges at this hospitalwill remain intact does that sound okay with you dr corbett drcorbett huh oh yes thank you all thatsexcellent he barely managed to pull his attentionfrom his hand now open on his lap on his palm lay his watch and eviesrabbitsfoot key chain and keys gone when he awoke in desirees apartmentat some point that morning perhaps in the crowded elevator evies murdererhad been standing behind him or maybe even right next to him the keys weremeant as a reminder of how vulnerable he was a warning to be very carefulwhat he said and to whom but there was also another possibility heacknowledged even more disturbing and chilling the possiblity that he wasnothing more to his wifes murderer than sport a pawn in some macabre game pardon wetstone asked excuse me harry replied againrealizing he had drifted harry you just said something likeim not going to be that easy what did that mean oh nothing harry said slipping thewatch and keys back into his pocket nothing important coronerrules manhattan reportersdeath a homicide kevin loomis stared at the headline in thetimes the photo of evelyn dellarosa was the same as the one in herobituary he tried as he had for the past week to convince himself that herresemblance to desiree was coincidental but deep inside he knew the truth amonth and a half ago wearing nothing but a bra and panties she had kneltastride him kneading the tightness from his back as she asked in a mostflattering disarming way about him and his life kevin read through the article his handswere shaking so hard he had to keep the paper pressed to the table at the lastmeeting desiree had been more or less dismissed as not a serious threat to theroundtable then just a few days later she had been murdered in her hospitalbed her doctor husband was a suspect but no arrest had been made maybethat was because he hadnt killed her kevin felt squeamish throughout the rideto the city he tried to convince himself that he was reacting this way becauseof the intimacy however artificial that he had shared with the woman not solong ago the newspapers and by now he had read the account in all of them toldof marital problems the daily news alluded to a lover evelyn dellarosaor desiree or whoever the hell she was had been murdered by her husband andthat was that kevin did not remember making even one ofthe turns that took him from his driveway to the crown building in midtownmanhattan he parked in the underground space with his name stenciled in blueon the wall and took the elevator up to his office on the thirtyfirst floorbrenda wallace was waiting for him barely able to contain her enthusiasm asshe told him the news your wife called a few minutes ago mrloomis she said breathless with excitement she said the people buying yourhouse have gotten their mortgage and the bank has approved the deal for yournew house in port chester standing in the doorway behind her burtdreiser gave kevin a wink and a thumbs up his expression left no doubt that hehad played a role in expediting the sale im pretty good at finding ways to solveproblems he had said that day on his boat the closings scheduled for wednesdaybrenda gushed on mrs loomis says you can call her at the office if you wantshell be there until five she also said to tell you that the house is reallyno big deal and you dont have to go through with it but that next to the dayyou two got married this is the happiest day of her life chapter maura hughess apartment was on the upperwest side half a block from morningside park harry walked there from theoffice hoping that maura had been able to honor her promise to stay soberpracticing in a fairly indigent area he had encountered the disease ofalcoholism in its most virulent lethal form as well as in its many otherguises it would be no exaggeration to say that he had seen even more tragedycaused by the bottle than he had seen in eighteen months in nam and it washardly reassuring to have his future bound to a woman who had almost lost herlife to drinking even sober her credibility was thin if she started drinkingagain it was nonexistent with mauras claims of a mystery doctorand no physical evidence connecting harry to the aramine injection dickinsonhad been denied an arrest warrant but mel wetstone supported the detectivesassertion that based on the impressive circumstantial evidence a grand jurywould produce an indictment the attorney seemed aroused by the prospect ofdefending harry in what might well become a trial of von bulow proportionssex adultery insurance money a beautiful reporters secret lifeprostitution arcane poisons physicians ringmaster of a media circus at anhourly rate of harry tried to recall if he had ever consideredattending law school he passed a florist debated picking up anassortment then quickly rejected the notion flowers were too reminiscent ofthe hospital and too open to misinterpretation not that maura hughes hadseemed the least bit interested in him as anything other than a source ofsouthern comfort but he had over the years endured unpleasant experienceswith patients of both sexes who had misread the meaning of his commitment inone case it was a concerned afterhours telephone call to a woman whoseinfatuation with him he had completely missed another was an extendedlatenight conversation at a young mans hospital bedside harry finally settled on a box ofchocolatecovered mints if maura was typical of someone newly sober herdesire for alcohol had been sublimated at least in part by a craving forsweets the homes improved measurably as he approached mauras block theapartment buildings had doormen and a number of the brownstones were wellmaintained it was nearing seventhirty but the evening was warm cloudlessand quite light harry paused by a playground where a group of kids black andwhite were playing pickup basketball on a scarred blacktop court they weremostly in their early teens and had no concept of teamwork but their skillsmade them a joy to watch he breathed in the energy of the city and felt someof the tension begin to ease from what had been an absolutely horrible day theonly bright spots were doug atwaters successful efforts to keep him at leastfor the time being on the active staff at the hospital and the almostcontinuous calls and gestures of support from his patients although he had no idea what to expectfrom maura hughes he realized that he was looking forward to her company he hadplayed bass with the guys at ccs once since evies death but most of hisevenings had been spent alone her house was a neat fourstory brownstonewith six broad cement stairs rising from the sidewalk to an ornate mahoganydoor there was a floor at street level with no outside entryway and windowsprotected by heavy wroughtiron grates harry suspected this basement apartmentwas mauras he was surprised to find that of the three bells the topmost onewas hers he identified himself through an intercom and she buzzed him in head of the stairs she said her voice sounded sharp and animated ahopeful sign harry mounted the stairs feeling some relief as much as heneeded company having to babysit an actively drinking alcoholic was not the wayhe wanted to spend his free time maura was standing in the doorway to herapartment his image of her from the hospital was of someone quite shortactually she was tall fivenine or ten with a regal bearing and a willowybody that looked perfect in sneakers worn jeans and an oversized cottonshirt she wore a white turban and no jewelry other than a pair of largehanging earrings colorful chips of enamel delicately wired to one another sothat they changed like a kaleidoscope with every movement of her head shelooked somewhat drawn and ill at ease her hand thin and smooth was coolexcept for the headdress there was no way harry could connect the litheunaffectedly elegant woman with the restless wildeyed patient he had known he handed her the mints she thanked himwith a thin smile that had more sadness than mirth come in come in please she said those earrings are really beautiful thanks i made them harry followed her into an expansiveliving room a bright and airy square perhaps thirty feet on a side thenarrow oak flooring was urethaned to a high gloss and scattered with orientalarea rugs the ceilings were high with recessed indirect lighting that had tohave been designed by a specialist in the craft this was hardly the dingydepressing tworoom walkup he had envisioned surprised maura said reading hisexpression harry gestured to the walls which werefilled with wonderful paintings the canvases were generally large and mostlyoils or some kind of acrylic but there were also watercolors and a fewcollages some primarily portraits were sad and starkly realistic but therest were abstract dynamic worlds of color and shape of meticulousorganization and absolute chaos harry had never been a student of art but hehad always been affected by it what he was sensing now was a remarkablevibrancy and an intense overwhelming anger these are incredible he said walkingslowly about the room i dont paint like that anymore not thati dont want to these are all yours even drunks can do things she saidcoolly hey im sorry if it sounded like thatswhat i meant its not these paintings are really striking thanks you want something a coke somewine coke would be great harry stopped himself at the last momentfrom commenting on the danger of keeping alcohol in the house he followed herto the kitchen which was small but designed for someone who cared aboutcooking to the left of it he could see another huge room a studio withseveral easels stacks of canvases and a large skylight in the far cornerbeneath a racked floortoceiling bookcase and surrounded by ferns and variouspalms was mauras bed look iim sorry if i seem tense ornervous she said her back to him as she filled two glasses its just thati am i probably should have called and canceled she handed him his glass led him backinto the living room and motioned him to a sofa opposite her chair on theglasstop end table to her left was the times open to the article aboutevie harry gestured toward the paper i guess if i was having a murder suspectover for a coke id be a little nervous too he said i hope you know that isnt it you and iboth know you didnt give that drug to your wife what then dr corbett just why are you here look please my names harry once ileave the office i stop being dr corbett and have you have i what left the office dr corbett harry my brother told me what you said to him about your being some sort ofexpert on alcoholism and about how you have people who will help me and takeme to aa meetings and all if youre here to save my soul i think i can saveboth of us a long uncomfortable evening my soul is in the mood to be picklednot saved hey i dont know exactly what i said toyour brother but im not an expert on anything except maybe taking care ofsick people then thats not why youre here yourenot here to ensure that i dont drink i didnt say that either tell mesomething if you believed i was coming over to save your soul as you put itwhy did you say yes because yesterday deep down inside ireally didnt want to drink today i do harry could feel walls going up either hehad somehow gotten off on the wrong foot or she was determined to put himthere if he tried to lie to her now about his motives she would know if hetold her the truth or tried to lecture her in any way he would probably beback at the playground watching basketball before his coke was warm maura im here because im in troublehe said finally theres a cop out to crucify me my hospitals looking for away to drop me from the staff and youre the only one who knows anything thatmight help me i dont have any idea who you saw walk past you to eviesbedside or why he killed her but the other night he could have killed me aswell and he didnt i think he didnt because hes certain that sooner orlater the police are going to arrest me he let me go because he doesntbelieve i have any cards to play but i do two of them actually ive heardhis voice and youve seen his face and you think that if im drinking illbe of no use to you i think that the last time you drank youalmost died i dont want you to die she studied his face i really want to drink she said i know you do he replied with genuineempathy i really want to run away from all this someplace unbearably warmwhere they use shells for currency and havent heard of malpractice suits orhmos or grand juries but im not going to maura opened the box of chocolatecoveredmints slid one onto her tongue and closed her eyes as it dissolved in hermouth you knew about the sweets things didntyou she said harry sensed a letup in the wallconstruction that doesnt make me an expert she savored another mint ten or eleven thousand calories a day inbonbons and life saves and kit kats and i havent gained an ounce go figure youre lucky i just look at that stuffand my belt lets itself out a notch go figure maura said the words in unison with himand then almost laughed almost harry waited she picked at the edge ofthe mint box then closed it and set it on the table he knew this was themoment she was considering asking him to abandon his crusade to keep her soberand just leave and if she did he would have to go and she would be drunkwithin an hour or two harry im sorry for giving you such ahard time she said finally i suppose you know that right now youre theonly thing standing between me and the bottle of southern comfort i have in thekitchen the only thing standing between you andthat bottle is you maura if knowing that makes me an expert then maybe i amone after all in the silence that followed harry feltthe topmost bricks come off the wall just shut up he pleaded withhimself he had said what he could anything more might just turn her off nota word not one goddamn what do you think of this turban she askedsuddenly im very selfconscious about having so little hair i tried a wigbut it looked ridiculous like dickinson pardon albert dickinson you cut him to shredsby telling him that his toupee looked like a piece of lettuce remember harry could tell from her expression thatshe did not oh yes she said with no convictionyou think the turbans ugly i can tell do you think i should take it off i think you should do whatever you wantto you still want to go out for dinner of course even with a flaky bald chick who keepspopping peanut m ampms and raisinets try me she swept the turban off and tossed itacross the room her reddishblond hair had grown back a bit although the scarfrom her operation still showed youre staring she said harry knew he was though not for thereason she was thinking with the headdress gone it was as if he was seeingher face for the first time the swelling and bruises that had so disfiguredher were gone her skin was smooth and beautifully pale with a faint naturalblush and a few freckles highlighting her high sculpted cheeks her eyes arich ocean green seemed possessed of their own intrinsic light and her mouthwas wide and sensual harry felt his own mouth go dry i um i dont think you need theturban he managed okay the turbans history if yourestill up for dinner im a nut for indian food im up for it and i know a place he glanced around the room and realizedthat two and possibly three of the stark portraits were of maura herself theywere skillfully done no one could dispute that and there was certainly aconstancy in her vision of herself but as far as he was concerned none ofthem captured even a trace of the allure and gentle mystery of the womansitting across from him you know she said you really are anice guy id like to help you if i can she took a tan windbreaker from the backof a chair and slipped it on harry did anyone ever tell you that you looklike wait a minute ill think of who oh i know gene hackman i thinkyou look a little like gene hackman harry looked at her curiously uncertainof how to respond her expression was too matteroffact she didntremember i um yes one person did tellme i looked like him your wife no no it was someone else maura imeant to wait until after dinner to discuss the mystery doc but could you tellme a bit of what he looked like how you described him to your brother she seemed about to respond then her eyesnarrowed harry could feel as much as see her confusion you know she said i remember someonecoming into the room at least i think i do but thats all you mean you cant picture his face she looked at him sadly and then shook herhead harry i didnt realize it until rightnow but no i cant picture a thing from that night not a goddamn thing chapter watch that kid shoot harry said asthey stood by the high chainlink fence that surrounded the basketball courtthe little one with the knicks shirt the teenager smaller and quicker thananyone else in the game obliged by sinking an offbalance jump shot fromtwenty feet nice call maura said they watched for a few more minutes andthen headed down manhattan avenue toward central park you sure you want to walk all the way tothe restaurant harry asked i know its hard to believe but before idid my half gainer with a full twist down those stairs i was a fairly decentrunner we walk harry shared details of his own ongoingstruggle to stay in shape you know youre being very patient notgrilling me about that doctor from the hospital she said we can talk about it later i feel terrible but i really cantremember what he looked like i havent thought about the hospital much mostlybecause i didnt want to now i want to but its like like my brain isswiss cheese some things some conversations are crystal clear others just out of curiosity do you rememberyour brothers friend lonnie he was in the room that night his nickname isthe dweeb hes black right exactly harry said excitedly do youremember what he was wearing what he did that night he had a hat on a cap good thats right what else she gazed up at a building then shook herhead sadly nothing im sorry harry i really amits like trying to remember who sat next to me in the third grade i know iwas there and i can pull up some hazy pictures even the dress my teacher usedto wear but no real detail harry recalled how quickly she had noticedjennifers pin and dickinsons hairpiece how rapidly she had reacted duringthe dweebs roleplaying scenarios the specialized area of her cerebral cortexresponsible for awareness had been functioning well that night perhaps evenmore sharply than usual but her ability to file information or at least toretrieve it had clearly been damaged badly damaged it appeared its not surprising i suppose he saidhoping his concern and disappointment werent too obvious the concussion thesurgery the alcohol the withdrawal the medications considering all that ithink youve done pretty damn well im sorry she said again ill keeptrying if something comes back to me youll be the first to know thanks hey enough i call for a changein the subject lets talk about art and war heroes over the years in most social situationsharry seldom carried the conversation thoughtful was the way heexplained that trait boring was evies frequent retort but maurahughes was extremely easy to talk to he rambled on as they walked andsuddenly he found himself talking quite candidly about the corbett curse andhis episodes of unusual chest pain things he hadnt shared with anyone so she said when he had finishedwhos your doctor im getting one he said too quickly she stopped took his arms and turned himtoward her concern shadowed her face promise harry had no idea how long he stared intoher emerald eyes before he responded with all thats going on i wont saywhen but i promise the light changed they crossed columbusand were half a block from central park when she said i think you should knowthat my performance this evening notwithstanding i have a steeltrap memoryfor things that people promise me and i can be an incredible nag when i wantto be i have a feeling you can be an incredibleanything when you want to be harry was totally surprised to hear thewords spoken in his voice was he actually flirting thats a nice thing to say harry sheresponded especially considering that at this point youve known me longerin the dts than out tell me what tipped you over the edge you mean drinking yes she laughed you think there has to be some tragedysome horrid dark event in my past that sent me reeling into the bottle i um i guess thats what iassumed yes well im sorry to disappoint youtheres certainly a lot in my past that i wish had never happened but nosingle cataclysmic tragedy in fact if anything alcohol was a godsend atleast for a while maura talked of her upbringing bywelltodo parents her summers at riding camps her years in boarding schooland finally her

financial reverses and my mother left him he died in a car crash somewhere outside of los angeles far from sober in case you were wondering a woman in the car with him was also killed when she spoke of her father harrynoticed a striking change in her expression and her voice the muscles aroundher jaw tightened her speech became strained and halting an opaque shadeseemed to descend over her eyes a protective membrane shielding herfeelings what about your mother he askedanxious to help her off the subject mothers still alive but neither tom nori ever hear from her except every other christmas or so i doubt shes sobervery often either probably because my parents never even spoke of suchmatters for as long as i can remember ive been acutely sensitive to things inthe world that were tragic or unjust she told of spending several years tryingto write the great american novel including two years on a navajo reservationin arizona but her writing lacked fire and her experiences with the navajosand others who were poor and oppressed only seemed to heighten her sense ofimpotence it was as if the harder she struggled to have her life make sensethe less it did one day not so much for answers as fortherapy i dusted off my paint box and stretched a few canvases i had takensome lessons in high school but never got into it this time from the verybeginning painting felt right to me i wasnt bad either but nobody seemed tonotice my work then a wonderful thing happened to me southern comfort i discoveredthat drinking freed something up inside me or maybe smoothed the rough edgesoff i dont know but i do know that the more i drank the better i painted or at least thought you paintedharry corrected no you may not want to believe it but ireally was better the galleries saw it and so did the people who buyart for a time my work was in great demand i actually bought that buildingmy apartments in then without my realizing it at first i began spendingmore and more time either

alcoholcounselor or tried aa for what there were always reasons idrank relationships that were in the dumper injustices bad reviewsprofessional snubs i saw a therapist for a while she said i just had anartists temperament and passion and besides i always sincerely believed icould quit whenever i wanted to now after whats happened to me im not sosure thats a start what realizing that you may not be able toquit any time you want to the restaurant harry had recommended wason ninetythird near lexington they entered central park at ninetyseventh itwas eightfortyfive but there was a fair amount of lingering daylight theytook a paved footpath down to the reservoir the air was warm and still thewater mirrorsmooth i really love this city harry saidespecially the park do you often walk through here at night the walkway around the reservoir as faras they could see through the gathering dusk was deserted this isnt what i would consider nightyet but the answer is yes i dont tempt fate by bushwhacking but the roadsare safe enough here he skimmed a small stone across the water ta dathirteen skips a new world record how come i only counted eight i can see im going to have trouble withyou enjoying the quiet comfort they were feelingwith one another they headed up a wooded path toward the road the lastvestiges of daylight had given way to evening listen harry she said ive beenthinking and i want to propose a deal you think i should be going to analcohol counselor or aa i think you should be seeing a heart specialist tohave that pain of yours checked out the deal is this you agree to face up toyour problem and ill agree to face up to mine i already promised you id do it im talking about soon if you want illgo to one of those meetings tomorrow believe me its not angina ive beenhaving i know angina its just that im overly aware of chestdiscomfort because of my family history and deal or not they stopped and looked at one another harryswallowed at the dryness that had recurred in his throat deal he said provided you agree notto take a drink of any sort of booze without calling me first and giving me achance to dissuade you deal her smile was warm and hopefulthen suddenly her expression changed her eyes widened harry she criedstaring over his shoulder not a word neither of you the manbehind harry growled harry recognized the voice immediately itbelonged to the larger of the two men from desirees apartment harry startedto turn but the thug several inches taller locked an arm under his neck andthrust a gun into his ribs maura instinctively whirled to run and collidedwith the mans partner who had come charging down the path from the roadcutting off any attempt to escape in that direction the spot they had chosenwas totally hidden from the road above and from the reservoir below mauracried out as the shorter stocky one grabbed her wrist and twisted her arm highbehind her back then he forced her off the path and up the hillside into thedense woods harrys captor shoved him rudely after her no sucker punches this time asshole hesnarled harry tripped on a thick tree root butthe giants grip across his neck kept him from falling after twenty yards theunderbrush and steepness of the hill made it impossible to continue it wasmuch darker than it had been on the path okay down on your knees both of youthe taller man ordered he dropped harry with a sharp kick to theback of the knee maura her hand bent up nearly to the back of her neck waspowerless to resist nice body the thug said as he forcedher face down on to the ground real nice he kneeled on the small of herback shut up and just do what you have to dothe other rasped leave her alone harry pleaded shesno threat to anyone she doesnt remember a thing nothing youve got tobelieve me shut up dammit something solid the mans fist or therevolver butt padded somehow slammed down on a spot just behind harrysright ear pain and a searing white light burst through his head he pitchedforward and landed heavily air exploding from his lungs no please don through a semiconscious haze harry heardmaura cry out then suddenly her words were cut off replaced by a dreadfulgurgling he could feel her kicking her feet flailing desperately against theground beside his face he lifted his head his vision was blurred but throughthe darkness he could see the man with the cinderblock build straddling maurafrom behind his beefy hands tight around her throat pulling her head up as hestrangled her bowing her back no harry cried his voice only a harshimpotent whisper no dont he struggled to push himself up but thebehemoth standing beside him drove him back down with a foot between hisshoulder blades suddenly the man on top of maura gruntedpitched forward and to one side then toppled like a stuffed toy down the hilltoward the reservoir at virtually the same instant the taller man cried outin pain and spun to the ground clutching his right arm instinctively herolled over twice and scrambled for cover behind a large oak harrys head wasclearing rapidly but he still could not figure out what was going on then hesaw the mans gun lying six feet away he crawled unsteadily toward itexpecting the giant to beat him there instead the man still holding his armlurched to his feet and stumbled off through the brush harry snatched up the revolver and thencrawled to where maura lay she was face down and very still but she wasbreathing he turned her over gently and cradled her head in his free hand maura its okay he whispered into herear its harry youre all right his senses keyed his finger tight on thetrigger of the revolver he peered into the darkness straining to see movementor a silhouette the noise of his assailants escape faded replaced by asilence as dense as the darkness in the grove harry checked the carotid pulses on bothsides of mauras neck they were bounding and sharp his own pulse wasbludgeoning the inside of his head mauras eyes were open now and she wassobbing softly harry continued scanning the woods he set the gun on his legand caressed the side of her face he was strangling me she said tryingto clear the hoarseness from her throat i couldnt breathe i know easy does it youre okay now whwhat happened im not sure i think both men were shotbut i didnt hear any gunfire are you all right as soon as i stop shaking i will be ithappened so fast they work for that doctor you saw ithink they wanted to kill you and leave me alive trying to convince the policethat i didnt do it he helped her sit up but continued tosupport her with an arm around her shoulder is someone out there she whisperedgesturing toward the darkness again they listened again there was onlysilence holding the revolver loosely he helped her to her feet the throbbingin his head persisted along with some dizziness a mild concussion hedecided nothing more he touched the bruise behind his ear and winced from thepain but there was virtually no swelling no support for his story that theyhad been mugged the two thugs knew what they were doing professionals butsomeone out here had beaten them both he and maura helped one another down thesteep slope the path dark but still somewhat lighter than the woods wasempty harry again rested his finger on the trigger of the revolver as theysearched slowly along the treeline i was certain the bastard fell this wayharry said maybe he was just wounded like the otherone he didnt roll that way but maybe im not sure i like it here in the parkanymore she said i think leaving may not be such a badidea myself at that moment she pointed at the base ofa tree several feet up the slope an arm protruded from behind it the limphand dangling palm up they swung a wide arc and then approached the tree fromabove the man who had so nearly strangled maura to death was wedged againstthe trunk he wore dark jeans and a black turtleneck the side of his face waspressed into the damp soil his visible eye was wide open staring sightlesslyup the hill here harry said pointing to a spot inthe upper middle of the mans back look maura bent down and could just discern thedimesized hole and expanding disc of blood what should we do she asked harry felt the mans jeans for a walletbut knew there would be none i didnt hear any gunshot he saidagain did you no but i was busy listening to thepearly gates creaking open i think whoever shot these guys had asilencer so professional killers use silencersmaura i think we should get the hell out of here maura rubbed at her neck im with you she said chapter the discovery of a man shot to death incentral park made the latenight news and the morning papers police locatedthe body at ten pm following an anonymous phone tip from a male caller the victimcarried no wallet and as yet had not been identified preliminary impressionwas robbery but police were not ruling out the possibility that the shootingwas an execution harry entered the hospital for morningrounds his thoughts in their nowusual state of disarray the mysterysurrounding evies death remained as murky as ever and now other unansweredquestions had darkened the picture even more who had been down there on thepath in central park silenced revolver in hand ready and quite able to killcould the arrival of their savior have possibly been a coincidence was he someanticrime vigilante no explanation made much sense a few things very few seemed apparentharry remained convinced that his life was not in jeopardy he was being keptaround to deflect responsibility for evies murder mauras continued survivalwas not nearly so assured though maybe albert dickinson gave her eyewitnessaccount no credence whatsoever but clearly the murderer did throughout the night she had said littleof her ordeal but harry shuddered at the thought of what it must have beenlike for her a killers hands tightening around her throat her spine bowednear the breaking point after leaving the park the two of themhad gone to harrys apartment mauras place they decided was simply toovulnerable and although rocky the night doorman was hardly the sort ofprotection that would put ones mind at ease he was better than nothing maurawas certain that by filing a formal report supporting her story her brotherhad already put his future in the department in jeopardy this time around sheinsisted that he not be involved at least not in any official capacity harrydid not completely agree but with all she had endured there was no way he wasgoing to try and change her mind he reported the central park body to froma pay phone for the time being tom hughes would be left out of it once in the apartment they settled on tothe sofa in the small oakpaneled den and turned on the television mauraphysically drained said little she sipped herbal tea nibbled some shortbreadcookies and stared at the screen in just over an hour the first news reportappeared on channel announcing the homicide near the reservoir in central park okay harry she said when the briefreport was complete i think im ready could you please tell me whats goingon i wish i knew he responded he told her about the bewilderingdepressing discoveries he had made in evies greenwich village apartment hetold her what he remembered of the doctor with the cultured accent and of thetwo men with him who had then assaulted them in the park maura listenedwithout interruption so its all about sex she said when hehad finished in a way i guess you could say thatyes somewhere in her what would you call it research evie apparentlycrossed the wrong person whoever it was murdered her or more likely had hermurdered in a way that should not have aroused any suspicion whatsoever aneurysmslike hers rupture all the time im certain there wasnt supposed to be anyflap about it or any autopsy but caspar sidoniss claim that i had reason tokill her changed all that now whoever really did it is committed toproving sidonis is right and to eliminating the only eyewitness aswell maura added harry evie sounds like such a sad mixedup soul believe me when i tell you she didntcome across that way what about children didnt you want themwhen you got married oh very much but she didnt she used to say she did but notreally look i know it sounds like i should have gotten out of the marriageyears ago or never gotten into it in the first place but believe it or nottaken on a daytoday basis it really wasnt that bad we were like a lot ofcouples we got up went to work had a reasonable amount of money hadfriends went on an occasional vacation bought some nice things made love at least in the beginning i took care of my patients played my music did myworkouts jogged through the park i guess i just didnt look at it all tooclosely i understand i think everyone whos in abad marriage is guilty of wearing blinders sometimes for a long while sheleaned back and closed her eyes theres still plenty of time harry for what she yawned and stretched for whatever hours later damp with sweat harry awokefrom a dream he had experienced many times before it was a nhatrang dreamviewed along the barrel of harrys gun beyond the end of the barrel a youngvietcong soldier is raising his weapon his face and expression are indeliblein harrys mind eyes widening in fear he tries to level his semiautomaticharrys gun discharges the youths chest burst open like a ripe melon he ishurled backward into oblivion moments later another soldier even younger thanthe first steps into view at the end of the barrel he spots harry and thewounded man on the ground beside him he raises his weapon harrys gundischarges once again the television flickered across thedarkened room its volume barely audible maura hughes covered with a woolenthrow lay sleeping beside him her head resting on his lap harry clicked offthe set and sat in the near blackness gently stroking her face and herdownlike new hair not once during the entire evening had she made excuses forherself or her life or tried to rationalize her drinking not once had shewhined about the deadly situation into which she had been thrust she might nothave medals as proof but in her own way maura hughes was pretty damn heroicand harry felt drawn to her in a most powerful way he shifted his legs shemoaned softly then rolled onto her back and looked up at him mmmm am i keeping you up she askeddreamily no lately ive spent more nights on thissofa than in bed why dont you go on into the guest room and get some realsleep is staying out here like this analternative if you want heavylidded she smiled up at him thenrolled back on to her side i want she murmured harry had three patients in the hospitalthe first a fouryearold girl with asthma was ready for discharge harrywrote out detailed instructions for the mother who was scarcely more than achild herself but no amount of information or reassurance seemed to be enoughto calm her finally harry took a business card from his wallet here naomi he said writing on theback of the card this is my home phone number if theres any problem withkeesha you dont even have to call the answering service unless im not homebut shes going to do fine the teen slipped the card into the pocketof her jeans then finally accepted the discharge and harrys efforts by givinghim a hug the second patient an elderly man had beentransferred back to harry from a cardiologist following an uneventful threedaystay in the ccu he was a toothless old gent who had been pleasantly confusedfor as long as harry had been his doctor now fifteen or so years with socialservices and the visiting nurses teaming up on his case there was a goodchance hed be back in his own place within the week he patted harry on theback called him dr carson and told him to keep trying and he would be a verygood doctor some day harry smiled sadly at the thought of howtypical how utterly humdrum normal rounds like todays once were now as hemoved through the hospital he was aware of the stares and the pointedfingers and the whispers thats the man the doctor whokilled his wife i cant believe they let him just walk around the hospitallike this he took the elevator to the fifth floor ofthe alexander building the car was the very same one in which he had riddendown with mel wetstone that time evies killer had been one of the crowdpacked in with them this time he was alone the final patient he had to see was inalexander a thirtythreeyearold architect named andy barlow barlow hadbeen hivpositive for two years and was now battling pneumocystis carinii pneumoniathe first indication that he had developed fullblown aids during those twosymptomfree years barlow had continued work at his job with a midtown firmvolunteered countless hours at a hospice for the homeless and disenfranchisedand led the campaign for expanded needle exchange and improved local servicesfor aids patients another legitimate hero harry thought as he entered theroom andy barlow oxygen prongs in place didnot look as good as harry would have wished his color was sallow and somewhatdusky his lips more purplish than they should have been he sat propped up atan eightydegree angle quietly working to get air into his lungs still hemanaged a smile hey doc he said the words punctuatedwith coughs hi yourself harry pulled up a chair and sat flippingthrough the pages in barlows chart the reports blood count oxygen levelschemistries chest film actually looked better than the patient did theywere reason to be at least a little encouraged whats the news barlow asked well the returns from these key upstateprecincts say were winning harry said tell that to my lungs that bad actually not andy said and paused forbreath my breathings a bit easier and im not coughing nearly as much hecoughed again several times and then laughed at himself as usual the manspeaketh too soon harry examined his throat chest heartand abdomen not bad he said now genuinelyencouraged hows your head andy shrugged i think being hivpositivefor a couple of years has helped a bit in getting ready for this but im stillpissed and and a little frightened me too harry said i know and i appreciate your saying it andy barlow wasnt the first patient withaids harry had cared for or even the tenth healthy habits exercisepreventive medications and aggressive treatment of infections had made asignificant contribution to the quality and quantity of each of their livesbut a number of them had already died this lung infection marked barlowsfirst step on a new road the questions of whether and when he would developthe fullblown disease had been answered now physician and patient had toreorder their priorities and their expectations harry feigned another chestexam until he was fairly certain his own emotions were under control you know andy said dont take thispersonally but i dont think i fear dying as much as i fear being sick all thetime ive spent so much time in hospitals with my friends i just dreadbecoming one of them i understand well i promise you imgoing to do everything i can to get you out of here pronto and to keep you outand as far as getting sick over and over goes i know nothing i say can takeaway that worry just try to focus on the truth that today is what you have itsall that any of us have the only thing you can do is try to live it to thefullest keep reminding me i will if you want me to now listen ireally do think the iv bactrim has turned the tide your films a littlebetter and sos your blood count good because im one of the principledesigners of the renovations on the claridge performing arts center and i wantto be at the opening production on the twentyfirst ten days hey no problem mon with mystethoscope tied behind my back even guaranteed you have my word andy an iv in his right hand reached outand grasped harrys right hand with his left harry squeezed his hand then turnedquickly and left the room this was a situation he would never get used to orinured to and in truth he never wanted to be he returned to the nurses station andwrote some orders for intensified respiratory therapy on andy barlow nearbytwo nurses were chatting with the unit secretary he had known each of themcordially for some time in one case many years now none of the three brokefrom their conversation to acknowledge him he flagged the new orders and setthe threering notebook chart on the secretarys desk just a few new orders he said thank you doctor the woman repliedwithout looking over ill take care of it harry gave momentary thought to forcing aconfrontation with the group a plea against being judged prematurely hedecided against it constitutional guarantees notwithstanding he knew that inmany minds he was guilty until proven otherwise as long as his situationremained unresolved there would be coolness and distance and silence andthere wasnt a damn thing he could do about it he trotted down to the first floor and outof the hospital the morning was cloudless and warm and with twenty minutesbefore his first office patient he could actually walk slowly enough toappreciate it he wondered how maura was doing by the time he had left forwork the reality of her situation had begun to sink in for her she seemedirritable deflated and distracted and although she didnt say so harrysensed she was thinking about how much easier everything would be with a drinkthey had decided that she would return to her apartment with a friend of herspack some things and move into harrys place for a few days meanwhile shecould decide about calling her brother when she did move back to her ownplace harry offered to hire a security guard until when she asked harry didnt try arguing with her on thatpoint especially since she was right if someone particularly a professionalwanted badly enough to kill her she would have to go into the deepest hidingor else sooner or later she would be dead it was that simple there was one person seated in the waitingroom of harrys office when he arrived a man he had never seen before hisface holloweyed and gaunt spoke of hard times his black graying hair wasclosecut and there was nervous tension about him that harry could almostfeel he had on faded jeans worn sneakers and a navyblue windbreaker with ayankees logo on one breast harry nodded a greeting before heading into marytobins cubicle the man responded with a thin smile whos our friend harry whisperedstudying the appointment book which showed a number of cancellations and noname written in this time slot his name is walter concepcion hesunemployed and has no insurance what else is new hes been having headaches who referred him believe it or not he says he read aboutyou in the papers doctor suspected of murdering his wife what better recommendation could any patient want well mary said youve never turnedany patient away that i could remember so i took the liberty of having himfill out a registration sheet and questionnaire fine it doesnt exactly look like weregoing to get buried in an avalanche of appointments oh well be all right tell me thoughhowre you doing aside from almost getting maurakilled last night witnessing a murder and having almost no idea what in thehell is going on not bad not bad at all i go to bed confused i wake upconfused he said instead that doesnt make you any different fromthe rest of us mary said smiling you just hang in there an the answerswill come she looked as strained and tired as he hadever seen her yet here she was with anxious callers to assuage cancellationsto accept without comment reporters to fend off and she was concerned withhow he was doing harry added her to his list of heroes he picked up the clipboard with the healthquestionnaire his new patient had filled out walter concepcion was fortyfivewith no phone a nextofkin his brother in los angeles and an address inspanish harlem as mary had warned he had no health insurance but he did listan occupation private investigator harry introduced himself andmotioned the man to follow him to his office i was a licensed pi concepcion explainedin response to harrys question but i got in a little trouble a few yearsback and they pulled my ticket his new york accent without a hint of latinosuggested he was us born next march im eligible to get it back i still dosome jobs for people but under the table if you know what i mean the tension harry had sensed in thewaiting room was physically apparent in an intermittent tic of the muscles onthe right side of concepcions face and in his fingers which seemed to be inalmost constant motion the trouble you got into harry saiddrugs without hesitation concepcion noddedcocaine crack actually i thought i could handle it no one can you got that right i been clean foralmost three years now though no drugs no booze no wine nothing not thati deserve a medal or anything but ive gotten my act back together that is a big accomplishmentharry said theres no need to put it down he liked the mans directnessconcepcions eyes though deeply sunken were bright and intelligent and madesteady level contact with harrys well mr concepcion i have about twentyminutes before my next patient is due harry said headaches are among thehardest symptoms to diagnose correctly but ill do my best you may have tocome back another time or two thats okay with me doc as long as i canstretch out my payments im not broke but i do have to balance who gets whatif you now what i mean no problem harry said why dont yougo on down to room two on the left ill take a brief history and examine youthere concepcion rose and left the room just asharrys private line began ringing the private line direct to the backoffice enabled harry to make calls without tying up an office line it also ensuredthat emergency calls from the hospital wouldnt encounter a busy signal dr corbett he said flipping through asmall stack of mail mostly junk that mary had left on his desk i am very upset with you doctor thefamiliar slightly accented voice said very upset harry tensed even if he could somehowalert mary there was no extension to this line at the front desk who are you he demanded the man you trapped and killed somercilessly last night meant a great deal to me the words were spoken without emotion listen i didnt trap anyone your goonstried to kill us im not sorry someone saved our lives but i have no idea whodid it i think youre lying dr corbett iblame myself for not considering that you might have arranged to have yourselffollowed but i think youll see that it was an unfortunate foolish thing foryou to do very unfortunate and very foolish who are you why are you doing this whydid you kill evie you have become a great inconvenience tome dr corbett the soft voice went on and i intend to do something aboutit it would make things much easier for any number of people if you would justfind some clever painless way to take your own life go to hell dead or in prison for life i am afraidthose are now the only options available to you if you dont wish to killyourself now i promise you will before i am through the man you arranged tohave gunned down last night was a close associate of mine he will be avenged why cant you just leave us alone i haveno idea who you are and neither does maura hughes she doesnt remember onething from her time in the hospital nothing ah would that i could believe that nowthen we come back to the dual issue of your punishment and your suicide bothof which i consider essential to show you how serious i am about this i havechosen that young gentleman you were speaking to not so long ago barlow isit you bastard dont you touch him a nice enough fellow it seems but mostunfortunate in having you for his physician no consider your options dr corbett ivmorphine is totally painless any number of sleeping pills would do the trickfor you as well so would carbon monoxide falling from a great height wouldprovide a wonderful rush i would think and would only hurt for a moment abullet upward through the palate would probably hurt even less please harry begged please give metime give me time to decide oh you have all the time you want thank you thank you very much but im afraid mr barlow has no time atall good day doctor nooo harry bellowed as the dial toneintervened damn you no harry looked up at that moment andrealized that walter concepcion was standing just outside his door i i just wanted to know if i shouldget changed he said embarrassed mary tobin responding to harrys shoutcame rushing past him and into the office call alexander five he ordered tellthem to get someone into room fiveohfive now andrew barlow roomfiveohfive im on my way over yes doctor mary tobin said mr concepcion youll have to come backanother time without waiting for a response harrybolted past the bewildered man out of the office and across the sunlit streetit was six blocks to the manhattan medical center chapter in this part of the city people were notthat surprised to see a man dressed in loafers and a suit sprinting along thesidewalk dodging pedestrians harry felt as if he was running throughmolasses the morning was already nearing eighty and quite humid passersbymoved aside and a few turned to watch but most of them were looking past harryto see who was chasing him harry knew he had a faster gear but with the chestpain still unresolved he was reluctant to use it as it was he felt somesharp jabs inside his left chest and he wondered with each block when thedebilitating bandlike discomfort was going to take hold by the time he reached the hospital hewas carrying his suit coat and using one sleeve to mop sweat off his face hedashed through the main doors anticipating that the overhead page would becalling out a code on alexander there was no such announcement nor hadthe pager hooked to his belt gone off the lobby was crowded as usual out ofdeference to the hospital and the patients harry slowed to a rapid walk downthe main corridor to the alexander building cutoff at certain times of theday taking the elevator might have been faster than the stairs but harrynever gave it a thought grateful for his regular workouts on the track hetook the stairs two at a time again there was some discomfort in his chestbut nothing major nothing that definitely said cardiac muscular orgastrointestinal harry decided filing the conclusion away the code cart was parked outside thedoorway to room harry cursed out loud as he hurried toward it he was justa few feet away when he realized that the cover had not been removed from thecart the two nurses who had so blatantly snubbed him just an hour ago werestanding nearby chatting they looked over at him and he could feel as muchas see their disdain whats going on he asked we dont know one of the womensaid pointedly you tell us harry stepped past them and into the roomsteve josephson stethoscope in place was standing on the far side of the bedhunched over andy barlow examining his chest and back the young architectwith his oxygen running almost wide open at six liters a minute looked aboutthe same to harry as he had on rounds sick but in no mortal distress stuff at both lung bases josephsonmuttered to himself he glanced up and noticed harry hey there you are hesaid i was on the floor finishing rounds when the nurses grabbed meapparently your office nurse called and said there was an emergency with mrbarlow here harry approached the bed aware that acluster of people nurses the ward secretary and a couple of residents were now filling the doorway he knew that no matter what he said hiscredibility already greatly diminished around the hospital would soon beextinct he had been set up by a maniac and quite masterfully at that i got a call on the private line in myoffice harry said in a near whisper that he hoped would not be audible tothe gallery the man on the phone implied that he looked at his patient andmeasured his words carefully that he might be planning to harm andrew herein some way but why barlow asked the question nearlylost in a spasm of coughing harry turned to the crowd look could someone please close thedoor he asked no one in the group moved harry stalkedover to do it himself the head nurse corinne donnelly stepped inside ill allow you to close the door shesaid but i intend to stay and hear exactly what explanation you have to offerfor this donnelly about harrys age had once senta close friend to him for medical care now she eyed him challengingly almostbegging for a confrontation come on in harry said wearily the nurse nodded people away from the doorand then closed it behind her steve josephson rested his considerable bulkagainst the wall harry turned to his patient andy we havent spoken about this but iassume you know about my wifes death and some of the newspaper and tv reportsabout me i do i didnt believe them the two sentences again sent barlow into aracking cough harry wondered what this scene was costing him in stamina youre right not to believe the papersharry said i didnt do anything to harm my wife but whoever did administerthat lethal injection is very angry with me i im not sure i know whyapparently hes decided to hurt me by threatening my patients steve josephson said you mean thatbecause this guy has some sort of grudge against you hes killed evie and nowwants to hurt your patients i think there are other reasons he killedevie i think he was threatened by some research she was doing but as far asandy goes the answer is yes i know it sounds crazy steve but it doesnt sound crazy corinnedonnelly cut in it is crazy dr corbett i think we should talk in myoffice harry looked down at his patient whatever you have to say you can sayright here okay have it your way doctor i intendto call the nursing director right now and ask her to speak with both drerdman and dr lord immediately i dont believe your story one bit aboutyour wife or about this mystery caller i dont know whats going on whatswrong with you but i do know that recently youve changed drastically maybeits some sort of posttraumatic stress syndrome something to do with thewar or maybe it has to do with your wife and dr sidonis whatever it is youneed to get help before anyone else gets hurt and for everyones sake youshould voluntarily take yourself off the admitting staff of this hospital untilthe truth comes out this young man has enough problems without being put injeopardy by his own physician harry looked over at his longtime friendjosephson shifted uncomfortably and stared down at the floor in the prolongedsilence they could hear some scraping from the other side of the door thestaff was still there undoubtedly pressing in to hear what was going oncorinne donnelly moved to put a stop to the eavesdropping but harry motionedfor her to stay put thats okay he said mrs donnellyyoure right i need to do whatever i can to keep my patients from beingendangered by this this sadistic lunatic but theres no reason tobelieve that taking myself off the staff will accomplish that closing mypractice would be like admitting that ive done something wrong and i haventim sorry but i intend to stay on and see this thing through not if i have anything to say about itthe nurse snapped she turned and stalked from the roomnearly colliding with the assembly pressed against the door harry im behind you one hundredpercent josephson said just let me know if theres anything i can do illsee you later mr barlow i hope you know that you couldnt have a betterdoc i do know josephson shook hands with andy thenpatted harry on the arm and left closing the door behind him looks like weve both got some toughtimes ahead of us barlow said his breathing was more labored than it hadbeen harry could see that he was exhausted and desperately in need of reststress was dangerous for a man in andys condition harry felt at once angryand impotent he was being manipulated like a puppet by a madman who thrived oninflicting pain andy im sorry he said hey what can you do ill call here later on to check onthings if its okay with you thanks hey doc yes the young man with newly diagnosed aidsreached out for the second time that morning and took harrys hand everythings going to be all right hesaid yeah i know it will harry turned and hurried from the roomnearly colliding in the hall with a bronzeskinned man dressed in surgicalscrubs carrying the metal basket of the intravenous service oh excuse me please the man said ina dense indian accent harry muttered that it was no problemaware that backs had turned and all activity had gone freezeframe as soon ashe neared the nurses station he left the floor as quickly as possible onceback at his office he would call doug atwater at manhattan health to begindrumming up support should corinne donnelly or anyone else try to have himremoved from the staff a call to mel wetstone might be in order as well as he headed back down the stairs harryfound himself wondering what might have happened if instead of shooting thetwo men in central park the unseen gunman had captured them and turned themover to the police maybe the whole nightmare would have been over by nowinstead evies killer had decided that harry would pay for that shooting he entered the main corridor againsensing the stares and whispers could it possibly get any worse than this five floors above the male nurse from theintravenous service strolled unnoticed into room and readied his equipmentby the bedside he wore the headdress and beard of a sikh andrew barlowglanced up at him sleepily everything okay andy asked oh yes everything is fine just finethe man said in staccato english he peered down at andrews iv site throughtortoiseshell glasses just a routine check no needles no new iv oh good andrew smiled weakly and drifted off the nurse whose mmc name tag identifiedhim as sanjay samar rn checked the bag of glucose and the plastic infusiontubing then he injected a small amount of liquid through the rubber port just to clear line he said softly mmhm andrew murmured without openinghis eyes sanjay was putting his metal basket backin order when he noticed a patch of white skin just inside his elbow in thefuture he thought when he used that particular skin dye he would have to bemore careful he left the room and walked purposefully to the stairway that wasfarthest from the nurses station his expression was all business but beneathhis spectacles and his dark brown contact lenses his pale blue eyes weresparkling chapter all right doc lets start all overagain from where from the fucking beginning thats fromwhere albert dickinson his rumpled shirt indesperate need of dry cleaning stubbed out one pall mall as he prepared tolight another the ashtray was fulltooverflowing the small interrogationroom reeked of years of tobacco stale coffee and body odor harry shifteduncomfortably in the slatback wooden chair and wondered if he should back offon saying anything else without calling mel wetstone but the truth was he haddone nothing wrong and aside from his intimate involvement in last nightscentral park murder he had nothing to hide still his troubles were piling uprapidly and now a young man he cared very much for was dead approximately twenty minutes after harryleft room a nurses aide found andrew barlow lying peacefully in bedwithout any pulse or respirations a brief attempt at resuscitation by thenurses and residents was called off because of fixed dilated pupils and anabsolutely straightline ekg although morning was the busiest most hectictime of day in the hospital with any number of technicians physiciansstudents maintenance people aides transportation workers and nurses comingand going none of the staff on alexander recalled seeing anyone enter orleave barlows room after harry after receiving the news harry canceledwhat few patients he had left to see and returned numb and dreamlike to thehospital andy barlow lay on his back in the semidarkness a sheet drawn up tohis chin his face already reflected the early mottling of death harry wantedto scream to bellow like the wounded animal he was he wanted to destroy theroom to rip attachments from the wall to snatch up a chair and hurl itthrough the plate glass window instead he sat alone by the bedside andybarlows hand in his and wept before he left the floor he placed threephone calls the first was to inform owen erdman that he would be calling backlater that day to set up an appointment as soon as possible the second callwas to andys family and the third was to albert dickinson if you think being the one to notify metakes you off my list dickinson said now youre crazy he thought for amoment and then added but thats just the point isnt it what that youre crazy dickinson could not charge him with anycrime until an autopsy proved that andy had died of something other thannatural causes but even a negative autopsy would leave unanswered questionsafter all the young architect was officially listed by the hospital as beingin guarded condition and the nurses to whom dickinson had spoken testifiedthat harrys false alarm had doubtless added immeasurable stress to an alreadydifficult situation it wasnt a false alarm harry saidwith exaggerated patience my office manager heard the call correction sir she heard the phone ringeven a dumb cop like me knows the difference between hearing a phone ringand overhearing a conversation well there was a patient of mine theretoo standing in the hall right outside my door he heard some of theconversation some of my half of it anyway well i guess that convinces me dont be snide then dont keep throwing ridiculousstories at me like im some sort of fucking retard the mans name was concepcion walterconcepcion harry reviewed the little he had learnedabout his new patient former private detective now unemployed recoveringcrack cocaine addict chronic headaches nervous tic just the sort ofcorroborating witness dickinson would expect him to come up with one thatwould fit in nicely alongside dting alcoholic maura hughes bookends get me this walter whatsiznames addressand ill speak to him dickinson said listen harry responded just tell meone thing what would i have to gain by faking such a phone call why would ido it let me think why would you fake aphone call from the man you say killed your wife announcing that now he hasdecided for no particular reason to knock off some poor faggot who was going todie anyway gee beats me i didnt kill my wife i didnt make upthe phone call are you done with me you know it could be this guy just diedof heart failure or something dickinson went on loosening his tie i meanif i was lying there in guarded condition with aids and pneumonia and my doctorcame bursting into my room screaming that someone was trying to kill me imight just croak too harry sighed look lieutenant i called you and toldyou about andys death i waited around while you and your man questionedeveryone on the floor i came down here to the station without calling alawyer ive sat here for an hour and a half answering questions that iveanswered two or three times already ive listened to your insults and yourinnuendos and your accusations and i havent given you a hard time in any wayright at this moment im feeling incredibly bad about what happened to andybarlow i really liked him and i was working like hell to get him through hispneumonia i think he was murdered by the same man who murdered evie but thatman wasnt me if you have any questions i havent heard before ask themotherwise i want to go home if that autopsys positive youre myman dickinson said fine and if its negative youre still myman thats your problem dickinson moved to stub out ahalffinished pall mall realized what he was doing and instead flicked theash in harrys general direction before taking another drag harry took hissuit coat from the back of his chair and headed for the door you havent arrested me for evies murderbecause you couldnt find a da who thought you had a good enough case andtheyre right i didnt do it tell that to the grand jury doc ivegot a weeks pay says theyre about to come down on you like a ton of bricks you know how to find me harry said it was after three when harry returned tohis office the waiting room was empty behind the glass of the reception areamary tobin looked forlorn we had already canceled and rescheduledmrs gonsalves and the silverman kids once before today she said doragonsalves was okay about it but mrs silverman was upset she called just afew minutes ago to ask that her familys records be sent over to dr lorello marvs a good guy hell take good careof them youre not upset of course im upset mary but what am isupposed to do i dont know oh lord im sorry dr ci guess this is all starting to get to me me too its terrible about andy barlow harry crumpled a blank intake form andclenched his fist around it the bastard who killed him is going topay he said i swear he is he threw the balled paper at the wastebasketand missed by two feet i had to call andys folks at delaware and tell themi hate that part of the job anytime but i hate having to do it over the phonethe most mary stood up and embraced her boss herfamily had seen more than its share of tragedy over the years and she knew howto comfort and console there was a special warmth in her wide girth thatreminded harry of his own mother before her recurrent strokes and weight lossof seventy or eighty pounds he prolonged the hug for a few extra seconds im afraid i have another piece of badnews she said as he drew away sara quit harry felt himself sink his nursepractitioner had been part of the office for over four years she was brightanxious to learn and quite willing to handle most medical problems the way hewould have his patients loved her and she actually generated a bit more moneyfor the office than her salary he glanced down the hall but could tell thather office was dark what happened he asked all this stuff has been really getting toher i think her husbands been putting pressure on her too she went homesick today but she said shell finish the week two if you really want one will be okay harry saiddistracted ill talk to her tomorrow another casualty mary didyou reschedule that man walter concepcion next week wednesday i think he triedexplaining to me what he overheard from your end of that call from fromthat man i think he was embarrassed and upset about not just turning aroundand walking away im actually glad he didnt do we haveany phone number for him we do he didnt put one on hisquestionnaire but he left one later i think the phones in the hallway of arooming house of some kind copy it and his address for me will youplease i might try and get in touch with him at that moment the private line in theback office began ringing harry tensed quick mary he said whisperingalthough there was no one around to hear follow me in case its him they hurried down the hall to the officehe motioned her to a spot where they could share the receiver the phone was inits fourth ring when he snatched it up dr corbett he said harry hey im glad i found you itsdoug harry covered the mouthpiece its doug atwater he said obviouslydisappointed the killer hasnt made any mistakes yet i guess it was wishfulthinking expecting him to make one now he waited until mary had left thentook his hand off the mouthpiece hi doug he said atwater was just about the only personaffiliated with the hospital that he could deal with hearing from at thispoint harry i just got a call from owenwanting to know if i had heard from you he told me about that poor guy onalexander five its terrible just terrible and i know you arent responsiblein any way doug theres a madman loose in thehospital he killed evie and now hes trying to hurt me any way he can owen told me thats what you believe isgoing on that is whats going on hey theres no need to bite my head offthis is the first time youve said a thing to me about any madman in thehospital sorry harry the nursing service has beenbugging owen that you were supposed to have called and taken yourself off thestaff is that so no its not doug ive spent twentyyears establishing myself as a doctor im not going to just chuck it nowbesides if i dont hang in there and fight theyre never going to find theguy whos doing this as things stand finding him is my only chance hang in there and fight harry thought back to themorning just a few weeks ago when he complained to phil that he didnt have anychallenges in life you coming in to talk with owen aboutthis atwater asked yes i was going to do it a couple ofhours ago but ive been tied up with one of the detectives oh you know theguy dickinson that same one from when evie died oh no that guys an idiot does hethink youre responsible for this mans death too of course oh shit harry im sorry listen isthere anything i can do i wish there were you dont have any idea whos doing thisto you not a clue there was an uncomfortable silence you know harry atwater said finallymaybe you should consider taking a little time off from the hospitalat least until this business cools down until the dust settles ive beenbehind you one hundred percent in this thing you know i have but with thenurses on the warpath and owen having a meltdown its getting hot damn hot you dont believe me either do you ican tell from your tone of voice harry youve got to be reasonable thereare other sides to this thing thanks for calling doug every singleone of you might vote to throw me out but im not quitting harry set the receiver down withoutwaiting for a reply and sank into his chair his longstanding friend andpossibly his last ally at the hospital had just bailed out atwater lacked theauthority to get him lifted from the staff at the hospital but he couldsuspend him as a provider for the manhattan health hmo manhattan healthpatients probably represented or percent of his practice without themit was doubtful he could stay in business for long mary tobin returned to his office doorwayand announced that she had done as much as she could and was leaving for theday to run some errands harry thanked her told her with too little convictionnot to worry and watched as she left the office tomorrow he would share thenews of the body blow that atwater seemed poised to deliver he had no desireto heap more worry on her today than he had already he scanned his desk and the floor aroundit for any charts that needed dictating there were none he dialed maurasapartment number and then his own but got answering machines in both places harry told each machine that he would behome by four then he called owen erdman and set up yet another appointment todiscuss his future at manhattan medical center finally he straightened hisdesk set his feet up on one corner closed his eyes and tried desperately tothink of something anything he could do to cut through the insanity that wassmothering him the ringing phone nearly startled him out of the chair onceagain it was his private line he lifted the receiver but said nothing inthe brief silence that followed harry knew the killer was back back togloat the autopsy on your patient will benegative the unmistakable voice said how do you know i have access to a neurotoxin so powerfuland so shortlived that by the time it kills it has already begun disappearingfrom the body the final metabolism of the poison actually occurs after deathand here we have the temerity to call the indians in the amazon basin savagesi tell you when it comes to killing they are virtuosos harry could feel the killers arroganceand enormous ego having witnessed the unspeakable consequences of angeringhim he chose his words carefully what do you want from me closure thats all same as before idprefer you did it with a note ideally with a note admitting to theilladvised administration of what was it you used oh yes aramine theilladvised administration of aramine to your wife you will at last be atpeace and i will have my closure im no threat to you at all harrycountered no one is i cant even get anyone to believe that you exist cant even get anyone tobelieve that you exist harrys thoughts were suddenly racing theman was insane true but he was also smart why was he taking a chance likethis calling harry in the office when anyone might overhear his confessionall harry needed was one reliable ally with firsthand knowledge just one heknew about the private line and apparently he also knew there was no wayharry could signal one of his office staff to pick up an extension but howcould he know that someone wasnt standing by listening as mary tobin had whendoug atwater called he was bold and arrogant but he was certainly notcareless why would he chance it harry struggled to understand thensuddenly he knew the bastard was watching the office right now somewherenearby watching no other explanation made sense listen a delivery man just came downfrom one of the upstairs offices harry said i just have to give him apackage if you have anything further to say to me stay on ill be rightback he set the receiver on his desk andsprinted down the hall to the front door there was a pay phone on the otherside of the street two buildings down his tormentor had to be there harry charged from the building into thelate afternoon glare narrowly avoiding a yellow cab as he raced across thestreet the half kiosk housing the pay phone was deserted but it hadnt beenthe receiver dangled down swinging to and fro like a pendulum the white handkerchiefresting on the small metal counter promised that there would be nofingerprints harry raced to fifth avenue the nearest corner pedestriantraffic was heavy he scanned the street searching for someone who looked outof place or interested in him nothing carla dejesus the elderly proprietorof a small variety store stopped sweeping the sidewalk by her shop and wavedharry waved back walked over and asked if she had seen anyone unusual oranyone running down the street she had seen no one he wanted to scream to lash out and hitsomething anything but his sanity was already in doubt in too many quarters im going to find you you bastard hemurmured as he continued straining to see anything out of the ordinarywhatever it takes im going to find you he returned to lock up the office onimpulse he tried calling his apartment again maura answered on the firstring it wasnt until he heard her voice that he fully realized how worried hehad been about her maura hi its harry he said howre you doing mr doctor her speech was too fluid too singsonghis spirits already low sunk even further maura are you drinking he said the ensuing pause was answer enough not enough to matter she said flatly maura please he said battling to keepboth his fear for her and his anger in check please stop stop now i needyou evies killer thinks i paid to have someone follow us last night hethinks im responsible for the death of his man to pay me back a few hoursago he killed one of my patients a thirtythreeyearold guy he just waltzedinto his room and killed him then he called here to boast about it he harry had to stop speaking to compose himself maura said nothing listen hefinally managed youre youre the only friend i have right now i donteven know what to do the bastard said he wasnt going to stop hurting me or mypatients until i until i kill myself for another ten seconds the line wasquiet harry why dont you come on home shesaid what are you going to do well for starters im going to take ashower harry gave a silent prayer of thanks heavy on the cold he said chapter harry had dealt with enough activelydrinking alcoholics to know that no promise especially the one not to drinkanymore meant much he took a cab across town expecting the worst as far ashe was concerned maura had to bear some responsibility for starting up againbut he also believed that she had been discharged prematurely following heroperation at mmc not necessarily prematurely for her surgery or even for thedts but certainly for her alcoholism she needed more time in the hospital someone to develop a workable treatment plan she would have benefited fromsocial services intervention some psychotherapy perhaps a visit or two frompeople from aa and quite possibly an inpatient stay at an alcoholism unit aswell once upon a time that was the way it had been done but now even if herphysician knew this approach would give her the best shot at recovery herinsurance carrier dictated otherwise there were codes in the companys databasefor each and every disease injury and condition that anyone might be likelyto have everything from leprosy to blackwater fever there were codes that setlimits for hospital stays procedures and allowable payments but there was nocode that took into account the complexity of any individual or his or herreaction to illness no code named maura hughes or harry corbett bravenew medical world harry paid off the cabby thought aboutpicking up another box of candy she might crave the sugar then simplyshrugged and crossed the street to his building he felt beaten and sore whatfight remained within him was fueled by rage and frustration andy barlowhadnt wanted to die in the time he had left he had wanted to design buildingsand go to concerts and be with his friends if maura hughes wanted toselfdestruct to drink until her liver or her stomach or her brain gave outthere really wasnt a damn thing harry corbett or anyone else for thatmatter could do about it no candy maura was waiting just inside the door tothe apartment there was an overnight bag at her feet ive decided to go home she said harry felt a spark of anger why he asked because you drank orbecause you want to drink some more both probably harry lets not debateit okay im just not any good to either of us and i dont see where a fewmore drinks is going to make a bit of difference well it will harry wanted to shout at her to remindher in the harshest terms that she had control of things andy barlow did notinstead he took a calming breath and held her by the arms her eyes were stillclear and focused she had almost certainly not had any more to drink sincethey spoke on the phone there was still a slim chance to stop it right there lets go in and talk he said just fora while harry please im not playing any headgames with you im not wallowing in selfpity and im not trying to get youto beg me not to drink i didnt think you were listen werejust having a lousy time of it both of us i know you feel bad about notremembering what that bastard looked like i wish you could remember too butif you cant you cant it really isnt that important what is important isthat youre the only one who absolutely knows the truth about me and evie imcounting on you to help keep me from coming unglued and i think i can do thesame for you now please just come on back inside for a few silent seconds she stared up athim anybody ever tell you that you look likegene hackman she said finally harry was shaken then he noticed themischief in her eyes well he said now that you mention it they sat on the sofa in the den drinkingcoffee and trying to make sense of the events that were battering their livesthey had made very little when an hour later harrys pager summoned him tocall his answering service maura had agreed that she was not handling heralcoholism very effectively but did not agree that she needed a couple ofweeks or more as an inpatient at a rehab especially not with harry footingthe bill as he had offered to do anything else she said anything butthe lockup harry suggested she might speak withmurphy oates the piano player in the house band at ccs cellar oates oncea serious drunk and heroin addict had been clean and sober for over a decadethough he rarely spoke about it ill be happy to speak with your friendmaura bargained and whatever he tells me to do ill do except get putaway in some nut ward hes probably at the club harry said now it doesnt open for another couple ofhours but therell be some musicians there playing or just hanging out thisis actually the time i like it there the most its dark and quiet and well sort of like a womb you know i just remembered that andy barlow oncecame in there to hear me play harrys thoughts again entered thedarkened hospital room on alexander and locked on the thin face staringlifelessly at the ceiling from the moment he had heard mauras thick speech onthe phone he had been holding on by the thinnest of threads now he felt thatthread snap and himself begin to slide down a sheer glass wall the lunatic admitted it maura hesaid pacing across the room and back he just called up and admitted killingandy like like he was admitting he stole the morning paper off my frontstoop and there wasnt a damn thing i could do about it not one goddamnthing what am i supposed to do im like a toy for him jump harry rollover play dead how am i ever going to stop this whos next harry lets go maura said suddenlytaking his hand lets get out of here right now the club might do you somegood too i dont know he said listen let mefind out what this page is all about then we can decide what we want to do harry dialed his answering service he wasnton for his coverage group so the call had to be something they couldnt dealwith the answering service operator usually chatty and ebullient soundedformal and cool apparently she had joined the ranks of those certain thatharry was guilty of murdering his wife it seemed as if word about him wasspreading like toxic fog dr corbett you got a call from a mrwalter concepcion she said making no effort to pronounce the name thespanish way he said that hes a patient of yours but that this isnt amedical problem he said that no one else but you can help harry scratched down the number checkedthat it was the same as the one mary had given him at the office and dialed awoman answered on the fifth ring diga buenas tardes harry said esta walterconcepcion por favor over his two decades of medical practiceon the fringe of spanish harlem he had evolved about a second graders fluencyin the language although his accent was closer to preschool un momento he heard her set the phone down andenvisioned a woman in a print house dress walking to the foot of a flight ofwellworn oak stairs oye walter she called out as if on cue walterconcepcion telefono harrys image this time was of his gaunt twitchynew patient slipping his feet into a pair of threadbare slippers opening oneof several doors on the second floor of the dingy boarding house and paddingdown the stairs hola he said at almost the momentharry expected him to mr concepcion its dr corbett oh hey thanks for calling back soquickly doc he said your office gal told me about what happened after thatcall came in im sorry youre having so much trouble i i was calling tosee if there might be a time for me to speak with you about it actually i was going to call you he glanced over at maura and motioned thathe wouldnt be long he wanted to get to know walter concepcion better beforeturning his phone number over to albert dickinson he also wanted to preparethe man for the sort of degrading grilling he could expect from the detectivebut another thought had occurred to him as well concepcion spoke proudly ofhaving kicked a drug and alcohol habit on external appearances alone he wasntexactly a ringing endorsement for abstinence but he was intelligent in astreetwise sort of way and did seem to take his recovery seriously if murphyoates wasnt at the club concepcion might be another voice of hope for maura would you be free in say an hourharry asked guessing that the onetime detective would probably be free almostany hour just say where doc and ill get there harry hesitated a moment and then gave himthe address of the club ccs cellar was a seatholeinthewall on fiftysixth street west of ninth avenue the scarred brickwalls were covered with signed blackframed photos of jazz greats many ofwhom had spent their entire lives in obscurity enmeshed in a vicious cycle ofpoverty addiction and pain cc carl cataldo had died years before andhad left the club to his niece jackie as far as harry could tell except fora few more photos on the walls and a stateoftheart speaker system not muchhad changed in the place since carl opened it decades ago there were four people in the dimly litmain room when he and maura arrived jackie expansive in a stained whiteapron was getting ready behind the bar a gnarled old janitor who had beenwith the place since day one was sweeping out the small privateparty room twomusicians both guitarists were trading licks on the stage one of them calledto harry hey doc how about comin up anknockin out a little bass line for us later maybe billy hey whenever my man any idea where murphy is the man shook his head and then ran offseveral incredibly melodic bars of i remember you except for expressinggrief about harrys loss no one at the club had even hinted by word or mannerthat they were upset by the publicity surrounding him they trusted his musicthey trusted him it was that simple and in a city of eight million or sothis was the only spot where he felt truly safe and accepted go ahead and play if you want to maurasaid sipping soda water ill be fine thanks but i dont think so i thought imight want to when we left the apartment but right now i just want to sit withyou and maura he simply walked past everyone on alexander five intoandys room and then out again how could he have done that without a singleperson noticing not one how did he just walk into our room thenight he killed evie he knows how to move around hospitals thats all thereis to it if you were evil enough and set your mind to it you could do it justas well theres so much stress and tension in hospitals that ill bet most peoplewho work there are totally focused on not making mistakes there are probablytimes when you could march an elephant through the halls and no one wouldnotice the guy just knows how to do it i guess harry i wish i could say something tohelp i really do you can dammit you can say you wontpick up a drink again her eyes sparkled at his curtness it wasthe first time he had spoken to her that sharply ill try my best she said howsthat itll do for now she stared into her glass so she said brightly tell me aboutthis guy whos meeting us here you said hes a private detective was he got into trouble with booze andcocaine i dont know what he did to lose his license but now hes trying toget it back well i think that may be him overthere walter concepcion was getting a soda waterfrom jackie who nodded towards where they were sitting he was wearing alightweight plaid sports jacket and looked more businesslike than he had in harrysoffice harry studied him as he approached the table wondering what sort ofimpression he might make on albert dickinson he moved well enough and carriedhimself like someone who had once had some athletic ability but even dressedup he still looked wasted and chronically ill dickinson would never believehis claim that he had been off crack for years harry introduced him to maura three soda waters on the perfectpitcherofbeer day concepcion said motioning to their three drinks could itbe that im not the only one on the wagon harry was impressed i didnt say a thing he said to maurayou heard the whole conversation harrys just patronizing us sheexplained im the lush in that case heres to us lushes i like this guy maura said joining inthe toast after five minutes of conversation harryknew that his office assessment of the man had been way off despite his sallowcomplexion and the persistent tic at the corner of his mouth concepcion wasengaging and intelligent he was born and raised in new york but had traveledextensively in the service and then on his own he spoke easily and even humorously of hisdrinking days and his virulent addiction to crack cocaine but the intensity inhis eyes left no doubt that this was serious business to him at the height ofhis career he was commanding thousanddollaraday fees and was in continuousdemand his professional downfall came when he traded his gun to an undercovercop for some crack at the time it didnt matter to him nothing matteredexcept his next fix but recovery had changed all that i go mostly to na concepcion toldmaura when bringing up the subject seemed right you know narcoticsanonymous but ill be happy to go with you to an aa meeting if you want naaa hershey bars anonymous theyre all the same as far as im concerned the sooner the better i guess maurasaid jackie brought over some pretzels andanother round of sodas the two guitars had been joined by hal jewell a fulltimedrummer who reminded harry of buddy rich and a sax player named brisby whowas a partner in one of the most successful black law firms in the city theywere working through a classy ballad in d that harry had never heard beforethree quarters of an hour had gone by and between the music and the pleasantsurprise that was walter concepcion he had managed to smooth off a bit of theragged pain he was feeling the ballad was captivating especiallywith the acoustics of the nearempty room they listened in silence untilbrisbys last melancholy note had faded away then concepcion cleared histhroat and turned to harry dr corbett i um theressomething i need to tell you i do have headaches like i told you in the office bad ones that no ones been able to help me with but that was only one ofthe reasons i came to see you oh i hope youre not angry about this ifyou are i guess id understand go on i was going to tell you at the officebut you got that phone call and ran out before i could doc i read about youin the papers in fact ive read absolutely everything i could get my hands onabout what happened to you and your wife at the hospital ive been satisfiedby it i even talked to a friends sister whos a nurse there she ah told me about the argument you had with that surgeon whats his name harry momentarily debated ending theconversation right there but over the past hour concepcion had come across asanything but a head case and there was nothing threatening or obsessive in histone or expression now sidonis he said caspar sidonis yeah him i he looked down at hishands i even know about you maura assuming youre the maura from mrscorbetts room not that much really but enough to know that not too manypeople at the hospital believe you walter maybe youd better get to thepoint harry said the point is i need work i know i dontlook it but im good at what i used to do damn good you claim you didnt killyour wife maura claims someone else was in the room after you i want to helpfigure out who that person was if i help you pay me if i dont youre onlyout expense money harry stared across at him he hadnt oncethought about trying to hire someone to help him out the idea certainly hadmerit he acknowledged now but walter concepcion hardly seemed the idealchoice he felt a sympathetic pang as he pictured the man in his rooming houserummaging through his small closet for his best clothes in hopes of landing ajob i dont know he said walter tell me something maura saidfrom what youve read what do you think about all this concepcion rubbed thoughtfully at thestubble on his chin well were not talking about a jealoushusband or even an amateur here he said thats for sure were dealing witha psychopathic sociopathic professional killer a man without a conscienceso i guess the most important thing i could say is that i dont believe drcorbett fits that profile at all and therefore i dont believe he did it youre right there harry said i also dont believe you hired the manwho did right again walter i just dont know harry was drawn to a connection withconcepcions experience and street smarts to say nothing of the value ofhaving another hand on board who was committed to proving he wasnt a murdererbut he was reluctant to strike a deal with a man about whom he knew so littlemaura saved him the trouble its a deal she said what harry you want to say yes and you knowit were dead in the water we dont have even the glimmer of an idea of whatto do next walter can help us i feel it in my bones i really think i can dr corbett harry took another fifteen seconds purelyfor appearances if youre going to be working for me youmight as well call me harry he said you wont regret this concepcion saidi promise he reached over and shook harrys handhis fingers were bony and gnarled but his grip was surprisingly firm for the next half hour harry went overthe case in detail concepcion listened intently and interrupted from time totime to clarify a point this technician who took thefingerprints has he heard anything at all did you suspect your wife washaving an affair at any time the two names you found in her addressbook have you learned anything about them do you have any idea whoyour wife worked for by the time harry finished they had beenat the club for over two hours the first few customers had started to stragglein well what do you think he asked concepcion twisted the small gold band hewore on the middle finger of his right hand i think weve got to do what we can tofind out who this desiree was working for thats where im going to start good luck harry said genuinelyimpressed with the logic of the idea what can we do in the meantime we need to get at that face maura haslocked away somewhere in her brain you mean by hypnosis its a thought harry rubbed at his eyes maura i feel really stupid for notsuggesting that youve had a few things on your mind shesaid listen harry ill try anything maybe we can throw in a few extrabucks and whoever hypnotizes me can convince my subconscious that southerncomfort tastes like borscht or diet dr pepper or something do you know anyonewho might do it actually i do harry said i knowsomeone quite well his names pavel nemec you may have heard of him as thehungarian the court of last resort for smokers mauraexclaimed ive heard theres a waiting time of six months to see him i took care of his son once i have hishome number back at the apartment if its humanly possible hell see ustomorrow concepcion whistled you must have done something prettyspecial for his kid not really harry murmured but pavelthinks i did he turned to concepcion okay then walter were in business um almost concepcion looked at himwarily im going to need some money for my expenses and some more to buyinformation when i need to dont worry ill keep an accounting and

life she said everybodys got to eat i trust him besides hes alreadycome up with two good ideas we didnt i would have thought of the hypnotistharry grumbled chapter impatient for the roundtable to convenekevin loomis lay facedown on the kingsize bed in his room at the garfieldsuites it had been a week since he learned that evelyn dellarosa had beenmurdered any number of times over those days he had considered trying totrack down sir gawaine to see if the man agreed she was desiree but if he wasdiscovered by anyone in the group probing into the identity of a fellow knightit would probably be over for him for the moment his plan was to keep hismouth shut on the matter and hope that gawaine brought it up the young beauty who called herself kellyknelt astride kevins buttocks kneading the tension from the muscles in hislower back her silk oriental dress red this night and adorned with gold lame lay over the chair alongside her black lace panties kevin watched herreflection in the mirror across the room her high firm breasts her smalldark nipples the perfect curves of her hips and ass kelly anothermeaningless name he thought like lancelot and merlin and desiree and therest shadow names of no substance created only to cloak secrets names thatvanished in the light of day is kelly your real name he asked her saw her smile in the mirror and feltfoolish knowing he was hardly the first to ask that question if you wish it to be it is she repliedsoftly patiently kevin closed his eyes and found himselffeeling vaguely queasy massaging him was this most gorgeous woman ready ifhe should wish it to take him inside her in the most intimate ways imaginableyet forbidden to share even her first name with him was she a reporteror perhaps a student in nuclear physics at columbia or was she just anupandcoming whore kelly tristram desiree galahad gawaine shadownames what would nancy say if sheknew hewondered would she believe he was part of it all did he even believe ithimself im going to take a shower he saidrolling over kelly bent down and kissed his cock whichimmediately started to harden you want me to come with you no he said too sharply i want youto tell me what in the hell im doing here just get dressed and ordersomething for dinner i dont care what it is as long as its the mostexpensive thing on the menu filet medium rare she said iremember as soon as kevin entered the stuyvesantsuite he made eye contact with gawaine from the mans dress and mannerloomis had always believed he had a prep school and possibly even ivy leaguebackground tonight his smooth manner seemed frayed his smile a little tense the seven highbacked chairs circling thetable were set about four feet apart tristrams gold nameplate had been placedin its customary spot between kay and lancelot gawaine moved his seat whichwas almost opposite kevins kevin caught his eye nodded a greetingthen approached howre you doing he asked cant complain gawaine said lancelots sent me a chinese girl thistime eleven on a scale of ten he calls her he might be right i think hestrying to make up for that desiree fiasco yeah probably gawaine smiled uncomfortably and pulledout his chair before kevin could test him again themeeting was convened by merlin maybe he doesnt know anythingat all about evelyn dellarosa kevin thought maybe he hasnt even seen any of thepictures of her galahads financial report showed that thegroups contributions had put their operating capital back over the agreedupon kevin had no idea how that baseline figure was arrived at or forthat matter how any of their rules had been adopted no minutes were everkept no record of votes no paperwork of any kind but everyone seemed to knowexactly where projects stood and what was expected of each of them kay spoke first reporting on one of threemajor new programs that would be discussed tonight he sounded quite eager toreport that the votes were now in place to pass legislation permittingcompanies to run genetic panels on all prospective employees first formalpsychological exams and profiles then aids screening and now finallygenetic testing they all knew that the total package might not do one trulypositive thing for the companies involved but it would save those companieshealthinsurance carriers tens if not hundreds of millions therell be the usual court challengeskay explained but i think we have control of this one i would guess itll bea year before its enacted challenged and upheld maybe a bit longer if thelabor unions latch onto any halfdecent lawyers but we are going towin the quicker the better lancelot saidas far as im concerned we ought to make genetic screening a requirement forentering kindergarten goddamn mutants are everywhere there was laughter from around the tableloomis faked his and noted that gawaines smile looked perfunctory kay received a round of appreciative pentaps for his work percivale clapped out loud tens of millions in increasedprofits for the industry possibly more tristram thought about the figureburt dreiser had quoted him the morning when they met on his boat nineteenmillion dollars that was what the former knights company had lost in oneyear by not being allowed to replace him on the roundtable nineteen million dollars assuming crown health benefited similarly from his worktristrams bonus would be one percent of that on top of his base salary if nobody else mentioned desiree hedecided he was not going to be the one to break the ice gawaine was called upon next to give thegroup an update on their newest endeavor legislation that would enable thehealth insurers to decide what treatment was appropriate and not appropriatefor patients with terminal illnesses kevin continued to watch him closelynoting how he shuffled papers and fidgeted with a pencil as he spoke sirbuttondown was uncharacteristically nervous no doubt about it please note gawaine said that i referto patients with terminal illnesses rather than terminally ill patients oncewe are allowed to define what illnesses can be considered terminal we plan toturn our attention to determining when the treatment for those conditions is nolonger cost effective we need the right to cut off coverage for those patientswho are taking up costly hospital beds and specialist care when there isultimately no hope for them of course the sooner in that process we can stepin the better the legislative climate is excellent right now tristram hasbrought the commissioner back into the fold so he wont be a problem wevebeen nibbling at this thing for years convincing the legislators and thepublic that since were footing the bills we should make the treatmentdecisions now it appears that we are ready to take a much bigger bitelancelot do you want to go on to your part lancelot set his halfsmoked cigar asideand cleared his throat he never actually lit up a cigar during a roundtablesession but he was rarely without his prop he gave gawaine a puckish grin andan aokay sign tristram noted that gawaine barely responded the neat part of this program lancelotexplained is a network of facilities we are calling palliative centers pcsthese are the places where patients we determine to be terminally ill can besent for inexpensive barebones care the ultimate hospice something on thecontinuum after a hospital and a nursing home but much less expensive to runthan either no treatments no ivs no therapy of any kind pain medicationonly administered around the clock in a totally humane way and the best partis that we are moving ahead with designing these pcs and even setting up thecorporations that will eventually run them in some cases were actuallypurchasing the facilities that will one day house them there was half an hour of discussion onthe palliative centers and then merlin took over this has been a hell of a meeting hecheered a hell of a meeting well im pleased to say that the news from myfront is good too weve implemented the employment modification program on alimited basis and tonight im prepared to present the results and projectednumbers on the first ten cases the policyholder in each of these cases hasbeen terminated from employment some have found new employment with companiesdoing business with insurers other than roundtable members others continue asallowed by law to pay their premiums themselves for eighteen months still othersnow qualify for medicaid but in most of these cases were already out of theloop as their insurers off the hook so to speak loomis could not remember anything calledthe employment modification program apparently merlin was using the roundtablesmoney and influence to arrange the firing of costly policyholders if so itwas the first time that specific individuals had been targeted by the group hescanned his copy of the printout merlin had passed around at the top was theheading qualifications the factors used by the computer to select casesbelow that were ten names and beside each of them was an insurance carrier adiagnosis and a dollar amount the smallest amount was the largest million the fourth of the ten names was a crown health and casualtysubscriber subscriber patient carrier diagnosis amount desenza elizabeth ryan crown head injury kevin stared at the name struggling tokeep his expression bland beth desenza was a production line worker at a largegarment factory just outside the city her son ryan had suffered a freakcardiac arrest and subsequent brain damage after being hit in the chest with abaseball thanks to her companys comprehensive insurance coverage ryan was a patientin the most highly regarded and most expensive brain injury rehabilitationhospital in the area kevin had engineered the coverage agreement with herunion beth was the only policyholder in all his years with crown who had takenthe trouble to find out his name and to write and thank him for his role inproviding care for her child she included a picture of ryan before theaccident bat poised smiling selfconsciously from beneath a baseball cap thatseemed two sizes too big thank you mr loomis she wrote thank you andcrown for making ryans treatment possible nancy had taken the note and had it mattedand framed now beths coverage for her son at least at the level provided bycrown was over the individualpolicy premium was extremely expensive almostcertainly too expensive for her to continue the coverage even for the periodallowed by state law tristram felt ill from early indications merlin wassaying provided the program is not overutilized once we get up to speed ourcompanies can realize a comfortable ongoing saving of three to six milliondollars a month not exactly a bonanza but hardly chicken feed there were appreciative pen taps fromaround the table i was just wondering why the companiesholding the policies werent consulted about these individuals before they wereterminated there was a deathly silence in the room tristram i dont believe i understandwhat you mean merlin said finally his tone and expression werenonjudgmental yet kevin felt his pulse pounding in his ears everything seemedto be happening in freezeframe the six faces fixed on him were like those ina wax museum imbued with expression but not with life then suddenly his gaze was drawn tomovement gawaine sitting across from him was shaking his head ever soslightly his eyes locked on kevins blazed loomis watched his lips move andheard the unspoken word as if it had been shouted into his ear no with the others focused on him loomisfelt certain he was the only one who had picked up on the warning i um im sorry he said whati meant to ask was why you hadnt checked with each of us for more names ah i see merlin responded thank youfor clarifying that i did misunderstand perhaps i can answer your questiontristram kay said since i designed the program to select the clients thedecisions purely business are made by computer to keep them as rational anddispassionate as possible as you can see from the list of factors considereda great deal of data is evaluated before a selection is made each timethousands upon thousands of policyholders are screened this process would bevirtually impossible for any of us to do on a regular basis and certainly notwith the accuracy of a computer the knights attention had shifted to kayexcept for gawaine whose gaze remained fixed on kevin his face was tight andwaxen the unspoken warning continued flashing from his eyes i understand tristram said forcing asmile i understand completely the roundtable meeting concluded withoutfurther incident the knights left the stuyvesant suite in the inverse order oftheir arrival kevin considered trying to waylay gawaine and demand anexplanation but he did not know the mans room number and the danger ofdiscovery in hanging too close to the meeting room was too great instead hereturned to his own room his feelings roiling kelly wearing only her panties lay onthe bed watching a movie eating grapes left over from dinner she seemedcompletely at ease kevin tossed her dress across her lap go he said but you have me until morning he took a fifty from his wallet and set itin her hand i wont tell anyone and i dont want youto just be careful leaving ill see you next time kelly tossed the dress aside stood on hertiptoes and kissed him hungrily he cupped her breast in his hand her nippleinstantly swelled to his touch her smooth lean body melted into his i want you she whispered for a frozen minute his thoughts were onlyof her he had not yet given in and made love with her but he knew he wasdrawing closer with every moment they were together perhaps that was what hereally needed he began thinking not to face the demons that were suddenlytormenting him but to escape them i want you she moaned again still onher tiptoes she took his swollen cock and worked it between her thighs iwant you inside me so much he took her by the shoulders and forcedher to arms length she was part of them an extension of the roundtable oneof the shadow names the piece she was about to take from him would bind himeven more tightly to the society perhaps she was even to be rewarded forgetting him to fuck her see tristram you can do it the roundtable would be sayingto him you can do anything get out he snapped right now the hurt on her face seemed genuine kevinalmost laughed out loud at her skill she dropped her dress on over her headand turned to allow him to zip it up next time she asked well see now please go kevin waited several seconds after thedoor had locked behind her and then splashed an inch of bourbon into a tumblerand gulped it down until he had read beth desenzas name on merlins printoutnone of the roundtables programs had ever presented even the slightest moraldilemma for him but they were programs that largely involved laws and thepeople who made them the insurance commissioner was a pompous politicallymotivated bastard fair game in kevins view the corporate sabotage madeperfect sense given the dogeatdog climate of the insurance business but thiswas different this was a flesh and blood person he could handle standing backbehind the lines lobbing shells down on the enemy but this was handtohandcombat and suddenly the enemy had eyes kevin was in over his head he knew itnow and there wasnt a damn thing he could do about it except to adjust theprice of a ticket on this ride was a twelveroom house and a secure future forhimself and his family he had paid the fare now he had no choice but to hangon and make the best of it the next time kelly asked he would be ready for whatever he had poured another two fingers when thephone began ringing tristram he said its gawaine the knight whispered canyou talk yes im alone you sent your girl home yes jesus you are asking for trouble minesin the other room whats going on why did you stop me atthe meeting i know your name do you know mine no its stallings jim stallings im a vicepresident with the manhattan offices of interstate health care kevin knew the gargantuan managed carecompany well he had once interviewed for a sales job with them go on he said loomis weve got to talk tomorrow noonsharp can you make it i can but battery park the benches on the hudsonside just be damn sure youre not followed but please loomis wait until tomorrow atnoon and be careful one thing kevin said quickly did yousee the picture of that woman dellarosa of course i did and do you think its desiree i never had any doubt about it it was youi had doubts about i wasnt sure if you were one of them or not but aftertonight im willing to take the chance that youre still an outsider like mein fact im betting my life on it kevin listened to the dial tone forseveral seconds then he set the receiver down and walked to the windowfourteen stories below scant earlymorning traffic flowed in slow motion alonglargely deserted streets a cab pulled up and stopped directly beneath hiswindow a woman wearing a tight iridescent red dress hurried out and climbedinside the lady without a name the cab rolled to the corner and thenturned uptown kevin sensed that he had seen the girl stroked her magnificenttaut body for the last time he glanced at his watch eleven hours elevenhours until battery park chapter at threethirty in the morning maura gaveup trying to sleep and tiptoed from the small guest room to the den throughhis partially open door she could see harry asleep in the master bedroom fora time after they returned from ccs cellar she thought he might ask her tojoin him there he liked her that seemed clear but there were reasons plenty of them why he would want to keep some distance between them keyamong them was that she had given into her frustration and her demons and hadbeen drinking that afternoon it was just as well she thought shewasnt ready for an emotional entanglement any more than he was still shecouldnt remember the last time a mans looks had turned her on so and moreimportant he was one of the kindest most decent men she had ever met itwould have been nice just to curl up in his arms for a night and let the chipsfall where they may she turned on the den light and ran herfinger over the volumes in the bookcase searching for something light verylight then again she thought perhaps heavy would be better she pulled out athin paperback of poems by lord byron evelyn dellarosa was written inperfect script inside the cover evie was of course another valid reason forharrys maintaining distance between them maura closed the book and slid itback she and harry had been through so much since his wifes death that it wasdifficult to remember it had only been a few weeks she scanned the shelves once more andfinally settled on a coffeetable book on ireland in six hours she and harrywere scheduled to meet with pavel nemec maura desperately wanted the sessionto work out connecting with the face that was locked in her subconscious wouldjust about balance her humiliation at having fallen off the wagon she hadnever been hypnotized before and had no idea whether being sleepless for theentire preceding night would be a plus or a minus on the other hand if thelegendary hungarian was as incredible as his reputation it probably didntmatter as harry had predicted the moment nemecheard his request a time slot had been cleared out for them exactly what did you do for hisson maura asked after harry told her about the appointment ricard nothing really i just did aroutine physical for music camp he said he plays the french horn and and i found a little lump that i didntlike beneath one arm cancer hodgkins disease actually thank god itwas in an early stage its been about six years now so hes considered acure he said it all so matteroffactly likeshe might talk about mixing paints but maura knew about school physicals andcamp physicals and such she had had enough of them to know that most doctorsdid nothing but listen to your heart but harry hadnt dealt with pavel nemecsson in such a cursory way harry had been harry maura reflected on what he had told her ofthe drama swirling around him at the hospital the call from his friendatwater asking him to remove himself from the staff the hearing that was beingarranged to decide whether or not he would be allowed to continue to practicethere harry corbett didnt deserve that sort oftreatment she thought angrily she brushed her fingers across her feathery newhair and along the stillsensitive margins of her craniotomy scar he alsodidnt deserve the treatment she had given him drinking again had beenpetulant immature and stupid she was lucky he hadnt just handed her abottle and booted her out no more she muttered knowing that shehad failed to honor the same pledge many times before thats it lady notone more drop she flipped through a few pages of irishcountryside and felt her eyelids grow heavy she wondered what it would feellike to be hypnotized if it would feel like anything at all obriens toweratop the cliffs of moher in county clare blurred then faded no more the words echoed in her mind notone more drop the aroma of brewing coffee worked its wayinto her consciousness she opened her eyes a slit pale morning light filtered into the denfrom between buildings harry sat on the easy chair beside the sofa he wasdressed in gray sweats with a towel draped around his neck and had obviouslyjust finished a workout his dark hair glistened with sweat and the color inhis cheeks made his rugged good looks just that much more appealing maura reached over dreamily and squeezedhis hand what time is it she said after seven we still have a while if youwant to doze off again im just being selfish by waking you up like this then ill be even more selfish and stayawake how do you feel sober she knew it was the only word he reallywanted to hear you ready to have your brain probed bythe hungarian i am he had just better be set to boldlygo where no man has gone before hes a wizard at least thats what ivebeen told hey listen evies threehundreddollar coffeemaker is hard atwork in the kitchen the first thing she did after the wedding was to give awaymy mr coffee hers goes to the gourmet shop by itself mixes the perfectblend then grinds brews and samples it with that buildup im all taste buds how do you take it after yesterday you have to ask harry smiled black it is he said maura had never paid a great deal ofattention to her looks one exlover had said that was because she had neverhad to today though she took a bit more time than usual getting ready alittle makeup the enamel earrings harry liked and a cotton dress instead ofher trademark jeans she felt keyed up at the prospect of whatlay ahead frightened that the session would be a bust but almost equallyapprehensive about other possibilities over the two and a half years of herdownward spiral she had been a blackout drinker with little regard for theplaces she went or the company she kept now she wondered just how selectivepavel nemec could be in unlocking her memory most of what was hidden away inher subconscious might as well stay right where it was nemec lived and worked at an address onthe upper east side before going there she and harry took a cab to hisoffice stopping at her place to pick up an artists sketch pad some pencilsand some pastels and at his bank to withdraw fifteen hundred dollars ive canceled another half day at theoffice and gotten someone to make rounds on my patients in the hospital hetold her most of my practice is pretty loyal i think but im reallybeginning to put some of them to the test she nodded sympathetically this is theday she said this is the day it all begins to turn around trust me heyspeaking of turning around turn this way a bit i want to try something he did as she asked and in less than twoblocks she had sketched a passable likeness of him by the time they reachedthe office the drawing was quite good thats amazing he said i can do better but at least this tellsme i can do it at all its been a while i actually once spent a summer initaly doing sketches and caricatures for the tourists on the piazza navona walter concepcion was already in thewaiting room chatting with the woman behind the reception desk whom mauralearned was mary tobin maura was glad to see him again today he wore a blacktshirt and she noticed that his arms were sinewy and more muscular than shewould have expected he had a tattoo over his left deltoid artfully done of askull with a serpent slithering out of one eye they called from dr erdmans office atthe hospital mary said the meeting is scheduled for ten tomorrow morning inthe conference room next to his office harry sighed i guess youll have to call my morningappointments and cancel them again i already did this is getting ridiculous you knowmaybe we should just close up shop for a while the older womans eyes flashed you do she said and im gonna find meone of those bamboo canes you know the ones that take flesh off with thesecond stroke okay okay well see what happenstomorrow fine i called your attorney to tell himthe time he wants you to call him later today but he said hell be there at three hundred fifty an hour whyshouldnt he be pardon nothing mary nothing im just in myirritable idiot mode is all it never lasts long thank goodness she said harry handed concepcion the money in anenvelope it was clear to maura that harry still had doubts about the man butshe had absolutely none walter had already given them a place to start thefirst steps of a counterattack okay were in business concepcionsaid pocketing the envelope and dont worry harry every dollar of thiswill be accounted for on paper receipts and all i actually think we got offto a running start last night after i got home i called about forty escortservices my line to them was that a woman named desiree had given me the nightof my life when i was last in town six months ago unfortunately for me afriend had made the arrangements and i had no way of getting hold of him forthe name of the escort service money was no problem but only if it was fordesiree three of the services made it sound as if they knew her they saidtheyd try to get in touch with her and i should call back a fourth oneelegance said she wasnt working for them anymore thats the one im homingin on why that one maura asked because the woman i spoke to initiallygave me vague answers about desiree she took my number and said id be calledabout an hour later a different woman called she said her name was page ithink she runs the business we played cat and mouse for a time i mentionedmoney as often as i could she denied knowing anyone named desiree as often asshe could finally i told her that i knew desiree was dead and i just wantedsome information about her i offered her five hundred dollars just to talkwith me in person for half an hour not one minute more and she didnt have toanswer any questions about desiree that she didnt want to i was sure she wasgoing to say no but when she said again that she didnt know desiree i knew ihad her were meeting tomorrow morning that sounds promising maura said it sounds like were about to be takenfor five hundred bucks harry muttered you just hang in there with me bosswalter replied the tic at the corner of his mouth firing off several timesyou dont seem to know it yet but what you got here is the detective bargainof the century just keep in touch maybe we can get together tomorrow nightand compare notes by the way maura ill check on an aa meeting for us to goto then if you still want to im ready you have my number at home harry saidcall anytime if you learn something he hesitated and then added walterim sorry to be giving you a hard time ill try not to concepcion pinched his own forearm hey skin as thick as rhino hide manhe said besides i havent done anything yet except cost you money when i doproduce and i will i expect you to get off my case he shook hands with them both waved tomary tobin and headed out come on harry said we can catch a cabon fifth okay maura said battling a suddeninexplicable case of nerves lets do it she started toward the door andthen turned back cross your fingers mary she said were off to see thewizard the discreet brass placard above the bellread p nemec behavior modification pavel nemec greeted them warmly and servedthem tea and cakes in the oakpaneled victorian waiting room of his office heand harry spent some time catching up on nemecs family and on harrys lifeover the years since they had last spoken he was in his early sixties mauraguessed graying and very slight but fit she found him charming andunpretentious even so the freefloating anxiety thathad begun to take hold of her in harrys office intensified maura had tried sohard to reconnect with the face of the man in the white clinic coat but theharder she tried the flimsier the memories became now she wondered whetherthe dts and the surgery and the drugs had distorted reality so much for herthat the man in fact never did exist her hands were shaking ever so slightlyshe abandoned trying to hold her teacup and instead sat quietly as harryexplained their situation nemec also listened intently but midway throughharrys account he stood and began pacing slowly behind her chair pausingtwice to rest his hands gently on her shoulders then suddenly he bent downhis lips close to her ear theres nothing to be frightened aboutmaurie he whispered nothing maura was startled maurie notmaura he had definitely said that no one except her father had ever calledher maurie and then only until she was ten or so harry stopped talking maura becameacutely aware of the traffic noises from the street it was happening sherealized no couch no watchonachain no new age music no gimmicks at allpavel nemec was at work right here right now he moved around to face her and placed hisfingertips on her temples her face had closed now but her mind was racingimages and faces cascaded through her thoughts like a video on rapid searchfaces from her childhood teachers playmates tom mother houses androoms rural scenes and city streets she connected easily with some of thepictures not at all with others then suddenly one scene began repeatingitself over and over it was her father a drink sloshing in his hand turningtowards her his rheumy eyes were cold with contempt his words were thick andslurred spittle sprayed from his mouth as he railed at her you re worthless maurie hopeless and worthless you cant do a damn thing rightexcept give me headaches just like your mother except for marrying her youreabout the worst mistake ive ever made in fact if it werent for youid never have had to marry her in the first place easy maurie nemec said with gentlefirmness he will never ever speak to you like that again he was sickthats all you never deserved to be spoken to like that he just couldnthelp it nemec cupped his calming hands behind her ears you did your best toplease him he hated himself too much to show love for anyone henever thought about what he was doing to you you can let it go now maura you can let it go forever the swirling images began to recede mauraknew her eyes were closed but she could see the mystic in his gray cardiganpacing in front of her her apprehension was gone now the shroud ofselfloathing that had blanketed her life for so long had lifted leaving herwith an incredible sense of peace all those times her father had crushed herpride belittled her even news of his death couldnt kill the terrible seedshe had sown throughout her life each time success was in her grasp herpathological selfdoubt would lead her to find some way to sabotage and destroyit worthless how old could she have beenwhen he began calling her that seven eight now finally she knew that it had neverbeen her not once she never deserved what arthur hughes had done to her andlike pavel said he could never hurt her again her eyes still closed she saw nemec moveto the table and retrieve her sketch pad and charcoal then she felt him set iton her lap we have work to do she heard his voice but knewhe had not spoken youre free now maura free to see what needs to be seen harry would later tell her that she hadnever opened her eyes until the detailed sketch was complete he would describethe eerie way the charcoal in her hand darted over the paper the disjointedbut absolutely unified process by which the mans face took shape he wouldtell her about the moment as she was still shading and shadowing him with hercharcoal stick and finger when he recognized him maura stretched her arms and worked herneck around she felt relaxed and refreshed as if she had just stepped from awarm spa she knew that she had produced a drawing of the man who had murderedevie dellarosa she also knew that pavel nemec had helped her in ways notherapist or counselor ever had there were flaws in her perception of herself gaping flaws for which she had never been responsible flaws that keptdriving her selfdestructive behavior flaws that made her time and again breakthe promises she made to herself no more not one more drop she opened her eyes and looked down at therendering then she drew in the mans clipon tie and shaded it green with goldaccents pavel nemec was back in his chair casually sipping tea howd you do that she asked he smiled at her kindly and shrugged my encounters with clients are not alwaysthis successful some days it is like walking through a dense fog for me somedays like today i can see with incredible clarity i believe youve beenwaiting for me for some time maura possibly years you did something about my drinkingdidnt you no but you did and most forcefully imight add she held up the drawing for harry tearsglistened in her eyes i did it she said i guess you did its amazinglyaccurate how do you know because i saw him the exact man youdrew he was right outside your room the whole time i was there just waitingfor the chance to finish what he had started when he ordered evies iv outside the room buffing the floors listening to awalkman the sort of person you look at over and over without actually seeinghim the nurses never saw him come on the floor after i left because he didnthe was already there he left before i returned are you sure maura asked harry studied the drawing for just a fewseconds ive never been more certain of anythingin my life he said you two make a hell of a team maura crossed to the unassuming little manand kissed him on the cheek you dont know the half of it she said chapter the day was new york city hot by latemorning waves of steaming air were rising off the pavement and children wereopening hydrants kevin loomis left his airconditioned midtown office attenthirty for a circuitous trip to battery park a waterfront oasis on thesouthernmost tip of the island at the convergence of the hudson and eastrivers in response to james stallingss warning against being followed he hadcarefully planned every step of the journey earlier that morning kevin had endured afortyfive minute meeting of burt dreisers eightmember executive planningstaff and although nothing unusual happened during the session he feltconstantly conspicuous and read double meanings into almost everything dreisersaid or did by the time he checked out with brenda wallace and left for whathe said was a longscheduled meeting and lunch he was perspiring for reasonsthat had nothing to do with the weather evelyn dellarosa had been murdered andjames stallings the other knight who had been with her was terrified i wasnt sure if you were oneof them or not what in the hell had stallings meant by that loomis crossed the street against thelight dodging a succession of infuriated cabbies he then entered a small customhaberdashery there were seldom more than one or two customers in the shop at atime and at this moment only the proprietor was there since joining theroundtable kevin had become a regular in the place the fitting area was inback next to an alley door kevin ordered a shirt allowed himself to bemeasured and then made an excuse for leaving through the rear exit next hetook a cab ride to the east side and walked several blocks to an irt stationducking frequently into doorways to check the street behind him the batterypark stop was at the end of the line he arrived there with ten minutes tospare still anxious about the possibility ofbeing followed or watched he strolled casually past a tarmac playgroundpausing for a minute against the high chainlink fence there were twenty orso children on the swings climbing bars riding seesaws laughing andshrieking with delight kevin thought about his own kids and about the lifethey were about to enter a fabulous home with a bedroom for each of them andland enough for a huge swing set and possibly even a pool someday a cleansuburban community with topnotch schools and a limitless future sunlight glared off the water to thesouth the statue of liberty stood tall against the sweltering heat kevinglanced about again and headed north on to the grassy mall it was exactlynoon carrying his suit coat now he passed half a dozen benches each oneoccupied office workers eating takeout lunches a bag lady asleep on anewspaper pillow two young mothers lolling their sleeping infants instrollers teen lovers nestled together oblivious to all but one another sonormal loomis over here stallings also holding his suit coat inhis hand beckoned to him from the shadow of a centuryold maple his briefcasewas on the ground between his feet the tension kevin had picked up in the manat the roundtable meeting was even more evident today he glanced aboutnervously and constantly moistened his lips with his tongue you sure you werent followed he asked im sure who are you worried about any of them lancelot kay galahadmerlin or someone they hired shit loomis i dont know what to do i justcant believe this is happening the mans apprehension was contagiouswithout even knowing what was going on loomis felt his pulse begin to race hey youve got to calm down he saidyou want to walk no no this is a good spot lets sitdown right here keep your back against the tree and a sharp eye out for anyonewho might be paying too much attention to us dark circles enveloped stallings eyesand his pale skin was covered with a sheen of sweat he had the look of ahunted animal lancelot came to see me a couple of daysago he began when they had settled on the grass at the base of the tree hisnames pat harper do you know him outside the roundtable northeast life i played golf with himonce well he picked me up after work and took me for a ride up intoconnecticut he drives a rolls that fits i really dont know anythingabout him except that his cigars made me queasy and hes a much better golferthan i am for that matter i dont know anything about any of the knights neither do i the secrecys on purposethey really dont care if we find out who they are but they want it to seemlike a big deal theyre really into this mystique thing you keep saying they who doyou mean all of them even percivale i thinktheyre on one side of the fence you and i are on the other for a while ithought it was only me that even though you joined after i did you were oneof them you always seemed so confident so tuned into everything that wasgoing on but listening to the way they grilled you about desiree i started tohave the feeling that you were an outsider too then hearing you last nighti felt almost certain of it all i can tell you kevin said is thatthe only contact ive had with the roundtable or the knights has been at ourmeetings i speak to my boss of course hes the one who picked me to succeedhim but thats all and we never talk about the roundtable at work only onhis boat stallings gazed out at the river and tooka deep slow breath it was as if he was getting set to dive from a cliff did your boss ever tell you they werekilling people he asked suddenly kevin pushed back and stared at the manhalf expecting to see a gotcha there just kidding smile hey easy does it jim kevin saidforcing calm into his voice im sure its not what you think stallings laughed mirthlessly its exactly what i think lancelotstarted by telling me how pleased everyone was with the work i was doing especially the legislation i drafted on the terminalcare project he said thatbecause the roundtables business was so unorthodox that was the word heused unorthodox that each new member had to go through a probationaryperiod now mine was over and i was in a position to do my company and myselfa great deal of good stallings again glanced furtively aboutthen he snapped open his briefcase withdrew a computer printout and passed itto kevin it was a list of qualifications very similar to the ones merlin hadpresented at the meeting the factors that had led to beth desenzas beingselected by microchip to lose her job only this list of criteria beganwith currently hospitalized you know about the futurecost analysesright stallings asked thats what merlin was talking about the estimate of what any illness will cost the industry over its entirecourse exactly well this program here has afuturecost minimum of five hundred thousand dollars lancelot wants me to runit through our data banks each week and come up with two or three names aidscancer chronic heart problems mental illness multiple trauma blooddiseases cystic fibrosis even babies born under a certain weight theres certainly no shortage ofconditions thatll cost half a million over time much more than that actually a millioneven two things like bone marrow replacements and liver transplants atwentyfiveyearold mental patient who cant make it outside of a hospitalwill be in seven figures before hes thirtyfive and his life expectancy isntmuch different than normal what happens to the names you come upwith stallings bit at his lower lip i am to handdeliver them to each of theother knights not including you apparently i guess youre still onprobation then i am to transfer into a swiss bank account an amount equalingtwentyfive percent of the total that persons care would cost my companylancelot explained that the funds i transfer will come from payouts to a set ofnonexistent patients he seemed very proud of the system which he says istried and true and foolproof those were his exact words tried and trueand foolproof then what happens to the patients sir gawaine shrugged helplessly they die he said you mean theyre murdered in thehospital lancelot never used that word my companywould achieve a net savings thats just how he put it netsavings of around a million and a half to two million a month oh i just dont believe that surelythere must be some other explanation go ahead and try to come up with one idid how else is that kind of money going to be saved and all the rest of them are doing thistoo as far as i know this is crazy how can they do it howcould they keep getting away with it over and over again stallings dropped the printout back intohis briefcase snapped it shut and adjusted each of the combination wheels i dont know but i kept thinking aboutthat dellarosa woman i think whoever injected her with that stuff must be theone who his voice trailed away he stared off at adistant freighter not far from where they were sitting a teenage girl intight shorts and a tank top rollerbladed past handinhand with a tall ganglyboy so normal did you ask lancelot about dellarosa i mentioned her but he claimed that ifshe and desiree were the same person he surely would have known it i askedwho handled matters in the hospital and how they did it all he said was thatwasnt his department theres got to be something youmisunderstood kevin did they promise you an additionalbonus of one percent of everything your company saves through your work withthe roundtable yes me too well lancelot took specialpains to point out what one percent of a million five to two million a monthcomes to he also pointed out things we all know that the cost of caring forcritically ill and terminally ill patients has spiraled out of control thatall our companies are being battered as never before and that health carereforms what with premium caps and all is only making matters worse he saidthat the money being saved by our efforts meant more jobs and better servicesthroughout the industry at one point he listed a bunch of conditions likeaids metastic cancer and muscular dystrophy truthfully now hesaid to all intents and purposes considering that doctors haveabsolutely no treatments available to cure any of these diseases when thediagnosis is made these people are as good as dead right and you want to know the worst partloomis the worst part is that as he talked on i found myself burying into thewhole thing dollars and cents profit and loss cost containment forchrissake i stopped thinking of the quality of these peoples lives i beganagreeing with everything he said diagnosis prognosis that was it that wasall that mattered i even started thinking about all the ways an additionalfifteen thousand dollars a month would change our lifestyle then at the lastmoment just before i signed on i began remembering that he was talking about peoplethats what i believe you were thinking about when you started questioningmerlins program last night i knew one of the women on that list ofhis stallings nodded thats why i keptsignaling you to stop kevin these people mean business we were on our wayback to the city when i asked lancelot what would happen if i decided not toparticipate in this program he said that he really didnt believe anythingwould happen he explained that only one knight had ever refused to participate sir lionel that was about a year ago but before the roundtable could decidewhether or not hed be allowed to continue with them he got some sort of foodpoisoning and died oh god kevin groaned i know all aboutthat guy when he died his company lost its seat on the roundtable completelyin fact it was probably given to you my boss used him to illustrate what iwould cost our company and myself if i was ever removed and not replaced butjim lionel didnt die from food poisoning it was from a coronary after thefood poisoning he died in the hospital just like go ahead say it just like evelyndellarosa and heaven only knows about how many other patients with expensivediseases kevin felt ill did lancelot make it sound like lionelsdeath was something they engineered i mean did he say it like a threat i dont know for sure hes got thissmile thats impossible to read kevin nodded hed had the same responseto pat harper well he just kept smiling through thewhole lionel story i wasnt sure what to make of it but it gave me thecreeps i didnt know what to say to him so how was it left stallings looked away again i have until tomorrow night to come upwith the first set of names and transfer the funds oh no and who gets the money theknights the guy who who does it i dont know but if you multiply my twoor three clients by two or three for each of the others thats a hell of a lotof money and every one of those people just dies theyre all pretty sick and there are somany hospitals and patients in the city that apparently no one really thinksabout there being anything out of the ordinary going on loomis what are wegoing to do listen maybe the whole thing is justsome sort of loyalty test kevin offered desperately you know you dont believe that jim i dont know anything why couldntyou just blow the whistle on what on who i have no proof ofanything not even the name of a single patient besides if the roundtabledoes get exposed i go down along with the rest of you what about my familymy kids well what then show up at the meetingand just beg them to stop its a possibility what about sir lionel and his foodpoisoning thats why i decided to chance sharingall this with you if there are two of us i think as long as we sticktogether we might be able to convince the rest of them to stop i need to think about this just dont take too long i only haveuntil tomorrow to give them the names and and i dont think i can do ithe checked the time listen im due back at the office in a few minutesplease loomis please dont say a word to anyone until we talk again okay i promise not to your boss not to your wife notto anyone stallings was genuinely terrified and ifhe was right about the roundtable kevin had no trouble understanding why ill call you before tomorrow nightstallings said they exchanged business cards and each wrote his home phonenumber on the back and kevin please wait five or ten minutes after i gobefore you start back ill be in touch sir gawaine took his briefcase and headedoff toward the subway station kevin stood there numb and unseeing his mindunwilling to sort through what had just been shared with him except toacknowledge that if the situation was as stallings believed the possibilitiesopen to them were all unacceptable mister hey mister kevin turned startled two youths inshorts and yankee caps stood on the sidewalk they looked about ten his sonnickys age each wore a basketball glove yes what is it our ball mister its right by yourfoot could you throw it to us kevin picked up the scuffed grassstainedhardball and tossed it back the taller of the two boys snagged it easily in away kevin had watched nicky catch a thousand of his throws thanks mister the youth called nicearm nice arm chapter the night was warm and extremely muggy the sort of night that invariably brought out the most vivid versions of thedream he lay facedown on a sheet that was already drenched his fists weretightly clenched and every muscle in his body was taut at some level he knewthat it was all in his past that he was only reliving the hideous experiencein his mind but as always he was powerless to wakehimself hyconidol almost matches atom foratom the pain fiber neurotransmitter chemical that means i can fire thosenerves off all at once and at will every single one of them think of it mrsantana no injury no mess no blood just pain pure pain except inthe work i do hyconidol has absolutely no clinical value but if we ever domarket it i thought an appropriate name for it might be agonyl itsincredible stuff if i do say so myself a small injection a little tingle alarger one well im sure you get the picture rays mouth becomes desert dry thepounding within his chest is so forceful that he feels certain the doctor cansee it please dont do this he screams silently please percheks thumb tightens on the plunger i think well start with somethingmodest he says equivalent perhaps to nothing more than a little coolbreeze over the cavities in your teeth our interest is in the identities ofthe mexican undercover agents mr santana mr orsino will write down anynames you choose to give and i should warn you some of the names we wish youto give us we already know it would be most unpleasant for you should we catchyou attempting any sort of stall or deception go fuck

just beyond thewalls of the chamber ray can hear the revelry of the fiesta de nogales thefireworks and the music the noisy celebration will go on throughout the nightit is doubtful he will be alive by the time it ends the doctor is right for santana the hourthat follows is an eternity twice he nearly passes out from the pain eachtime perchek uses a shot of some sort and an increase in the iv infusion tobring him around for the next series of injections ray becomes used to thesound of his own screaming somewhere along the way he wets himself in betweeninjections his muscles now continue to spasm uncontrollably several times hegroans out names perchek glances over at orsino who shakes his head rayspunishment for lying is an increase in the dosage his response morescreaming three ways a

are government troopsoutside the man exclaims in perfect english dozens of them i think theyhave alacante us agents just raided the arizona house too the tunnelentrance is still closed but its only a matter of time before they find ittheyre after you anton i dont know how they found out but they know yourehere the voice ray strains to pull togetherthe floating fragments of his thoughts he knows the voice orsino is there another way out ofhere perchek asks through that door doctor theres ashort tunnel to a house across the street alacante had it built listen the voice says ive got to getback before they find the main tunnel and me in it i am grateful for the warning myfriend you know how to reach me if theresanything i can do the tunnel door scrapes shut there are afew seconds of echoing footsteps then silence but in those moments raysclouded mind locks in on the voice sean garvey garvey you bastard you son of abitch he shrieks remembering the moment he and his boss had been hauled offby alacantes men the signs that something wasrotten with garvey had been there a dozen times over he thinks now how carelessit had been not to have picked up on them how stupid mr santana it appears our business mustcome to a premature closure perchek says from somewhere on the floor above themcomes the sound of a door being smashed in then there is gunfire doctor i think we should go

closer now and they can hear voices the doctor levels theautomatic at the center of santanas forehead ray clenches his teeth andforces his eyes to remain open for the last moment he will ever see anythingthen with the smile ray has come both to fear and loathe perchek lowers therevolver steps forward and empties the still nearly full syringe into theintravenous line dont worry he says you

the friend who has betrayed him garveyyoull rot in hell for this a moment later his nervous system explodesin a volcano of pain he shrieks again and again he thrashes his head abouthe bites through his lip and hurls himself sideways on to the floor the agonyin every nerve every fiber of his body intensifies garveeeey soaked in sweat walter concepcion sat boltupright in bed after more than seven years he had almost become inured to thenightmare but some journeys back to the basement sessions with the doctor werestill worse than others and this one his first in the weeks since arrivingin manhattan from his home in tennessee had been a motherfucker it was the pain that had brought on theflashback it usually was the electric nerve pain that had been part of hislife for almost every moment of the seven years since the doctor emptied thesyringe into his body ray wiped off his forehead and face with the sheet andfumbled through the bedside table drawer for the bible he had hollowed out tohold his percodans he could stand to have everything he owned in the rentedroom ripped off even his gun but not his percodans his doc at homeunderstood after years of neurologic consultations psychotherapy aa na andhospitalizations the man had given up trying for a cure and now just wrotethe scripts the local pharmacist understood too and just filled them tothose men and the others who knew the whole story ray was a legend the manwho had captured anton perchek santana had brought along enough pills tolast a month provided the chronic pain didnt get any worse than it had beenhe had no desire to take to the street for drugs but he would if he had toanton perchek was alive and plying his miserable trade in new york and therewas no way ray was leaving the city until the man was dead he had heard from harry about thesuccessful session with the hypnotist next maura would be meeting with thecriminologist her brother knew together they would make computer renderingsof her drawing in a variety of disguises those drawings would be put up inhospitals throughout the city santanas plan was simple keep jabbing at thedoctor irritate him enough and sooner or later he would do something rashsooner or later he would make a mistake he tossed two percodans into the back ofhis throat and washed them down with a glass of water then he set out clothesfor his meeting with page he would wear his sports jacket so that he couldconceal the shoulder holster and his he didnt expect trouble but heanticipated it since his betrayal and capture in nogales he alwaysanticipated it he reached beneath the pillow withdrewhis pistol and unscrewed the silencer it was bulky and although it hadworked just fine that evening in central park it tended to cut down onaccuracy besides he thought when he finally stood facetoface with antonperchek when he finally leveled the at a spot between his eyes and pulledthe trigger he wanted the doctor to hear the sound chapter this hearing isnt going to be pleasantmel wetstone said to harry as they drove across town to the hospital but ipromise you we are not going to take any bullshit from these people he had picked harry up in the mercedesphilip had sold him the one that phil claimed defined the man as an attorneythe four doors as well as the trunk had electronic closing mechanisms and therear couch seat hardly did it justice reclined it wascertainly reassuring to see that wetstone was successful enough to afford suchtransportation but today the mercedes had tapped into harrys midlife feelingsof inadequacy and block by smooth airconditioned block it was inflating themlike a thanksgiving day float gratefully there were just a few more blocks togo did sam rennick say what they were goingfor he asked sam plays things pretty close to thevest but it was clear that he isnt willing to concede any of the points wevepresented to him not the sketch from ms hughes not the floor buffer theorynot the call to your office from the killer they want you off the staff untilthe case is resolved can they do that probably there are a few spots in thehospital bylaws where the language about who can do what to whom is vague purposely vague we think the bottom line is that if they vote you out andbelieve me weve got some cards to play before they do we can try for aninjunction but wed better get a damn sympathetic judge a far better ideawould be to beat them back right here and now thats what i intend to do harry stared out the sunsensitive windowat the passing scene he had no desire to be booted from the mmc staff for onething his patients were his emotional and financial lifeblood for anotherbeing barred from practice in the hospital would make it that much harder toput the pressure on the killer and they had enough progress since connectingwith walter concepcion to believe that before long some sort of strategy forputting pressure on him might actually evolve maura was on her way to meet with herbrothers friend lonnie sims the dweeb had access to the latest in thegraphics suspects together they would enhance mauras sketch and addphotographic quality coloring and detail the result would be essentially afullcolor mug shot front and side views they would then add and subtractmix and match until they had similar photos of the man with his appearancealtered when harry and his lawyer entered theexecutive conference room for the second time since evies death theatmosphere was distinctly more formal and more threatening recordingmicrophones had been placed at several spots around the massive table theplayers from the first drama were all there already along with a number ofnotable newcomers including members of the hospital board of trustees thedepartment heads who made up the medical staff executive committee the headnurses from alexander and alexander caspar sidonis and a legalstenographer there was also a man sitting beside the hospital attorney whomharry did not know a roughhewn man in an illfitting blue suit steve josephson squeezed harrys hand ashe passed doug atwater smiled uncomfortably and came over harry he whispered im glad i gotthis chance to talk with you i hope you understand that the other day i wasonly suggesting what i thought would be best for you obviously i upset youand im sorry for that i wanted to be sure you know that im behind you ahundred percent in this thing half a dozen snide responses sped throughharrys head none of them made it to his mouth atwater didnt deserve it overthe years he had been most supportive of harry and his struggles to keep familypractice a respected option suggesting that harry take a voluntary leave fromthe hospital was the only way he could think of to avoid the hearing that wasabout to take place a hearing in which harry seemed destined to be humiliatedand ultimately swept aside i understand doug he said but ihavent done anything wrong so i just cant go down without a fight in that case give em hell harryatwater grinned sam rennick reviewed the ground rules thathad been agreed upon by him and mel wetstone witnesses would give a statement andanswer questions from first rennick then wetstone harry would be permitted tospeak after each witness but only to respond to questions from his lawyer notto address any of the witnesses directly when the hearing was concluded thejoint hospital and medical staff executive committees would vote by secretballot whether to suspend harrys admitting privileges or not before you begin mr rennick dougatwater said i would like it to go on record that the manhattan healthcooperative will abide by the ruling of this hearing he looked over at harrydr corbetts status as a physician provider for mhc will remain intact solong as he has admitting privileges at this hospital considering that the health plan was boundonly by its own laws in picking and removing physician providers atwatersstatement amounted to an endorsement his company could have made the resultsof this hearing essentially moot by simply cutting harry from its rolls it wasa move harry had feared they might make he was doubly glad now that he hadheld his temper with doug the head nurse from alexander startedthings off by reading affidavits from both of the nurses who had been on dutythe night of evies death there was no question in either of their minds thatexcept for maura hughes harry was the last one to see his wife before thelethal rupture of her aneurysm sue jilson recounted in some detail harrysrequest to leave the floor for a milk shake and then return the hospitalattorney used his questions to pin down the nurse about the security setup onthe floor then he homed in on the clinical condition of maura hughes she was about the most classic case ofthe dts ive ever seen the woman said she was restless and combativesweating profusely and disoriented most of the time when she wasnt accusingthe staff of ignoring her she was swatting at insects that werent there shewas medicated almost the entire time she was on our service and despite thatshe was still one of the most disruptive patients weve had in a long time harry and mel wetstone exchanged glancesthe hospital attorney knew mauras sketch was about to be presented and waseffectively destroying its credibility by painting such an unappealing pictureof her it was the reason harry had argued against having maura attend thehearing to present her drawing herself mel had warned him what she might hear wetstone cleared his throat took a slowswallow of water and favored the nurse with an icy smile im sorry ms hughes was so disruptive toyour neurosurgical floor he said thank you the nurse replied completelymissing wetstones sarcasm you dont have very warm feelings towardalcoholics do you does anyone wetstone allowed half a minute for theresponse to sink in around the room as a matter of fact yes some peopledo he said softly the american medical association has formally classifiedalcoholism as a disease the american psychiatric association has also i hopeyoure not prejudiced against too many other diseases as well i have nofurther questions of you the head nurse beet red folded her notesand stared off at a spot that would keep her from eye contact with anyone ifthe impact of her testimony hadnt been neutralized entirely it had certainlybeen diminished wetstone turned to harry dr corbett have you been in touch withmaura hughes since her discharge i have and hows she doing quite well actually she hasnt had adrink since her surgery and shes started back on her painting the white lie was one they had agreed uponthe previous day oh yes shes an accomplished andwellregarded artist isnt she you have a drawing of hers here with you a copy of it yes miss hughes hadtrouble recalling some of the details of the mans face so we went to see ahypnotist that would be dr pavel nemec the murmur around the room suggested thatthe hungarian was known to most of those present im not sure hes a doctor harry saidbut yes he had no trouble helping her reconnect with her memories onesession about fifteen or twenty minutes was all it took mr rennick wetstone said here is anotarized affidavit from pavel nemec attesting to his certainty that thedrawing you are about to see represents the face remembered by maura hughes the man who came into room nine twentyeight after dr corbett left to get hiswife a milk shake he waited until everyone that mattered had a copy before hecontinued dr corbett have you ever seen the man depicted in ms hughesdrawing i have he was dressed as a hospitalmaintenance man buffing the floors outside room nine twentyeight when iarrived when i left for the milk shakes he was still there when i came backwith them he was gone youre sure of this positive its an extremely good likenessof him maura hughes has an incredible eye for detail she says she suspectsthat the tie was a clipon because the knot was just too perfect several people laughed out loud this is ridiculous caspar sidonismuttered though loudly enough for everyone to hear so what youre telling us dr corbettwetstone said is that this man he waved the drawing for emphasis this manwaited for an opportune moment put on a doctors clinic coat taken from withinthe casing of his floor buffer walked boldly into room nine twentyeight andinjected your wife with a killing dose of aramine i believe that is exactly what he did many of the faces around the room wereexpressionless but harrys unofficial visual poll said that the majority stillhad strong doubts about him without comment wetstone motioned that hewas done since the burden of proof was in theory at least on the hospitalharry would not be crossexamined by the hospital attorney it was one ofseveral procedural points wetstone had won sam rennick next introduced the man in theillfitting blue suit willard mcdevitt the head of maintenance for thehospital mcdevitt in his fifties with a ruddy complexion and a nose thatappeared to have been broken more than once or twice spoke with the force ofone convinced he was incapable of being wrong about anything he reminded harryof bumpy giannetti the hulking bully who had stalked him after school andbeaten him up with biological regularity from grades seven through ten hewondered in passing if bumpy would respect him now that he was the chiefsuspect in two murders mr mcdevitt is the man in that drawinganyone you recognize rennick asked after establishing the mans credentials absolutely not i never saw him before inmy life he looked haughtily over at harry and what about that industrial floorbuffer the one dr corbett claims the killer used that night well first of all let me say that ifthere was a buffer on alexander nine that night it was one of mine and if itwas one of mine one of my men was runnin it could someone have brought one into thehospital anythings possible but those babiesweigh close to a quarter ton and are bigger n a clothes dryer its hard toimagine someone sneakin one into the hospital without being noticed could they have stolen one from yourdepartment not unless it was at gunpoint we have asignout system i designed myself to prevent any unauthorized person from usinany of our equipment even a wrench has to be accounted for i dont think wedexactly misplace a fivehundredpound buffer thank you mr mcdevitt rennick nodded toward wetstone withoutactually looking at him harry saw the gesture and reflected cynically on thefoolishness of a profession in which subrosa byplay was an accepted evenrehearsed part of the practice then he noticed caspar sidonis exchangingwhispered comments with the trustee seated next to him motioning towards harryat the same time the byplay in medicine might be more subtle than in law butit was no less nasty mr mcdevitt mel began where are thefloor buffers kept locked in a room in the subbasement doublelocked as a matter of fact only me an gus gustavson my head of floormaintenance have the key every one of them buffers thats taken from thatroom has to be signed out by him or me i understand mr mcdevitt id like toask you again whether you believe there is any way a man who was not in youremploy could get at one of those buffers absolutely none that look again harry met the mans gaze in away he had never faced up to bumpy giannetti held it and even managed a weaksmile had mel wetstone shared with him the next part of his strategy hissmile would have been much broader wetstone stood walked to the door openedit and stepped back a curious silence held for several seconds then wasshattered by a machinery hum a tall blond man dressed in a tan mmc maintenancejumpsuit entered the room he wore a standard hospital photo identificationbadge and was polishing the tile surrounding the plus oriental rug with an industrialbuffer property of mmc was stenciled in red on the side what in the hell willard mcdevittexclaimed wetstone nodded toward the buffer man andthe machine was shut off mr mcdevitt do you know this man i do not mr crawford where did you get thatcontraption from the room marked floor maintenancein the subbasement and was it difficult for you to get the blond man grinned piece of cake he said ill return itnow if thats okay he spun the machine round and wheeled itout instantly it seemed as if everyone was talking and gesturing at onceharry noticed that several members of the medical staff were laughing willardmcdevitt looked as if he was going to charge mel wetstone instead he listenedto some whispered words from the hospital attorney shoved his chair back andstalked out for his part wetstone carefully avoided appearing smug or evenpleased he sat placidly allowing his theatrics to hold sway for the firsttime harry felt that the emotion in the room might be turning in his favor ifrennick and his witness could be so wrong about the floor buffer people had tobe thinking maybe they could be wrong about other things as well now just a minute just one damn minute caspar sidonis had clearly taken as muchas he could he stood and strode to the head of the table owen erdman thehospital president moved his chair aside for him this man is a huckster sidonis saidmotioning toward wetstone a snake oil salesman hes using misdirection andtricks to keep you from focusing on the important points in this case and samim afraid all youve done is make it that much easier for him this isnt acourtroom its a hospital were not here to debate fine points of law werehere to see to it that our thousands and thousands of patients patients whocould take their business to any number of facilities have the confidence inthe manhattan medical center to continue coming here were meeting here todayto prevent our hospital from becoming the laughingstock of the city were hereto ensure that the medical school graduates with every hospital in the countryto choose from think enough of this place to apply for residency here the man was good damn good harryacknowledged this was revenge for evie and payback for the humiliation of theamphitheater all rolled into one and most important his force andeffectiveness sprang from his hatred of harry and his consuming belief inharrys guilt harry took another silent poll of the room already thingsdidnt look as promising as they had mel wetstone seemed on the point ofrising to object to sidoniss tirade but he thought better of it and sank backin his chair trying to stop the powerful chief of cardiac surgery fromexpressing his opinion could only hurt them i am not embarrassed to say that eviedellarosa and i were in love sidonis went on for years she and harrycorbett had had a marriage in name only the night before she entered thishospital the night before she was murdered she told him about us i know thatfor a fact that gives him a motive a twohundredandfiftythousanddollarinsurance policy gives him another the nurses have already testified to hisopportunity and certainly the method chosen was one only a physician wouldknow now its remotely possible that dr corbett is as innocent as he claimsits remotely possible that every crazy alternative explanation he has come upwith actually happened but even his innocence does not change the fact thattwo of our patients with strong connections to him are dead the newspapers arehaving a field day at our hospitals expense the public confidence we haveworked so hard to build is plummeting harry corbett owes this hospital therespect and consideration to remove himself from the staff until this wholematter is resolved one way or the other since he has refused to honor thatresponsibility this group must take action i promise you here and now i willnot continue to practice at an institution without the gumption to stand up foritself and do what is right for its staff and patients thank you drained or apparently so sidonis usedthe backs of chairs to help him return to his seat mel wetstone inhaleddeeply then let out a sigh harry felt flushed and selfconscious sidonis hadthreatened the hospital and the board of trustees with a massive blow to theirtwo most vulnerable areas reputation and pocketbook world famous heartsurgeon quits hospital over handling of doctor doom harry could just seethe headlines in the daily news he leaned over to his lawyer there was a commotion outside the roomthe doors burst open and owen erdmans staid secretary rushed in im sorry dr erdman she saidbreathlessly i tried to explain to them but they wouldnt listen sandyscalled security theyre on their way she stepped aside as a small mob marchedinto the room leading the way was mary tobin and close behind her was marvlorello next came all the other members of the family medicine departmentalong with a number of harrys patients some with their children in tow twodozen people in all harry guessed no closer to three among themhe recognized clayton miller the man whose severe pulmonary edema he andsteven josephson had reversed by removing almost a unit of blood the groupcrowded into one end of the conference room then several people moved asideand harrys patient mabel espinoza stepped forward two of her grandchildrenclung to her skirt my name is ms mabel espinoza she saidher latino accent was dense but no one ever had trouble understanding her shefaced the hearing with the stout dignity that had always made her one ofharrys favorites i am eightyone years old dr corbett has cared for me andmy family for twenty years i am alive today because he is such a wonderfuldoctor many others could say the same thing when i am too sick he comes tosee me at my home when someone cannot pay he is patient i have signed thepetition in less than one day more than two hundred have signed thank you this was your marys idea wetstonewhispered to harry i never thought she could do anything like this though another woman stepped forward andintroduced herself as doris cummings an elementaryschool teacher in a harlemschool she read the petition signed by of harrys patients enumeratingthe reasons harry was essential to their wellbeing and that of their families if dr corbett is removed from thestaff of the manhattan medical center without absolute just cause thepetition concluded we the undersigned intend to take our health care toanother hospital if leaving the manhattan health hmo is necessary andpossible we intend to do that as well this man has been an important part ofour lives we do not want to lose him marv lorello whispered in cummingss earand motioned toward owen erdman cummings circled the table and set thepetition in front of the hospital president across from harry a distinguishedwoman named holden who was a past president of the board of trustees brushedaside a tear standing to her right mary tobin was beaming like a mother at herchilds graduation next marv lorello spoke on behalf of thedepartment of family medicine describing harry as an invaluable friend andpowerful example to those in the department especially those newly inpractice he read a statement signed by every member of the department ineffect threatening to move their services to another facility if harry shouldbe removed from the hospital staff without absolute legally binding proof ofhis misconduct he set the document on top of the petition in front of owenerdman then the group trooped out of the hearing there was no further discussion the votewas a formality although two of the twelve submitting ballots did endorseharrys removal from the staff caspar sidonis left the room as soon as theresult was read dr corbett erdman said coolly thatwas an impressive show of regard for you it would be tragic to learn that suchloyalty is not deserved have you anything further to say only that im grateful for the vote i aminnocent and i intend to prove that and to find this man i would hope tobegin by posting this likeness around the hospital absolutely not erdman snapped mystaff will discreetly distribute that sketch to our department heads but wewill not lay ourselves open to the public suggestion that a murderer could justwaltz into our hospital disguise himself behind one of our floor polishers andmurder one of our patients i demand your promise of cooperation in thisregard harry looked over at mel wetstone whosimply shrugged and nodded you have my word harry said in that case erdman concluded youhave our blessing to continue with your work are you going home wetstone asked asthey headed out of the hospital no im headed to the office i thinkmary deserves a lunch dinner at the ritz would be more likeit chapter the thermometer mounted on the wall justoutside the battery park irt station was in direct sunlight stillninetyfour degrees was ninetyfour degrees as he entered the station dampand uncomfortable his briefcase in one hand and his suit coat scrunched in theother james stallings cursed his penchant for dark dress shirts he loved theway they looked on him and the statement that they made among hiswhiteshirted colleagues but on a day like today wearing royal blue wassimply dumb but then again he had been doing a lot ofdumb things lately the station was mobbed tourists fromellis island and the statue of liberty jostled with passengers off the statenisland ferry and a crowd of kids in their early teens wearing camp citysidetshirts almost everyone was talking about the heat stallings shuffledthrough the turnstile behind two cityside girls who were giggling about a boybeing disallowed on their field trip caught up in their conversationstallings tried to piece together what it was the boy had done and where theywere all headed but before they could the teens took up with a dozen othercampers and moved like a jabbering phalanx down the broad stairs there was a train waiting at the platformbattery park was at the beginning of the run so there were almost always emptyseats even at rush hour today though it was standing room only fromsnatches of irritated conversation around him stallings discerned that therewas a delay of some sort and of course while the cars themselves wereairconditioned the platforms were not thick steamy air billowed in with thepassengers and overwhelmed what little cooling the system was generatingbeneath his arms stallingss shirt was soaked through he glanced out thewindow at the crowd still pouring down the stairs and across the concreteplatform loomis was supposed to wait ten minutes before heading back to crownit had probably been close to that already not that it really mattered if theyended up on the same train especially different cars but stallings who hadnever been the nervous or paranoid type was frightened irrationallyfrightened he kept trying to convince himself sir lionel had posed something of a threatto the roundtable and he had died suddenly and mysteriously a year or solater evelyn dellarosa had been murdered in her hospital bed she too hadcrossed paths with the society the drug used to poison her had beendiscovered but almost by accident were the two deaths coincidence possiblebut doubtful stallings thought now within twentyfour hours he wouldeither have to submit a list of hospitalized clients to be terminated orbecome a potential threat to the roundtable himself meeting with kevin loomis was the rightthing to have done he decided loomis seemed like an upfront decent enough guyeven though he remained noncommittal and maybe even unconvinced as soon as hehad the chance to sort through everything he would come around and togetherthey would figure out something they simply had to stallings wipedperspiration from his forehead with his shirtsleeve the car was nearly packedthe heat oppressive it was only a matter of time before someone passed out hey watch it one of the passengerssnapped fuck you came the quick retort a gnarled old woman with a pronounced humpand an overfilled shopping bag worked her way between him and the seats andstopped with one of her heels resting solidly on stallingss toes stallingsexcused himself and pulled his foot free the crone glared up at him withreddened eyes and muttered something that he was grateful he couldntunderstand the doors glided shut and for a moment itseemed as if they had been condemned to a new brand of torture but slowlyalmost reluctantly the train began to move stallings was taller than most ofthose standing in the car clutching his briefcase and his hopelessly wrinkledsuit coat in his left hand he was able to keep his balance in part by holdingon to the bar over the old ladys head and in part by the force of thosepressing around him he commuted to work from the upper east side on the irtand so was an inveterate and extremely tolerant rider but this was about asbad as he could ever remember to make matters even worse the train waslurching mercilessly perhaps responding to an effort by the driver to make upfor lost time a minute out of the station the oldladys heel again came down on his foot this time stallings nudged her awayearning another glare and another epithet moments later a particularlyvicious lurch threw a crush of people against him he felt a sharp sting in hisright flank just above his belt a bee a spider he reached down with hisright hand and rubbed at the spot the stinging sensation was already almostgone his shirt was still tucked in all around his hand was still off the barwhen a tight curve pitched him against the passengers behind him hang on to something for chrissakesomeone cried as he was pushed back upright idiot someone else added sorry stallings muttered still tryingto make sense of having been stung in such a way he had been stung before anynumber of times by both bees and spiders he wasnt allergic to either butwhatever had bitten him this time had done so right through his shirt the train slowed as they entered the cityhall station the crush of passengers intensified as some tried to make theirway to the doors excuse me a woman said trying to getpast stallings sir stallings couldnt respond his heart hadstarted pumping wildly his pulse was resonating in his ears like artilleryfire he felt a terrifying nausea and dizziness taking hold sweat cascadeddown his face the car lights blurred and then began spinning faster andfaster his chest felt empty as if his lungs and heart had been torn out heneeded desperately to lie down hey what are you doing someoneshouted his hand had slipped off the steel bar hey buddy stallings felt his knees buckling hishead lolled back hey back away back away hes passingout stallings knew he was on the floor hisarms and legs jerking uncontrollably feet hit against him as people tried toback away he sensed himself bite through his lip but felt no pain a flood ofwords reached him as distant echoes through a long metal tunnel hes having a seizure getsomething in his mouth roll him over roll him over on his side im a paramedic move aside everyone move aside somebody dosomething i am lady just back off get a cop the words became more disconnected moregarbled stallings felt the people kneeling around him touching him but hewas powerless to react he knew he was losing consciousness blood flowed fromhis lip on to his royalblue shirt he sensed his bladder give way the blurredimages faded to blackness the voices and sounds died away all but one of the tangle of people werefocused on stallings this one a nondescript man in a print sports shirtreached between two wouldbe rescuers and grasped the handle of stallingssbriefcase then ever so slowly he slid it free of the crowd he smiledinwardly at the image of sir gawaine utilizing one evasive tactic after anotherto avoid being followed to battery park never realizing that thestateoftheart bugs galahad routinely placed in each knights room had madetailing him quite unnecessary the car doors were open now and peoplewere pushing and jamming to get out on to the platform the man withstallingss briefcase moved calmly with the flow the syringe in his pocketwould be tossed into a sewer within a block the cardiotoxin he had emptiedinto stallings was one of his favorite weapons a drug virtually unknownoutside of the lower amazon so potent that the poison remaining along thebarrel of the syringe would probably still be enough to kill the thirtygaugeneedle attached to the syringe was so fine it could pass through a pore makingthe puncture wound essentially invisible and even if the injection hadproduced a tiny droplet of blood the mans dark blue shirt would have made itvirtually impossible to notice just another statistic another heatrelateddeath beautiful just beautiful anton perchek exited the station just asthe two policemen were rushing in take your time gentlemen he whisperedbelieve me there is no need to rush chapter the mood in harrys apartment wasdecidedly upbeat walter concepcion and maura arrived within a few minutes ofeach other both with good news harry needed it after the hearing as hewas getting out of mel wetstones mercedes in front of his office he hadexperienced another bout of chest pain more sharp than dull or squeezingmoving from deep in his back through to the middle of his breastbone the wholeepisode didnt last long maybe three or four minutes and it wasnt all thatsevere but it was the worst pain he had had in a while by the time he hadgiven mary tobin a quick kiss of gratitude and hurried to the medicationcabinet to try a nitroglycerine pill the pain was subsiding if it was anginahe told himself again it certainly wasnt a textbook case still maura was going to keep her part oftheir bargain by going to an aa meeting with concepcion the least he could dowas schedule a stress test he went back to his desk dialed the office numberof a cardiologist friend and actually let the phone ring once before he hungup he would keep the nitroglycerine in his pocket he decided and take it atthe first sign of chest pain if it worked if the pain subsided there was a fairlystrong likelihood that the problem was his heart then he would call thecardiologist meanwhile he told himself the stress test could wait harry gave maura and concepcion a vividaccount of the hearing at the hospital especially the near catastrophicspeech by caspar sidonis and the remarkable performances by mel wetstone andmary tobin this sidonis concepcion said when hehad finished does he know about your wife i mean the research she wasdoing i dont think so i havent shared what iknow about her other life with anyone except the police telling sidonis seemedto serve no purpose i doubt he would believe it anyway he sounds like he could be a dangerousenemy i would recommend you to stay as far away from him as possible will hefollow through on his threat to quit i doubt it but you never know he makesit sound like he could just walk out of mmc and hang up his shingle at anotherhospital but he has a huge research lab and when youre in themillionplusayear category which im sure he is things are seldom thatsimple theres no hospital in the city without a chief of cardiac surgery andi doubt any of them would be too pleased to have ol caspar decide to horn inon their territory maura next told of how lonnie sims hadhelped her produce a series of photoquality pictures of the man she had seenthere was the original and three other frontandside views one with glassesand a beard one with a mustache and blond hair another with blue eyes andlong dark hair sims had reduced them all in size and placed them on a singlelegalsize sheet along with an empty box for the addition of other informationhe then printed out ten copies for her should have done one as a womanconcepcion said studying the images what nothing just babbling this guy seemslike he can almost walk through walls in hospitals so i was wondering whathed look like as a nurse actually lonnie tried out a number offeminine wigs and makeup of various kinds that opened up dozens ofcombinations and possibilities the pictures would have been awfully small ifwe had tried to print too many plus we felt it might be too confusingfor anyone looking at a set of fifteen or twenty composites to focus in on oneof them good point concepcion said well geta batch of color xeroxes and put them up on every floor in the hospital maybein other hospitals too we cant harry said he reviewed his clash with owen erdman andhis agreement that erdman alone would supervise distribution of the drawingsand then only privately to department heads it wont work concepcion said moreagitated than harry had ever seen him what do you mean theres not much chance that someonesjust going to look at these posters and say ah ha thats our man rightover there it happens that way sometimes but not often what werereally trying to do is annoy the doctor upset him to the point where he doessomething careless jab and run jab and run until he doesnt care aboutanything except getting even with you you talk as if you know him harry said the tic at the corner of concepcionsmouth fired off several times i dont know him specificallyharry he said but i know psychos our tripping up that man is not nearly aslikely as his stumbling over his own ego but our best chance of having thathappen is to find a way to rile him up im sorry but i cant do it walter igave the hospital president my word my positions shaky enough around thatplace without pushing my luck with him hes famous for his temper in a weekor so we can try approaching him again but not now whatever you say doc concepcion studied one of the posters fora few seconds maura this is really quite amazing hesaid slipping it into a battered leather portfolio she looked at him curiously how do you know hey i may be a little rough around theedges he responded cheerily but i know good artwork when i see it thanks she said shrugging off hermomentary concern well know just how amazing a likeness that is when we seethe guy looking out at us from behind a set of bars if he lives that long for a moment concepcion wasafraid he had said the words out loud it seemed to maura as if a shadow hadpassed over concepcions face as if he had quite suddenly drifted off to somefaraway place he took a long drink of the lemonade harry had made for themwhen he set his glass down the shadow was gone his grin was broad andengaging so then mis amigos he saidits my turn to tell you about elegance the escort service for discerninggentlemen the woman who runs it is page she wouldnt tell me any more thanthat i met her at this dark bar on the east side that has no windows not oneit turns out that my suspicions were right desiree did a kind of freelancework for elegance on and off for four or five months um im sorry to saythis harry but apparently she was very much in demand swell hey are you going to be okay with this harry shrugged go ahead okay anyhow this page is very angrybecause some wealthy powerful people pulled out of a contract with her whenthey found out desiree was a reporter what happened was desiree triedinterviewing some of the other girls and one of them ratted on her pagethought that by firing desiree shed get rewarded instead she and elegancegot canceled she ended up losing a hell of a lot of money she seemed angryenough to talk about the men involved but she also seemed really frightened ofthem apparently two of them paid her a visit and gave her the third degreeabout desiree i couldnt get her to tell me anything about them at first so ikept sweetening the pot until she did harry im ah im afraidthe fifteen hundreds gone all of it it was kind of a doordie situationshed had a few drinks and was just on the edge i figured that if i didntnudge her over with a good offer i might lose her for good well five hundred of thats yoursharry said harry maura exclaimed sorry sorry go on walter i trust youreally i do she didnt know any of the mens namesexcept someone named lance i guess thats his last name he paid her in cashand let her know if a girl was unsatisfactory for whatever reason the girlsseven of her very best went to the camelot hotel twice a month and stayed thenight she didnt know for certain what the men were doing there but fromthings her girls told her from time to time she thought some of them might havebeen in the insurance business insurance thats all she said it isnt that muchbut it certainly got my attention i was thinking i could approach some of thechambermaids at the camelot chambermaids in hotels know everything and inthis city half of them are latino maybe i can learn who some of the guys areand we can go from there they meet every two weeks atthe camelot hotel i dont think thats going to benecessary harry said remembering one of the few lines of desirees writinghe had gotten the chance to read i think evie might have already named acouple of them for us he had copied the two names he found inevies address book and kept the copy in his wallet the original was wedgedinto the toe of an old pair of sneakers in the hall closet now he smoothedthe names on the table called information and then dialed the new york publiclibrary he was looking for a referenceroom librarian named stephanie barnesbarnes had been one of his first medical assistants and one of the few wholeft the office to go back to school rather than to have babies or to make moremoney than he could afford to pay harry had given her a nice bonus to helpwith her first year now happily married with a masters degree in library scienceshe had both the babies and more money than he could afford to pay over the years of their continuingfriendship she had taught harry something that he had already long suspected that a resourceful imaginative referenceroom librarian could find out almostanything stephanie i have two names along withaddresses and even social security numbers he said after accepting hercondolences about evie and assuring her that he had nothing to do with herdeath i think both men might be involved with the insurance business in someway i want any information you can dig up on either of them especially wherethey work and what they do tomorrow would be okay if youre too busy but iwas actually thinking more in the line of the next hour or so stephanie told him not to expect anythingbut it was just thirty minutes later when she called back bingo harry said after he took down theinformation walter youve done it again james stallings vice president ofinterstate health care kevin loomis first vice president of crown health andcasualty they both seem to be stars on the rise too loomis had two years ata community college in new jersey and was just a sales agent until a couple ofyears ago now hes big stuff im not sure what hes doing living at queenswith what he must be making stallings is private school all the way ststephens dartmouth and wharton business school hes won a ton of awards forperformance in the company and the industry do you want me to look up the companyphone numbers maura asked harry tapped his pages of notes you obviously havent had any experiencewith people like my friend stephanie office and home phone numbers for both which one are you going to try first harry looked over at concepcion why the awardwinning executive ofcourse walter said is it worth talking through how youre going to approachhim i think i might be better improvisingharry said he dialed the number for the manhattan office of interstate healthcare and asked for james stallings in a few moments stallingss secretarycame on the line mr stallingss office hi harry said im trying to reach jimstallings my names collins harrison collins i was a classmate of jims atdartmouth im with the selection committee for next years graduation jimsname has been submitted for a distinguished alumnus award and i need to goover some details with him harry got two thumbs up from his smallaudience there was an unnaturally long pause before his secretary responded im sorry mr collins she said mrstallings isnt able to take your call well when should i call back again there was an uncomfortable longpause what was this about again an award dartmouth is giving mr stallingsan award mr collins im afraid mr stallings isill quite ill he hes in the intensive care unit at memorial hospital oh thats terrible will he i mean ishe going to be all right i cant tell you any more than thatwithout permission im sorry harry reviewed the conversation for mauraand concepcion and then used his title and knowledge of hospital procedure toget through to a nurse in the memorial hospital icu his conversation with thewoman lasted only a minute he slowly set the receiver down stallings had a cardiac arrest on the subway this afternoon he said hes on a ventilator essentiallybraindead she couldnt tell me any more than that how old was he maura asked harry glanced at his notes fortytwo not exactly cardiac arrest ageconcepcion said what do you think i dont like it i dont like it at alli think you should call that other one whats his name harry was already dialing crown health andcasualty loomis he said kevin loomis harry modified the tale he told toloomiss secretary harrison collins was with the executive of the yearcommittee of the american insurance association loomis was to be one ofthree nominees for this years award harry knew the lie sounded good even ashe said it in a few seconds loomis was on the line what can i do for you mr collins hesaid are you the only one on this line harryasked what can you talk safely of course i can whats this all about mr loomis my name isnt collins itscorbett dr harry corbett do you know who i am i read the papers this is about my wife mr loomis mylate wife evelyn why are you calling me mr loomis in trying to

know stallings and i havenothing more to say to you my number is in manhattan callme anytime but make it soon i have a feeling we need to talk kevin loomis hung up without responding hes going to check on what i told himabout stallings harry told the others after that i think ill be hearingfrom him one way or the other maura respondedwarily for all we know he may have been the one who hired evies killer chapter each patient was allowed two visitors inthe memorial hospital icu when kevin loomis arrived there at twofifteen thefollowing afternoon james stallings already had his quota he was directed toa small family room with overstuffed furniture a selection of religious andinspirational reading material and a television that was turned to the cartoonchannel visiting hours were from noon until eightbut this was kevins first opportunity to get to the hospital since receivingthe call from harry corbett as soon as he had hung up on corbett kevin hadcalled memorial patient information could tell him nothing more than thatjames stallings was a patient in the icu and that his condition was criticalhe dialed stallingss office at interstate health hoping to learn more buthung up as soon as the secretary asked his name badly shaken he managed tomake it through an hourlong meeting at work a meeting in which burt dreisersat directly across the table smiling at him benevolently burt you know sir gawaine thetall goodlooking guy who came on board the roundtable about six or sevenmonths before i did you wouldnt happen to know how he ended up in criticalcondition in the memorial hospital icu would you after the meeting kevin had barely hadtime to make it home for julies dance recital he would have preferred to havebeen assigned to nickys little league game but his deal with nancy was thatthey would alternate now with little brian scheduled to begin various lessonsas soon as they were settled in port chester the formula would have to berevamped by the time he caught up with nancy itwas almost nine the kids were finally all in their rooms with kevin havingspent the previous night at the garfield suites it had been a day and a halfsince he and nancy had said more than a few words to one another she hadpicked up on his uncharacteristic tenseness and asked about it he made noattempt to disagree work had been unusually heavy he said when she asked howhe had made out in his poker game he chose the won a few dollars lie thenshe ran down two days worth of family news and began flirting with himstroking the inside of his leg it had been a couple of weeks since they hadmade love since before the previous roundtable meeting in fact but thisjust wasnt going to be the night he begged off citing a splitting headacheexhaustion and a phone call he had to make to burt he forced himself not tolook at her hurt and concern and shuffled down to his basement office therehe called memorial hospital once again icu critical excuse me huh kevin had been staring unseeing at a bugsbunny classic a woman stood in the doorway of the family room she was talland slender with sandy hair cut short her narrow face was attractive andmight have been beautiful were it not for the dark circles under her eyes youre here to see jim stallings i am yes the woman stepped forward and extended herhand im vicki stallings jims wife kevin stood kevin loomis im with crown health i i play cards with jim oh then you saw him just the nightbefore before this happened did he seem all right perfectly normal he was in the subway when he collapsedshe said talking as much to herself as to kevin city hall station hissecretary said he had some sort of appointment downtown but she had no ideawhat how did you say you knew jim i um i play cards in the samegame he does oh yes you just said that didnt youi cant seem to keep a thought in my head i assume he lost again she saiddesperately distraught but still trying for civility jim never was veryinterested in card games or very good at them from what i could tell but hewould never miss that game i gather it was as much about business as aboutpoker kevin felt strange hearing the lie fromsomeone elses wife im really sorry about whats happenedhe said i couldnt get any information from the hospital other than that hiscondition was critical is he i mean does he vicky stallings shook her head and thensuddenly and rapidly unraveled kevin stood by awkwardly until she had regainedsome control her sobbing let up embarrassed she apologized he told herthere was nothing to apologize for my sister just left she managed why dontyou go on in there alone ill be by in just a bit jim hasnt mentioned youbut he kept that poker game pretty much to himself its very good of you tocome im sorry this has happened kevin saidagain for as long as he could remember kevinhad had an intense aversion to hospitals he disliked intensive care units evenmore he checked in with the nurse at the desk and was directed to cubicle aglassenclosed box with drapes partially blocking the windows the patient inthe cubicle bore scant resemblance to the urbane executive who had sat acrossfrom him through nearly five months of roundtable meetings tape across hispuffy face held tubes in place through his nose and mouth beside the bed alarge respirator hissed and whirred its display flashing like some obsceneelectronic game stallingss lips what kevin could see of them wereswollen cracked and bruised his eyes were taped shut periodically everymuscle in his body seemed to go into spasm with his rigid arms twisting inwarduntil his palms faced away from his sides overhead the monitor screendisplayed a heart rhythm that was quite regular kevin knew the innocentpattern was deceiving braindead thats how dr harry corbetthad put it braindead kevin pictured evelyn dellarosa as shownin the newspapers and as he remembered her such a remarkable looking woman so classically stunning was this how she ended up too tubes coming out ofevery body orifice puffed and braindead on artificial ventilation alive onlyuntil some doctor finally strolled in and simply pulled the plug was this whatwas in store for kevin loomis as well he moved closer to the bedside was there any way stallingss cardiacarrest on the irt could have been a coincidence the man was incrediblystressed over the situation with the roundtable it was a hundred degrees onthe subway platform and not much better in the cars and what if he was unluckyenough to get one of the old unairconditioned ones perhaps some preexistingcondition caused his heart to just crap out on the other hand perhaps theywere being watched all the time at battery park perhaps stallings hadrecognized someone from the roundtable in the subway perhaps they had donesomething to him dammit james what in hellhappened hismind screamed what am i supposed to do thank you for being so patient mrloomis vicky stallings had washed her face andput on a bit of makeup its kevin he said this is so sad dohis doctors have any idea what could have happened id be happy to talk with you kevinshe whispered but i would prefer doing it in the family room its doubtfuljim can hear but theres always the chance i understand they returned to the small room wile ecoyote was lashing himself to a huge rocket just as the road runner wasflashing past kevin reached up and flicked the set off you dont have to talk about this with meif its too painful he said theres not much to say actually thedoctors have said theres no hope they estimate his heart stopped for eight ornine minutes people were doing cpr but i guess it wasnt enough the rescuesquad finally got him going was he i mean did he have any heartproblems before kevin sensed how desperate he was hopingfor a positive answer kevin jim ran last years new yorkmarathon in three and a half hours about six months ago he took out a largeinsurance policy they required a stress test jim said he did so well that thedoctor who performed it eventually had to stop the test to go on to the nextpatient a large insurance policy reflexively kevin ran throughhis own coverage as soon as he joined the roundtable he had beefed it up twomillion five with an additional half a million for accidental death he always looked fit to me he said the doctors say that maybe it was hispotassium dropping due to the heat and sweating apparently the heart is verysensitive to potassium it depends on what he was doing for the hour or sobefore vicky stallingss voice once more grewstrained kevin could see that she was precariously close to coming apartagain in fact he was rather close himself stallingss death was nocoincidence any more than evelyn dellarosas or the knight named sir lionelswas a coincidence somehow they had followed stallings or perhaps even kevinto battery park then somehow they had gotten to him now he was a vegetablethe unflappable sir gawaine kevin wondered if he too had gone out and boughta new house as soon as his appointment to the roundtable was a fact kevin wanted to scream he made a pretenceof glancing at his watch vicky stallings saved him any embarrassment i really appreciate your coming likethis kevin she said again reaching out to shake his hand and who knowsit will take a miracle but there have been miracles before many of them ill be praying for him kevin saidbacking out of the room he felt lightheaded and desperately wanted a drink kevin stopped in the first bar he passeddowned a couple of quick vodka tonics and then returned to crown brendawallace had some letters for him to sign and a list of calls to return hewatched her move about her office tanned and lithe and utterly sensual burtdreiser had the corner office the yacht and brenda wallace when hadburt decided he could handle whatever the roundtable wanted of him had he beenpart of the planning that put the whole program together and most importantwhy in the hell couldnt kevin be like him he finished his work and sat for a timestaring out at the city then he picked up the phone and called george illychthe underwriter at crown who had handled all of his policies george kevin loomis is here how goesit hey fine kevin what can i do for you kevin pictured george illych leaning backin his chair looking longingly at his beloved winstons a jovial overweightbilliard and golf hustler illych smoked two packs a day and was one of thepoorest insurance risks kevin knew nancy and i have just bought a house inport chester hey great thats great first the bigpromotion then the big house then the big coverage george ivedecided with the new house and my income up near counting bonusesthat i want a bit more coverage hey no problem what did we write for you recently a million that was four months ago myphysicals still good yes up to six months how much do you havetotal this million would make it three and ahalf plus an additional accidental he added but didnt say all to nancy yes hey pal no problem ill have thepaperwork up to you within a couple of days perfect thanks george how about shooting a little pool afterwork sometime soon pool against you i couldnt afford itgeorge hey wait a minute you just became thethreeandahalfmilliondollar man thats only if im dead george ohyeah youve got a point there half an hour later brenda wallace stoppedby to say goodnight kevin quickly stacked the papers he had been working onand slid them inside his desk drawer there was nothing further he toldbrenda she gave him one of her most dazzling smiles before heading home kevin opened his briefcase and took out anewspaper clipping about evelyn dellarosa he was looking at her picture whenhe dialed harry corbetts line corbett this is the man you calledearlier he said to harrys answering machine i want to talk to you be hometomorrow morning at nine ill call he set the articles back in his briefcaseand then tossed the drawings he had been making in on top of them they were aseries of diagrams and sketches of the basement of his house in queens mostparticularly emphasizing the position of the washing machine dryer bulkheadentryway and especially the electrical power source chapter it was nearly midnight when harry heardmauras soft knock on his partially open bedroom door he was lying on hisback wide awake trying to will himself to sleep but he was still far too keyedup things were continuing to break for them as they had since the momentmaura convinced him to hire walter concepcion now the insurance executivekevin loomis had left a message on his answering machine he wanted to talk inthe morning he was going to call bit by bit the circle was closing step byminuscule step they were drawing closer to evie and andy barlows killer come on in im awake he said i just wanted to see if i could talk youinto some tea and maybe a little company wearing loose cotton pants and a tank topshe stood in the doorway framed by the light behind her if her goal at thatmoment was to look alluring and incredibly sexy she has succeeded admirablyharry pushed himself up and motioned her to a spot on the bed a fairly safedistance away no tea thanks but a little companywould be fine a little company harrys attraction to the womanhad begun within minutes of their meeting at her apartment and had grownsteadily since it was dumb he knew dumb and dangerous both of them werefragile and vulnerable his wife had been dead just a few weeks maura hadfallen off the wagon and they had business to attend to a madman who wantedboth of them dead harry ive decided to go home tomorrowshe said suddenly he tried to mask his surprise and hurt you dont have to do that i know but sooner or later i do itsnot to get away from anything here i hope you know that its just that all ofa sudden my head is full of the paintings i want to do theyre flashingthrough my brain like comets thats terrific but i dont think itssafe yet not from the killer i agree but thatdangers here too itll be everywhere i go until we nail him what i am safefrom now is the booze that was the big worry for me even more dangerous thanthe killer the aa meeting tonight made me even more certain im not takinganything for granted and im going to keep going to the meetings but i knowim going to be all right with all the terrible things thatve happenedthats one good thing to come out of this mess she smiled at him but now ifee like i ought to be alone and i know you need some space she sat with her legs tucked underneathher her body was silhouetted by the hall light harry tried to remember thelast time he had held evie the last time they had sex the last time he hadreally cared he sensed the stirrings in his body over the past days he hadmanaged to overcome them now he reached out tentatively and took herhand i dont need space and i dont want youto go he said she moved closer he breathed in the scentof her and knew that whatever resistance he had been clinging to was gone you dont know me harry she said imtough ive been known to eat nice kind men like you for breakfast and spitout the seeds he backed away and peered at her that sounds like something you heard in amovie it is actually i think it might havebeen garbo but ive sort of always wanted to try the line out myselfunfortunately though its true i cant remember the last lover i cared aboutas anything more than some sort of perverse validation that i was a worthwhileperson you are a worthwhile person hesaid and incredibly sexy even with no hair you have plenty besides that minimalistcoif just lets me focus more on the rest of you he drew her toward him and gently cuppedher breast she made a soft excited sound pressed his hand in more tightlyand nestled her head against his chest harry ive wanted you to want me since ifirst saw you walking up the stairs to my place now i really am frightenedwere both going through so much weve had so much hurt maura we dont have to make love we canjust lie here and hold one another she slid her hand down his shorts dont let me talk you out of this shesaid propped against the headboard he kissedher lightly on her lips on her neck on her throat she knelt astride him andpulled off his tshirt then with his lips just inches from her breasts sheswept off her tank top and threw it aside instantly his mouth was on hersucking her caressing her nipple with his tongue making love sober is going to be a hellof an experience for me we dont have to do it tonight shut up harry listen though ireally dont feel right making love with you unless its safe its been quitea while for me i think but you know how us blackout drinkers are dont worry evie was the condom queenthe latest box is in the drawer by the bed its been there for months i dontthink its even been opened well its about to be they kissed gently longingly he workedhis hand inside her pants over her buttocks farther and farther until hecould touch her new dampness instantly she was wet she let him stroke herthat way for as long as she could stand then she slid down him pulling hisshorts free and running her lips and tongue over him again and again go slow maura he begged im reallyout of practice and i want this to last where does it say you only get one tryshe murmured moving up to his lips and helping him slide her pants down completely nude with wonderfully whiteskin and only the shortest soft bristles of hair on her head she was thesexiest woman he had ever been with she lay stretched out on her belly nowtoes pointed he knelt beside her and ran his hand down her long silky bodypausing to stroke her buttocks again and again then he rolled gently on top ofher kneading the muscles in her back spreading her legs apart with his kneeshe was so aroused so large he ached he kissed the inside of her thighs andtouched between her legs she was ready too incredibly ready please harry she moaned not thisway i want to look at you this first time i want to see your face i want tosee your wonderful face he kissed her behind the neck and helpedher roll over she drew her knees up and took him in her hand for severalmagical suspended seconds they remained that way their eyes fixed on one another keep looking at me she whispered as sheguided him inside her baby please keep your eyes open just a littlelonger keep your eyes open and see how happy this makes me see how much ilove doing this with you the light of morning was filtering throughthe blinds when the phone began ringing harry couldnt remember when they hadfinally drifted off to sleep but he knew it couldnt have been very long agothey had made love then rested then made love then showered and ate andthen made love again if this is you at fifty maura hadgasped at one point im sure glad i didnt meet you when you weretwentyfive you would have been eleven he said thats just the point an hour later as she lay beside him shegently touched the patchwork of scars covering his back he had already toldher about nhatrang hey you can tell me the real story nowshe said ill certainly understand what was her name the ringing persisted he reached acrossher for the phone just as she was beginning to stir the digital display on hisclock radio read hello harry yes harry its doug sorry to wake you hey ive been up for hours maura now almost fully awake reachedplayfully under the sheet to touch him he pushed her hand aside stifling alaugh harry what in the hell is going onatwater asked from the tension in dougs voice it wasclear he was not referring to what was going on at that moment in harrysbedroom with what harry asked with those posters dammit harryplease were friends dont play games with me harry was wide awake now sitting boltupright maura sensing trouble was up too doug you have to believe

you get hold of your brother i think so i want to know if there was ever alicensed detective in new york named walter concepcion the call from kevin loomis came preciselyon time at nine oclock by that time three other calls had come in as wellone was from a maintenance worker at mmc one from university hospital and onefrom bellevue each of them reported seeing the man in the poster two of themwanted an advance on the reward before giving any information harry found anotebook in the study and began keeping a log he also began letting hismachine screen calls goddamn concepcion he said after eachof the calls goddamn concepcion loomis calling from a pay phone wouldsay only that he was willing for the two of them to meet he sounded tense butnot excessively so be at the southeast corner of theintersection of third avenue and fiftyfirst at eleven oclock tonight hesaid wear a baseball cap ill pick you up he hung up before harry could ask anyquestions over the next half an hour there were twomore calls with tips and inquiries about the reward maura answered bothneither seemed that promising were going to have to develop a systemfor evaluating these she said i suppose we should say that if the callercan point the man out to us were interested otherwise thanks but nothanks maura i dont have fifty thousanddollars hey first things first she saiddont you remember hearing the speaker say that at the aa meeting last night god ive created a monster the third call was from tom hughes hewould keep looking but as far as he could tell there had never been alicensed private eye in manhattan or any city in new york state named walterconcepcion harry slammed down the receiver then snatched it up and calledconcepcions rooming house walter himself answered concepcion i want to know who the hellyou are and why youve stabbed me in the back like this for fifteen seconds there was silence your place or mine concepcion saidfinally chapter i couldnt see the mans facebecause of the way i was tied up but even through the drugs and the pain irecognized his voice it was my boss sean garvey he was what we called afloater sort of part cia part dea part above it all it was his job tocoordinate our side of the undercover operation in northern mexico but he soldme out and brought in his friend perchek to work on me when the man harry had known as walterconcepcion arrived at the apartment harry immediately lost control withoutwaiting for any explanation he spun concepcion against the hallway wall andwas so close to striking him that maura had to restrain him now he and maurasat together on the sofa in his living room listening in stunned silence asray santana took them through his three years as an undercover drug enforcementagency operative in mexico then his capture and his torture at the hands ofanton perchek after garvey left the cellarorsino one of the drug lords lieutenants told perchek about an escape tunnelleading to a house across the street with the festival going on in nogalesand crowds of people all over the city they would have a perfect chance toslip away from the mexican police poor orsino obviously didnt appreciate whohe was dealing with it wasnt by accident that no pictures or reliable descriptionsof the doctor existed perchek pulled a pistol from his medical bag and just ascalmly as you please shot him through the mouth then he pointed the gun atme but he was furious with me because i hadnt broken it was the ultimateinsult to him he wanted me to die but not a quick death instead of shootingme he emptied the whole syringeful of hyconidol into me oh god maura said santana shuddered it was horrible indescribably horriblebut it was also a mistake i didnt die fascinated harry studied the man as hecontinued santanas voice was animated enough but there was a blankness inhis eyes a strange detached distance outwardly he was telling his storybut in his mind harry realized he was living it ray for gods sake ray comeon a mans urgent voice pries into santanasconsciousness ray fights to stay within the darkness finally though hegroans opens his eyes a bit and strains to focus on the face behind thewords his body feels as if it has been worked over with a baseball bat he ison his back on the grimy cellar floor a makeshift pillow beneath his head ray its me vargas ray where is hewheres perchek come on ray weve lost a lot of time the face comes into focus joaquin vargasone of alacantes most trusted lieutenants one of the men ray was preparing tohave arrested vargas mexican undercover all the time vargas i never thought you never mind that wheres perchek with great effort ray pushed himself uphis head is clearing rapidly apparently the doctor does not know his reveredpain drug as intimately as he thinks or maybe he just doesnt know raysantana how long have you been here with mesantana asks half an hour maybe a little more youvebeen out like a fish on ice at first we thought you were dead he went out a tunnel somewhere overthere it goes to the house across the street the tunnel vargas orders immediately three uniformed policemenrace that way they dont know what he looks like raysays i do i need a gun ray youre too im fine joaquin you have no idea whatthe bastard did to me please give me your gun reluctantly vargas hands over hisrevolver a nine millimeter smith amp wesson ray cradles the gun and patsthe mexican on the arm you sure as hell had me fooled he says without waiting for a reply ray hurriesup the stairs if the streets are as garvey has warned crawling with policechecking out any and all gringos there is still a chance perchek hasnt founda safe way out it is nearly six pm long lateafternoonshadows stretch down the main street where a small parade is wending its waytoward the plaza the crowd along the sidewalks is modest probably in a lullbetween the afternoon and evening festivities but a number of thosecelebrating are wearing costumes and masks chances are perchek isbehind one of them possibly in the midst of the parade or perhaps he isheaded out of town by now but policemen are everywhere knocking on doorschecking alleys and blocking the main exits from town there is still achance ray is more wobbly from his ordeal than hewishes to admit but each step feels more assured than the last and he knowsthat when and if he does need the strength it will be there he starts tofollow the parade but after a few yards one of vargass men calls to him thepoliceman is approaching with a thin agitated man who is gesticulating wildlyand chattering nonstop the man is naked save for a pair of red silk bikinibriefs mr santana the officer says we foundthis man bound and gagged with adhesive tape in an alley two blocks in thatdirection he says that not ten minutes ago a gringo put a gun to his headtook his costume and tied him up were looking for a clown with a redpolkadot suit mask and bright orange hair from this fellows description idoubt hell be hard to spot only ten minutes ago theres no way he can escapeus were closing in on the plaza ray voices his approval but he sensessomething is wrong anton perchek had shot orsino to death without a flicker ofhesitation an ally of his why allow the man in the clown suit who hasalso seen his face to live he slips the smith amp wesson beneathhis belt and heads away from the plaza toward the alley where the clown wasfound a tangled ball of adhesive tape shows him the exact spot the alley isdeserted with firecrackers going off every few minutes there is no way agunshot would ever have been noticed yet the man is alive not at all certain what he is searchingfor santana makes his way around the tawdry block then quickly around thenext one and the next litter from the fiesta is everywhere a number ofcelebrants lie in doorways or between trash barrels in deep alcoholinducedsiesta one of them somewhat removed from any others catches santanas eyeit is a young woman with a rather pretty face perhaps in her early twentiesshe is sleeping on her side her back pressed against a building covered tothe neck with a tattered mexican blanket ray approaches but five yards beforehe reaches her he knows she is dead he pulls back the blanket she is dressedonly in a pair of white cotton panties and she is pregnant perhaps sevenmonths perhaps eight a single bullet hole stares up at him obscenely from aspot just above her engorged left nipple the blood that has oozed from it hasalready clotted santana bets that the doctor had the womans clothes hiddenaway even before he took the clowns driven by a jet of adrenaline his legsare suddenly responsive he pulls the revolver free as he sprints toward themain street a juggler in a skeletons costume and mask is entertaining a crowdof fifty or so shielded by the corner of a building ray studies the crowd andthen turns his attention to the street everyone seems to be involved inconversation in commerce with one of the street vendors or watching thejuggler then suddenly he sees her across thestreet and a block away she is walking slowly unobtrusively away from thecrowd away from him what strikes him though is her very unobtrusivenessher feet are bare her head covered by a shawl an unremarkable pedestrian in avery remarkable scene unremarkable the doctors most valuable attribute santana moves ahead keeping the crowdbetween himself and the woman if it is perchek taking him will not be easythere are dozens of potential hostages around and scores of potential victimsshould any sort of shooting erupt one move that is all he has if heis wrong there will be one shocked bruised woman but nearly fifteen years asa cop tell him he isnt wrong one move he remains in the shadows of the buildingfor as long as he can then he breaks across the street and dashes toward thewoman from directly behind her at the last possible moment she sensesmovement and begins to turn around but ray his gun drawn is alreadyairborne his shoulder slams into her back sending her sprawling on to therutted dirt street the moment he impacts with her the instant he feels thebulk and the tightened muscles ray knows it is perchek shrieking in russian the doctor spins tohis back struggling to free the gun in his right hand but the loose maternitydress slows him and santana is ready for the move he pins percheks wristwith his left hand and simultaneously thrusts the smith amp wesson up intothe soft flesh beneath his chin drop it he barks drop it now or itsyour fucking head perchek i mean it the doctors ice blue eyes sear him hismouth is twisted in a snarling rictus of hate then slowly ever so slowlyanton perchek releases his weapon and lets it drop from his fingertip harry worked his neck around and realizedhe hadnt moved a muscle for some time across from him ray santana saggedvisibly exhausted from recounting the ordeal that should have killed himwithout speaking maura went to the kitchen and returned with coffee nobodyspoke until she had poured three cups can you tell us what happened afterthat harry said nothing good percheks injection didntkill me but over the last seven years i often wish it had somethingirreversible happened to the pain fibers in my nervous system they fire offwith no cause sometimes a little sometimes absolute hell i assume youve seen doctors without the chemical perchek used theydidnt even know where to begin most of them thought i was crazy you know howdoctors are about things they didnt learn in some textbook they thought i wasjust after drugs or a government pension finally i took a medical dischargefrom the agency and got one hundred percent disability i go to aa and naperiodically but the pain always wins out fortunately i have a doctor andpharmacist at home in tennessee who understand so getting percodanprescriptions is no problem and your family maura asked santana shrugged sadly my wife eliza tried to understandwhat had happened to me and what i was going through but with no encouragementor insight from any of the doctors she finally gave up last year she gotmarried to a teacher from knoxville and your son hes at the university from time totime when he can he calls i havent seen him in a while this is very sad maura said i was managing at least until a fewweeks ago i was about a year after perchek was locked up in the mexicanfederal penitentiary just outside of tampico i got word that he was deadkilled in a helicopter crash during an escape attempt i didnt trust the reportin mexico if you have enough money you can make just about anything happen or appear to happen there had been an explosion over water i was told thechopper blew up there were several reliable witnesses what was fished out ofthe atlantic was identified as perchek through dental x rays you sound as if you werent convinced lets just say that what i wanted tobelieve and what i believed in my heart were not the same thing but how did you end up here harry asked i got a call from an old friend inforensics at the bureau in dc that expert of yours mr sims had sent down anumber of prints for identification one of them a thumbprint matchedpercheks with about ninetyfive percent certainty i wasnt that surprised especially when i learned it had been lifted from the room of a woman who hadbeen murdered in a hospital i came here and began making plans to get close toyou my friend in dc promised to give me a little time before identifying theprint for sims but why didnt you tell us who you were well the truth is i wasnt sure whatside you were on i thought maybe you had hired perchek to kill your wife iwasnt even a hundred percent certain after that night in central park harry groaned that was you you shot that man you look upset i am upset i saved mauras life maybe yours too if you had taken those men in instead ofkilling one andy barlow might still be alive now it was santana who lashed out harry dont be an ass were dealing withkillers here not college professors not social workers killers got thatthese people dont stand around and let someone escort them to thepolice they kill its too bad about barlow he shouldntve died but get itthrough your head it wasnt my fault youre dangerous santana harry snappedback a walking stick of dynamite with a short fuse you dont really care whogets blown away as long as anton perchek goes along with them youve got that right brother well i might get booted out of myhospital because of what youve done brother come on harry santana said you mightget reprimanded but you wont get kicked out your lawyers too good listenwell go take the posters down theyve been up most of the night now and thatmeans theyve already succeeded in rankling perchek which is pretty much whati wanted them to do rankling perchek you really are a piece ofwork harry said not at all kindly have you heard how many times thegoddamn phone has rung since you got here thats a growing percentage of allthe nutcases in manhattan each one convinced i can be conned out of fiftythousand dollars rankling perchek santana just get out of here imhaving enough trouble with my enemies without getting blindsided by mysocalled friends maura had heard enough listen you two she snapped sit downand shut up for a minute both of you i dont care how you feel about oneanother but neither of you operating alone has much chance of getting thisperchek harry youre a doctor not a cop and ray you cant get insidehospitals and thats where your man is you two need one another face it harry glared at santana maura stalkedacross the room and stood over him hands on hips do you guys want me to make you shakehands like we used to do after fights in junior high school okay then westick together and we try to clear things with one another before we do themdeal deal the two men grumbled well come on then maura cut in beforethey could get started again weve got some posters to take down a small crowd clustered around thebulletin board outside the mmc surgical suite there were nurses techniciansand physicians including an anesthesiologist an ent specialist and caspar sidoniseveryone it seemed was talking at once about the posters that had appearedovernight throughout the hospital you know one of the nurses saidpointing to the rendering of perchek with a beard i actually think ive seenthis guy janine another nurse said since youkicked billy out last year youve seen most of the guys in the city not funny janine said i agree janine sidonis said andneither is this this latest humiliation for our hospital at the firstwords from the cardiac surgical chief all extraneous conversation stoppedeveryone in the hospital knows that harry corbett killed his wife he couldntstand the thought of losing her and so he killed her its as simple as thatthese drawings are just a smoke screen a misdirection play the man isabsolutely certifiable and so is the woman who drew these they are theproduct of an alcoholics distorted mind and nothing more youll all seeive had it up to here with corbett and the way hes manipulating everyone inthis place fiftythousanddollar reward indeed embarrassed by the surgeons ramblingoutburst and the stories they all knew about his involvement with the murderedwoman the crowd quickly dispersed as sidonis turned to go he nearly collidedwith a man in a fulllength lab coat whose photo badge identified him asheinrich hauser a research professor from the department of endocrinology i agree with you completely doctorhauser said in a dense german accent this corbett makes trouble foreveryone thank you doctor sidonis replied he glanced at the man who was four orfive inches shorter than he was with graywhite crewcut hair thick glassesand yellowed teeth the teeth disgusted sidonis instinctively he backed awayfearing a blast of bad breath he had not seen the man before that he couldremember but he seldom took notice of anyone with whom he didnt haveimportant business have a good day now hauser said yes you too sidonis paused and lookedat the man once more have we met the mans ocher smile prompted sidonis tolook away i dont think so doctor he said butperhaps we shall meet again sometime chapter by nightfall the threeday heat wave hadyielded to a pleasant summer rain harry left the apartment at tenthirty andtook a cab to the east side as instructed he was wearing a baseballstyle cap the only one he could find in the apartment it was evies from herwashington days navy blue with us senate in gold just above the brimafter reading the introduction to desirees book between the sheets hecouldnt help but wonder if the cap was a trophy harry had been loudly rebuked by owenerdman for breaking their agreement and putting up the posters but as santanahad predicted he did not appear to be in danger of losing his staff privilegesso long as they were taken down promptly harry would do mmc santana and theman he had hired to help cover every hospital in the city would take care ofthe six others they had done so far when they had left harrys apartmentthere was still a good deal of tension lingering between the two of them harryfelt he could no longer trust ray santana to act in anyones interest but hisown to his credit santana did not dispute that point but he maintained thatany sacrifice by anyone that resulted in the doctors death would have beenworth it they briefly considered bringing albertdickinson up to speed on the developments in the case but neither of them werein favor of doing that the chances of getting anything helpful from him weresignificantly lower than the chances of his causing more trouble for themperchek was arrogant and fearless but he was not foolish dickinson would morethan likely end up driving him underground perhaps the worst thing that couldhappen since it was still not at all clear what the doctor was doing inmanhattan or how he came to kill evie there was no way of predicting how longhe would stick around while harry and santana were off to teardown posters maura stayed at the apartment to screen phone calls there was asteady flow of them now at about two or three an hour most of the calls wereclearly cranks but some sounded interesting maura dutifully logged each oneand promised to get back to the caller with fifteen minutes to go before he wasto meet kevin loomis harry paid the cabby off at park and fiftyfirst andwalked the remaining blocks although he wasnt particularly worried aboutbeing followed he had not forgotten his experience in desirees apartment hecut down to fortyninth and back pausing in several doorways to survey thestreet nothing it was a garbage collection night and the light raindid little to wash away the stench from the mountains of plastic bags awaitingpickup it had been a while since the last protracted garbage strike inmanhattan on summer nights like this he could understand why they seldom wentunresolved for very long traffic was light and the intersection offiftyfirst and third was nearly deserted with evies us senate cap pulledlow over his eyes harry leaned against a light post and waited at exactly a yellow cab pulled up the front passenger door swung open get in doctor the driver said hisvoice like number thirtysix sandpaper you loomis harry asked as the cabpulled away and headed uptown nope the driver said nothing more untilthey neared fifth avenue at fiftyseventy as soon as im across fifth jumpout and hurry up to the corner of sixtieth youll be picked up there ivealready been paid so just get out quickly and go he slowed until the light was just aboutto turn red then spurted across the intersection just ahead of the oncomingfifth avenue traffic the maneuver drew an angry volley of horn blasts but ensuredthat no car could make it through behind them harry hurried up fifty tosixtieth as soon as he reached the corner a black lexus rolled up the dooropened and harry jumped in while the car was still moving the driver agoodlooking man about forty swung on to central park south and accelerated kevin loomis he said sorry for thecloakanddagger stuff im not even sure itll do any good stallings and itook every precaution we could think of when we went to meet at battery parkbut somehow they still managed to follow one or both of us stallings was onthe way back to his office from our meeting when he had his cardiac arrest who are they harry asked they are the people i think areresponsible for killing your wife thats why i decided to see you tonighttheyre health insurance people they call themselves the roundtable you mean like the million dollarroundtable more like the hundred million dollarroundtable im part of it they turned on to the west side highwayand headed uptown harry listened in near disbelief as kevin loomis describedthe secret society and his recent involvement with it harry liked the manimmediately the hard edge to his speech the streetsmart toughnessunderlying the newly acquired executives manners if the roundtable was aselite and exclusive as loomis depicted it was a bit difficult to imagine himbelonging as he listened there were two things thatstruck harry almost from the beginning the first was the secrecy and mistrust and how little loomis had been allowed to know about the other knights itsounded more like a covert government operation than an oldboys club thesecond was something about the man himself clearly loomis was saddened bywhat had happened to evie and to james stallings but while hecertainly wasnt flip or glib neither did he seem that distraught or desperate or even frightened he sounded much calmer tonight than when they first spokeon the phone calm and detached as far as your wife goes loomis saidim just guessing at what might have happened im assuming you had nothing todo with her death our marriage was on the rocks just likethe newspapers said but i would never have harmed her the people on the roundtable are terriblyparanoid they were worried that desiree was investigating them she wasnt harry said she was writinga book and preparing a tabloid tv report on the power of sex in business andpolitics he reviewed the night he had spent in desirees apartment omittingany mention of the doctor her involvement with your group was primarilyresearch he concluded she probably went through your wallets when she hadthe chance she figured out you were in the insurance business but that wasall she knew i dont think she had the faintest notion what you were meetingfor well apparently the roundtable didntbuy that i was there for the discussion and there was not even a hint thatthey planned to track her down and kill her but now im sure they did i haveno idea who actually injected her with that chemical i would imagine its thesame guy who carries out the terminations of policyholders who cost ourcompany too much money hell for all i know there may even be more than oneof them harry decided to wait until he knew a bitmore about loomis and his motives before sharing the news of anton perchekthey entered the bronx on the henry hudson parkway and continued driving awayfrom manhattan toward van cortland park harry remained uneasy about loomissaffect and wondered if the man was lying or perhaps holding something back kevin he said why have you decided totell me all this i mean youre part of it if the roundtable is destroyedtheres a good chance youll suffer too there are a few reasons actually iveread a lot about you and i dont like what theyre doing to you theyredestroying your life you won a medal for getting shot up in nam i was tooyoung to fight but my older brother michael lost a leg there also the wholethings getting to be too much for me now dont get me wrong im no angelfar from it i could do most of what the roundtable wanted and not bat an eyebut i draw the line at killing people no matter how sick they are or how muchtheyre going to cost us i intend to turn states evidence and make some sortof deal with the das office that is if i ever get my hands on anyevidence what do you mean theres nothing on paper nothing at allstallings was the only one who might have backed me up ill go ahead anyway tell the same story i just told you and name what names i can but i suspectthe lawyers for the other knights will cut me to shreds maybe not you know all along ive had atheory about why whoever killed evie seemed to be going out of their way notto harm me i figured it was because i was the perfect fall guy why get rid of me now i realize ive probably been right with every signpointing to me you and stallings werent likely to challenge the roundtable exactly you said your wifes killer hasbeen trying to get you to kill yourself that would have been the clincher idont know about stallings but i would have immediately stopped suspecting theroundtable harry turned to loomis what youre doing takes a lot of gutshe said when you do go to the authorities ill be right there with you ifthats any comfort thanks but from what ive read in thepapers im not sure that would be a plus the cops really hate you harry smiled touche kevin listen im thinking aboutsomething pretty farout that might help us could you go over the criteria youremember from that sheet stallings gave you i can do better than that he handed over the printout of merlinsprogram the criteria that had cost beth desenza her job then he looped on tothe mosholu parkway heading back toward the major deegan expressway and thecity how many companies are involved harryasked probably five thats not counting mycompany or stallingss i know two of them for sure comprehensiveneighborhood health and northeast life and casualty what companies the otherthree represent i dont know yet although i might be able to find out if ireally work at it dont do anything to ruffle anyonesfeathers these guys clearly dont have much patience with people who upsetthem harry studied the criteria the lowest projected cost to qualify fortermination was what again half a million exactly harry rolled up the printout and tapped itagainst his fist his idea was beginning to take shape kevin i really appreciate that youvecome to me before going to the da he said now ive got something to show you he handed over a folded copy of theposter kevin glanced at it then pulled off into the breakdown lane and turnedon the interior light never saw him before he said after halfa minute hes the man who killed evie we haveproof i saw him outside her room just before the injection her roommate sawhim in the room and he left a fingerprint that was identified by thefbi lab his names anton perchek hes a doctor kevin an md hes known allover the world as a master of torture and for keeping victims alive andawake during torture he was supposed to have died in a helicopter accidentescaping from prison six years ago and you think hes involved with theroundtable i do i think hes the one who carriesout these these terminations kevin handed back the poster and swung thecar on to the highway for a time they rode in silence youve got to nail that guy kevin said youve got to harry looked at him curiouslybut didnt comment kevins eyes remained fixed on the road i have a thought harry said you saidtwo of the companies involved were comprehensive neighborhood health andnortheast life and casualty i dont have many patients with comprehensive buti do have quite a few covered by northeast life suppose i admitted one to myhospital and made up a diagnosis that would qualify him for termination underthis protocol could you do that i think so the real question is whetheryour knight from northeast casualty would bite whats his name pat harper hes lancelot the one whomade stallings the offer to join the inner circle so if anyones actively involved in thisthing it would be him thats good but youre suggesting taking a patientand deliberately exposing him to this anton perchek who would do such athing actually harry said i have someone inmind who would be happy to only hes not exactly a patient of mine could youtake me to my office its on th near fifth sure i knew it was right to contactyou once again loomiss words and the way hespoke them made harry feel uneasy not once had he talked about the implicationsfor him and his family of what he was doing in fact not once had he spoken ofhis family at all he had chosen to contact harry before going to the da why youvegot to nail that guy why not we suddenly harry knew what had beentroubling him so about the man was that he sounded detached as if the eventshe described had happened to someone else entirely he had chosen to speak withharry before seeking out the da because he never had any intention of going tothe authorities in fact he had no intention of seeing this thing through allat once a good deal about this strange ride made sense loomiss calmness hislack of fear loomis was an insurance executive harry suspected that his deathwould leave his family well provided for you okay harry asked as they approachedthe lights of the city huh oh sure im still worried aboutwhats going to happen but i feel much more hopeful after talking to you good we can put an end to theroundtable you know i know the sadness in his voice was unmistakablenow kevin you said you knew about me and thewar what i read in the papers the platoon i was with was ambushed wewere caught in a vicious firefight with mortar shells dropping on us from anearby hill most of our kids were killed or badly hurt i managed to dragthree of them to the medevac chopper thats what i got the decoration for asif i even knew what i was doing at that point then a shell exploded rightbehind me i think it hit a mine because it seemed like half the jungle blewup i have no idea who dragged me out of there it was about a week before iwoke up they had taken what metal and other debris they could out of my backalong with part of one kidney i spent several months in a rehab hospital thepain was wicked and for a long time i thought i might not walk but you did thats sort of the point about threemonths into my rehab i decided i couldnt take it anymore i snuck off in mywheelchair with a revolver tucked under the sheet for half an hour oh helli really dont even know how long i sat in the woods with this gun in mymouth and my finger on the trigger why didnt you pull it harry shrugged i guess i just decided it wasnt my job they had crossed the river into the citynow and were heading toward harrys office good for you hopeless is a relative term kevin jamesstallings is pretty much hopeless you arent think about that will you for a moment it seemed kevin was about tosay something but instead he just nodded and focused on the road harry felthe had gone as far as he could in counseling a man he did not know at least hehad made his point they rode in silence until loomis pulled up at harrysoffice is there anything else i should know beforei go about creating a worm for sir lancelot to bite on just follow the protocol loomis saidi wish you luck harry stepped out on to the street therain had stopped but the humidity was still close to percent id like about a week before you go tothe da he said if were going to pull this off publicity would reallyhurt no problem ill check with you firstanyway thanks and kevin yes do everyone a favor and see this onethrough loomis looked at him without making eyecontact yeah sure he said thanks it was the middle of the night beforeharry found what he was looking for a male patient age thirtyfive tofiftyfive whose insurance carrier was northeast life and casualty maxgarabedian a fortyeightyearold school custodian garabedian who wascompulsive about his work and his body was something of a hypochondriac butin the main he was healthy and that was what harry needed to know there wasonly one way his scheme could work and countless ways in which it could gohaywire but barring a freak accident having max garabedian show up in somehospital when he was already an inpatient at mmc would not be one of them harry considered calling garabedian toexplain what he was about to do but if the man agreed he would be open tocharges of insurance fraud no he decided max garabedian would have tobe hospitalized for treatment of his expensive potentially fatal illnesswithout his knowledge harry copied down all the pertinent data the hospitaladmitting office would need to know now there were only two problems comingup with an appropriately dire condition and convincing ray santana to becomethe bait chapter harry stepped off the elevator on to grey and headed directly for the chart rack next to the nurses station he wastrying to be unobtrusive but he knew that every nurse aide and secretary onthe floor was aware of his arrival he was also trying to appear nonchalantalthough he felt more and more like he was on night patrol in the jungle itwas his third day of making rounds on the patient in room the manregistered as max garabedian in order to clear his name from one felony hewas willfully committing another probably several others that theircharade had survived even this long was a tribute to meticulous preparation andincredible luck but the clock was ticking it had taken two days of intense workbefore harry was set to admit ray santana to the manhattan medical center thediagnosis he had chosen for his creation was acute lymphocytic leukemiacomplicated by a low whitebloodcell level and bacterial endocarditis aserious potentially lethal infection of the heart valves to up the ante forsir lancelots insurance company he added a code and special note implyingthat garabedian was being evaluated for total body radiation and a bone marrowtransplant to test the case kevin loomis had run thedata through the computers of crown health and casualty the projected cost oftreating max garabedians illnesses over the years he was projected to haveleft to live was a bone marrow transplant would add to theequation partly by increasing his life expectancy years if lancelot wasusing the roundtables selection program max garabedian would light up on thenortheast life computers like a flare harry opened garabedians record andreviewed the notes and laboratory reports he had inserted there including adictation he had done using the name of the chief of hematology he had signedthe note himself and intercepted the copy as it was being placed in thehematologists cubby such maneuvers were necessary to keep the nurses andchart reviewers from becoming suspicious but each move carried with it thedanger of discovery and harry was definitely feeling the strain he had beensleeping only four or five hours a night had absolutely no appetite and haddeveloped a nasty dry cough that he felt certain was nothing more than nerves and to heighten the tension there had beenabsolutely no sign that the roundtable or the doctor was nibbling at the bait harry wrote a lengthy problemorientedprogress note in the chart as had been the case during the first two days ofrounds no one spoke to him unless he addressed them directly it was just aswell the less anyone asked him the less he would have to lie and lying wassomething he had never done very smoothly to discourage hospital personnel fromvisiting maxs room harry also added probable tuberculosis to the mix allin all enough pathology to give even the most intrepid caregiver pause givenray santanas gaunt appearance sallow complexion and chronic five oclockshadow harry knew that hospital personnel would have no trouble connecting himwith his frightening inventory of diagnoses felony garabedian whom harry had labeled in hisadmission history a successful commodities trader was admitted to anisolation room throughout his hospitalization he would be tended to by hisown specialduty nurses the nightshift nurse was a private detective namedpaula underhill the day and evening shifts were being covered by maurawearing glasses and a brunette wig as garabedian would be on precautions bothnurses would be required to wear surgical masks and gowns of course antonperchek would be masked and gowned as well but both maura and santana feltthey would still be able to pick him out and paula underhill a wittybrooklynborn black belt in kenpo karate was more than willing to try felony having specialduty nurses also helpedsolve one of the thornier problems harry had tackled laboratory tests heordered blood work each day but none of it included rays whitebloodcellcount which would have been normal but with garabedian having his own nursesthe nurses on the floor would almost certainly follow his laboratory tests lessclosely if at all the trick had been to create a patient requiring aninsufferable amount of work and then to provide the regular staff with thesalvation of a private nurse harry did insert fabricated admission bloodcounts from his office to the inpatient chart and decided he could improviseand produce more lab work depending on what he was hearing from the staff hewas hearing nothing most of the other details were simple towork out at least in theory the intravenous line would be taped to raysskin and wrapped in gauze iv medications would be run into the gauze or intothe sink oral medications would be discarded immediately or squirreled awaybeneath rays tongue until they could be and of course percodan or demerolwould be ordered every three to four hours as needed for pain felony the final hurdle was rays absoluteinsistence on having his gun close at hand both the private detective who wascarrying a gun of her own and maura who was not agreed to help him concealthe weapon if needed felony felony felony harry finished his note by indicating thatgarabedians condition was improving slightly but that another ten to fourteendays of hospitalization were anticipated his goal was to fabricate as manycomplications as possible northeast life and casualty like most insurers inthe brave new medical world had a team of peer reviewers that checked therecords of hospitalized patients poised to terminate benefits if the databasesaid it was time for the diagnosis to be treated at home outside room was a steel cart with thegloves gowns and masks required for infectiousdisease isolation harryprepared himself and entered the room closing the door tightly behind himmaura was in a chair sketching in an artists pad ray was propped in bedwatching regis and kathie lee any problems harry asked he wants me to give him a bed bathmaura said hey i got one a couple of times a dayfrom the nurses the last time i was in hospital ray whined just because imnot sick is no reason i shouldnt get tender loving care no bed baths harry said but i willwrite orders for three enemas a day instead and to think i was embarrassed even toask for one i assume there havent been anysightings not even of a nurse its like they thinkthe plague is in here they do maura anything i can do foryou just find a way to have youknowwho makean appearance harry motioned to rays pillow no problem keeping that concealed not as long as my nurse here keepsvolunteering to do things so the people out there dont have to theyvealready thanked her so many times i wouldnt be surprised if they took up acollection for her any progress in the outside world the calls have slowed down but theyrestill coming in one lab tech from good samaritan swears our man was a baldingmedical resident from poland a nurse from university hospital is certain hesan orderly there only with dark hair and an earring he probably was both santana said ifwe could ever pinpoint what days he was spotted in those hospitals id betwed find a death or two in patients insured by the roundtable companies well if what were doing here doesntwork i promise ill help you put those posters back up by that time illhave nothing to lose true enough but if something goes wronghere and we get caught id be surprised if theyd even let you back in thishospital as a patient but hey amigo weve got our system downpat harry said with comic bravado what on earth could possibly go wrong all day ray santana had been having a moredifficult time than usual with pain primarily behind his eyes and in hisfingertips he had received a percodan at ten in the morning and required ashot of demerol five hours later finally fifteen minutes after the shot hedrifted off into a fitful sleep a powerful antibiotic ordered to treat hisheartvalve infection was dripping from a plastic iv bottle into the thickgauze bandage wrapped around his arm maura was washing her face in preparationfor her sixth eighthour shift in three days and her second one in a row shefelt tired but still keyed up their trap had been a long shot from the verybeginning but it hadnt collapsed around them yet santana was beginning to breathe moredeeply and regularly as maura settled down in her chair with the latest peoplenext to alcohol the magazine remained the most addictive thing she hadever found and like booze it was perfectly easy to keep away from as longas she didnt start the door to the room was nearly closed from out on thefloor she heard the footsteps and multiple conversations of a group of peopleapproaching then there was a mans voice the hospital has three rooms withthe reverse ventilation necessary for proper infectiousdisease isolation hewas saying the new wing will be connected through this floor and willprovide three more that will make this hospital number one in the city in theevent of an infectious epidemic maura her concentration split between themagazine and the lecture did not realize that santana was suddenly awake upon one elbow rubbing at his eyes maura he rasped can you see him can i see who the man dammit the man whos talking his eyes were wild from the drug hismouth cottondry but you say the cost per day ofthese rooms is now more than double a standard room a second voice was asking yes but compared with whats charged atmedical centers comparable to this one thats still a bargain now if youladies and gentlemen will follow me this way ill show you the latest in santana was sitting bolt upright now thepillow on his lap shielding his gun panicked maura threw her magazine asideand moved toward him ray perspiring profusely now was clumsily trying todisengage himself from the bedclothes and iv line at the same time open the door he demanded in a gravellywhisper open it now please tell me whats going on dammit maura hurry open the fuckingdoor santana was on his feet now stillshielding his pistol maura swung the door open about ten yards down the hallamidst the usual midday crowd of nurses patients and visitors a group of tenor eleven welldressed men and women were moving slowly away from them excuse me maura called out to themexcuse me please the speaker stopped and the group turnedin unison for several frozen seconds they stood there as santana peered outat them from beside his bed maura scanned the group too but at that distanceshe was unable to determine which of them if any was anton perchek you son of a bitch santana suddenlyyelled raising his gun you fucking son of a bitch instantly there was screaming and chaosin the hallway as the business people and perhaps a dozen others dove for coveror turned to run the iv line pulled away from the plasticbottle as santana bolted toward the door the portable pole on which it hungclattered to the floor he stumbled over it and lurched against maura knockingher to one knee and momentarily losing his balance at the same time you son of a bitch he hollered again the iv line dangling from beneath the bandageon his arm he braced himself against the doorway leveled his gun and firedthe length of the hallway the shot reverberated like a cannon blast everyonewho was still standing dove to the floor the screaming intensified scramblingto her feet behind santana maura saw the glass that was covering a largefloral print at the very far end of the hallway shatter from the bulletseveral feet to the right of the picture three of the businessmen jammedthrough the door to the stairway waving his gun wildly with his iv linesnapping like a whip santana sprinted barefoot after the men down a gauntletof screaming terrified visitors staff and patients call security someone shouted get him someone else yelled several men had gotten to their feet andwere running though with some caution after ray who had now reached theend of the corridor and exploded through the stairway door another gunshotechoed back through grey then another maura stripped off her gown and mask heronly thought was to get away before anyone remembered her and started askingher questions she was wearing a storebought nurses uniform and ashoulderlength wig while the action and attention were still fixed on the farend of the hallway she moved quickly in the opposite direction to thestairway past the elevators once on the stairs she raced down to the firstfloor then took a calming breath and stepped into the main corridor of thehospital she had gone less than ten feet when two uniformed security mencharged past her and up the stairs moments later two nypd officers one ofthem shouting into a radio ran past heading for the far end of the hospital the response to the crisis was rapid andwell coordinated maura felt certain that it would be only a few minutes beforeray santana was captured or worse she found herself hoping that before hewas taken or killed he at least got a clean shot at the doctor battling to maintain her composure shestrolled through the crowded front lobby there was a mounting electricity inthe air along with an urgent exodus through the main doors as word spread ofa crazed gunman loose in the hospital not another one she heard someone sayas she exited with the crush into bright lateafternoon sunlight it seemslike every time you turn around some wacko is shooting up a post office orhospital with police sirens blaring maura walkedaway from the medical center in less than a block half a dozen cruisers hadscreamed past her loudspeakers were blaring and a number of uniformedpolicemen were sprinting toward the street circumscribing the medical center she was two blocks from the hospital whenshe finally felt safe stopping to call harry she phoned the office first marytobin was there and harry had had no further patients and had left for homehalf an hour before he had told her he would be in the hospital at fivemaking evening rounds on his two inpatients mary theres been some trouble at thehospital maura said i cant explain right now but i suspect before toolong youll get some details if you turn on the news i think you ought toclose the office as soon as possible and go home mary was too wise and had been throughtoo much in the past weeks to ask for clarification whatever you say child she said thanks for understanding maura saidnow ive got to call harry oh by the way the max garabedian youll hearthem talking about on the news is ray santana who ray i mean walter concepcion well getback to you as soon as we can mary please go home get out of there now maura fished out another quarter andcalled the apartment the machine answered harry please its me maura she saidharry if youre listening please pick up harry she was about to hang up when he came onthe line maura hi sorry to make you do that imstill screening calls but listen weve had a break maybe a big one ill beheading into the hospital in just a few minutes to tell you and ray about it harry she said i dont think id dothat if i were you chapter by the time maura reached the apartmentnews bulletins of the crazed gunman at the manhattan medical center werealready blanketing the airways max j garabedian a fortyeightyearold stockbrokerhad quite suddenly charged from his hospital room wildly firing a gun down thehallway details were sketchy but as yet no injuries had been reported andgarabedian who was wearing blue pajamas and no shoes at the time remained atlarge furious at santana and as close to panicas maura had ever seen him harry paced from one end of the apartment to theother speaking as much to himself as to her i shouldnt have trusted him as soon ashe put those damn posters up i should have brushed him off like like ihope hes okay but right now i want to strangle him i absolutely want tostrangle him it must have been perchek out there to upset him so but whydidnt you spot him the police could show up here any minutemaura insurance fraud attempted murder who knows what else dickinsonwill have a field day with this one a jubilee what in the hell am isupposed to do now the fiasco at the hospital wasnt the onlyserious development harry had to deal with he had only a short time left inwhich to make a decision that would cost him twentyfive thousand dollars almost every bit of savings he had santanas meltdown had forced him into acorner the police were certain to arrive at the apartment before long if hewas going to accept the deal offered by a stranger on the phone he had to makepreparations and leave before they came please sit honey she said just for acouple of minutes sit and try to relax a little she turned back to channel the reportswere varying widely from station to station most of which were still rushingcrews over to the hospital but channel and one other station had alreadyannounced that garabedians physician was dr harry corbett still the chiefsuspect in the bizarre murder of his wife evelyn dellarosa who had also been apatient at mmc harry was concerned for what the real maxgarabedian was about to go through he had tried calling the school custodianat home but got no answer almost certainly the man was still at his jobalthough harry had no idea at which school maura tried calling the departmentof education but got no response there either only fourthirty and no ones there shesaid no wonder so many kids in this town cant read i dont know what to do harry said forperhaps the tenth time that guy is expecting me in new jersey at nine thebank closes in another hour and fifteen minutes he started pacing againweve got to start moving and moving fast the longer i wait the more likelyit is the people at the bank will have learned that im in the news again asit is im not sure how happy theyre going to be about forking overtwentyfive thousand in cash no matter what we decide ive got to go and getthat money now then i dont think we can come back here the call that had upped the ante bytwentyfive thousand dollars had come to the apartment around the same time raysantana was shooting up grey when harry arrived home from the office therewere two messages on his machine neither of them any more promising than theseveral dozen others they had logged over the past four days thinking thatthis call might be the changeofshift checkin from maura harry preempted themachine hello is this dr harry corbett the voice was a mans youngish tomiddleaged with an accent harry couldnt place with certainty possiblygerman or swiss it is harry said i am calling about the man in your posterand the fiftythousanddollar reward harry made a face and wished he had leftthe answering machine to do its job instead he opened the log notebook andwrote in the time of the call go ahead he said what hospital areyou with i am with no hospital the man said ilearned about the flyers and your reward from my employer and who is that the man in the poster his initials areap i will not speak his name over the phone but you may already know it harry stiffened at the mention of thedoctors initials and immediately wondered if the caller could be perchekhimself but the voice was just too different from the doctors harry trieddesperately to think of any reason why he should deny knowing who anton perchekwas would he be giving anything away who are you he finally said i handle security at his mansion and workas one of his bodyguards when he needs me to do so i am on a pay phone rightnow if you know ap at all you know that he would not hesitate to kill me onthe spot for making this call harry had opened the spiralbound notebookand was writing down as much of what the man was saying as possible go on he said i wish to meet with you tonight and tomake an exchange my information for your money how much money i do not intend to remain in this area oreven in this country after we meet the doctor and i have had some problemsbetween us i have reason to believe he intends to kill me i will settle forhalf of what you have offered twentyfive thousand in cash i dont have it then get it i will not negotiate anylower than that twentyfive thousand or no deal in exchange i will give youthe location of the doctors mansion and a recent photo of him taken withouthis knowledge i will also tell you what security he has at the mansion thereyou will find proof of his role in the death of your wife and other evidenceagainst him as well how you handle that evidence will be up to you but dr corbett i have no time for this ihave preparations of my own to make nine oclock tonight if you know thedoctor you know why i do not trust anyone you must do exactly as i say or wewill both lose out now here is what you are to do harrys bank was open until six thatnight he had a total of in his savings account plus another five thousandor so in checking he also had no personal connection whatsoever with anyone atthe bank cursing himself for not making more money and for not having takenthe hollinsmccue job and for not going into ophthalmology and for evertrusting ray santana harry took his savings and checkbooks and with mauraslipped out the rear basement door they hurried to his garage for the bmwstopped briefly at a newsstand and then drove to his bank with no idea howmuch space twentyfive thousand dollars would take up especially in bill sizesof one hundred dollars or less as the caller demanded harry had dumped out abriefcase and brought it along he entered the bank half an hour beforeclosing time it was a moderately large branch and was still servicing a linewaiting to see the six tellers twentyfive thousand was more cash than he hadever handled at one time was it conceivable the bank wouldnt have that muchon hand outside maura sat behind the wheel ofharrys bmw the driver of the getaway car the ground rules percheks securitychief had laid down were that harry was to bring the money to a landfill on thenew jersey side of the hudson not far from the city of fort lee he was tocome alone and to arrive at exactly nine pm the directions to the spot wereminutely detailed the landfill was a dump site at the end of a winding dirtand gravel road harry was to drive to the center of the clearing flash hislights four times and wait beside the driversside door the caller insistedon knowing the make and plate number of his car if any other vehicleapproached the landfill whether it had anything to do with harry or not themeeting would be off forever the money means a lot to me the callerhad said but not enough to die for how do i know this isnt a trap harrysaid what kind of trap to what end if myemployer wanted to kill you you would be dead it is that simple if you knowhim at all surely you know that you are much more important to him alivebesides he delights in inflicting pain the permanence and peace of death arehis enemy harry fought off an involuntary chill ill have a gun you would be foolish if you didnt i canassure you i will i want a chance to inspect what you havebefore i turn over the money you will have five minutes the young teller studied harryswithdrawal slip for fifteen seconds then she verified his balance and lookedthrough the plexiglas cage at him smiling how will you want this she said this was new york city harry remindedhimself not some boondocks village a twentyfivethousanddollar cashwithdrawal was everything to him but probably not so uncommon to any of thesepeople hundreds or less he said knowing thatthere was no sense trying for an air of nonchalance when she had his bankbalance on the screen right in front of her did you bring something to carry themoney in she asked or would you like one of our bags i have a briefcase he held it up for her to see herexpression made it clear that she knew he was not one of the doitallthetimepeople ill need to get authorization from mrkinchley she said she left her post and headed out frombehind the cages to the desks where the junior officers sat harry followed herwith his eyes and saw her approach a nattily dressed man in his late thirtieswith a sailors tan and a chiseled jaw come on harry thought just give methe goddamn money if the bank withdrawal fell through he had decided tocall his brother phil who lived in short hills about fortyfive minutes fromfort lee but if he had to go that route everything would become immeasurablymore complicated he risked a glance out the front windowmaura was parked directly across the street she was wearing dark glasses and awhite floppybrimmed hat which was bobbing animatedly probably to somethingon the radio the sight of her that way brought harry a smile in spite of thetenseness of his situation their relationship was being forged in theintense heat of the events that had drawn them together but in just a shorttime they had become friends in a way he and evie never had and thatfriendship in turn had given their lovemaking an openness and mutual caringthat had never existed in his marriage now reluctantly he was testing thatfriendship despite the mysterious callers quite credible story and his useof percheks initials neither harry nor maura was at all comfortable with whathe was being asked to do still as the caller had said they could think of noreason perchek would want to lure him into a trap it couldnt be for themoney surely twentyfive thousand dollars was nothing more than petty cash tothe man it seemed as if there was nothing he coulddo but follow the instructions to the letter and hope for the best but whenmaura noticed the phone evie had installed in the bmw she had the germ of anidea and soon after that they had a plan there were three elements essentialto their strategy and maura possessed them all another car a cellular phoneand the courage and willingness to put herself in harms way they had stoppedby a newsstand and bought a detailed street map of the area surrounding fortlee on it the landfill was nothing more than a blank spot near the river twoblocks square surrounded by suburban streets as soon as possible maura wouldpick up her car and her phone she would then drive someplace near the landfilland without being seen find her way to a spot where she could hide and watchthe field at eighttwenty after he had left the garage she would call himshe would check in once again after he had reached the new jersey side ifthere was no sign of a trap he could proceed to the landfill with moreconfidence if problems did develop she would have the phone to call for helpthey had a gun the one harry had taken from the killer in central park afterarguing for harry to keep it she finally agreed that it made more sense forher to have it sir im sorry for the delay harry spun around to the tellers cage andthen realized that the young woman was standing next to him oh yes no problem he held his breath and clenched his fiststo keep his hands from shaking it was already nearing rush hour if the bankcame through maura would still have a tough enough time getting across thegeorge washington bridge finding a place to leave her car and then locating aback way into the landfill if they had to deal with phil whether or not hecame through with the money it would be nearly impossible for her to get therein time if youll come with me sir mr kinchleywill have your money that would be fine he said smilingcalmly his pulse hammering in his ears kevin loomis sat alone in his basementoffice photographs of his family and his life with nancy spread out on hisdesk beneath a checklist he had drawn up every item on the list had been takencare of now the insurance policies were absolutely airtight as long as therewas no suspicion that his death was a suicide suicide would cost him wouldcost nancy two million of the three and a half million he had inforce to say nothing of five hundred thousand dollars in double indemnityaccidentaldeath benefits but he had worked out every movement every momentin the most exhaustive detail there would be no suspicion of suicide he had put careful thought into the guestlist he had drawn up for the barbecue dinner party they were giving thefollowing night the guests fourteen in all included the most respectedsuccessful influential and communityconscious people they knew their pastorand his wife nancys boss and his wife the lawyer who was head of the locallittle league association the president of the rotary club nancy thought it abit strange that kevin had chosen to invite only two of their more funlovingbeerdrinking friends but she accepted kevins explanation that he wanted tothank some people before the move to port chester in fact he wanted guests who would mosteffectively and eloquently vouch for his cheerfulness and his hospitality rightup until the moment of the accident as well as to the fact that he had had afew two of them would accompany him down to the basement the two he plannedto pick were men at whose homes he had done minor repair work in the past astore manager and the pastor they would be on the stairs their flashlightbeams fixed on the water gushing from the detached washing machine hose theywould attest to kevin having the skills necessary to take care of the emergencyand would report on his movements through the inchesdeep water on the concretefloor the moment kevins hand came down on the shorted wire of the dryer wouldremain forever fixed in their minds but what the hell they were friends whowould do anything for nancy and he was paying a far greater price the children were accounted for as wellnicky and julie were going to spend the night with friends brian would be withnancys parents it was strange to think that tomorrow afternoon when he sent themoff he would be looking at each of them for the last time they would have atough time of it but not nearly as tough as if their family became destituteand their father went to prison perhaps there really is anafterlife hethought now perhaps ill be able to look in on them every single day he stacked the photos up and reviewed eachone for a final time then he wrapped them with a rubber band and set them in adrawer the lists he tore up and threw in a plastic bag full of trash which hewould put in the barrels in the garage finally he went once more to thewasher and dryer to check on his handiwork the twine that ran from theloosened hose out the basement window was in place one pull and the hose wouldcome free cutting the twine off and discarding it would be his next to lastact on earth the last would be innocently setting his hand on the back of thedryer kevin knew that harry corbett suspectedwhat he was planning to do there was nothing subtle about the vietnam story hehad told that night in the car and in fact he had thought a great deal aboutwhat corbett was trying to tell him that his situation wasnt hopeless thatwas all well and good for corbett to say he didnt have three kids to providefor kevin had spoken with him several timessince then and had been careful to sound upbeat and positive he did notbelieve corbett intended to act on his concerns what was there for him to doanyway a little more than twentyfour hours and it would all be over kevin inspected the setup he had createdaround the washing machine and dryer the police would come over and file somesort of report but there was no way anyone could prove this wasnt anaccident absolutely none he sighed the relief of a man who had justcompleted a job and done it well tonight he would have a wonderful dinner withhis family and later on he would make love to nancy as he had never madelove before chapter the late summer heat wave that had beenblamed for brownouts accidents and deaths throughout the city had finallybroken the early evening temperature was in the midsixties with a decentbreeze and the threat of rain harry dropped maura at her car at exactly sixand then returned to the parkingspace condominium to await his eightfifteendeparture the bmws dashboard clock had been out of commission for years andneither he nor evie had ever bothered to get it fixed so he was using hiscasio to keep track of time he was nearing the garage when maura called tocheck in test her cellular phone and report that traffic from her apartmentto the bridge was only moderate her next call would be the one at eighttwentythat they had prearranged this is it harry she said youllsee by ten oclock tonight well be ready to go to the police theyll have tobelieve us this time just hang in there you hang in there and please becareful harry parked in his spot and walked out ofthe garage a police cruiser was moving slowly along half a block awayperhaps looking for him perhaps not thanks to ray santana there was nowabsolutely no place where he could safely go he returned to the bmw flippedon the radio again and waited wins the allnews station was stillbroadcasting updates every ten minutes or so on the bizarre developmentssurrounding the gunman at manhattan medical center the real max garabedian hadbeen taken into police custody questioned and released he had returned tohis rd street apartment and was refusing to speak to the press untiladvised to do so by his attorney in a prepared statement read by his lawyergarabedian denied knowing anything of the man admitted to manhattan medicalcenter under his name he denied having any relationship with harry other thanpatientphysician but called harry an intelligent dedicated doctor andexpressed his determination to hold off any judgment until the truth came out harry gave passing thought to trying tocall garabedian from his car phone but this was no time for him to be doinganything at all except sitting and waiting until eightfifteen there was more ray santana had not beencaught authorities were at a loss to explain how a gunman in pajamas with noshoes or socks could have made it out of the hospital with security police anddozens of nypd officers ringing the place the broadcaster clearly losing abattle with selfrestraint opined that this was new york after all maybe theoddly clad fugitive had simply stepped on to the streets of manhattan andblended in at seven oclock mmc publicrelationsdirector barbara hinkle held a news conference excerpted on wins the hospitalshe said was grateful no one had been hurt in the unfortunate incidenthospital officials would have nothing further to say until a preliminaryinvestigation into the nearcalamity was completed she did add that hospitalauthorities as yet had had no luck reaching dr harry corbett the physicianwho admitted the gunman to grey i am sure you all know she said thatdr corbett has been under a great strain lately as a result of the tragicdeath of his wife i have been told he has been under a physicians care forhis grief reaction as well as for some posttraumatic stress issues related tohis heroic service in vietnam posttraumatic stress hospital barbie speaks with forkedtongue harry said aloud clearly mmcs spin doctors had alreadymet and decided on their strategy for dealing with the collective disastersbrought down on their house by dr harry corbett posttraumatic stress harrywondered what name they would come up with if anyone ever demanded to know whohis shrink was we at the hospital are speculatingthat dr corbett borrowed the name of max garabedian in order to hospitalizesomeone he cared about who was very ill but without health insurance hinklewent on possibly a fellow vietnam veteran the plan backfired when hispatient went haywire nice harry said not bad and not that far off either he thought the rest of hinkles press conferenceadded nothing of substance except that nursing officials were looking into theidentities and backgrounds of the specialduty nurses brought into the hospitalby the gunman for forty minutes nothing new wasbroadcast then with just half an hour to go before harry was to leave one ofthe many mysteries connected with the case was reported solved an electriciandoing work on the heating system of the hospital had been found by amaintenance man bound and gagged in the subbasement he had been robbed atgunpoint by a man answering the fugitives description his clothes and shoeswere taken along with twentyfive dollars from his wallet the wallet was thenreturned to him police were checking it for fingerprints as well as thehospital room where the gunman was a patient for three days he was nervous and scared i think theelectrician said but he was decent enough to me he gave me back my walletbecause he said he knows what a hassle it is getting a new drivers license hedidnt hurt me but i think maybe he would have if i didnt do as he asked harry checked the time eightten outsidethe garage dusk was gradually yielding to night the lights of the city wereon he started the bmw and slowly ever so slowly rolled down the ramp to theexit finally at exactly eightfifteen he shut off the radio and pulled outon to the street the game was afoot harry drove past one block then anotherhe didnt feel all that nervous but his hands were white on the wheel heglanced at his watch it was twenty past where was she where was the callhe checked the time again okay he decided maybe its onlyeighteighteen moments later the phone buzzed he snatched up thereceiver yes he said harry im in a tree maura whisperedwith breathless excitement im up a fucking tree in the woods next to a dumpdo you believe it if i had known there was a man around like you who could getme to climb trees at garbage dumps at night in new jersey with a gun in myfanny pack i never would have bothered drinking well im in no place that exotic harrysaid whispering although there was no need to ninetysixth heading for theparkway is anyone there yet not a soul i found a great place toleave the car and a perfect place to hide and youre sure no one saw you positive are you being followed i cant tell yet it doesnt make any difference whetherthey do or not listen harry i think i see a car coming up the road illcall you again at ten to nine unless hes standing too close to this tree youre doing great maura are you warmenough i think its going to rain soon hey im fine i told you tonights thenight with one eye on the road ahead and one onthe rearview mirror harry swung on to the henry hudson parkway several carsbehind he caught sight of a dark sedan which he felt fairly certain had beenwith him from the beginning maura was right though it really didnt matterwhether the caller had someone tailing him or not he was going to follow instructionsto the letter maura was their ace in the hole by the time he had crossed the georgewashington bridge a misty rain had begun to fall harry found windshieldwipers annoying and had always postponed turning them on until he absolutelyhad to this time he switched them on at the first droplets if things cameunraveled tonight it wasnt going to be because he did something pigheaded orstupid once on the new jersey side of the riverhe consulted the directions after two miles he swung off the main road into adensely built workingclass neighborhood the streets were treelined and thesmall yards of the clapboard houses were strewn with balls big wheels andother trappings of new families the sedan followed several blocks behind itslights off harry felt certain he could see two people silhouetted inside heeasily located the corner where he had been instructed to stop and wait for oneminute he was pulling away when the phone buzzed maura was several minutesearly and harry knew as he was reaching for the receiver that there wastrouble yes harry stop right now she said in apanicdriven whisper this place is crawling with police a dozen of themmaybe more their cruisers are out of sight and you wouldnt know a thing waswrong but theyre here his blood suddenly ice harry glanced inthe mirror the sedan was still there about two or three blocks back heshifted into gear and began slowly rolling down the street go on he said harry your friend dickinsons here atone point he was about ten feet from this tree now hes strolling aroundchecking that everyones in place youre sure im sure hes working with somelieutenant who seems to be from the local police hes very excited about beinghere to nail you from what i could hear someone called and tipped off thepolice that you had demanded a meeting at this place that you have a body withyou and will pay twentyfive thousand dollars for this guy to get it athousand miles from here and bury it where it will never be dug up the mansaid you were crazy that you killed people for fun he wanted nothing to dowith you except have you in jail where you couldnt hurt him youve got toget out of here harry his mind whirling harry began slowly toaccelerate just stay out of sight until its safe togo home he said then go to my apartment ill be in touch he heard her telling him to be careful ashe set the receiver down then he glanced at the directions he had writtendown in one more block he would go left or straight instead of turning rightas instructed it would take the men in the sedan several seconds to realize hewas diverging from the plan three or four seconds at the most that was all hehad his best bet was to try and get back to the highway he sped up to aroundforty bury a body how could perchek ever expectsuch an outlandish story to get harry into trouble unless in the same instant harry understood whatwas happening he cut his lights swung a sharp left and hit the gas he madea sliding right then another left the siren was on behind him now and hecould see the blue strobe through the trees the streets baked to bonedry foralmost two weeks were slick with rain and oil he skidded into another turnon to a street that was a long straightaway to the main road the speedometerwas nearing eighty he had always been a laidback driver and rarely drove thisfast even on a turnpike a couple backing out of their drive to go to thestore a kid on her bicycle there were any number of possibilities fordisaster now undoubtedly the men in the unmarked cruiser had called forbackup as well he tried desperately to think thingsthrough the best he could do was to acknowledge that the situation wasabsolutely horrible he was racing around rainsoaked streets in a neighborhoodthat was completely foreign to him at night in a sevenyearold car almostcertainly with a body in the trunk one minute that was about all hehad left one minute before they caught up with him or the backups cut him off he was closing fast on a main roadassuming it was the one he had taken in it was a fourlaner with no dividerthe sedan was on the straightaway now no more than three blocks behind andgaining harry was about to brake so that he could turn into the northboundlane but at the last moment he saw a small gap in the traffic each way heslammed down the accelerator and barreled across all four lanes a tractortrailer was coming from each direction in a cacophony of air brakesscreeching tires and horns they both swerved skidding in a ponderousgrotesque pas de deux the cruiser had no choice but to stop and back away fromthe potentially deadly dance there was a street directly across from the oneharry had come up he shot down it slowing a bit he glanced behind him justas one of the trailers in excruciating slow motion toppled on to its side in the distance he could hear sirens many of them he swung into a side street and then halfway up the driveway ofa darkened house the sirens were getting louder he stepped quietly out of thecar expecting at any moment to have all the lights in the house go on at onceor else to be attacked by a rottweiler he glanced about he had no idea at allwhere he was except that the river was somewhere in the direction the housewas facing just past the garage he could see woods beyond the backyard tothe west with luck he could make it there then he would have to see hesnapped open the briefcase and stuffed what he thought was about seven thousanddollars into his pockets he was wearing slacks and dress shoes the perfectoutfit for impressing the people at the bank but not much good for runningfrom the police unfortunately at this moment he would have to make do he took the key and inserted it in thetrunk part of him wanted just to leave it closed and run he dreadedconfronting this part of the nightmare perchek had conjured up for him laterwherever he was he could find out from the news bulletins what was inside asiren sounded from close by and moments later a squad car raced down thestreet its strobes flashing harry threw himself into the shadows the net wasclosing he had little time left he turned the key hesitated again and thenthrew the trunk open hot air heavy with the stench of bloodand death immediately wafted up into his face below him crammed into thesmallish trunk lay caspar sidonis his perfect face was waxen his hair mattedwith blood from entry and exit bullet holes just above his ears bile washed up into harrys throat hehesitated actually trying to think of something he should be doing thenswallowing back the burning acid he quietly lowered the trunk poor bastard he whispered a second cruiser this one with no lightsor siren made its way past checking every house and driveway on the otherside of the street with a spotlight harry again ducked into the shadows hisside of the street would be next with a final glance at the trunk he movedquickly into the backyard and scaled a fivefoot chainlink fence as he leaptto the ground he experienced a breathcatching pain in his chest explodingfrom just beneath his sternum up into his jaws and ears he stumbled then fellto the rainsoaked mossy ground instantly he was drenched both from therain and from his own sudden perspiration the sirens seemed to be all around himnow he crawled deeper into the woods and then pulled himself upright on thetrunk of a tree the pain was leveling off he battled back a wave of nauseawithout getting sick then he closed his eyes and took several calming breathsgiving up was a very real possibility surely someone would believe he had beenset up mel wetstone had worked near miracles already perhaps he could pullthis one off as well no the thought of being taken prisonerof jail of albert dickinson was more than he could stand from a hundred yards behind him he couldhear voices they had found the car the pain was much less now almost gonewith the jungle survival training he had had in vietnam and several thousanddollars in cash at least he had a slim chance of escaping he stuffed themoney deeper in his pockets and pushed off from the tree then keeping low andmoving as quietly as possible he began an awkward jog through the dense woods chapter high hills in elegant short hills newjersey was an expansive fifteenroom colonial with a coach house and pool onthree rolling acres built and christened by a liquor baron in it hadkept its name through four subsequent masters phil corbett the latest in theline had been living in the estate with his family for almost three years hedisliked the pretentiousness of house names and was constantly threatening toreplace the high hill placard on the fieldstone stele at the base of thedriveway with one reading high upkeep when the phone began ringing at tenthirtyon the night of august phil was eight hundred dollars up and studying apossible royal flush the onceamonth sixman game rotated from house tohouse but the participants enjoyed playing at high hill the most shortlyafter moving in phil had converted the music room into a soundproofwalnutpaneled wild west card room complete with honkytonk background musicsawdust on the floor an overhead fan cuban cheroots and brass spittoonsstakes in the game were high enough to make it interesting but there wasntone of the players who couldnt comfortably absorb a fivethousanddollar ding earlier in the evening several of the menhad mentioned the latest news blitz involving phils older brother two of themmatt mccann and ziggy white both millionaires who had never finished collegehad grown up with phil in montclair and had known harry fairly well talk about your bigtime comedown mattsaid remember how we all used to idolize harry he was the scholar who

someones out to get him thats what he tells me and thatswhat i believe i hope youre right ziggy said ialways liked harry a lot but you know even dillinger had a brother hes not dillinger ziggy the ringing persisted five six seventimes phils agreement with gail was that if she was in the house on pokernight she would answer all phone calls but tonight she had gone to themovies with friends phil studied his ten jack queen king of diamonds andthen glared over at the phone trying to will it to cease finally he slappedhis cards down you gentlemenll have to wait a minutefor me to take your money he said rising but id advise you all to foldim working on a straight flush yeah sure someone muttered hello phil its me are you alone phil had no trouble picking up the urgencyin his brothers voice ah no no im not change phones please phil put the call on hold i was lying about the straight flush hesaid burying his cards at the bottom of the deck you guys play on without mefor a while in twenty minutes phil was back his faceheavy with concern theres been some problems with mybrother he said im afraid were going to have to call it a night anything we can do white asked actually there is id like it if youand matt could stay behind the rest of you just head home as quickly aspossible well settle up tomorrow and if any of you want to feel free to saya prayer for harry hes in it pretty deep right now and hes going to need allthe help he can get phil you be careful now one of theother three men said no one wants to believe somebody in their family couldget into bigtime trouble but it happens i know stan thanks id like you toforget i got that call just now but in the end thats up to you the three men exchanged concerned glancesthen without further question they hurried for their cars ziggy white andmatt mccann remained behind a few moments after the last car had left apolice cruiser lights flashing came up the drive matt im going to need you to stay andwatch the kids until gail gets home phil said maybe around eleventhirtyziggy im going to speak with these guys then i have to get out of herewithout being followed any ideas during their school years white had beena daredevil among daredevils always diving in from the highest rock orshoplifting some unneeded item from the most theftconscious store he had goneon to make a small fortune as an options trader now he mulled over theproblem for just a few seconds no sweat he said excitedly mattllhide while the cops are here you make it clear your wife is out and yourebabysitting ill walk them out and have a chat with them by the squad carmeanwhile you slip out the back take a flashlight but only use it whenyoure certain its safe go through your backyard and then across that littlebrook you have back there if

griffins driveway theyre in england until after labor day you knowwhere that is right okay you can drop me off someplace near my house andkeep the car as long as you need it harry knelt in the dense undergrowth justbeyond the soft shoulder of a rural twolane road the night wasnt thatchilly but he was soaked through and shivering thank god phil had been homethank god he hadnt hesitated in agreeing to help now if he would only showup accessory to murder was nothing he wanted to expose his brother to butuntil he found anton perchek and a way to bring him down staying free was theonly realistic chance he had the biggest problem since he didnt knowexactly where he was calling phil from and phil didnt know the fort lee areawell at all was finding a way to meet up it was finally left to harry tochoose the right person to bribe into driving him to a spot they both knew alittletraveled roadway that swung past a power substation not far from theirchildhood home in montclair it was the place where harry first took hisyounger brother to introduce him to beer and cigarettes only to find that philwas already well acquainted with both the lucky man harry selected was amotorcyclist on a harley chopper harry watched from the woods beside a servicestation as the biker lumbered into the restroom and called him over as soon ashe came out the man was well tattooed and grizzly bear huge as unlikely tobe frightened off by harry as he was to be tight with the police the fare forthe halfhour ride was agreed upon in seconds a thousand dollars over hisyears in medicine harry had seen the ravages of bike accidents often enough tohave developed a healthy fear of ever riding on what the er docs cynicallyreferred to as donorcycles but the biker whose name was claude was worththe risk harry donned the spare panzer division helmet hunched as low as theraised passenger seat would allow clenched his teeth and wrapped his armsaround the bear hey if youre gonna get that friendly iwant another hundred the biker said laughing you dont speed and i wont get freshharry replied within the first mile or two they hadpassed four police cars heading in the opposite direction you must be some hot stuff claudecalled over his shoulder parking tickets harry yelled back during the half hour harry had beencrouched in the bushes by the substation six cars had passed one of them amontclair police cruiser now as he wiped a muddy hand across his forehead hewondered what his next move should be if there was any workable optionavailable to him any at all his mind hadnt settled on it yet on the plusside he had miraculously made it through the trap perchek had set for him infort lee still by the time the fortyminute ride was over harrys teeth werechattering mercilessly he tipped the biker with a hundreddollar bill ascasually as if it were a one and accepted a deathshead pin in return now asthe fear that he and phil had somehow miscommunicated took hold he wished hehad kept claude around there were bends in the road about fiftyyards in either direction from where harry was concealed the headlights ofapproaching cars reflected off the trees several seconds before they actuallycame into sight each time as soon as he heard the engine noises or saw thereflected light he flattened down in the shallow swale beside the road andeach time he got a bit filthier and if possible a bit more sodden through the darkness and the persistentdrizzle he heard engine noise to his left moments later reflected lightshimmered high off the trees a truck he thought burrowing back undercover what it was instead was a mobile home as large as a bus moving alongslowly followed closely by a car harry froze as the twovehicle caravanslowed even more and then stopped not ten feet away both drivers cut theirengines and killed their headlights immediately heavy darkness settled inagain the interior light on the massive rv flashed on and off as the dooropened and closed for several seconds there was dense silence then philcalled out harry you out there before he could even reply harry had towork the immense tension from his muscles and his jaw he worried in passingabout the second car but at this point he had to trust that phil knew what hewas doing right here bro he said he pushed himself to his feet and made anineffectual stab at brushing some mud off phil met him at the front of the rvwhich harry could see now was a winnebago you okay soaked scared to death is that the sameas okay well believe it or not i have a warmupsuit inside thatll fit you whos in the car its ziggy white remember him the one who used to bet people he coulddrive a mile blindfolded i didnt want him to come with me but heinsisted he cant get enough of living on the edge youd think being anoptions trader would do it besides he says hell never forget that you oncekept bumpy giannetti from beating the snot out of him thank ziggy for me harry said as philhelped him up the step but tell him that if thats really the case iprobably just showed up at the right moment and presented bumpy with a punchingbag less likely to hit back the interior of the winnebago was as grandas any hotel harry had ever stayed in this is incredible he said strippingoff his shirt is this yours for the time being its yours theluxor thirtyseven feet of everything you could ever ask for in a motor hometwo tvs with a dish on the roof fax phone bar ice maker stereo systemwasherdryer driver and passenger airbags cherrywood cabinets youtold me you needed a car but i got to thinking that you also needed a

pockets you neglected to mention theallimportant microwave he said just dont do them all at once philtossed over the black nike warmup suit i dont think i could stand thethought of all that cash vaporizing in my rv the fridge is pretty well stockedand there are some clothes in the closet that i think will fit you just becareful and dont stay in one place too long is there anything else you need harry thought for a moment then took apen and paper from the small mahogany writing desk and dashed off a note tomaura the doorman at my coop will take this upto her he said then i want you to back off and keep out of this youvedone way more than enough phil slipped the letter into his pocket weve had a funny life harry he saidi wont deny that over the years especially after you won those

me feel i had totop you what difference does it make anyhow its not a contest it never hasbeen its our lives youre my only brother harry i dont want to lose you harry stared at his brother through thedim light it was the first time he had ever heard phil talk this way heleaned against the soft leather headrest of the passenger seat remember that day in front of my officewhen you told me not to

brothers stood insilence by the door then for the first time since the death of their fatherthey embraced rocky martino the night doorman atharrys apartment building had more than enough reason for having an extra nipor two it had been the longest most stressful night of his life in the spaceof just a few hours half of manhattan seemed to have descended on himeveryone looking for harry corbett the manhattan police the new jerseypolice even the fbi something about moving a body across state lines crewsfrom several tv stations and some radio people as well had come by and spokenwith him but all he could tell any of them was that he had no idea when harrycorbett had left the building or when he would be back the one thing that he did not tell any ofthe news people but he did tell the police was that maura hughes had comeback to the apartment at tenthirty and was still there two officers had goneup and spoken to her for over an hour early on rocky knew that he was in overhis head and had the presence of mind to call down shirley bowditch thepresident of the coop association she had handled everything now at lasthe was alone he went to the maintenance closet just behind the door to thecellar on the bottom shelf in the base of a locked tool box was his supplyof nips he selected an ounce of absolut and downed it in a single gulp theraspy burning brought warm familiar tears to his eyes when he returned to thelobby a tall broadshouldered man in a sports coat was tapping on the glassholding up a police badge rocky buzzed him in the huge man introduced himselfand the branch he was with but whatever he said didnt register rocky toldhim his name we need your help the policeman saidhow long are you going to be on duty noon rocky said i work midnight untilnoon armand rojas the other doorman and i decid good good rocky now listen up theresa woman up in harry corbetts apartment her name is maura hughes so if she goes by cab to meet up with himwe want to be driving her he guided rocky to the street and pointed at a cabparked half a block away when you want a cab for her just point at that onewell do the rest ookay rocky said intimidated by themans size and brusqueness the giant fished out a bill from hiswallet and handed it over it was fifty do this right rocky and not a word toanyone and therell be another one of these in it for you rocky took the bill and watched until thepoliceman had disappeared from sight then he headed back to the tool kit hewould do what the man asked because he was frightened of what would happen ifhe didnt and because he wanted the other fifty the guy who had gone upstairsan hour before with an envelope for maura had only given him twenty hepolished off another vodka he liked harry corbett and was sorry he was insuch trouble but hell it wasnt rocky martinos fault he returned to the lobby it was almostfive in the morning he had new money in his pocket and a glow in his gut aswarm as sunrise outside half a block away the cab stood waiting he lickedhis lips and thought about the sudden windfall soon to be increased by anotherfifty bucks no one could criticize him for cooperating with the police no oneat all chapter four oclock five fivethirty the phone in harrys apartment continued ringing almost incessantly thebizarre events surrounding the gunman at manhattan medical center followed bythe executionstyle slaying of caspar sidonis had thrust him into the centerof the media spotlight maura sat alone in the den watching the story evolveon local and national tv as she used the answering machine to screen calls thesimpson and tonya harding cases had dominated the airwaves more but not bythat much stations were breaking for updates every five or ten minutes andone was rehashing the events continuously footage of sidoniss life and manyaccomplishments was beginning to appear maura was emotionally and physicallyexhausted but she was far too keyed up and worried about harry to sleeptucked between the pillows of the sofa was the note that a man named white haddelivered just a few hours before maura im okay meet me at amright in front of the place where we first met with walter if i dont show uptry again in three hours i will do the same take several different cabs thenthe subway then walk be careful you will probably be followed love harry white would say nothing to her except thatharry was unharmed and safe an hour later albert dickinson had come up to seeher guns drawn he and another policeman had searched the apartment despitethe other officer dickinson was as abrasive and disrespectful as he had beenin the hospital he had no patience for hearing any stories from her aboutharry corbetts innocence anton perchek or anyone else all he wanted to knowwas where he could find his man miss hughes do you know the penalties inthis state for aiding and abetting a fugitive wanted for murder he asked ifyou know where corbett is and you dont tell us i promise that you will spendmost of the rest of life in prison i cant imagine a prison that could beany more unpleasant than this conversation maura said smiling sweetly being a wiseass must be generic impleased to tell you we just gave that detectives job away to someone who wasmore of a team player and less of a wiseass than your yalie brother lieutenant if youre going to smokeyoull have to do it outside maura pointed to the sixthstory windowrather than the door for a frozen moment she thought dickinson was going tostrike her finally with a fuck you he stormed out she triplelockedthe door behind him actually managing a smile at the new definition of policelock now she sat back and watched reruns ofthe interviews with mmc officials nurses police the electrician victimizedby the gunman and max garabedian the only news was the old news that thebogus garabedian had been neither apprehended nor identified but thatfingerprints lifted from the hospital room were being analyzed go ray she silently cheered she was pleased that at no time during thedifficult stressful night had she felt the urge to drink but she also knewthat she needed to sleep she set the alarm for turned off the ringer onall the phones in the apartment and positioned the answering machine not farfrom her head if harry did call with a change of plans she at least wanted achance to hear his message finally she picked up one of the phones you guys get some rest she said thenshe slammed the receiver back down at eight am a message from the producerof inside edition worked its way into her consciousness he waspromising harry enough money to hire a firstclass defense team in exchange foran exclusive on his story she showered made some coffee and glanced out thewindow cloudy but no rain ccs cellar wasnt all that far from the coopbut she wanted to allow an hour to get there she would take a cab across townand down to somewhere near the un then she would cut back by foot to a subwaystation then another cab and perhaps a trip through a store with multipleexits and finally a third cab to within a block or two of the club it seemedto her that in a place as crowded as manhattan with subways and so many storesto duck into it shouldnt be that hard to ensure that she wasnt beingfollowed she dressed in jeans sneakers and aplaid buttondown shirt and then selected a deep cloth bag from a collectionof them in evies closet she dropped in her wallet the dark wig she had wornin the hospital and a white shirt in case she needed to change her look thenjust in case she threw in a shirt jeans and sneakers for harry it wasdoubtful he was going to be returning to the apartment in any hurry therevolver she kept strapped in front of her in her leather fanny pack thesecurity of having it at hand felt greater than the fear of being arrested forcarrying an unlicensed handgun she took the stairs down six flightsstartling rocky martino when she came through the stairway door behind him hebolted to his feet and stepped back but not before maura caught a strong whiffof alcohol his eyes were bloodshot and his hands slightly tremulous but hemade a laudable stab at decorum miss hughes you gave me a bit of afright he said moistening his lips with his tongue what can i do for you maura wondered how many times she had doneas ineffectual job at covering up her intoxication as rocky was doing all thewhile thinking as he probably was that she was pulling it off could you please call me a cab shesaid fumbling through the bag for her wallet yes maam martino said no problemany word from dr corbett no rocky nothing well my fingers are crossed that hesokay he stepped back from the desk withexaggerated broadbased steps he shuffled outside and waved up the streetmoments later a cab pulled up maura handed rocky a one hesitated and thengave him a five as well take a break and have breakfast on merocky she said he jammed the bills in his pants oh i will maam i will something about his smile made maura feeluneasy she hurried past him into the cab the un she ordered immediately lookingbehind them as they pulled away ill tell you how i want you to go dontworry if its not the most direct way ill pay the cabby nodded if there was someone following them theywere damn good within a block maura was convinced that the street behind themwas clear it was possible that someone was driving in front of them with aradio but she could take care of that soon enough they passed a newsstandshe could see harrys photo on every front page hey read all about itdoctor death strikes again there was nothing the least bit witty orromantic or adventurous about any of this anymore for a time last nightperched in that tree by the landfill thinking everything was about to work outfor them she had felt like grace kelly in to catch a thief or audreyhepburn in charade this morning she felt deflated exhausted andfrightened she tried to imagine how harry had felt when he lifted up the trunkof his car they were on broadway now heading southshe counted off three more blocks turn right here she ordered the cabcontinued going straight she rapped on the plexiglas shield hey i saidturn right here the cab made a sharp left heading for thepark halfway down the block it began to slow maura stopped pounding on theplexiglas desperately she tried to figure out what was happening she thoughtabout the gun in the pack strapped around her waist but she sensed that whatshe needed was just to get the hell out of this cab she reached for the doorjust as the electronic locks snapped open the cab was still rolling suddenlyher door was snatched open a man jumped in almost on top of her he was agiant perhaps sixsix and broad across the shoulders he shoved her asidewith one hand as if she were a doll her head struck the window just behind herhealed incision without a word of instruction the driver accelerated cuttingback west toward the hudson maura recognized the behemoth immediatelyhe was percheks thug the survivor from the pack snarling she leapt at himpounding at his face with her right hand as she tried to unzip the fanny packwith her left her first blow with her fist caught him on the bone just abovehis eye he cried out pawing at it with one hand lashing out at her with theother she ducked under his first blow and felt her hand inside the pack closeon the grip of the revolver in one motion she pulled it out jammed themuzzle into his ribs and fired nothing happened absolutely nothing theone chance she might have had was gone the killer snatched the gun away andslapped her viciously across the face her lip split and tore against herteeth her head snapped back against the window then she pitched faceforwardalmost on to his lap safety safety he teased his voicesurprisingly highpitched we mustnt try to shoot our little gun until werelease the safety he grabbed her by the neck and pulled herupright she spit at him spattering his shirt and face with blood he wipedoff his cheek with the back of his hand slowly furiously and then he hit heragain as forcefully as the first time now she was limp he pushed her downto her knees and roughly pressed her face on to the seat were looking for your pal corbett hesaid i dont know maura managed her facewas throbbing and his grip on her neck was hurting as well but she wasdetermined not to give him the pleasure of making her cry i dont know wherehe is or even if hes alive the killer pulled harrys shirt out of herbag he jerked her face up to show her sure you dont he said even if i did know where he was idnever tell you he pressed her face back into the seat the doctor will be pleased to hear thathe said the most soughtafter fugitive in new yorkcarefully maneuvered the huge winnebago luxor through the streets of manhattantrying not to attract any unnecessary attention he was sticking as much aspossible to the broad northsouth avenues terrified of turning on to acrosstown street that was narrowed with trucks or construction spending mostof his life in the city where his car often remained in the parking garage forweeks at a time his driving was rusty backing up the bmw often presented achallenge backing the motor home out of a narrow city street lined on bothsides with cars would be potential disaster his picture was all over theplace a fender bender a cop an arrest it would probably be that simple it was ten minutes of ten harry waseasing his way down columbus avenue trying to time it so that he turned on tofiftysixth at exactly ten once he had maura they could get out of the cityand find a place to stop and sort things out there were those who knew or atleast believed he was innocent maura tom hughes mary tobin kevinloomis steve josephson doug atwater julia ransome phil gail harry glanceddown at the consolemounted clipboard and the pad on which he was writing downthe names and added ray santana to the list he had a number of friends workassociates and even patients who would be hardpressed ever to believe he wascapable of any crime let alone murder but the question was who amongthem would be willing to take chances for him together he and maura would be able tofigure out something especially if they were somehow able to locate raysantana had contributed mightily to the mess he was in but he certainly hadntcaused it now if he could be brought together with loomis a breakthrough wasquite possible if first harry had to reconnect with maura then he hadto do what he could to ensure that kevin loomis stayed alive and finally hehad to find santana and do it all while keeping himself out of jail firstthings first he thought recalling one of the blue and gold banners he hadseen on the wall of the aa meeting first things first he turned on to fiftysixth streetgratefully there were no delivery trucks road crews or double parkers butthere was also no maura the front of ccs was deserted and the place lookedto be locked up harry slowed and considered stopping to check the door but aninsistent horn from behind saved him the trouble of making a decision he droveup amsterdam for a few blocks then swung over to columbus and made anotherpass nothing he tried calling her apartment and his but got answeringmachines in both places there was no answer at ccs finally he paged phil hey harry phil said good to hearfrom you i think i caught some little item about you on the news orsomeplace very funny how are gail and the kidsholding up lets just say were all having to defendthe family name a bit howre you doing thanks to you im still on the loosephil that note i gave you set up a meeting with maura but so far she hasntshowed are you sure it was delivered positive i spoke to ziggy this morninghe put it in her hand personally at about three am shit anything i can do not for now youve done more than enoughalready phil thanks ill be in touch just take good care of my baby thereive been promising gail a weekend away in her now that youve gotten firstdibs im going to have to deliver harry cruised around his loop for almostan hour careful to widen or shorten it each time no maura something wasdefinitely wrong he got kevin loomiss home phone number from information andtried him there daddy was at the store getting ice for a party a childinformed him mommy was in the bathroom harry said hed call back in an hour it was nearly eleven almost two hoursbefore the second scheduled try at connecting outside ccs harry would bethere but he felt almost certain that maura would not perchek dickinsonbooze of the three only a fall off the wagon seemed unlikely he checkedthe gas gauge and the rest of the jet plane dashboard panel no problems sofar he headed downtown the only option he had it seemed was totry and find ray santana he had no desire to put mary tobin at risk but hereally had no choice besides he thought smiling in any match between theauthorities and mary his sympathies would have to go out to the cops hereached her at home as he expected she was anxious to do whatever she couldto help him and had an enormous extended family who were willing to help out aswell my soninlaw darryl is the only onewho has badmouthed you she said hell be back home just as soon as theyfinish the x rays and the stitches an thats just from my daughter hellstill have to deal with me it took almost fortyfive minutes for herto get walter concepcions address and number and make it back home as soon asshe entered the office the two policemen who were staking out the place hadbarged in and questioned her were going to get him one of them hadsaid just dont you be helping him when we do ive got twentyone grandchildren andseven greatgrandchildren young man mary replied im sure youll be a bighit with your family and fellow officers when you haul me off to jail at precisely noon she called harry withconcepcions number and address and a report of her conversation with policehe called immediately and got no answer then when he was a block away fromthe rooming house he tried again this time santana picked up three minuteslater he loped out of the house and jumped into the passenger seat harry knewthe moment he saw the man that his anger had gone he was merely grateful thatwhere there had been one now there were two he swung on to the harlem riverdrive heading north now this is my idea of a getaway carsantana said ray was well past needing a shave and looked as wasted and hyperas harry had ever seen him its a loaner from my brother im gladyou got away are you all right you dont look so hot just the usual only more of it thanusual i screwed up at the hospital im really sorry was it perchek you saw no not perchek it was garvey harrysean garvey the bastard who served me up to perchek i was lying there halfasleep when i heard his voice outside the door its been seven years but iknew in two seconds that it was him our eyes met and he recognized me tooim certain of it he was with a bunch of people in suits hes lightened hishair and had some sort of stuff done to his face but it was him by the time ireached the doorway of my room he was pulling away from me i lost my cooland fired at him the rest i guess you know do you have any idea who garvey is nowwhat he might be doing at a hospital in new york none after nogales he disappearedalmost into thin air he either had some powerful friends in high places or hehad the goods on them i pulled every string i could to find him nothing norecords he ever worked for the government no social security number no taxreturns nothing witness relocation times fifty i called in ever marker icould think of around the agency and the cia zip you have coffee in here harry motioned the thermos santana pouredhimself a cup and then flipped on the nineinch television bolted on a swivelatop the passengerside dash the reporter was updating developments in thedual manhunt for dr harry corbett and a man tentatively identified as raymondsantana a former dea undercover agent whose fingerprints were among thosetaken from grey so much for the element of surprise raysaid it was only a matter of time you think mauras in trouble i know she is listen im goingto head back to the club soon the note i sent her said wed try again at oneif either of us didnt show up that body in your trunk sounds like perchekswork do you suppose hes got her harry shook his head i dont want tothink about it first this roundtable then perchek andnow goddamn sean garvey to boot this is really the mother lode harry where do you think we should start ray santana eyes narrowed was peering at thescreen from just a few inches away douglas atwater vice president ofmanhattan health you know him harry i know him well hes one of my fewenduring supporters at the hospital hes on this station live right nowissuing a plea for you to give yourself up before anyone gets hurt so well santana said your enduringsupporter at the hospital is also the man i tried to kill yesterday garvey in the flesh chapter it made no sense for them to remain in thecity and there were a number of good reasons not to with harry driving he andsantana left manhattan and headed north on route toward the newyorkconnecticut border their mood was grim maura had not shown up at ccsat one and it seemed fairly certain now that perchek not the police had her you know harry said the more i thinkabout atwater the stupider i feel what do you mean santana his feet up on the dash hadturned off the tv he was gazing out the side window at an approaching bank ofstorm clouds getting an iv into evie and injecting herwith aramine took some planning harry explained whoever did it had to knowthat she was coming into the hospital that day and i didnt know myself untiltwentyfour hours before doug was one of the few people besides me who wasaware that her admission date had changed when did he start working for yourhospital he doesnt work for the hospital exactlyhe works for the managed care outfit that has a contract with the hospital managed care thats very creepy sounding ifyou ask me its a far cry from some ol doc ridingup in his buggy with his black bag ill tell you that much anyhow dougsbeen around for about five or six years i think sounds right someone high up in theagency did a hell of a job making him disappear a new life a new face andno records that he ever existed garvey probably brought his pal anton up tonew york as soon as he was settled in his new position with the managed carecompany there must be a hell of a lot of money in this roundtable businessfor perchek not to go back to his old globehopping ways maybe the doctor just wanted to settledown sure thats it hes in semiretirementjust five or six killings a week well what do we do now ive been thinking that maybe we shouldgive ol garves a call santana said things are unraveling for him justabout as fast as theyre unraveling for us garvey knows im around now anduntil im not around he wont ever be able to stop looking over hisshoulder that shot i fired in the hospital may have missed but it did send aclear message that im not in a negotiating frame of mind also he mustrealize that you know about the roundtable why else would you have set me upin the hospital but we have no proof of anything or wewould have gone to the police they must know that too i agree that gives them a chance to stayin business but only if youre in jail or dead and im successfully bought offor dead what about maura santana shook his head his expressiongrave assuming they have her shes abargaining chip so long as were around and a loose end as soon as were not let me call him harry said angrily iwant to thank him for being such a devoted friend all these years just be cool he pulled into a rest area and dialedatwaters office at mmc whom should i say is calling pleaseatwaters secretary asked harry hesitated for a moment then saidits dr mingus dr charles mingus mingus one of harrys idols wasacknowledged by many including atwater to be the greatest jazz bass playerever he had been dead for fifteen or twenty years it took just a few secondsfor atwater to come on the line harry is that you he said hi doug okay to talk absolutely

nine oclock harry hung up bravo bravo santana said applaudingthat was one hell of a performance harrys eyes were flint it was even better than you think hesaid i know exactly where she is it was raining steadily when they crossedthe tappan zee bridge heading for new jersey the digital clock on thewinnebago dashboard read pm a small digital calendar mounted right nextto it read august august corbett curse minus one harry concentrated on the road ahead assantana prepared himself harry knew he might drop dead on september st ashad his grandfather at seventy and his father to all intents at sixty butthe chances of his being killed tonight were far far greater still santanawas a professional harry had been under fire before in his life and they werenot going after maura unprepared before crossing the bridge they had leftthe highway and searched until they found an armynavy store ray spent halfan hour inside and emerged with a rifle two knapsacks full of equipment and areceipt for the stock in the place was limited but the bigticketitems the rifle telescopic sight and binoculars he pronounced asadequate did you really kill a guy in the war likethe papers said santana asked inspecting the rifle as they pulled away its nothing im proud of thats okay killing a person issomething that once youve done it you know you can do it thats all thatmatters to me im filled with hate ray it wouldnt bethat hard for me to kill either of them one less thing for me to worry about harry had never been inside doug atwatershouse but he had seen it from the water and from the land three years beforeharry had rented a yacht for a surprise party for evies birthday the boat washuge large enough to hold the combo from the club and about forty guestswith room to spare it was chartered for a circumnavigation of manhattanisland and was by far the most extravagant thing harry had ever done buttheir marriage was already crumbling over his conservative lifestyle and hewas desperate to make a statement that evening was the last time he couldremember evie seeming truly happy atwater had shown up for the affair withhis usual gorgeous blonde du jour an actress of some sort harryrecalled sandi patti she and harry were standing alone by the rail atdusk watching the palisades of new jersey glide by when suddenly she begangesturing wildly at a spectacular modern house built on the very brink of oneof them thats dougies she exclaimed thatsdougies house see that deck we had mimosas out there this morning youwouldnt believe the view have you ever been there in fact until that moment harry had knownonly that atwater lived in an elegant penthouse on east fortyninth streetthey had met there several times when he and evie had gone out with atwater andhis date curious about the house he glanced back across at the new york sideof the river and fixed a couple of landmarks in his mind later in the eveningthe captain used his navigational charts to pinpoint the spot exactly it wasnot very far from fort lee harry had considered mentioning the house toatwater but now he felt certain that he never had he and atwater werefriendly but obviously not that close because harry had never been invitedover a month or two later after visiting hismother in the nursing home harry had found himself just a few miles from wherehe thought the house to be it was surprisingly easy to find a sprawlingcaliforniastyle mansion at the crest of a rising treelined driveway at leasta hundred yards long the massive wroughtiron gate at the end of the drive wasclosed a sixfoothigh fieldstoneincement wall stretched along the roadwayin both directions giving the impression that the entire property wasenclosed he did not consider dropping in but tonight he and santana would pay acall pull off at the next rest area santanasaid you need to get ready and i need to check this sight out despite his gaunt physical appearance andnervous tics ray had always seemed somewhat cocky and selfassured butfollowing harrys conversation with sean garvey he had become withdrawn andsubdued the tic at the corner of his mouth had diminished until it was just afaint suggestion and his hands were rock steady harry bet that this wasexactly the way santana had looked as he crouched aimed and fired that nightin central park he pulled off into a sparsely occupiedrest stop santana tossed him a black turtleneck ammo vest and watch cap anda small jar of black greasepaint labeled nightstalker dont forget the backs of your hands hesaid as he left the camper cradling the rifle in a canvas wrap outside the rain had begun fallingharder to the east in the distance lightning glinted off the blackening sky harry set the clothes beside his seat evieandy barlow sidonis maura he was ready to fight ready for whateverbut there was one more piece of business he had to take care of before theyheaded into battle a phone call kevin loomis glanced up at the clock andtried to imagine what the mounting flood in the basement was looking like rainhad forced the barbecue indoors but it really didnt matter everything wasmoving along as he had planned it wouldnt be long now it had been about thirty minutes since heleft the party through the backdoor ostensibly to get a scorecard from hisgolfbag in the garage he grabbed the card which he had set by the garagedoor then cut around the side of the house to dislodge the washing machinehose his setup worked even better than he expected one tug on the heavy twinehad pulled the hose free and the twine had slipped off so that he was able topull it through the basement window now there were about ten minutes leftbefore he would discover the disaster he made his way through the gueststrading stories laughing at jokes and doing a fairly effective job of gettingdrunk it was strange knowing when the exact moment of ones death was going tooccur what if he had known from the very beginning would he have doneanything differently the question was rhetorical he would always have joinedthe roundtable as he understood it to be and the moment he entered his firstroundtable meeting he was one of them from then on nothing he did wouldchange a thing he had said goodbye to each of the kids inhis own way and had managed halfdecent sex with nancy before tension overwhelmedhim now he stood in the kitchen and glanced over at the drawer where he hadplaced the flashlights just a few more minutes suddenly he realized thephone was ringing his first thought was that something had happened to one ofthe kids he snatched it up hello kevin loomis yes its harry harry corbett howre youdoing fine were having a party here thoughi really cant talk thats okay you can just listen i wonttake long the murder they want me for the surgeon yes from the doorway nancy asked with bodylanguage if the call was anything for her to be concerned with kevin shook hishead its atwater kevin harry went ondoug atwater from manhattan health hes the knight behind the killingsbehind that dr perchek i told you about i suspected as much atwaters galahadthe knight in charge of security i saw him earlier today on the news the others in your group may haveparticipated but i believe hes the mastermind were going after him and perchekright now good luck kevin im calling to beg you to see thisthing through if we get them were going to need you to testify against themif we fail all those patients at risk are going to need you even more i i dont know what youre talkingabout kevin said of course im going to see this through i wish you lucktonight ive got to go now kevin please be strong you have toomuch to lose we all do kevin set the receiver down withoutreplying damn corbett he didnt have any kids he turned on the sinkwater which was now little more than a trickle hey fred he called to one of the twomen he had selected weve got no water pressure all of a sudden what do youthink the man shrugged guess we ought to check the basement hesaid kevin allowed him to open the basementdoor and try the light bulbs out the man said or else thepower down theres dead from below they could clearly hear thesound of gushing water kevin handed him a flashlight and then called overreverend pete peterson and handed him one as well his pulse was beginning torace it looks like a great flood down therehe said unfortunately my waders are right in the middle of it you guys hangon the stairway and follow me with your lights ill see what i can see it was about to happen kevin was thinking it feltstrange so strange that his whole life had come down to these few moments he led the two men down to the basementand stepped into foot and a half of water its the washing machine hose hecalled out from the blackness its snapped off keep your lights on it all those things in life that had seemedso damn important at the time all meaningless just be careful peterson said kevin jammed the hose back on to itshousing see he said no problem no problem atall what i am doing is right bestfor nancy best for the kids best for everyone god forgive me sir tristram knight of the roundtabletook a single deep breath and then set his hand down the back of the dryer hisbody stiffened sparks shot from his legs at the waterline his heart went intoimmediate standstill the muscles in his hand in a viselike spasm tightenedaround the frayed wire he had been dead for fifteen seconds by the time theweight of his body pulled him free of the wire and allowed him to drop into thewater chapter green dolphin street they were still a ways from atwatersmansion when harry began hearing the tune in his head he tapped out the rhythmon the steering wheel and bobbed his head to the bass line what are you doing santana asked listening to music its a tune that popsinto my brain when im keyed sometimes i dont even realize im tense until ihear it santana studied him from within the blackgreasepaint his eyes were glowing discs of pearl keep listening he said finally they drove toward the hudson until theyfound the narrow winding roadway that paralleled the palisades harry cut theheadlights and slowed down there were no cars on either side moving orparked the houses each overlooking the hudson from a majestic height werewidely spaced and nestled in the woods a good distance from the road throughthe rain and the gloom it was impossible to make out much more than lightsfrom any of them you still think you know where we aresantana asked im not as certain as i was a littlewhile ago harry said peering through the winnebago windshield which wasbeing squeegeed by wiper blades as big as hockey sticks maybe thats why thedamn tune in my head keeps getting louder maybe its time to stop listening howreyou even going to know were there im looking for that wall i told youabout that stone wall at almost the moment he said the word theysaw it fieldstone set in cement two feet thick running along the road asfar as they could see to their right a sixfoothigh chainlink fenceextended from the wall toward the cliffs harry pulled as far off the road ashe could cut the engine and gestured toward the fence i would guess theres another one likethis on the other side and then the cliffs in the back so the place iscompletely enclosed a big corral santana said what betterplace for a gunfight peering down the road they could justmake out the main gate perhaps fifty yards away santana used a hoodedflashlight and set out their equipment which included a snubnosed revolverand the silenced semiautomatic that harry knew had killed the gunman in thepark in addition there was a rope adhesive tape switchblade knives wirecutters wire swiss army knives powerful flashlights and several boxes ofammunition santana handed harry the revolver and some bullets the safetys here he said flip it offafter you load it then just point and shoot just point and shoot harry echoed theultimate kodak moment load up your rucksack and be ready santana took the binoculars and the rifleswitched off the interior lights of the rv then opened the door and slippedout harry watched impressed as the former dea undercover agent moved quicklyand silently into the wall and scaled it in a heartbeat he lay flattened onthe top scanning the property then after a few minutes he was back the house is pretty well lit and not thatfar away i can actually see into some of the windows theres one guard in alittle house by the gate i didnt see anyone else any dogs not that i could see shouldnt we have brought some big tbonesteaks just in case you mean like they do in the movies exactly harry any attack dog thats worth itssalt knows the difference between the kind of meat that just lies there and thekind of fresh meat it gets to hunt down and kill we see a dog we shoot itthats too simple for the movies but its damn efficient now heres what ithink we should do im going back up on the wall about halfway down when iflash one time call the house and demand to speak to maura that way wellknow for certain shes there hopefully ill see her through one of thewindows if not well just have to get close enough to figure out where sheis if i flash twice come along three times theres trouble of some kind inthat case hop up on the wall right over here and be ready to use that gunlock the doors and leave the key wedged under the right rear tire questions none you ready i am ray i guess there is one thing go ahead please dont take this wrong ive got ascore to settle with these people too a big score i just want to remind youto to keep your cool santanas response was not what harryexpected he glared at him in an unsettling frightening way the tic by hiseye and at the corner of his mouth intensified okay you asked now you listen hesnapped ive lived in pain every second of every minute of every hour ofevery fucking day since that bastard shot that stuff into my body sevenyears the only peace i ever got during that time was when i was able toimagine what it was like for him in that filthy mexican prison now hes upthere in that mansion along with the bastard who set me up to be tortureddont you tell me to keep my cool harry felt himself recoil from the mansfury it took some time for him to regain his composure finally he reachedout and rested his hand on santanas arm sorry ray he said well get them ipromise you we will santana left and quickly flattened himselfagainst the wall the rain had let up considerably and the gate was easier tosee harry peered at it for a second or two when he looked back santana wasagain atop the wall a moment later his light flashed once harry checked thetime and dialed the number atwater had given him atwater answered onthe second ring dr mingus atwater said it is tell me again what you have for me i want proof that mauras okay tell me what you have santana is staying at the rooming housein spanish harlem ill tell you the address and the name hes using when youlet maura leave how did he find me up here perchek left a thumbprint in evies roomsomeone at the bureau told santana hes pledged the guy to secrecy no oneelse knows about it except him and me not even the crime guy who lifted theprint in the first place howll i prove youre telling me thetruth doug i dont give a shit about you whatyou prove or dont prove every cop in new york is looking for me once i havemaura im out of here thats all i care about now where is she who have you been in touch with on theroundtable two men jim stallings is one now hesdead the other one ill name as soon as i speak to maura hes told me all theother names give me one someone named loomis i cant rememberhis first name but i have it written down hes not the other one youve spoken to no now no more delay i cant stay herethat long call this number back in exactly fiveminutes harry hung up and waited in the dark upahead he could barely make out the shadow that was santana pressed on the topof the wall the rain had all but stopped now the country air wafting throughthe open passengerside door was scrubbed and sweet the songs of peepers andcrickets filled the heavy silence harry ran his fingers over the greasepaintcoating the backs of his hands harry picked up the receiverand hit redial all right atwater said as soon as heheard harrys voice you have thirty seconds im standing right next to herlistening on a portable phone dont upset me hello maura its me are you okay harry ive been so worried about youim all right they they made me drink bourbon i fought it but theymade me then they gave that up and shot me some drug to make me tell themwhere you were but i couldnt tell them what i didnt know her voice sounded strained but strong maura just be tough i have everythingwe need to get us out of the country there was the briefest hesitation thenshe quickly covered up her confusion i didnt think you could pull it alltogether so quickly she said im ready her extension clicked off okay harry call this number again infive more minutes and we deal make it half an hour i cant stay wherei am any longer whos the other man on the roundtable youvespoke to harper pat harper northeast life andcasualty kevin loomis had said the mans name justonce but it had been easy for harry to remember a girl named pat harper hadbeen his first crush in junior high dropping harpers name now was perfect ifharry didnt make it through the night at least loomis would be safe fromreprisal okay thirty minutes atwater said harry listened to the dial tone and triedto imagine what was transpiring behind the wall for two minutes there was onlyblackness up ahead then santanas light flashed twice it was time harry slipped on the rucksack and snappedthe revolver into a holster on his belt keeping low he flattened himselfagainst the wall and moved along it until he reached santana who was standingon the road side theyre not keeping her in the house hewhispered someone i think it was garvey left by a side door and walkednorth in a minute or so he came back with her then they went back again andgarvey returned alone now hes back in the house where to first the guard by the gate if theres goingto be any shooting try and let me do it my gun doesnt make any noise i remember santana set the rifle by the wall it looks like its all going to beclosein work he said maybe i can get a refund for this the fieldstones offered easy purchase forscaling the wall together they reached the top lowered themselves halfwaydown the other side and dropped to the sodden ground harry found himselfanticipating pain in his chest before he hit in fact he did experience abrief jab though not nearly as bad as when he jumped the backyard fence infort lee if this was as bad as it got tonight he could handle it easily guns drawn they inched up on the smallgatehouse there was a dark fourdoor sedan parked beside it through thesmall side window of the house they could see the guard talking on the phone if this is a checkin call were inluck santana whispered one less thing to go wrong have some twoinchadhesive tape ready he motioned harry to the far side of thegatehouse door then tapped lightly on it once and flattened himself againstthe wall the door opened cautiously gun drawn the guard stepped out harryhadnt time to fully appreciate santanas moves before it was over ray broughthis pistol down sharply on the mans wrist the guards hand went limp and thegun dropped as if it had suddenly become electrified before he could even cryout ray was on him a hand tightly across his mouth his leg around the backof his calf the takedown was quick and silent ray came down straddling themans chest with the muzzle of his silenced revolver jammed between his teeth not a sound ray growled understand the man nodded keeping the silencer inhis mouth ray rolled him on to his side and motioned harry to tie his handsbehind him then he again rolled him to his back he pulled his gun out andpressed it under the guards jaw okay wheres the girl the man stared up at rays blackened faceharry could see him assessing the benefits and dangers of trying to lie theinternal debate lasted only seconds guest house down the path to theleft is perchek with her the mention of the doctors name brought aflash of fear to the guards eyes he hesitated then nodded how many men ray waited for a responseand then set the silencer muzzle squarely on the mans left eye how many one with pperchek in the cottage hestammered two in the house plus garvey who atwater yes two plus him put a bandana in his mouth and tape it intightly santana whispered to harry wrap the tape all the way around hishead twice then tie his ankles harry did so efficiently and togetherthey dragged the man ten yards to a tree and tied him there santana checkedinside the gatehouse the gate release is right inside thedoor he said the door beside the gate is unlocked he glanced at hiswatch weve got about twenty minutes lets go get her they stayed close to the wall which metthe chainlink fence on the far side of the property in a copse of low shrubsup the hill and to their right was the main house with lights shining throughevery window and spots illuminating the front walk fifty yards or more to theleft of the main house shining through a small wood were more lights there harry whispered pointing ray nodded and led the way they reachedthe trees and moved through them carefully keeping low the guest house aminiature version of the mansion was itself spectacular it was almost allglass built on steel girders that thrust up from the cliff so that its deckwas cantilevered out perhaps a hundred feet above the hudson harry peered overthe precipice there was a shoreline of boulders extending out ten or fifteenfeet from the base of the cliff and directly across the still black riverglittering like the milky way was manhattan against the cliff beneath the main floorwas a set of rooms not visible from the front of the guest house through onewindow which was barred they could see maura alternately sitting on the edgeof a bed and pacing she appeared worn and tired but reasonably steadysantana put a finger to his lips and pointed towards the house moving closer theypeered in through a massive picture window the expansive space living roomdining room and kitchen was tentshaped gleaming hardwood and glass with acedar ceiling and a center pole fifteen feet high french doors opened on tothe deck and half a dozen large windows offered stunning views of the city aguard his weapon in a shoulder holster was pouring coffee behind himreading at a table sat the doctor at the sight of him an unnaturalguttural noise emerged from santanas throat the sound of hatred he pickedup a shotputsize rock and motioned with his gun for harry to follow him theystopped just outside the glass door me first he whispered before harry could respond santana heftedthe rock and hurled it facehigh through the door the thick glass explodedinward ray was inside at almost the instant the rock hit the floor dont he barked as the gunman reachedfor his weapon harry stepped through the empty door frameand took the mans gun anton perchek who had not even lowered his booklooked up first at him then at santana his smile was one of bemusement theirises of his eyes were so pale as to appear almost white his pupils werewide black holes in the snow there was not a hint of fear in the man thatharry could see or of any emotion at all for that matter down on your face santana ordered thegunman when the man hesitated ray dropped himwith a pistol butt behind the ear all the while keeping his attention fixed onperchek the gunman was moaning but awake as harry bound him with the techniquehe had perfected on the gatekeeper santana pulled a chair away from the tablewith his silenced revolver still aimed at perchek he helped harry lift thesemiconscious man into the chair harry tied him there then he stepped backcloser to santana the doctor eyed the two of them curiouslyhe was certainly the man harry had seen outside of evies room the man maurahad drawn but in some ways he wasnt he looked like all of the computerrenderings but none of them he would have fit in perfectly behind the counterof a convenience store or piloting a jet he was nobody and everybody when hespoke his voice was mellow hypnotic and totally devoid of emotion well ray its been a while hasnt ithe said santana pushed the table away from perchek with his foot even throughthe black greasepaint harry could see the tension in his face clearlyperchek sensed it too you dont look so good ray he said assantana was taping his wrists to the wroughtiron arms of the chair themuscle wasting in those hands that twitch by your eye what is it drugssome sort of disease harry noticed that the doctors armsespecially his forearms were thickly muscled his biceps stretched the sleevesof his sky blue polo shirt santana checked him for a weapon but found none the key to mauras room ray demanded perchek shrugged as if the business wastoo mundane for him to bother with no key he said just a dead bolt inthis side santana motioned harry down the shortflight of stairs in half a minute he was back with her she was holloweyedfrom strain and her lip was swollen and crusted with blood but otherwise sheseemed unharmed the big guy hit her when they kidnappedher harry explained anything else santana asked except for forcing the booze down methey havent really hurt me i managed to spit a lot of it out and after theyleft me alone i made myself throw up i was drunk for a while but im sobernow they thought id start begging them for more but i hated the feeling andeven the taste harry put his arm around her and held hertightly santana glared down at perchek who in the agency helped garvey disappearso cleanly he asked perchek continued smiling at him benignly ray you look terrible absolutelyterrible his speech was as sterile as his eyes you know i keep thinkingthat back in nogales i never had the chance to give you the antidote for myhyconidol thats whats wrong with you isnt it my lord ray what anoversight i am so sorry so truly sorry shut up and tell me who sent garvey outwith a new identity there is an antidote you know and adamn effective one it is too the biochemical process is quite simpleactually its called competitive inhibition the antidote just floods thebloodstream and replaces those nasty little molecules that have been locked onto those nerve endings of yours all these years and bingo yourecured no more pain ray think of it why why just look at your eyesyoure addicted too arent you oh ray i can just imagine what youve beenthrough all these years why its a wonder you havent done yourself in beforenow santana listened as if transfixed perchekwas soothing seductive hypnotic and totally believable harry wanted to saysomething anything to break the spell of the doctors rhetoric instead hetoo stood motionless it was santanas pain well now you dont have to hurtanymore ray those horrible pain flashes you keep having i can make them goaway for good i promise you no more need for narcotics youll feel thedifference in only a few minutes ray just think of it no more pain everagain guaranteed you can keep me tied up while you try it then you canleave i promise no one will touch you all i want is him he nodded towardharry in exchange for the antidote all i want is half an hour with him perchek looked over at harry and for thefirst time harry could see emotion in the mans eyes a consumingcontemptuous loathing focused directly and completely on him harry glancedback at santana and saw a flicker of uncertainty perchek saw it too and wasagain smiling benignly santana set his pistol on the table thenhe whirled and stretched twoinchwide adhesive tape tightly across thedoctors mouth next he pulled out a contraption from his pocket an arcanemetal frame with five finger rests and pointed screws over each perchekstiffened momentarily but made no move to resist as ray locked the fingers andthumb of his right hand in place i dont have a pain drug he said buti do have this thing ive been hanging on to for years a friend brought itback from china ill bet youve used something like it yourself from time totime first nail then flesh then bone then through the other side eightfingers two thumbs millimeter by millimeter ive been saving it and ididnt even know why until now he tightened the screws down so that eachnail blanched perchek reacted not at all ray dont let him make you into himharry begged theres no antidote for that drug and even if there wereyou know hed never give it to you i need him ray they want me for murdershe committed lets just take him in and get him locked up dont sink to hislevel you dont understand harry santanasaid icily siempre estaba yo a su nivel i was always at his levelnow get out he snapped the words like a whip harry started to protest but he knew itwould serve no purpose he took maura by the arm well be right outside he said weonly have about ten minutes before garvey starts wondering why i haventcalled they left as santana was tightening thefirst screw who did garvey own at the agency heasked whos protecting him now perchek smiled beneath the tape santanatightened the screw through the nail blood spurted out around the metalperchek stared ahead pain or answers santana said youvegot a choice to make no ray its you who have the choice sean garvey spoke to him from just outsidethe front door he held a gun to harrys head they stepped into the room thehuge thug followed roughly dragging maura by the arm then shoving her to thefloor his gun was leveled directly at ray and you dont have a lot of time chapter raymond you were careless seven yearsago garvey said and you were careless tonight still holding his revolverto harrys temple he shuffled sideways away from the front door until his backwas to the river my man big jerry here called the gatehouse to set up agolf game with his pal and what do you know no answer now then get thatthing off dr percheks hand santana didnt move you son of a bitchhe said how many of our guys did you get killed how did you get paid by thescalp ray glanced towards the door it was onlythe slightest movement but harry caught it so did garvey dont try to pull that shit with me hesaid theres no one out there and you know it face it raymond you triedyou lost now take that off antons hand santana again glanced towards the door just a flick of his eyes then he reached over and loosened the screw perchekflexed his finger and the device clattered to the oak floor a lot of the guys you sold out hadfamilies ray said kids that had to grow up without a father we worked forshit pay and took crazy risks because we believed in what we were doing we alltrusted you and you just handed us over one by one i can understand him hegestured toward the doctor he works for the highest bidder whoever ithappens to be hes a machine but you youre something worse yourescum a soulless gutless traitor the tape garvey snapped take it offhis mouth santana complied though not at all gently you should have stayedback in kentucky or wherever the hell you were raymond everyone would havebeen much better off now weve got to run some sort of damage control in orderto keep my pet project up and running is that why you broke perchek out ofprison to work for the roundtable lets just say that as soon as i got thehang of my new career in the health insurance business i appreciated thepossibilities now however i need to find out who among my knights needs tobe taught a lesson in loyalty fortunately for us i believe our friend drcorbett can come up with that information and coincidentally we have just theman here who can help him do it you will help wont you anton perchek smiled it will be a pleasure so move aside there raymond big jerrywill untie the doctor harry would you be so kind as to crawl over and takedr percheks place in that chair garvey placed his gun barrel at the baseof harrys skull and forced him down to his hands and knees slowly harrymoved across to maura still on the floor his eyes were fixed on santana whoremained crouched beside perchek for the third time ray glanced minutelyalmost inadvertently toward the front door harry found himself beginning tobelieve there actually was someone out there sean garvey clearly feltthe same way jerry im sure our friend raymond isrunning a scam but just take a quick look outside will you then untie thegood doctor harry heard the motion behind him as jerrymoved to the front door then suddenly snarling with rage andhatred santana sprang from his crouch and charged his onetime boss garveyshot him at pointblank range once then again jerry whirled quickly andtwice fired into him from behind but santanas unearthly cry only grew louderhe collided chest high with garvey driving him backward through the screendoor and out on to the deck jerry lunged toward them but harry could see hewas too late santana silent now had his nemesis in a death grip his legswere churning like a halfbacks even though life had already left his bodygarvey hit the top of the waisthigh guardrail just as ray pushed off and thetwo men flipped over the railing like toys garveys scream filled the nightthen it stopped with the suddenness of a guillotine jerry was staring at the spot where thetwo men had vanished when perchek cried out his name he spun around just asharry dove from his knees for the corner of the table where santana had placedhis gun harry grasped the butt of the pistol at the moment the killer firedthe edge of the table shattered harry rolled then rolled again as a shotslammed into the floor behind him there was pain in his chest but he was farbeyond reacting to it then suddenly he was on his belly sighting down thebarrel of his gun at the chest of the man who was preparing to kill him it washis recurring nhatrang dream this time though there was no youthful asianface no loud report echoing in his ears only a soft spitting sound and aflash of flame the front of the behemoths neck blew apart just above hisjersey he flew backward exploding through the plate glass window and on tothe deck harry scrambled to his feet prepared tofire again but there was no need the man lay motionless blood spurting fromhis severed carotid artery in just a few seconds the spurting became atrickle maura raced to harrys side he slipped off his rucksack and took outa powerful flashlight together they peered over the railing of the decksantana and garvey their bodies shattered lay on the rocks a hundred feetbelow oh ray harry murmured maura quickly turned away at least rays pain is finally over shesaid stepping clear of the huge corpse stretched out on a bier of brokenglass just a few feet away he told me in the hospital that he didnt think hecould go on much longer when he got the call about percheks fingerprint hedbeen thinking more and more about suicide out of mauras line of sight harry bracedhimself on the railing until the boring pain beneath his breastbone began tosubside damn not now perchek injected him with thathyconidol he said finally ray hated him but garvey was the one he reallywanted garvey was the one who handed him and the other undercover agents overlisten we ought to get out of here before the other guys at the main housecome over we can call the police from my rv he left the railing and followedmaura back inside okay perchek lets go mess with me in any way and iswear ill kill you i can see that you are very good atthat the doctor said harry replaced the adhesive tape gag cutthe rope binding him to the chair and forced him facedown on the floor onceagain he noted that perchek was powerfully built especially through theshoulders and arms and even with his revolver pressed against the mans spineharry still felt at risk tightly he said as maura tied perchekshands behind him make sure his hands are relaxed i dont want even a littleslack then take that gun on the floor over there be sure the safety is i know i know harry pulled perchek to his feet andforced him through the door across the room bound and gagged the guardwatched them go down this way along the fence harryordered in a whisper maura keep your eyes out for the other two guys they moved carefully through rainsoakedbushes and shrubs ten yards twenty the fieldstone wall was easy to see now there maura whispered urgently she pointed at a figure moving stealthilytoward them across the lawn gun drawn harry pulled the adhesive tape frompercheks mouth tell him to stop right there he saidperchek said nothing harry jammed the muzzle into the base of his neck dammit do as i say or i swear ill killyou right now its me perchek dont come any closerthe good doctor has a gun in my back wheres doug the guard called back dead now just stay where you are no back away harry yelled back awaynow but stay on the grass where i can see you maura were going to head forthe gate theres one more of them somewhere so keep looking they crossed the lawn harry held the ropebinding percheks wrist in one hand and santanas silenced pistol in the othermaura kept her revolver poised to fire youd best kill me perchek said shut up santana didnt take advantage of theopportunity when he had it and look how he ended up they had reached the gate harry checkedinside the guard house no one keep close he whispered is that guystill out on the lawn still there she said okay he held his breath pulled perchek closerand guided him through the ornate wroughtiron pedestrian gate adjacent to themassive main gate the winnebago was right where they had left it fifty yardsdown the road maura that mobile home is ours the keyis under the right rear tire you drive ill stay with him it looks imposingbut theres no trick to driving it just turn it on and go until we get therekeep your eye behind us shoot anything that moves last chance perchek said harry did not bother responding hisattention was fixed on the huge mobile home now no more than thirty feet away everything still okay back there no problem maura said were almost there they were at the corner of the wall nowless than ten feet from the rv it appeared undisturbed okay you go for the key ill coveryou harry pressed back against the side of thewinnebago maura ducked past him ran to the rear tire and swept her handbeneath it again harry held his breath be there he prayed got it she said she hurried back to the door on thepassenger side opened it and clambered across into the drivers seat harryguided the doctor over to the step okay perchek step up and get on to thatcouch over there he said at that moment a gunshot cracked fromsomewhere atop the wall near the gate and a bullet slammed into the metal byharrys face before he could react a second shot tore through his upper armhe cried out and reeled back against the side of the rv clutching the woundthe gun dropped from his hand it took only a second for perchek his handsstill tightly bound behind him to sprint off toward the gate another bulletsnapped into the side of the winnebago maura jumped to the ground but perchekwas already diving to safety through the pedestrian gate she fired three timestoward the wall but the shadow on top of it had disappeared im okay harry said get up there andstart this thing i can make it he followed her into the winnebago andslammed the door behind him seconds later maura pulled away he tore away thesleeve of his turtleneck the bullet had hit the meat part of his deltoid andexited only an inch or so lateral to where it went in blood was oozingsteadily from the wounds but it was venous bleeding not arterial he couldmove his fingers and his elbow although there was a good deal of pain enoughto think the shaft of the humerus might have been hit as well he wrapped thesleeve around the wounds and used his teeth and free hand to tie it as tightlyas he could stand as maura sped past the massive gate the headlights of thesedan that had been parked there flicked on harry cursed himself for notthinking to shoot out a tire as they walked past it theyre coming after us he said where should i go the rivers off to the right stay onthis road and look for a left you can make harry this thing is huge just take it up to as fast as you canhandle it and then go a little faster he snatched up the phone and dialed this is dr harry corbett im wanted by the police right now weredriving along the palisades in a winnebago motor home being chased by men whowant to kill us were the window beside maura exploded inwardshowering her with glass reflexively she ducked then poked her head up andaccelerated through forty you all right cut on my arm and my face but im okay tires and brakes screeched as she snappedthe wheel to the left they skidded on the wet pavement then felt a bump andheard the crunch of metal against metal the lurch sent cabinets flying openthe fax machine snapped off its stand and shattered against the wall potspans and canned goods clattered out on to the carpet and bounced off the teakdining table can you put your seat belt on i cant let go of the wheel harry dropped the phone picked up maurasgun and raced to the driversside window in the lounge i dont see them he cried maybe youknocked them off the the window behind him shattered hewhirled and fired three shots just as maura pulled the wheel sharply to theright he lost his balance and cried out as his wounded arm struck a counterthe collision with the sedan was louder and more forceful this time the heavysedan was much faster but hardly a match for the luxor in closein battle harry im okay there are three of them ithink percheks in the back seat im sure of that he had to holler now to be heard over therush of wind and the roar of the two engines they were heading down a fairlysteep hill harry i can barely stay on the road is there any way you can make a left onto a side street im going fiftyfive id have to slow toten i just hope this road doesnt turn too sharply or were going to tipover hang in there youre doing great the sedan pulled alongside them againthis time the center window on the drivers side was shot in harry bracedhimself and pulled the trigger of his revolver but got only an impotent clickthe pursuers inched forward watch it maura he cried a shot came through the vacant windowbeside her and spiderwebbed half the windshield she whipped the wheel to theleft only the pressure from the sedan kept them from flipping harry scrambledinto the passenger seat fumbled for the seat belt with his wounded arm andthen gave up trying if she didnt have one on he didnt want one either harry theyre in front of us trying tocut us off she yelled i can hardly see through this windshield harrywatch out the roads gone theyre in front of us the sedan had spun against the grille ofthe winnebago beneath the massive windshield it was being pushed sidewaysplowing through a forest of saplings and low bushes at fifty miles an hourtrees snapped like firecrackers as the winnebago barreled forward brakesscreeching several larger trees flashed past their branches whipping throughthe empty windows again and again the wheel spun out of mauras grasp eachtime she managed to steady it then suddenly the dense young woods fell awaya tenyard stretch of wild grass ended in blackness ahead of them were thelights of manhattan well below them was the hudson harry harry maura cried bracingherself were going over the sedan and motor home hurled off theedge of the precipice together harry grabbed the edge of his seat stiffenedhis legs and watched through the cracked windshield in numb horror as the cartumbled away from them and hit the water just beneath them the winnebago nosedslightly downward as it passed over the spot where the sedan had splashed downit hammered into the ebony water with dizzying force striking it first withthe front bumper instantly the windshield collapsed inward and the massivedual airbags filled chilly water flooded the cabin harry snapped forward and collided withthe dash at the instant the airbag drove him back into the seat the pain inhis chest which had never fully abated exploded through him once more maura he cried the river poured in with force fillingthe winnebago in seconds still tilted forward the huge rv glided downwardbeneath the surface harry battling the rushing water the airbag and thepain in his arm and chest inhaled deeply and clawed his way toward thedrivers seat expecting at any moment to connect with mauras body the murkyriver pushed him backward toward the sitting area he kicked off his sneakersand struggled to calm and orient himself the blackness was total wherewere the windows below him above were they still sinking his breath wasgoing he kicked and battled to find a way out nothing water was entering hisnose and mouth soon any second now he would have to take a breath he feltthe consuming panic of being trapped in water panic unlike any he had everknown his movements grew weaker more futilethe pain in his chest grew worse water seeped down his throat breathe his mind cried you musttake a breath darkness closed in reluctantly harry surrendered to it hisarms grew heavy the dreadful ache beneath his breastbone began to fade thenat the instant his consciousness vanished he felt a hand take hold of the backof his shirt chapter harrys first awareness was the smell the unmistakable amalgam of cleaning solutions antiseptic laundry starch andhuman illness it was an aroma as familiar to him as his own room he was in ahospital cranked up in bed at a fortyfive degree angle piece by piece image by image thenightmare began returning to him he was dead had to be the godawfulsensation of muddy river water filling his mouth and lungs it had to havebeen fatal is this heaven no its iowa he was dead and itreally wasnt all that bad he would open his eyes now and there would beclouds billowing about his feet james mason would be ushering new recruits tothe celestial escalator that would take them to the next level dr corbett dr corbett open youreyes a womans voice harry did not respondimmediately although he sensed that he would instead he tested his limbsfirst his legs then his left arm and finally his right there was no movementthere the arm was gone the bullet had severed an artery and the armwas gone he opened his eyes a slit and peered down at his chest his arm andhand were there resting in a loose cloth sling working exactly as they weresupposed to maura he murmured the word then said it againlouder whos maura the woman asked harry opened his eyes fully and turned tothe voice a young woman with short sandy hair and an attractive intelligentface looked down at him she had on a white clinic coat with a blue name tagthat read carole zane md cardiology maura hughes is the woman who was withme harry said his senses clearing rapidly there was a woman survivor fromthe accident but i dont know her name from what i heard you were in worseshape than she was i think she was taken to a hospital in newark thank god shes alive was all he could think do you know anything else about theaccident he asked nothing at all except that you were in acamper and you flew off a thirtyfoot cliff into the hudson some camper harry said where am inow youre in the coronary care unit ofuniversity hospital in manhattan im dr zane one of the cardiac fellows youwere brought here by chopper last night apparently we were the closestfacility to the accident with an available cardiac bed what day is it saturday the first the first of september yes september first the end forgramps the beginning of the end for dad now its harrys turn have i had a coronary maybe we dont know for sure iunderstand you are a physician a gp yes okay then youve been shot through yourupper arm the humerus has been chipped but its intact they wanted toexplore the wound last night but they couldnt because your ekg is abnormalits showing st segment changes suggesting acute posterior wall injury yourcardiac enzymes are slightly elevated as well so there definitely has beensome minor cardiac muscle damage already so ive had a coronary not had the ekg patterns keepchanging whatever is going on is still evolving that means we have a chanceto fix it with a balloon or a bypass damn harry quickly reviewed his family historyand his months of intermittent symptoms the physician took notes stopping himfrom time to time to clarify a point she was quite obviously bright but moreimportant to harry she was also kind attentive and careful not to show himhow rushed she was are you having any pain now she asked no i never have had pain when im atrest mostly i tend to get it when i run hard or jump well weve decided against bloodthinners and clot dissolvers because of the gunshot wound and the possibilityof internal injuries we dont know about yet you are on anitroglycerine drip she motioned to the plastic bags draininginto his left hand the nitro drip was running piggyback through a longslender needle inserted through the rubber infusion port of the primary line sugar water which was keeping the vein open no problem harry said wondering how hemight best go about finding out where maura was and how she was doing wed like to do a cardiac catheterizationon you as soon as possible zane said do whatever you have to she handed him a clipboard the operativepermit there are a number of potential problemswith this procedure listed on page two i am required to inform you of them oneat a time dont bother harry said signing ivealready been dead once and it didnt feel all that bad do you think i couldmake a phone call or two first let me listen to your heart andlungs then theres someone here to see you curious harry let himself be examinedthen carole zane promised to meet him in the cardiac cath lab as soon aspossible and turned toward the door harry followed her with his eyes onlythen did he notice the uniformed policeman seated just across from hisglassenclosed cubicle facing him dr zane she turned back yes whats that policeman doing here she smiled at him patiently well from what ive been told you areunder arrest ill see you downstairs harry electronically cranked himself upanother few degrees and searched about for a phone if he was under arrestthen phil had to be in trouble as well undoubtedly the police had alreadytraced the winnebago to him one call corbett just like you were injail albert dickinson walked into the room andstopped at the foot of the bed he was wearing his usual suit and smelled as ifhe had just smoked an entire pack of cigarettes at once harry felt a mix ofanger and disgust at the sight of him have you gotten people out to dougatwaters house he asked the new jersey police are working on it maybe you should just wait until someoneburns the place down do you know anything about maura shes not in the dts yet if thats whatyou mean you snide bastard isnt there anykindness inside you at all not towards murderers or drunks no notmuch youre going to feel very dumb when thetruth comes out now what about maura shes in newark city hospital hurt butnot badly from what i hear shes the one who saved you apparently she wentup to the surface couldnt find you and then dived back down the docs tellme you were on your way out when she pulled you to shore apparently you werehaving a coronary so they say what about the sedan thatwent over with us theyre hauling that up right now any survivors dickinson shook his head none how many were in there dunno ill be looking into that and intowho they were later today im going to wait until after youre taken care ofto get a statement from you so youll have some time to put together a realdoozy your file in the office is already three inches thick with fairy talesi ought to tell you that we know where that monster mobile home came from thejersey police will be paying your brother a visit as soon as our da tells themwe want to press aiding and abetting charges which we do harry adjusted the oxygen prongs in hisnose and wondered if the detective was trying to provoke him on purpose just tosee what a fullblown coronary looked like a nurse came in with a syringe whats that harry asked just some demerol to keep you relaxedduring your catheterization the cath lab people will be up for you in aminute no medicine please harry said illbe calm i promise okay the nurse replied but ill haveto notify dr zane this man is under arrest missdickinson said if he goes anywhere an officer must go with him the nurses expression suggested that shewas not nearly as taken with dickinsons importance as he would have likedharry asked her for the phone one call dickinson reminded him harry swallowed back a dozen or socomments on the policeman and his ancestry then he called his brother collectphil had just heard about the accident and was getting set to drive to thehospital as harry would have predicted he made light of the loss of theelegant mobile home hey that was going to be yourfiftiethbirthday present anyway harry i was just waiting to have itwrapped he was however concerned about harryscardiac situation sounds like you just worried about thatcurse and worried about it until it came true he said maybe so phil promised to find out what he couldabout maura and to see harry in a couple of hours moments later a gurney waswheeled in by a stoopshouldered man with hornrimmed glasses and a grayingmustache he was wearing surgical scrubs beneath a loose surgical gown hetransferred harrys iv bags to a pole on the gurney and then grabbed the sheetbeneath harrys head two nurses on opposite sides of the bed grasped the samesheet at hip level hey dont just stand there one of themsaid to dickinson grab this sheet beneath his feet and help us lift him dickinson complied but looked revolted okay the other nurse said one twothree the four of them swung harry on to thegurney as if he were weightless the landing caused a twinge in his upper armand perhaps something real or imagined in his chest how long is this going to takedickinson asked the nurse shrugged one to two hours she said setting aportable cardiac monitordefibrillator between harrys feet depends on whatthey find and what they do he may end up in the or for a bypass the nurses hooked a small oxygen tank toharrys prongs and floated a sheet on to him then dickinson followed thestretcher and one of the nurses out of the room take a break he said to the uniformedpolicemen ill go down with him ill call you up here in half an hour andtell you whats what with the nurse on one side of the gurneyand dickinson on the other harry was wheeled to the elevator the monitorbetween his feet silently charted out his heartbeats facing cardiac surgeryhe felt detached surreal and very mortal but in truth he had felt that waymost of the time since the night he walked back on to alexander with a milkshake for evie the gurney was pushed on to the elevator by the man from thecath lab dickinson and the nurse squeezed in alongside it there was a secondset of doors beyond harrys feet opposite the one through which they hadentered harry heard the doors behind him glide close he heard a key beinginserted in the control panel so that their trip could be made with no stops hey the nurse said what are youdoing the cath labs on the eighth floor not the subbasement at that moment her expression turned toterror dickinson looking with wideeyed surprise at the old man from the cathlab was fumbling inside his coat for his gun when harry heard the soft spit ofa silenced revolver from just beside his ear the nurse spun degreesslammed into the metal door and dropped dickinson clearly beaten loweredhis hand in a gesture of surrender the silenced revolver spit again andcreated an instant hole in the white shirt over his left breast for twohorrified seconds he stared at the wound a halo of crimson appeared around thehole he looked at harry his expression a mix of astonishment and utterdismay then his eyes rolled up and without a word he crumpled to the floor harry was too shocked and horrified tospeak the heart rate on the screen between his feet was one seventy heexpected any moment to see the beating stop entirely i told you you should have killed me whenyou had the chance anton perchek said dispassionately now you must getready for your great escape the elevator stopped at the subbasementbut perchek kept the doors from opening youll never make it harry said i made it this far didnt i perchekboasted a brief stop for some things at my manhattan apartment and i arrivedhere to begin preparation just a few hours after you did they couldnt havechosen a better hospital for my purposes i have several different excellent idbadges from here and having handled a number of cases here for the roundtablei know my way around the place pretty well youre insane so then doctor we must get a move oni have a laundry hamper waiting just outside the door its saturday so thelaundry is almost deserted a little iv pentothal for you and we should be ableto roll right past the pressing machines and out of this place why dont you just kill me harry asked the doctor circled around the gurney sothat harry could see the loathing in his eyes and the glee oh harry the idea is not to kill youhe said the idea is to have you beg me to kill you harry cast about for something anythinghe could use as a weapon there was not going to be any abduction and tortureit was going to end for them right here right now he fixed on the dooropen button near his right foot the laundry was through the door behindhim something possibly an equipment supply room or the power plant had to beon the other side of this one if he could just get there he had a chance atthe very least perchek would have to decide whether to pursue him or flee the sling was loose enough to allow somemovement shielded by the sheet he slid his right hand across his body thepain in his shoulder grew more intense with every millimeter but he ignoredit finally his fingers closed on the only weapon he could think of theoneandahalfinch needle in his iv hookup carefully he eased it free fromthe infusion port and shifted it to his left hand perchek released the door behind harryshead theres our hamper right where i leftit he said setting the silenced revolver down as he pulled the gurney outfar enough to drop the side rail now just the right amount of pentothaland at that moment the nurse crumpled on thefloor moaned loudly perchek turned now harry screamed to himself he gripped the needle tightly and drove itto the hilt in the soft spot just below the doctors right ear perchekbellowed with pain and surprise and reeled backward pawing the spot harrypushed himself off the stretcher and swung backhand as hard as he couldconnecting with percheks left cheek and sending him sprawling to the concretefloor next to the hamper then he whirled and hit door open on the paneljust above where albert dickinson lay he could sense perchek stumbling to hisfeet as the other set of elevator doors glided open head down harry racedacross a small enclosed waiting area burst through a set of swinging doorsand charged straight into hell he was on a long cement walk in thecavernous hospital power plant the temperature was over one hundred and thenoise level was deafening machinery whirring and rumbling above the constantchurning of circulating water harry pulled off his sling and threw it aside ashe ran awkwardly away from the elevator expecting at any moment to be shot inthe back to his right was a safety railing and fifteen feet below that wasthe massive turbine a gray monolith rising out of a concrete slab thepulsating highenergy drone it emitted bludgeoned harrys chest like aheavyweights fist to his left reaching seventyfeet towarda grimy glasspaneled ceiling were the boilers foreboding giants radiatingheat and energy thirty yards straight ahead and up a short staircase was theglassenclosed control booth inside his back to harry a large man in a tanjumpsuit and yellow hard hat was watching tv help harry screamed help me his cry was swallowed by the noise hestumbled on sweat already cascading down his face and stinging his eyes theunremitting pulsations from the turbine were making him intensely nauseous heglanced back just as a bullet ricocheted off the steel column by his earperchek had crawled over the gurney and now knelt at the head of the corridortaking aim once more harry dove on to his belly sending pain screaming fromhis shoulder and throughout his chest the bullet missed by inches stinginghis cheek with concrete spray fifty feet ahead of him were the stairs to thecontrol room which he now realized had to be soundproof fifty feet hecould even make out the mcdonalds bag on the counter by the television butunless the engineer in the hard hat turned around and spotted him the boothmight as well have been on the moon there was no way he could reach it beforeperchek reached him then to his right just a dozen or sofeet away he noticed the stairway down to the turbine floor he scrambledforward on his left hand and knees his right arm would bear no weight at allthe heat was intense the air heavy and stagnant the pain in his chest wasunremitting he half tumbled down the steel steps scrambled across theconcrete and took cover behind the massive turbine ground zero the droningvibration cut through his body like a chain saw fifteen feet above him on the corridorfrom the elevator perchek leaned over the metal railing searching staying onto kill him was a foolish choice but clearly the doctors pride and hatred hadtriumphed over logic crouching behind the turbine harrycircled trying to keep out of percheks line of sight behind him was anothersafety railing and beyond that another dropoff to a lower level the entirewindowless threetiered power plant was as vast as a cathedral he could hearwater flowing below probably being pumped in from the river to cool the steamfrom the boilers after it had passed through the turbine harry wondered if theconduit returning water to the river was large enough to carry a man out perchek had already moved over to coverthe stairs up to the corridor the stairs down to the lowest level werevirtually a continuation of those there was no chance harry could make iteither way he continued inching to his left trying to keep the hideousturbine between him and the doctor but at that moment perchek spotted himharry fell back as the revolver again spit flame a piece of pipe directly overhis head split open with a freight train roar steam under immense pressurespewed out instantly flooding the whole area and billowing thirty feet upwardto the ceiling the temperature rose rapidly the hot wet air was painful tobreathe hell harry knew he was cut off from eitherstaircase but now the swirling cloud of steam had completely engulfed theturbine he pushed through the dense mist on his belly and slipped between thesafety rail the twelve or thirteenfoot drop to the lowest level looked likea hundred but there was no choice painfully clinging to the rail with hisone good hand he lowered himself over the edge he hung there for a momentthen dropped to the concrete floor rolling gracelessly as he hit pain shot upfrom his feet through his chest taking his breath away it was severalfrightening seconds before he realized that he could still move he was at the very bottom of the hospitalnow beneath the concrete floor were the water tunnels crawl space and earththe massive pedestal supporting the turbine extended upward from the groundthrough the floor to the level harry had just left ahead of him flush withthe concrete was a steel grate harry crawled over and inspected it it wasfour feet by three placed to allow access into a concrete tunnel which was abouteight feet across at the base of the tunnel five feet below where harryknelt a stream flowed rapidly discharging spent coolant water from the powerplant to the river beside him a control post with four buttons permitted the waterto be stopped to service the system in either direction open inflow closeinflow open outflow and close outflow the prospect of trying toescape through the tunnel to the river was not appealing but it was rapidlybecoming his only option with the drilllike pain in his chest getting evenworse it was possible he couldnt make it anyway on the turbine floor above him steamcontinued hissing out perchek was up there somewhere undoubtedly guarding thestairway harrys only way out but now he realized the doctor had anotherproblem soon dropping steam pressure had to set off an alarm the engineer inthe control room would have to look down and see what was going on any saneman would flee right now but anton perchek was hardly sane harry tried the grate it was heavy butmovable with two good arms it would have been rather easy he kept glancingup at the stairs expecting any moment to see perchek step down from the cloudthe dreadful ache beneath his breastbone shot up into his jaws and ears inch byagonizing inch he slid the grate aside he estimated the rushing water belowto be three feet deep not much cushion he was weak dizzy and drenched withsweat probably having a fullblown coronary there was little chance he couldsurvive dropping into the pitchblack tunnel to follow the outflow to theriver it would be better to try and hide behind the turbine pedestal anyminute someone had to come down he crawled over to the concrete base ofthe pedestal just as perchek stepped out of the billowing steam and down thestairs harry crouched low out of sight at least for the moment beside himwas a rolling metal cart loaded with tools he tried hefting a hammer with hisleft hand it was a worthy weapon but he doubted he would be able to use iteffectively still it was something perchek scanned the area and peered intothe tunnel the open gate was a giveaway that harry had been there but it wasalso a source of confusion for perchek he had to make a decision harry gripped the hammer and watched asthe doctor crouched by the opening debating whether or not to jump in thepain in harrys chest was making it hard to breathe and even harder toconcentrate then perchek stood and turned away from the grate again searchingthe room harry cursed softly he had to do something maybe attack maybe tryto sneak back up the stairs again perchek knelt and peered into the tunnel suddenly before he fully realized what hewas doing harry was on his feet charging toward the doctor with every ounceof strength he had left leaning on the tool cart as he pushed it ahead of himthe hissing steam and machinery rumble covered the sound of the wheels percheksensed something and turned but too late the cart slammed into his shouldersending him over the edge and splashing into the water below harry collapsedto the concrete gasping and perilously close to unconsciousness below him hecould see the doctor on his hands and knees groping in the black water for hisgun harry forced himself to move he kneltbeside the grate and with agonizing slowness pushed it back into positionperchek looked up as the grate clanged into place for the first time harrythought he could see panic on the mans face then he remembered the controlpanel if he could close the outflow the water would deepen and the gun wouldbe harder to find anything that would buy even a little time was worth tryingwith great effort he rolled over reached up and pushed the button fromsomewhere beneath him came the vibration of gears engaging he slumped facedownon the concrete floor unable to move barely able to breathe the lightsdimmed the intense noise began to fade time passed a minute an hour then suddenly the grate by harrys facebegan to move he opened his eyes and through a gray haze saw percheks fingerswrapped around the metal thrusting upward in short bursts again and againwith the outflow closed the rising water had floated him upward his leveragewas poor but he was easily powerful enough to move the grate aside in just afew seconds he would be out battling the darkness and the pain harry forcedhimself to one elbow then with agonizing slowness he toppled over on to hisback across the grate unable to move he lay there arms spread as percheksfingers tore frantically at his scalp and his neck and pulled at his shirt corbett get off get off go to hell corbett the doctors panicked words were cut offhis movements grew more feeble harry felt the soothing coolness of waterwelling up around him flowing out over the floor the fingers clutching themetal beneath his head slipped away minutes passed the water continued risingaround him now touching his neck now his ears all at once the cacophony of machines andsteam stopped dead harry thought at last imdead but so is perchek ray so is the doctor a hand gently shook his shoulder hepeered up through the haze the engineer knelt beside him yellow hard hatkind brown eyes behind protective glasses are you crazy being down here like thisfella he said why its a wonder you didnt get yourself killed epilogue september the block print on the single day calendardirectly opposite his bed was the first thing harry saw when he opened hiseyes september nd corbett curse plus one he had been awake sometimeearlier and remembered being spoken to by nurses and doctors just before theytook him off the ventilator but he recalled little else except that he had hadsurgery he was going to be a cardiac patient for the rest of his life perhapseven a cardiac cripple but at least he had a rest of his life he was back in an icu room though not theone he had been in before he had on an oxygen mask and was hooked up with theusual array of lines wires and tubes but he felt remarkably well dr carolezane was standing at his bedside take a deep breath dr corbett shesaid you must take deep breaths harry had cared for enough of his patientsafter their coronary bypass surgeries to know that for two or three days thepain from the sternum being split and wired back together was intense stilldeep lungclearing breaths were essential he did as his doctor asked therewas a sharp jab in his left side but no discomfort in his sternum none atall he moved his legs there was no pain in either of them one of them had tohave been operated on to remove the vein for his bypass he ran his hand overthe inside of his thighs no bandages then he touched his chest the skin overhis sternum was shaved but intact whats going on he asked what do you mean the bypass how did you do it without anincision here she looked at him curiously thenunderstood dr corbett im afraid we might have gonea little too heavy on the anesthesia and pain meds ive told you what happenedseveral times you didnt have a bypass and if your coronary arteriograms areany indication you never will dont you remember seeing them harry shook his head carole zane smiledher patient smile and turned to someone else in the room suddenly mauraappeared beside her she had a blackened left eye and small bandages by herbrow and on her cheek but she still looked radiant hi doc she said remember me hey i think so the one who saved mylife in the winnebago right im glad youre okay discharged early this morning tenstitches but not much else harry you didnt have a bypass operation theresnothing wrong with your heart nothing at all he stared up at her confused i dont understand the pain the ekg she held up a clear plastic baggie insidewas a reddish brown spike four inches long they took this out of you harry shesaid its bamboo so it never showed up on any x rays its been deep in yourback since the war gradually working its way forward the point was right upagainst the back side of your heart once we saw the perfectly normalarteriograms we did a ct scan carole zane explained and there it wastaking it out was relatively easy so much for the curse maura said except that being terminally dumb is acurse too so i still have one to worry about i spoke with your brother and with minetoo toms at atwaters place right now and so is your lawyer tom saystheyve found a whole roomful of stuff from the roundtable including tapes andfinancial records perchek has a place in manhattansomewhere harry said i think thats where he keeps the disguises and idbadges and the poisons he used if we can find that place maybe well turn upthe aramine he used on evie is this perchek the man who killed thepoliceman in the elevator dr zane asked and the nurse no not the nurse she spent most of thenight in surgery but shes doing fairly well right now i hear shes going tobe okay god thats good news they found a man floating directlybeneath you in the power plant zane said was that him harry nodded and smiled beneath his oxygenmask he was thinking about ray santana i think wed better let him rest for awhile zane said she squeezed his hand reassuringlyadjusted his monitor leads and then left the room maura lifted up the mask and kissed him onthe lips bamboo he said bamboo she echoed she stroked his foreheadand kissed him again hey she exclaimed anybody ever tell you that youlook like gene hackman
