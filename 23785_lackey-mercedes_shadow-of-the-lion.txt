the yellow lanternlights of mainzs dockside inns reached out across the dark rhine standing on the prow of the riverboat erik hakkonsen stared at them thinking of little more than food and a bed hed left his home in iceland three weeks earlier to answer the emperors summons theyd had a stormy crossing then the late spring thaw had ensured that the roads of the holy roman empire were fetlock deep in glutinous mud and finally the river had been full and the rain steady tomorrow he would have to go to the imperial palace and find out how to seek an interview with emperor charles fredrik but tonight he could sleep the riverboat nudged into the quay a wet figure stepped out from under the eaves of the inn is there one erik hakkonsen on this vessel he demanded halfangrily the rain hadnt been kind to the skinny courtiers bright cloak the satin clung to him and he was shivering erik pushed back his oilskinhood im hakkonsen thank god for that im soaked to the skin ive been here for hours complained the man come ive got horses in the stable the emperor awaits you erik made no move who are you the fellow shivered baron trolliger the emperors privy secretary he held out his hand to show a heavy signet it was incised with the roman eagle that was not a seal anyone would dare to forge erik nodded ill get my kit the shivering baron shook his head leave it he pointed to the sailor who had paused in his mooring to stare you watch over this mans gear someone will be sent for it as much as anything else the alacrity with which the sailor obeyed the order drove home the truth to erik he was in the heart of the holy roman empire for a certainty in his native icelandor vinland or anywhere else in the league of armaghthat peremptory order would have been ignored if not met with outright profanity come the baron repeated the emperor is waiting passing from the narrow dark streets and sharpangled tall houses into the brightness of the imperial palace erik had little time to marvel and gawk at the heavy gothic splendor of it all instead baron trolliger rushed him throughstill trailing mudinto a large austere room as soon as erik entered the baron closed the door behind him not entering himself in the center of the room staring at erik stood the most powerful man in all of europe he was a large man though now a bit stooped from age his eyebrows seemed as thick and heavy as the purple cloak he was wearing his eyes a shade of blue so dark they almost matched the cloak charles fredrik the latest in a long line of hohenstauffens guardian of the church bulwark of the faith lord of lands from northern italy to the pagan marches in the baltic ruler over millions of people throughout central europe the holy roman emperor himself in direct line of descent from the great fredrick barbarossa all of that mattered little to erik his tie to the emperor was a clan tie not a dynastic one he was there to become the emperors servant not his subject so erik simply bowed to the old man rather than kneeling and spoke no words of fealty simply the old oath linn gu linn the words were gaelic but the oath that bound him came from the cold fjells of pagan norway an oath that went back generations to the time when a hohenstauffen prince had rescued a pagan clan from demons set loose by their own foolishness charles fredrik spoke like an old mandespite being no older than eriks father but he voiced the ritual words strongly from generation to generation he held out the dagger that erik had heard described with infinite care all his life the dagger was iron old iron sky iron hammered with stone in the pagan northlands from a fallen thunderbolt the hilt was shaped into a dragon headthe detail lost in the blurring of hundreds of years of use it still drew blood for the bloodoath like new steel did blood for blood clan for clan erik renewed the oath calmly after binding their wounds himself charles fredrik took erik by the elbow and led him across to a window the window was a mere arrowslit testimony to the palaces ancient origins against modern cannon such fortifications were almost useless but there was a certain undeniable massive dignity to the huge edifice there they stood silent for some time looking out at the scattered shawl of lights which was the great sleeping city of mainz erik was quite sure that those lights represented more people than lived in all iceland their lives and those of many more rested in the hands of the old man standing next to him the emperor seemed to have read his thoughts it is a great load at times he said softly his heavy jaws tightened the next words were spoken almost harshly i have called for the clann harald because my heirs have need my son is very sickly and i do not expect my only surviving brother to outlive me not with his wounds so i must take special care to watch over my two nephews for it is quite likely that one of them will succeed to the throne after i am gone the emperor sighed your older brother olaf watched over my nephew conrad for his bondtime as your father hakkon watched over me a slight smile came to his face to my surprise i find i miss him he used to beat me you know he has told me about it godar of the hohenstauffen erik did not add often charles fredriks smile broadened according to your brother olafoften he chuckled it did me the world of good i eventually came to realize nobody had dared punish me before that do you know that your family are the only people in the world who dont call me emperor or your imperial highness i think it is why we trust you our loyalty is to the godar of the hohenstauffen not to the empire that too his father had said often you must sit and tell me the news of them once i have given you your task i warn you it will be a more onerous chore than olafs manfred my younger nephew reminds me of myself at that age you will have toas your father did with meserve as confrere in the monastic order of the knights of the holy trinity of courseas thenyour identity and purpose must remain secret manfreds also erik nodded my father has told me about the knights the emperors eyes narrowed yes but things have changed hakkonsen it is one of the things that worries me the knights have always beennominally at leastindependent of the empire servants of god not of any earthly power in practice they have served as the empires bulwarks to the north and east in your fathers day the nobility from all the corners of the holy roman empire came to serve as the knights of christ in the pious war against the pagan and many brave souls came from the league of armagh not just the handful of icelanders sworn by clan loyalty to the service of the emperor erik nodded again my grandfather says that in his day aquitaines made up as many as a quarter of the orders ranks the emperor clenched his fist slowly exactly today no knight from that realm would dream of wearing the famous tabard of the knights of the holy trinity once the brotherhood knights were truly the binding threads in the cloak of christianity today the knights of the holy trinity come almost entirely from the holy roman empire not even that only from some of its provinces theyre prussians and saxons in the main with a small sprinkling of swabians a few others he paused then he looked erik in the eyes theyre beginning to take an interest in politics far too much for my liking and theyre alsoi like this even lessgetting too close to the servants of the holy trinity damn bunch of religious fanatics that lot of monks charles fredrik snorted all of it mind you supposedly in my interests some of them probably even believe it but i have no desire to get embroiled in the endless squabbling of italian citystates much less a feud with the petrine branch of the church the grand duke of lithuania and king emeric of hungary give me quite enough to worry about leaving aside the outright pagans of norseland and russia again he sighed and theyre not a binding force any more today the common people call the churchs arm militant the knots more often than not and whats worse the knights themselves seem to relish the term the clann harald do not mix in empire politics stated erik firmly his father had warned him that this might happen the emperor gave a wry smile so your father always said just as im sure he warned you before you left iceland but erik hakkonsen because you guard manfred do not think you will be able to avoid it any more than your father could the old man turned and faced erik squarely politics will mix with you lad whether you like it or not you can be as sure of that as the sunrise especially in venice eriks eyes widened the emperor chuckled oh yes i forgot to mention that didnt i he took erik by the arm again and began to lead him toward the door but we can discuss venice tomorrow venice and the expedition of the knights to that city which you will be joining an expedition which i find rather peculiar they were at the door by some unknown means a servant appeared to open it for them but thats for tomorrow said the emperor whats left for tonight before you get some welldeserved rest is to meet the cross you must bear i suspect the thought of venice will be less burdensome thereafter about halfway down the long corridor leading to the great staircase at the center of the palace he added anything will seem less burdensome after manfred it took the emperor and quite a few servants some time to track down manfred eventually the royal scion was discovered in the servants quarters halfdrunk and halfnaked sprawled on a grimy bed judging from the halfsob and halflaugh coming from under the bed manfred and the servant girl had been interrupted in a pastime which boded ill for the princes hope of attaining heaven without spending some time in purgatory erik studied the young royal now sitting up on the edge of the bed manfred was so big he was almost a giant despite being only eighteen years old erik was pleased by the breadth of shoulders and the thick muscle so obvious on the halfclad body he was not pleased with the roll of fat around the waist the hands were very good also thick and immensely strong clearly enough but erik did not miss the suggestion of nimbleness as the embarrassed royal scion hastily buttoned on a cotte he was pleased also by the evident humor in the princes eyes bleary from drink true but they had a sparkle to them and erik decided the square blocktoothed grin had promise also whatever else prince manfred might be he was clearly not a sullen boy it remained to be seen how intelligent he was there eriks hopes were much lower the emperor standing in the doorway of the servants little room cleared his throat this is your clann harald guardian you young lout youll have to mind your manners from now on the princes huge shoulders seemed to ripple a bit as if he were suppressing a laugh thiswillow uncle the way you always described these icelandic sheep farmers i got the impression manfred gasped clutching his belly eriks boot had left a nice muddy imprint the prince choked struggling for breath you stinking he hissed a moment later the prince was hurling himself off the bed great arms stretched wide erik was pleased by the rapid recovery just as he had been when his driving foot hit the thick muscle beneath the belly fat manfreds charge would have driven down an ogre unfortunately ogres dont know how to wrestle erik had learned the art from an old huron thrall on the hakkonsen steading and polished it during his three years in vinlandmuch of which time he had spent among his familys iroquois relatives manfred flattened nicely against the stone wall like a griddle cake the palace almost seemed to shake the prince himself was certainly shaking when he staggered back from the impact not for long eriks hip roll brought him to the floor with a crash flat on his back the knee drop in the gut halfparalyzed the prince the algonquian war hatchet held against the royal nose did paralyze him manfred was almost crosseyed staring at the cruel razorsharp blade two inches from his eyes youll learn grunted the emperor give him a scar hes overdue eriks pale blue eyes met manfreds brown ones he lifted an eyebrow which cheek prince he asked manfred raised a thick finger one moment please he gasped i need some advice the prince rolled his head on the floor peering under the bed youd better decide sweetling right or left a moment later a girlish voice issued from under the bed left the prince rolled his head back the left then erik grinned the hatchet blurred blood gushed from an inchlong gash he was still grinning when he arose and began wiping off the blade i think the prince and i will get along fine emperor the most powerful man in europe nodded heavily thank god for that he began to turn away tomorrow we will speak about venice no politics insisted erik there was no response except a harsh laugh and the sight of a broad purple back receding into the darkness rome come brothers said the slightlybuilt priest who limped into the small chapel where his two companions awaited him the grand metropolitan has made his decision one of the other priests cocked his head quizzically is it the holy land then as we hoped no not yet at least he has asked usme i should sayto go to venice the third priest sighed i begin to wonder if we will ever make our pilgrimage eneko the italian words were slurred as always with pierres heavy savoyard accent the small priest shrugged as i said the grand metropolitan only requires me to go to venice youyou and diego bothare free to carry out the pilgrimage we planned dont be a typical basque fool growled pierre of course we will accompany you what would you do without us demanded diego cheerfully again he cocked his head yes yesgranted you are superb in the use of holy magic but if its venice i assume thats because of the grand metropolitans scryers do those men ever have good news to report snorted pierre the basque priest named eneko smiled thinly not often not since jagiellon took the throne in vilna thats certain pierre scowled why else would we be going to that miserable city eneko gazed at him mildly i wasnt aware you had visited the place pierres scowl deepened not likely a pit of corruption and intriguethe worst in italy which is bad enough as it is the basque shrugged i dislike the city myselfand unlike you ive been there but i dont know that its any more corrupt than anywhere else then smiling more complicated yes diegos head was still cocked to one side the mannerism was characteristic of the castilian eneko whyexactlyare we going there it cant be simply because of the scryers those gloomy fellows detect lithuanian and hungarian schemes everywhere im sure theyd find chernobog rooting in the ashes of my mothers kitchen fire if they looked long enough true enough agreed eneko smiling but in this instance the matter is more specific apparently rumors have begun to surface that the strega grand master was not murdered after all he may still be alive the grand metropolitan wants me to investigate the last sentence caused both diego and pierre to frown the first with puzzlement the second with disapproval why is it our business what happens to a pagan mage demanded pierre again eneko bestowed that mild gaze upon the savoyard the church does not consider the strega to be pagans i would remind you outside our faith yes pagans no the distinction was implicit already in the writings of saint hypatiai refer you especially to her second debate with theophilusalthough the churchs final ruling did not come until i know that grumbled pierre still diego laughed leave off trying to teach this stubborn savoyard the fine points of theology eneko he knows what he knows and theres an end to it eneko chuckled and so after a moment did pierre himself i suppose i still retain the prejudices of my little village in the alps he said grudgingly but i still dont understand why the holy father is making such an issue out of it pierre sighed diego we are not talking about some obscure witchdoctor dottore marina was considered by every theologian in the world christian or notespecially those versed in the use of magicto be the most knowledgeable strega scholar in centuries he was not simply a magus you know he was a grimas a master of all three of the stregheria canons fanarra janarra and tanarra the first grimas since vitold in fact and we all know how that lithuanian swine wound up growled pierre his savoyard accent was even heavier than usual enekos eyebrows a solid bar across his forehead lowered pierre i remind youagainthat the church does not extend its condemnation of the grand dukes of lithuania onto their subjects the savoyard priest looked away then nodded acknowledgement of the justice of the reproof besides continued the basque the criticism is unfair in any event vitolds fate derived from his boldness not from sin rashness if you prefer but i remind you enekos stern gaze swept back and forth between his two companions i remind you brothers that we have set ourselves the same purpose as that of doomed vitoldto stand firmly against chernobog and all manner of evil for a moment his eyes roamed the austere interior of the chapel finding comfort there perhaps but not forgetting how long it had taken them to find such a chapel in rome to challenge it on the field of holy battle he continued softly instead of lolling in comfort while our pauline brethren wage the struggle alone hearing the paulines referred to as brethren brought a momentary tightness to pierres lips but the savoyard did not challenge the term as often as eneko lopezs odd views grated on the savoyards upbringing and attitudes he had long since made the decision to follow the man anywhere he chose to lead them as had diego well enough eneko venice it is and we should send for francis in toulouse as well he would be invaluable in venice dealing with strega lopez shook his head no he said firmly i want francis to go to mainz and try to get an audience if he can with the emperor im not certain yet but i think he will be far more useful there than he would be in venice with us the basque priests words caused his two companions to stiffen again diego made that cockedhead quizzical gesture am i to take it that the grand metropolitan is looking more favorably on our proposal lopez shrugged he keeps his own counsel and he is a cautious man as you know but yes i think so i suspect he views this expedition to venice as something in the way of a test so do i brothers and if im right as to what we will find there we will need a private conduit with charles fredrik those words cheered pierre immediately well then by all means lets to venice the next morning as they led their mules through the streets of rome the savoyard finally unbent enough to ask the question again this time seeking an answer rather than registering a protest he did it a bit pugnaciously of course i still dont understand why were looking for a strega scholar we are not came enekos firm reply we are soldiers of god pierre not students battle is looming with venice as the cockpiton that every holy scryer in the vatican is agreed we are not looking for what the scholar can explain we are looking for what the mage can summon perhaps pierres eyes widened even as a boy in a small village in the alps he had heard that legend youre joking he protested eneko gazed at him mildly and said nothing it was left to diego to state the obvious he most certainly is not vilna not for the first time the shaman thought longingly of the relative safety of the lakes and forests of karelen from which he had come it required all his selfcontrol to keep from trembling that would be disastrous his master tolerated fear he did not tolerate a display of it as always in his private chambers jagiellon was not wearing the mask which the grand duke wore in his public appearances jagiellon was officially blinddue to the injuries he had suffered in his desperate attempt to save his father from the assassins who murdered him such at least was jagiellons claim the shaman doubted if very many people in lithuania believed that tale none at all in the capital city of vilna most of the populace of the grand duchy of lithuania and poland were quite certain that jagiellon had organized his fathers murder in order to usurp the throne few of them cared in truth succession in lithuania was often a bloody affair to begin with and in the four years since he ascended to the throne jagiellon had made it quite clear that he was even more ruthless than his father had been but if they doubted his other claim few lithuanians doubted jagiellons claim of blindness indeed they took a certain grim satisfaction in the knowledge jagiellon was more savage than his father truebut at least the father had managed to blind the son before succumbing to the usurpation not surprising really jagiellons father had been as famous with a blade as jagiellon himself the shaman suffered from no such delusion in the time since he entered the grand dukes service the shaman had realized the truth jagiellon had made his way to the throne by delving into magic even blacker than his father had been willing to meddle with and had delved too deeply the demon jagiellon had thought to shackle to his service had been too powerful for the rash and ambitious young prince and so while jagiellon had indeed lost his eyes that loss had been the least of it eyes were still there after all easily seennaked and visiblewith the mask removed but they were no longer jagiellons eyes for all that they rested in jagiellons face the eyes were black covered with eyelids so fat and heavy they turned the orbs into mere slits but the shaman could see them well enough far too well those eyes had neither pupils nor irises nor any trace of white eyeball ebonycolored and opaque uniform throughout appearing at first like two agatesuntil deep within the emptiness could be sensed as if stones were really passageways into some place darker than any night do it commanded grand duke jagiellon and his huge hand swept across the floor reopening the passage stifling a whimper of protest the shaman underwent the shapechange again as always the transition was accompanied by agonyand even more so the passage through which his master sent him but those agonies were familiar things the source of the shamans terror lay elsewhere nor did the terror stem from the lagoon itself as much as the shaman despised the stink of the watersin his new form even more than he would have in his human one his fishlike body swam through the murky shallows nosing the scents drifting through the mud swirls and reeds he detected the mage soon enough as familiar as he now was with that scent again as before the odor was very faint the mage remained near water at all times but rarely ventured into it to do otherwise would have been dangerous more dangerous to leave the waters vicinity than to enter it in truth the shamans jaws gaped wide displaying teeth that could rend human flesh easily but the display was more for the purpose of driving away the shamans own fear than any prospect of savaging the mage the mage had protectors in these waters the shaman was not the only thing swimming there which possessed sharp teeth and there were worse perils than teeth anyway much worse it was to detect the greatest of those perils that jagiellon had sent the shaman backagain and againto scour the waters of venice and the jesolo keeping a wary eye out for undines the shaman swam for two hours before turning away from the marshes he made no attempt to cut short his investigation jagiellon would be watching him the grand duke could see through that magic passageway as well as send the shaman through itor return the shaman to the palace in vilna in the event of disobedience once given to jagiellons service escape was impossible for the servant for the same reason the shaman did not stint in his ensuing search through the canals of the city that search also lasted a full two hours despite the fact that the shaman hated the canals even more than the marsh waters true the canals were not as dangerous undines rarely ventured into the city but the stench of human effluvia sickened the shaman he was in the end a creature born and bred in the wilderness of finland civilization nauseated him enough even for jagielloneven for the thing which jagiellon truly wasthis was enough the shaman swam back into the open sea and waited for his masters summons the summons came soon enough and the shaman underwent the agony almost gaily now that he knew he had escaped once again from the peril which lurked in venice the lion still slumbered fear returned quickly however great fear once the grand duke explained his new plan you would do better to use the broken god the shaman said softly trying his best to keep the whine out of his voice simply a counselor offering sage advice in the end his master took the advice but not before flaying the shaman jagiellons conclusion rested on the frailty of shamans as compared to simple monsters he accepted the fact punished the frailty the next day the new shaman was summoned to an audience in the grand dukes private quarters the shaman just arrived in vilna was also from the lakes and forests of karelen the grand duke was partial to that breed of finns especially for water work sit commanded jagiellon pointing a huge finger at the heavy table in the center of the kitchen the shaman stared whatever else he had expected the shaman had never thought to see the ruler of lithuania cooking his own meal over a stove the sight was incongruous erect in his heavy robes of office grand duke jagiellon seemed as enormous as a bear the ease and agility with which those great thick hands stirred food frying in a pan was equally incongruous despite his astonishment the shaman obeyed instantly jagiellon was famous grunting softly the grand duke removed the pan from the stove and shoveled a portion of its contents onto a wooden platter then as if he were a servant himself laid the plate before the shaman eat all of it if your predecessor poisoned himself i will need to discard the rest which would be a pity its one of my favorites dishes the shaman recognized the food fortunately he managed not to gag more fortunately still he managed to choke it all down as he ate he was aware of jagiellon moving to the door and opening it but did not dare to watch jagiellon was famous when the shaman was done with the meal jagiellons huge form loomed beside him again take the platter with you to your quarters commanded the grand duke his heavy voice sliding out the words like ingots from a mold do not clean it display it prominently it will help you to remember the consequences of failure the shaman bobbed his head in nervous obedience my project in venice will require subtlety shaman lest the spirit that guards the city be roused from its slumber that is why i summoned you here my last shaman was subtle enough but he lacked sufficient courage see to it that you have both the shaman was confused he had heard of venice but knew nothing about the city somewhere in italy he thought i will explain later go now you may take this with you also it will remind you of the consequences of success as he rose from the table clutching the platter the shaman beheld a woman standing next to the grand duke she was very beautiful you will not have the use of it for long warned the grand duke soon enough the thing must be sent off to venice the shaman bobbed his head again more with eagerness now than anxiety the shaman was not given to lingering over such pleasures in any event in that too he was a creature of the wilderness by the time he reached his chambers the woman following obediently in his wake the shaman had come to realize that she was no woman at all simply the form of one which his master had long since turned into his vessel the shaman did not care in the least a vessel would serve his purpose well enough and did so but the time came his lust satisfied when the shaman rolled over in his bed and found himself staring into an empty platter instead of empty eyes and he wondered whether he had made such a wise decision answering the summons of the grand duke of lithuania not that he had had much choice of course jagiellon was famous ferrara each hammer blow was a neat precise exercise of applied force enrico delleste loved this process this shaping of raw metal into the folded and refolded bladesteel his mind and spirit found surcease from trouble in the labor at the moment as for the past several years he needed that surcease needed it badly besides a duke who worked steel was intensely popular among his steelworking commons duke delleste lord of ferrara modena este and reggio nellemilia needed that also ferrara stood between too many enemies in the shifting morass of italian politics in the year of our lord ferrara had no natural defenses like venice and no great allies all it had was the duke enrico dellestethe old fox as his populace called himand the support of that populace a page entered the forgeroom shouted above the steady hammering milord signor bartelozzi is here to see you he awaits you in the sword salon the duke nodded without stopping or even looking up from his work antimo will wait a few moments steel wont he forced himself to remain calm to finish the task properly if antimo bartelozzi had bad news he would have sent a messenger or simply sent a letter the fact that he needed to talk to the duke that could only mean good news about his grandchildren or news which was at least hopeful delleste lifted the bar of hammered metal with the tongs and lowered it into the quenching tank he nodded at the blacksmith standing nearby who stepped forward to continue the work the duke hung his tools neatly and took the towel from the waiting factotum the old fox he murmured as he dried the sweat tonight i just feel old the room the duke entered was spartan stoneflagged cool its only furnishings a wooden table which leaned more to sturdiness and functionality than elegance and a single chair simple and not upholstered hardly what one would expect the lair of the lord of the cities of ferrara este modena and reggio nell emilia to look like on the wall above the fireplace was a solitary piece of adornment and that was absolutely typical of delleste it was a sword hung with crimson tassels the pommel showed faint signs of generations of careful polishing the wall opposite the fireplace contained an entire rack of such weapons the old fox sat at the table and looked at the colorless man standing quietly in the corner antimo bartelozzi had the gift of being the last person in a crowd of two that youd ever notice he was also utterly loyal as the duke well knew bartelozzi had had ample opportunity to betray the delleste in times past the duke used other spies and agents for various other tasks antimo bartelozzi was for family affairs to the duke that was the only thing more precious than good swordsteel greetings antimo tell me the worst the lean grayhaired man smiled always the same the worst first the worst is that i did not find them milord either one nor do i have knowledge of their whereabouts the old fox shuddered trying to control the relief which poured through him my grandsons are alive bartelozzi paused its not certain to be honest milord all ive established is that marco valdosta was last seen the night your daughter lorendana was killed and i had established that much two years ago but i did find this the dukes agent reached into a small pouch he handed over a small sheathed knife whose pommel was chased and set with an onyx this dagger is a signed ferrara blade that turned up in the thieves market at mestre the seller was questioned he admitted to having bought it from one of the jesolo marshbandits the duke hissed between his teeth he took the blade and unscrewed the pommel looked at the tiny marks on the tang this was marco valdostas blade he looked at the wall at the empty space next to one of the hereditary blades on its rack the space for a small dagger given to a boy next to the swordstill in its placedestined for the man his grandson marcos blades and you dont take this as another bad sign perhaps whoever stole the dagger from him killed the boy the old fox eyed bartelozzi under lowered eyebrows you found one of the bandits questioned him antimo nodded they robbed the boy yes beat him badly badly enough that the bandits assumed he would not survive but there are rumors the jesolo is full of rumors snorted delleste still its something he moved toward the bladerack tell me that i can return it to its place antimo you know the tradition behind him he heard a little noise as if bartelozzi was choking down a sarcastic reply the duke smiled grimly no ferrara blade once given to a delleste scion may be returned until it is blooded you may hang it in the rack milord that blade is well and truly blooded i slid the bandit into the water myself the thiefvendor also there was barely enough blood left in them to draw the fish delleste hung the dagger and turned back and the younger boy sforzas bastard antimo bartelozzi looked decidedly uncomfortable milord we dont know that the condottiere was his father spare me growled the duke my younger grandson was the spitting image of sforza by the time he was ten you knew my slut daughter as well as i did she was enamored of all things milanese and sforza was already then the greatest captain in viscontis service antimo studied delleste for a moment as if gauging the limits of his masters forbearance it was a brief study for bartelozzi the old foxs limits were almost nonexistent that is a disservice to her memory milord and you know it perfectly well to begin with her devotion was to the montagnard cause not to milan your daughter was a fanatic yes a traitor not really the dukes jaws tightened but he did not argue the point bartelozzi continued nor was she a slut somewhat promiscuous yes a slut no she rebuffed duke visconti himself you know shortly after she arrived in milan quite firmly by all accountseven derisively a bold thing for a woman to do who had cast herself into milans coils that may well have been the final factor which led visconti to have her murdered once she had fallen out of favor with her lover sforza not even visconti would have been bold enough to risk his chief military captains anger delleste restrained his own anger it was directed at the daughter anyway not the agent besides it was an old thing now a dull ember not a hot flame and that core of honesty which had always lain at the center of the old foxs legendary wiliness accepted the truth of bartelozzis words the dukes daughter lorendana had been headstrong willful given to wild enthusiasms recklessyes all those in which the duke admitted privately she was not really so different from the duke himself at an early age except that enrico delleste had possessed even as a stripling prince more than his share of acumen and he had been lucky bartelozzi was continuing all we know about the younger boy is what we learned two years ago he was thrown out of theodoro mantestas care once the true story of lorendanas death leaked out mantesta not surprisingly was terrified of milanese assassins himself your youngest grandson seems to have then joined the canalbrats damn mantesta anywayi would have seen to his safety for a moment he glowered remembering a night when he had slipped into venice incognito the duke of ferrara was no mean bladesman himself theodoro mantesta had been almost as terrified of him as he had been of milanese assassins almost but not quite and for good reason in the end delleste had let him live the old fox waved his hand irritably i know all this antimo shortly thereafter you discovered that a child very like him from the poor description we had was killed about three weeks later and while it wasnt certainhundreds of poor children live under the bridges and pilings of veniceit seemed logical enough that the victim was my youngest grandson so tell me what you have learned since if you please antimo smiled what i have learned since milord is that the boy whose throat was slit had actually died of disease the day before the dukes eyes widened who would be that cunning not my grandson he was only twelve at the time two ladies by the name of claudia and valentina would be that cunning milord bartelozzi shook his head you would not know them but in their own circles they are quite famous notorious it might be better to say tavern musicians officiallyexcellent ones by all accountbut also thieves excellent thieves by reputation and according to rumor shortly thereafter the two women gained an accomplice a young boy about twelve ive not laid eyes on him myself mind youneither have any of my agents the boy seems to have been well trained in stealth but i have gotten a description quite a good one in fact the description came from a former mercenary in sforzas service could be one of the wolfs byblows as he put it lord knows hes scattered them across italy the duke of ferrara closed his eyes allowing the relief to wash over him again it made sense yesit all made sense his youngest grandson had been a wily boyquite unlike the older as if all of the legendary cunning of delleste had been concentrated in the one at the expense of the other combined alas with the amorality of the father sforza even when the boy had been a toddler the duke had found his youngest grandson troubling his musings were interrupted by bartelozzi antimos next words brought the dukes eyes wide open again the two women who may have succored your grandson are also reputed to be strega genuine strega too not peddlers and hucksters the reputation seems well founded from what i could determine strega why would they care what happened to the bloodline of valdosta and delleste bartelozzi stared at him after a moment delleste looked away away and down because venice is the best refuge of the strega he answered his own question has been for centuries if venice falls a brief shudder went through his slender but still muscular body i have been not myself antimo these past two years all my offspring dead it was too much his most trusted agents nod was one of understanding but pitiless for all that you have other offspring milord of position if not of blood all of ferrara depends upon you venice too i suspect in the end there is no leadership in that city that can compare to yours if you begin leading again like a duke and not a grieving old man delleste tightened his lips but accepted the reproof it was a just one after all true he said curtly then after a moment his lips began to curve into a smile hearing bartelozzis sigh of relief he allowed his smile to broaden you think it is time the old fox returned eh past time murmured bartelozzi the storm clouds are gathering milord have been for some time as you well know if venice is destroyed ferrara will go down with it the duke of ferrara began pacing about for all his age there was a spryness to his steps venice first i think that will be the cockpit he did not even bother to glance at bartelozzi to see his agents nod of agreement so much was obvious to them both which means we must find an anchor of support in the city a great house which can serve to rally the populace of venice the current quality of venetian leadership is dismal but the population will respond wellas they have for a thousand yearsif a firm hand takes control he sighed regretfully doge foscari was capable once and still has his moments buthe is too old now if either of your grandsons is alive the old fox shook his head firmly not yet antimo let our enemies think the ancient house of valdosta is well and truly destroyed that will be our secret weapon when the time comes for the momentassuming they are still alivemy grandsons are far safer hidden amongst the poor and outcast of venice we could bring them here milord the duke hesitated his head warring with his heart but only for an instant before the head began shaking firmly not for nothing did that headthat triangular sharpjawed faceresemble the animal he had been named after no he said firmly as you said yourself antimo i have a responsibility to all of my offspring those of position as well as those of blood for a moment he paused in his pacing stood very erect delleste honor has always been as famous as its cunning without the one the other is meaningless bartelozzi nodded in obeisance as much as in agreement he shared in full measure that loyalty for which the retainers of delleste were also famous valdosta cannot serve for the moment the old fox resumed his pacing of the others brunelli is foul as you well know however cleverly that house has managed to disguise it dorma has potential but the head of the house is still too young unsure of himself petro dorma may surprise you milord the duke glanced at him you know something i dont bartelozzi shrugged simply an estimate nothing more delleste stared out the window which opened on to the little city of ferrara looked past the city itself to the lush countryside beyond perhaps antimo im not sure i agree petro dorma is a judicious man true enough and i think quite an honorable one but thats not enough a sword must have an edge also the duke sighed if only montescue theres the man with the right edge and for all his age the tested blade to hold it hearing bartelozzis little choke the duke smiled wryly dont tell me hes still trying to have my grandsons assassinated it seems so milord apparently the same rumors have reached him as well the old fox turned his head and gazed squarely upon his most trusted agent and adviser instruct me antimo in this matter i do not entirely trust myself bartelozzi hesitated then do nothing milord casa montescue has fallen on such bad times that old lodovico montescue will not be able to afford better than middling murderers andagain he hesitatedwe may as well discover now at the beginning of the contest how sharp a blade your grandsons will make the duke of ferrara pondered the advice for a moment then nodded spoken like a delleste see to it then antimo pass the word in venicevery quietlythat if either of my grandsons come to the surface we will pay well for whoever takes them under his wing until then they will have to survive on their own blades as you say must be tempered his lips tightened became a thin line those of a craftsman gauging his material no doubt iron would scream also if it could feel the pain of the forge and the hammer and the quenching tank no matter so is steel made part i june ad chapter the silhouette of the basilica of st mark was black against the paling predawn sky the pillar and the winged lion in the piazza san marco could just be made out in the bow of the gondola benito shifted uneasily looking at it figlio di una puttana woman he said trying to sound older than fourteen cant you get a move on itll be sunup before im home he wished his voice would stop cracking like that marco said it was just part of growing up he wished that that would stop too being bigger was no advantage for climbing or running and if he stopped growing he might stop being so hungry all of the time up on the stern the hooded oarsman ignored him moving slowly and steadily you want me to row this thing for you he demanded shut up she hissed you want to attract attention at this time of the morning only people in trouble are rushing benito had to acknowledge that it was true enough even now there were three other vessels moving on the grand canal all of them slowly he sighed i just need to get back home im supposed to see my brother she snorted if you hadnt held us up wed be the other side of campo san polo by now and you cant be in any more of a hurry to get back to whatever rathole you sleep in than i am to see the back of you i should never have agreed to take you benito huddled down in the bow this womans tongue was even sharperedged than maria garavellis the wind between the ornately facaded buildings was cold he was cold and as usual he was hungry it had been a fruitless night mercutio had let him down again he liked working jobs with mercutio his ideas were exciting daring and well crazy you always knew with any job he organized it was going to be nipandtuck skin of your teeth stuff and needing lots of luck but somehow mercutio always seemed to have that luck benito sighed mercutio also had the habit of not turning up for a job benito had sat waiting for four cold hours for him tonight and not a coppers profit to show for it he could have used some more coin all he had in the attic was a half crock of elderly fagioli stufata it was definitely past its best the beans were producing gas before they even hit his stomach his eye was caught by the body it bobbed in the dark water under the pilings as the tiny fish plucked at it that was a fine cloak a few knife slashes could be dealt with his jaw dropped the rich soft swollen white hand still had rings on it he turned to speak dont even look she hissed between clenched teeth but he started to point she hit his hand with the oar shut it there was such intensity in that quiet command that benito didnt even dare to glance at the corpse again they poled on in silence the bow of the shabby gondola cutting the oily still water here where it was sheltered from the predawn breeze most of venice was still sleeping when she spoke they were a good hundred yards past the corpse despini her voice shook slightly she was plainly shocked benito looked warily at her what a stray strand of long wavy coppercolored hair had found its way out from under her hooded cloak she pushed it back whatever this girl moved must be valuable that was a wellfed wrist gino despini he was one of my customers he had a booth down on the calle farnese sold love philters charms and amulets of protection against the french pox benito nodded sagely that was the sort of cargo she moved the frauds hedge magicians tricksters and petty strega around the campo ghetto didnt always want to declare their imports to the state or the church dangerous tricky cargoes but valuable so why didnt you want to stop get those rings or take him to his family she raised her eyes to heaven youre a fool whoever killed him could have sunk him if they just wanted him dead they didnt even rob him what does that mean she demanded benito knew he was out of his league here he was a good enough sneak thief but this he was wounded but escaped died and fell in the canal he ventured warily she shook her head you dont know anything do you boy if they left his body to float theyre not scared of the schiopettieri benito swallowed hard the schiopettieri were professional soldiers under the official command of venices signori di notte the lords of the nightwatch answerable to the senate of the great republic in effect they were the citys police force you didnt mess with them that spells someone with influence and power she continued whoever killed him obviously doesnt need money she pursed her lips there was a rumor about that he was more than what he seemed a strega mage proper not a charlatan he was left to float either as message or more likely as bait bait who did it he asked huskily this was deep dark water the woman shrugged maybe the servants of the holy trinity theyve been pretty active lately so have the agents of the council of ten maybe other strega but i dont think so they favor magic or poison hed been stabbed bait theyll take whoever comes to go on with their questioning if its the servants you know how they question people with knives and fire and prayers for your soul she raised an eyebrow and said sardonically you were thinking of sneaking back there werent you i didnt understand the boy answered humbly but katerina who told you my name she demanded fiercely captain della tomasso look while theyd been talking a flotilla of rowing boats had appeared and were coming along the grand canal rowing steadily in measured strokes the leading ones were definitely schiopettieri oarships merda katerina spat it must be a sweep weve got to get out of here she began to scull frantically pushing the gondola towards the mouth of a narrow canal benito got up hastily he was getting off the unfamiliar water and onto the buildings quickly theyll have blocked off the side canals kat right she pushed the boat into a group of tied up gondolas and small craft moored to poles at the waterdoor of the marblefaced mansion she dropped a loop over the bollard lie down little brother were poor boatkids whove lost our parents and have to sleep on the water benito looked askance at her but he lay down on the gondola ribs next to her she pulled a grubby piece of sailcloth over them she also tied a piece of cord to a knobbly yellow oilcloth parcel from the bow she dropped the parcel gently over the side down into the still water hastily she tied it off benito wondered what the hell cadging a ride across from guidecca had gotten him into he liked a bit of excitement but messing with people who knew people who were being killed by the servants was too much it was too much thought katerina lying on the ribs of the gondola here she was with a cargo that could get her burned at the stake even if they never picked it up well if it came to hard questioning they might get her name under that sort of questioning especially if they used magic they could find out everything unless like despini you had defenses that would kill first holy mother she must not be caught the dishonor to the family if she were it would kill the old man every time shed gone out shed known it was a risk but they could simply not afford to lose another cargo and who else could they trust somehow the casa montescue secure for all these years had been infiltrated there was no other explanation she looked up they were tied up beside the imperial embassy across the canal was the pretentious casa brunelli pah nouveau riche curti they had glass windows instead of the varnished silk that real longi case vecchie used the kind of neighborhood that the schiopettieri would not take kindly to finding loiterers in even if they didnt pick up the parcel dangling from the bow she looked across not without a certain envy at the ornate marblefaced building she was startled to realize there was someone on the thirdfloor balcony of the casa brunelli lie still kat said between clenched teeth to the wrigglesome urchin next to her there is someone on the balcony up there to give him credit the boy didnt peer he froze who how would i know you you canalbrat its hard to make out anything in this light a man by the way he stands he must have seen us come in whispered the boy kat could feel him tense next to her getting ready to run stay still she hissed benitos dark eyes flickered nervously then she felt him tense again theyre stopping theyre coming here kat reached for the slipknot on the cord how do you know the boys eyes darted you can see the reflection in the window he mumbled it was true enough the two schiopettieri oarships were slowing backing water the vessels behind them werent venicebuilt shed swear to that whoever made them needed lessons in shipbuilding tubs but tubs bright with steel so much so that it was a miracle they didnt tip over that wouldve emptied all the armored men in bright triplecrossenameled breastplates and their gilttrimmed helmets into the canal benito and katerina gaped forgetting the watcher on the balcony the teutonic knights of the holy trinity the fabled arm militant of the pauline orders the soldiers of god who beat back the huns the norse and the various slavic and magyar pagans and heretics on the northern and eastern frontiers of christendom the borders of emperor charles fredriks holy roman empire rested squarely on their steel shoulders those breastplates were unmistakable a legend across the christian world and they were half feared as well as admired and respected by the southern and mediterranean folk who generally followed the petrine currents in the church what the hell are they doing here benito got it out seconds before kat his voice had more admiration in it than katerina montescue would have voiced going to the imperial embassy by the looks of it said katerina with relief benito too sounded more relaxed i always wanted to be a knight katerina shook her head fighting trolls and hellspawn in the frozen northlands dealing with pagan russian and tatar princes and their demons andeven worsethe heretic grand duchy of lithuania and the kingdom of hungary and their sorcerers and shamans ha its dark half the year up there and they look silly in that armor its no good anyway one of the new pistols from spain will put a ball right through it besides they take the sons of the nobility of the empire not canalbrats the boy looked militant im more than just a canalbrat my father was the holy grand metropolitan of rome himself snapped katerina and your mother was the duchess of milan and just a canalside puttana in her spare time now shut up they still wouldnt be pleased to find us here the schiopettieri would run us in and beat us up just for being in this part of town the boy bit his lip his dark eyes fumed at her but he lay still katerina turned her attention back to the pageant reflected in the windows of the casa brunelli with shock she recognized the file of graycassocked and hooded men filing out of the embassy onto the stonefaced landing even in the poor light there was no mistaking the white triple crosses on the backs of those cassocks the monastic servants of the holy trinity did not inspire the same awe as their sibling paulines the knights did they simply inspired fear and distrust especially for katerina montescue and they werent an unfamiliar sight in venice their war on the jews and the strega was not officially sanctioned by the doge on the other hand doge giorgio foscari was turning a very blind eye well at his age your thoughts started turning more to heaven than earth anyway and the servants claimed to be the custodians of the keys to heaven kat suppressed a chuckle that had gotten metropolitan michael very steamed up in the pulpit last mass rome and the holy grand metropolitan did not approve of the strident claims of the paulines a querulous elderly whiny voice sounded across the canal it rose above the soft sonorous sound of the plainsong that the servants of the holy trinity were beginning to chant my best cassock i wanted to wear it for this occasion someone hastily hushed the old monk as the boatloads of knights drew up to the quay a trumpet sounded sharp and bright steelclad figures disembarked from the boat and came up the steps they were in military array formed up around a palanquinlike structure which was borne by several of the hefty knights it was plainly heavy but too small to hold a person what are they carrying whispered benito how in the names of all the saints do you expect me to know katerina hissed savagely do you want me to go over and ask them benito sniffed theres no need to bite my head off its just that it looked like a chest there were big locks maybe it is treasure there was a thoughtfulness in that young voice that made katerina catch her breath and shake her head this boy was going to die young are you crazy dont even think of stealing from them dont even think of it two figures now left the tail of the procession one was a graycassocked and stooped monk the other was a woman true she wore a nuns habit but she walked like a duchess her head held up with an arrogant tilt that revealed a silhouetted prow of an aristocratic nose sister humility whispered the incorrigible canalbrat next to her katerina had to bite back a snort of laughter then when she realized what the reflectedinglass figures were doing it made her forget all about laughing they were getting into a small gondola with a single arquebusarmed schiopettieri a knight carried a small brazier over to the vessel another brought a box from their ship katerina knew enough of magical practice to guess that they were about to conduct a rite of enclosure they could hardly fail to pass her gondola heaven alone knew what was inside the parcel from ascalon that she was supposed to deliver but having it inside a magical circle of enclosure was not a good idea she pulled the cord and the slipknotted parcel went down to the mud benito had plainly also seen what was happening over the side quick katerina shook her head i cant swim you dont have to benito snapped impatiently you can hold on to the boat come on be quick and quiet about it theyll be here any minute he slipped over the side and into the water between the boats like an oiled rat nervously hastily katerina followed icy cold canal water slid up her legs soaking into her petticoats her heavy twilled bombazine dress was more resistant to water it bulged up around her like some clumsy bubble she clung to the gunwale here he whispered hoarsely pulling her hand take the bowrope she had to give up her precious hold on the gondola and flounder her head went under but she managed to grab the rope the bow came forward cracking into her head nearly stunning her quiet they waited in the water through the narrow gap between the canalboats she could see the windows of the casa brunelli they still provided a mirrorview the two watchers in the water could see the gondola with the monk nun and a slowly rowing schiopettieri come down the side canal the nun was chanting prayers waving the censer the monk had a pole with something on the end which he ran along the wall if it made a line it didnt show up in reflections benito pressed his mouth against her ear when they get to the edge of the boats you take a deep breath and hold it ill take you under start breathing deeply now when he did pull her under it was all she could do not to struggle frantically for the surface and they seemed to stay down forever then she felt benito tugupwards she bumped her head against the gondola again what was that sound the voice was male but high and cool the diction was faintly stilted as if this was a second language perhaps a fish monsignor sachs they shelter among the boats the voice of the schiopettieri was frightened respectful katerina trying to breathe quietly was not surprised the servants of holy trinity were terrifying enough without magic who do those boats belong to why are they here the man asked the nun continued her low melodious chanting as if the man had not spoken katerina could imagine the soldiers shrug even if she could not see it this was venice there were gondolas and skiffs everywhere they are for the staff of the embassy monsignor the foreign monk was plainly unimpressed they will no longer be able to use this door the embassy can only be entered by the portal have them moved he commanded and i am abbot sachs i will be addressed as such not by southern titles it didnt sound as if he approved of those either but at least their voices were getting farther away i will see to it abbot said the schiopettieri merda whispered benito we have to get out of here he started to pull on the gondola katerina shook her head wait she said quietly give it another minute theyre not far enough away yet so they waited in the water it seemed an eternity before they decided it was safe benito took a deep breath and ducked under the water then thrust up and hauled himself over the gunwale katerina tried to pull herself in her petticoats dress and sodden hooded cloak all impeded her even benitos hauling was not sufficient he let go and she fell back little bastardo then she realized hed let go in order to take the oar and push the gondola closer to the waterdoor he was quickthinking if inexpert with an oar there were slimy steps under the water dripping katerina was able to get back into her boat and flip the bowrope free she seized the oar from the inept benito and sent them out into the canal he could swim but not handle a boat as she turned the vessel with quick skilled movements of her feet and oar a movement caught the periphery of her vision someone up there shed forgotten about the watcher on the balcony of the casa brunelli he was watching impassive it was much lighter now and she could see him as clearly as he could doubtless see her dripping self the man was slight reddish haired with dark eyebrows that met to form a forbidding line a gaze like an eagle it was not a face that you could forget and it looked implacable she sculled hard it was not something which could be done too hastily without ending up in the water she nearly did that again why didnt he call out asked the wet benito once again huddled in the bow one of lifes little mysteries snapped katerina trying to keep her teeth from chattering sculling was an exercise which could leave you pretty warm but she still hadnt recovered from either the cold water or the fear however by the expression on the mans face she was sure that the only reason he hadnt called out was that he didnt want to be seen himself the largest of san marcos bells began to peal the dawn when it was still the arsenals marangona bell began to sound it would ring for some time calling the shipwrights carpenters and caulkers to work venice was stirring and kat was a long way from home she could hardly help being seen wet well at least she could get dry and she had other clothes she was probably better off than the boy but her cargo was somewhere in the canal mud outside the imperial embassy bad she couldnt come back that evening or the next the solstice feast with its celebrations ridottos and balls would go on for two more days she would just have to pray that the heavy parcel would not wash with the tide and that the boy would keep his mouth shut worse and because she had never learned to swim shed have to ask this shivering canalbrat to get it back for her worst damnation chapter it was a racasse a scorpionfish the only catch of the day and it had to be a godforsaken racasse marco valdosta stared at the reedwoven fish trap it was the best and newest one he owned he stared at the contents which flopped around getting its long poisonous spines nicely wedged then cursed a curse which was long literate and alliterative the words did not match the speaker benitos older brother was a painfully thin ragged sixteenyearold dressed only in tattered breeches balanced on his haunches on a scrap of raft cobbled together from waterlogged flotsam a marshdwellerone of the mixture of destitutes refugees and criminals who scratched out a living among the islands and the mosquitosinging jesolo marshes to the northeast the coastal lagoon that sheltered venice was pleasant enough around the city but closer to the mainland away from the cleansing ebb and flow the marshes that fringed the lagoon were an ooze of thick stinking muds and stagnant brackish waters the townsfolk of venice called the people who lived there loco marco looked it his dark hair was nearly waist length indifferently clean and held back in a tail with a twist of marshgrass his lean tanned face was smudged with mud above the almond eyes and along the cheekbones this was not the sort of creature from which one expected anything intelligible much less intelligent marco was flat out of patience with the day which was hot and stank with his luck which smelled almost as bad as the day and with the world which smelled worse than his luck for anyone else on this muddy lagoon for anyone else fishing between the quays of this sinking stinking city a racasse would be cause for rejoicing they were fine eating and you could sell the spines there was always a market for poison all you needed was a priest to club the fish with and some care andif it was stuck in a fish trapa good long harpoon but marco didnt have a harpoon there was no way to kill the fish in that trap short of clubbing the painstakingly woven structure to reedsplinters he had a knife of sorts but it was no more than a splinter of stolen murano glass with one end dipped in a caulkers tarbucket and wrapped with string all he could do was to stare at the threetimesdamned thing wedging itself more and more tightly in the depths of his fish trap and try not to cry the only catch of the whole day useless and he hadnt eaten since yesterday morning damn the saints and damn the trap his only hope was the chance that the fish might relax when it died enough to let him slide it out or if he could find a fisherman with a harpoon he would lose half the value of his catch but he might get something he poled the raft toward the wharves in hopes of finding a fisherman there was just the barest possibility there would be someone there with a bit of a coin or something edible to tradehed willingly swap fish trap and all for a little bread he hadnt had any real bread in months real breadthe smell of bread bakingused to drive him nearly out of his head mama would laugh at himtell him hed never be a fighter he wasnt carnivore enough marco wanted to be a healer not a fighter mama had been a fighter but meaner people had killed her he almost missed the shadow under the wharf pilings that moved wrong almost but living with the marshfolk gave you paranoia if nothing else and when the shadow lunged down from its perch on a crossbeam he already had in hand the only thing on the raft that could count in a fight the trap that was full of scorpionfish the trap wasnt much more substantial than a marshdwellers promise it shattered as it hit the man all dressed in dark colors he was real clothes and not rags and his face covered the man got a spine in one eye and the rest in the hand that came up to fend it off the dagger in his other hand flew into the water he was already insane with pain when he hit the raft which promptly capsized but marco had been ready for that he dove with the push of the raft behind him took off into deep water and shoved off the mucky bottom then came up with a rush that got him halfway back onto the raft before his attacker finished his death agony the man floated a dark bundle that twitched and rolled being slowly pulled back under the wharf by the current no more danger from him for sure marco got himself back onto his raftand started to shake a manwaiting there like he knew it was part of marcos regular circuit man dressed all dark with his face covered and a knife in his hand man that came down on him like he knew exactly what he was doing who he was going for assassin had to be they were hunting himafter two years they were hunting him now theyd found him again and theyd get him like theyd got mama oh god marco poled back towards the jesolo marshes in a fog of panic hunger forgotten casting glances back at the wharf to see if anyone had found the body if there were any more of them after him but all he could see was the normal working small craft and a few of the other marshdwellers out bobbing on the lagoonmost of them too busy fishing or dozing in the sun to take any notice the rest not wanting to notice trouble lest it fall on them too got to hide that was all he knew his pulse pounding in his ears and his knees wobbling with weariness he pushed the scrap of the raft into the marsh where the high yellow reeds made a maze you could easily get lost in he brought it in up against a particular reedisletwhich he and chiano knew wasnt an islet at all he looked around again then crouched and listened nothing out of the ordinary sea birds mewling reeds whispering nothing else he jumped off the raftwater was just a bit more than waist deep here though the bottom sucked at his feetand picked up an edge of the islet it was a kind of basket made to look like a hummock with reeds sticking out of it resting on a much larger raft marco heaved his little raft atop the big one climbed onto them and lowered the basket down to cover himself and his home again there was just enough room under the roof to sit hunched over with his chin on his kneesbut it was safer than anywhere else in the swamp especially with them out after him only he and old sophia and chiano had these hideaways that he knew of chiano taught the two of them how to make the hideouts the halfcrazy old man swore they were called blinds in the camarque and that you used them to shoot birds from marcos hide was the reason he was still alive hed waited out many a locogang hunt in his and no end of searches by big gianni but would it hold against them whoever they were mama had had plenty of safeguards but none of them had helped her ends of reeds tickled his back and arms as he pushed the thought of discovery resolutely away no he wouldnt think about it he needed to think about something else but songs werent any goodthe only ones he could remember right now were all grim think get calm keep your mind occupied or youll panic he began breathing deeply and quietly willing his pulse to slow making himself a bit calmer telling himself he had nothing to worry about the raft bobbed a little if anyone came by marco would know it by the disturbance of the water there was no way anyone could get near him without him knowing as usual when he wanted to relax and calm down marco relied on mathematics he loved figures and calculations nowif you started with a load of salted fish say forty barrels say two hundred thirtyseven fish to a barrel and you transported up the po with your costs going up but the worth of those fish going up the farther you went the heat under the basket the bobbing of the raft the close air and exhaustion all conspired to put him to sleep it began again benito tugged at his elbow si marco responded absently he was doing mamas accounts and thered been a lot of business today mama said i should stay with theodoro overnightmarco can he be on the ship up to milan please dreamskip again stumbling around in water and mud up to his waist lost in the dark and cryingthat was how the marshdwellers had found him and beat him up and robbed him of everything but his breeches and the paper he kept clutched in one hand he lay in shallow mud and water freezing dazed hurting and crying he woke cryingbut silently silently hed learned since then never to make a noise he wiped the tears from his face with the tail of his hair and listened nothing and it was getting on towards sunset judging by the red that filtered through the basket and the gotobed sounds the marshbirds were making oh godhe was supposed to meet his younger brother benito at dawn he had to warn him that they were on the hunt again benito could be in as much danger as marco but first he had to find chiano and sophia they would probably be out on their usual squatthe bit of dry sand bar off the end of the lido it had formed during the last really big storm and likely the next one would take it away again but for now it provided a good spot for clams and driftwood old sophia and chiano as unlikely a couple as ever decorated the face of the lagoonsophia maybe forty and looking four hundred chiano ten years older and looking thirty she had been a bargees wife until a fifteenhundredton roccaforte with a following wind behind it ran down their small barge and sent her man and kids to the bottom chiano claimed to be everything from a stranded sicilian seaman to the prince of damascus she was the closest thing to a chirurgeon and healer the marshes boasted and so was inviolate from most of the mayhem that raged among the marshdwellers he proclaimed himself to be the one true prophet of the great mother herself he was treated with superstitious care although marco was sure that if chiano hadnt lived with sophia the marshdwellers would have burned him out the two of them had found marco in pain and half deliriousand for some reason known only to themselves picked him up and carted him back to sophias hovel and nursed him back to a semblance of health theyd taught him how to survive during that vague sixmonth period during which shock had kept him pliant enough to adapt hed paid them back for their care by sharing the scroungings that benito gave him and writing down chianos prophecies chiano induced visions with fly agaric and was obviously then in no condition to record his prophecies himself why he wasnt dead twenty times overwell it was a mystery like where chiano came from in the first place or got the paper or what he did with the pages after marco filled them with the holy words in his careful clear hand chiano kept him safe too chiano wasnt big but the fear that he really might be a witch helped chiano keep the swampdwellers who wanted a boy at bay the swamp gangs wanted runaway boys as their slaves big gianni wanted them forother things all of them were crazy mostly from chewing blue lotos and no telling what they would do to someone who got between them and what they wanted but chiano stood by him until marco was big enough to fight back and canny enough to hide from what he could not fight chiano and sophia were where he expected to find them they had lit a small fire of driftwood and were grilling fish spitted on reeds over it they looked like images out of hell red lit weatherandagetwisted faces avidly watching their cooking dinner marco didnt make much noise but they heard him anyway that you boy chiano called into the dark si chiano i got trouble boy the world got trouble replied chiano easily neveryoumind whats the matter this time big gianni one of the gangs wish it was just that somebody jumped me out at the wharfa man dressed all in dark clothes with his face covered and waiting like he knew i was coming he had a knife i think theyve found me damn that be trouble and moren ye need sophia coughed you got any notion who they be no more than i ever did could be anybody slavetakers schiopettieri even milanese chiano growled damn it all no not milanese never milanese milanese would be trying to help me not kill me ill believe that when i believe sophia hushed chiano before he could say any more fine marco said but whose mama was a montagnard agent huh who saw duke viscontis agents coming and going so who should know it was an old argument and whose mama was probably killed by the order of the duke visconti she served hmm marco leave it boy i know more politics than you do still i notice you may have thought strega but you didnt say it you off to give benito a warning got to hes in danger too boy this was another old argument sophia chimed in forcefully no buts yere young this aint no life for th young well be all right shes got the right of it boy there was a suspicion of mist in chianos slightly crazed eyes the words of the goddess are complete now thanks to you you go chiano claimed the words were complete about once a month look ill be back same as always benito wont have any safe place for me and i wont put danger on those as is keeping him for the first time in this weekly litany chiano looked unaccountably solemn somehowi dont think sonot this time well times wasting boy be offor they might find benito before you do sophias face twisted comically then as she glanced between marco and their dinner she plainly felt obliged to offer him some and just as plainly didnt really want to have to share the little they had you eaten she asked reluctantly marcos stomach churned the fear and its aftermath made the very thought of food revolting grazie but no im fine she smiled relieved off wiye then yed best hurry marco went finding the way back to his raft and poling it out into the black open water of the lagoon in the distance were the lights of venice but the tide was out he would have to pole the channels at least coming back he would be able to run with the turn of the tide at dawn lots of lights in the city tonightlots of noise marco blessed it all for it covered his approach then rememberedand shame on himself for not remembering beforethat it was solstice feast what night of the feast it was he couldnt remember his only calendars were the moon and stars these days and the seasons by the noise probably well into the festival but that meant benito would be delayed by the crowds on the bridges and walkways that might prove a blessing it gave him a chance to check all around their meeting place under the wharf for more of them he poled all over beneath the wharf between the maze of pilings keeping all his senses alert for anything out of the norm there wasnt anyone lying in ambush that he could find not by eye nor ear nor scent so he made the raft fast and climbed up into their meeting place among the crossbeams out near the end of the wharf the first time theyd met hereafter marco had slipped into the town with his heart pounding like an overworked drum and passed theodoro a note to give to benitothey hadnt said much benito had just wrapped his arms around his brother like hed never let go and cried his eyes sore and his voice hoarse marco had wanted to cry toobut hadnt dared benito would have been shattered that was the way the first few meetings had gone but boys are resilient creatures before too long benito was begging for marcos stories again and the tears only came at partingand then not at all but now the stories included another sethow they would find the agents of duke visconti get mamas message to them the original paper was long gone but the contents resided intact in marcos headand what marco memorized was there for good and all that was why mama had taken him everywhere with herwhen shed ask later hed recite what had been said and done and just as a precaution marco had made plenty of copies of that paper over the last two years he made a new one as soon as the previous copy began deteriorating and kept it with him at all times mostly hidden on his raft one day theyd get that message back to milanand the visconti would rescue them take them home to milan and train them to be noblemen benito hadnt liked that story as much as the tales about the steelworks in ferrara and the doings of their grandfather the famous old fox but it had comforted marco when had benito started scrounging for him marco wrinkled his brow in thought and picked at the splintery beams under him staring at the stars reflected in the wavelets in the harbor must have been that winterthat was it when hed showed up as usual in nothing but his trousers shivering and pretending he wasnt cold benito had looked at him sharply then cuddled up real close and not just for his own comfort hed put his little body between marco and the wind next meeting benitod brought a woolen cloakold faded snagged and torn but better than anything marco could get in the jesolo after that hed never come to a meeting emptyhanded though marco refused to ask him for anything lord knew he needed those meetings himself needed the comfort needed to hold someone to talk to somebody sane chiano and sophia were only sane sometimes hed needed company even more than the material comforts benito brought and he needed those desperately he waited and waited but before the largest bell at san marco pealed he had to leave to cross the lagoon the uncertainty and fear it brought gnawed at him as he always did at times like this he thought about magic chiano was a magiciana master of his craft if one believed the stories he told when he was around marco and felt no need to be cautious or the cheap rotgut he brewed went to his head perhaps no one but marco and sophia did though because he never used magic much anymore too dangerous he said and it went without saying that he was probably right someone had certainly tried to kill chiano leaving him wandering senseless in the marshes and his magic hadnt protected him any of course if the people whod beaten him had been wearing steel armor his magic wouldnt have been much use against them chiano claimed that peopleother magicianscould tell when magicians were casting a spell what kind it was where the magician was and even who was doing the casting that was why it was too dangerous for him to use magic unless there was no other choice but then there was marco marco could be a magician thats what chiano said he was perfectly willing to teach marco everything he knew there was just one little problem with that chiano was strega and marco was christianand not just any christian but one who had been indoctrinated by his mother in the pauline creed it was a sin for any pauline who was not an ordained priest to dabble in magic for only a priest was sufficiently armored in holiness to withstand the blandishments of the evil one who was always on the watch for magicians to tempt them into using their powers for selfish purposes it was according to everything marco had been taught a short step from selfishness into real black sin and it was doubly triply impossible for a true christian to even think of using strega magic marco was already deep enough in sin as it was associating with the pagans but life would have been so much easier with the help of a little magic a little magic to tease the fish into his traps a little magic to keep him warm in the winter a little magic to protect him no he told himself that was temptation and behind temptation was the evil one surely god was watching himwell maybe not god but an angel anywaywatching and waiting to see if he fell and if he fell washing his hands of marco who was not strong enough to resist so minor a temptation but oh it was hard hard to resist at times like these the sounds of solstice feast drifted over the water over there people thronged the waterways the streets the plazas everyone wearing some sort of mask even if they couldnt afford a costume people who had saved all year for this time were stuffing themselves with fatty sausages bread rich bean soup salame mortadella cotechino stillsteaming loaves of ciabbata thick fragrant zuppa di fagioli dont think of food with lent on the horizon they were throwing themselves into pleasure pleasure leads to temptation and temptation to sin he reminded himself but even mamas stern delleste family had enjoyed solstice feast and when mama had come here to venice she had made certain that at solstice feast there had been masks and costumes for all three of them and that at least once during the three days of the festival they had all gone out together to see the stiltwalkers the jugglers the musicians even a puppetshow or a play she always seemed to know what great house was giving away food after a feast toowonderful food bread as white as could be soaked with the juice of the meat the great folks had eaten piecrust heavy with gravy with bits of mushroom and venison clinging to it the broken sweetmeats of marchpane and sweet cake dont think of food faintly the sound of singing floated over the marsh and marco bit his lip overwhelmed for a moment by loneliness dont think of mama either there were thousands of people over there across the lagoon and somewhere among them was benito probably enjoying himself as only benito could with or without money with never a thought for the death that might be even now stalking his path chapter you are afraid old man the undine called etheria stared at chiano with her flat golden eyes and challenged him to deny his fear he couldnt he could only hang his head and nod i am afraid he admitted it was always better to admit the truth to the elemental creatures at least the ones that he had regular congress with some of them were damnably good at ferreting out lies he stared at his dirty bare feet at the grasses and reeds of the hummock on which he perched and heard the undine sigh you should be afraid she said grudgingly and he looked up she settled her arms and upper back against the hummock across from him looking like some odd and exotic courtesan relaxing upon the divan in her salon her hair was just beginning to dry along her hairline and it frizzed out in little filamentous green kinked strands tell me please he asked humbly humility it was a new emotion to him or rather new to the person he had begun to reassemble from the bits and pieces of his past he remembered the confidence bordering on arrogance what do the christians say pride goeth before a fall etheria didnt show emotions in the way that a human would for the undines face was less mobile more fishlikebut she was clearly as afraid as he was firstthere are things evil things that can change their shape in the lagoon snooping about the jesolo and in the canals there have always been such things but more often now and much much more evil at first we think they looked for you but you worked little magic very little and they may believe you are no more now they prowl more freelywhen we do not find them first she bared her sharklike teeth they are no match for us but we think that one day perhaps soon something stronger will come chiano shuddered why the undine studied him there is more blood in the water of late more bodies there is more fear on the water we can taste it hear it in the voices of the fishermen the boatmen the world of you humans is fragmenting and we do not know why she licked her lips but not in anticipation when you mortals are at war we suffer too for your world affects ours as below so above as above so below chiano sighed he knew whatever happened in the spirit world was reflected in the material world and vice versa if there was trouble here below there would be trouble in their world as well if something evil came to prey upon humans evil that preyed upon those who were not human would be attracted unnatural death brought unnatural destruction the silvanican they tell me anything more he asked at last when it was clear that etheria had nothing more to give him perhaps i know of one who will come if i do call her and you might be wise not to call one yourself at last the undines expression softened it is little enough for all that you have done for me and mine he reached for the taloned hand she offered there will be no talk of debts between us sisterofthewaters perhaps when you have found yourself again the undine said firmly you must find yourself again she took her cool hand from his patted him on the head as if he was a child and slipped beneath the water left to await the silvani chiano shook like a reed in the wind again again that call to find myself his memories were still clouded there were still key fragments missing things that might protect him so that he could work magics safely again he had known so muchand now it was all in pieces shattered and somehow he had to put the pieces together again someone had feared him enough to want him dead and the selfconfident andyes arrogantperson he remembered being was the sort who could attract such enemies he who was grimas of stregheria the master of the three magics of stars moon and earthyes evil would come looking for him and he was bound to combat it but he was a warrior whose sword lay shattered his shield broken in two and his courage beaten to the ground but he could pray he could still pray carmina agenoria help me find my skills again fortuna guard me nortia give me back my memories fana and fanus tana and tanus jana and janus restore what i once had and oh aradia help me protect this place again he hugged his knees to his chest and rocked back and forth in an agony of fear and longingthe longing to be himself again and the fear of what must surely follow if he ever regained what he had lost he didnt notice the silvani until she brushed against his hair and blew into his face to attract his attention then he looked up if he had not had such an affinity with watercreatures the silvani surely would have been his favorites they appeared as lovely girls not more than two feet tall dressed all in red and winged this one hovered just barely above the water wings blurring to keep her there and regarded him with wide eyes what would you old man she whispered i think i know you i wish that i remembered he replied sadly justof your courtesy what do you know of the evil our friend tells me is abroad in the city more than i wish to she replied in a breath something terrible has come bound in a strong box of iron and guarded by men in steel hedged about with spell and sword we dare draw no nearer to it than the island on which it dwells for once he felt a stirring of hope there were enough christian mages in the city surely there was no need for one broken old man if it is hedged about he began the hedges are peculiar the silvani said frowning severely and among the guardians at least one is unclean perhaps more the silvani looked so human it was easy to read their expressions and this one assumed an air of pleading let me speak for those of the air the silvani the laura the folletti and follettoyou must come again into your powers the path of the future is shrouded and the one who veils it from us is she shivered and clearly was not willing to say more well he could hardly blame her he suspected he knew the name she would not speak even though he could not remember it himself did not indeed want to remember it but he had a momentary image of something huge and monstrous squatting in a dark forest littered with rotting tree stumps and shattered bones devouring the image fled or perhaps he fled from it thank you he said his spirits sinking there was no choice then it would be more of the rue and the fennel and the fly agaric more of the visions to sort through looking for what was memory and what was hallucination the silvani took his thanks as a farewell and vanished leaving him once more alone chiano remained on the hummock for some time thereafter thinking through his course of action by sunset he had come to one definite conclusion he would have to take steps to protect marco he could sense that the boy would not remain in the jesolo for much longer in the marshes chiano had been able to shield the boy as well as shelter him the marsh locos were afraid of chianochiano and his undine friends the undines would not voluntarily leave the water true and so what no dweller in the jesolo could avoid approaching the water within easy reach of a lurking undine not even crazed and vicious big gianni was willing to risk their anger but if marco returned to the city the undines would be of no use the elemental creatures rarely even entered the canals for they found the citys waters very unpleasant and they would not be able to protect the boy anyway from the perils he would encounter there not now for a certainty venice would have been dangerous for marco under any circumstances but now with a new assassination attempt having been launched against him the city was ten times more dangerous than ever chianos memory was still too fragmented to understand the exact nature of that danger but in truth that hardly mattered chiano had long ago understood marcos true identity for that boy with that lineage deadly threats could come from any direction no the undines would no longer make suitable guardians city assassins were not marsh locos they did not have to perch by the water every day for their sustenance and chiano was not ready yetif he would ever beto return himself so practical steps if necessary bloody steps and he had the perfect instrument for the task right here at hand in the marshes in that too he understood the goddess was giving him a sign and a gentle warning no more softness he even understood to a degree the goddesss insistent and unusual hardness marco had to be protected not so much for his own sake but for that of venice chiano wasnt sure exactly whyyetbut he knew it was so from the very first moment he had laid eyes on marco he had seen the great shadow which the slender boy cast in the spirit world venice would need that shadow some day of that he was certain and he was certain of it because chiano himself cast a similar shadowor had once at least but never as wide never as broad never as deep chiano sighed he knew what to do and how to do it even though that doing was distasteful even in the end perhaps wicked no more softness old man oh yes and hed gotten his little tail well scorched had the former swiss mercenary turned fanatic assassin fortunato bespi had been dying when the undines had fished him out and brought him to chiano it would have made a pretty wager whether shock or drowning would have gotten him first neither did chiano and sophia had patched him up and kept him dosed against fever he had been bleeding from blade wounds and burned all over from what chiano and sophia had been able to piece together from the mans semiincoherent ravings he had fought off his assailants until they set fire to the house he had barricaded himself in even then apparently the man had been able to escape and try to find shelter in the marshes which were the traditional refuge for venices outcasts and outlaws eventually chiano had been able to glean his identity from the ravings and when he did had come very close to killing the man himself fortunato bespi of all men if sophia hadnt restrained him chiano would probably have rolled the man back into the waters this time with his throat slit and a weight around his ankles fortunato bespi even with his broken memory chiano had recognized the name immediately bespi was notorious perhaps the bestcertainly the most ruthlessmontagnard assassin in all of northern italy a fanatic by all accounts a true believer not simply a sellsword a man so dangerous that apparently the montagnards themselves had decided to kill him such at least was the explanation chiano had eventually deduced from the words bespi muttered in the days of his slow healing but sophia had been firm so she and chiano had hidden the badly injured man on one of the firmer reedislands under a basket made to look like a reedhummock sophia with her own eccentric theology had insisted that the spirits had brought bespi to them for a purpose and over time chiano had come to halfbelieve it himself and was glad he had for it was now clear that sophia had been right all along who better to guard marco from assassins than fortunato bespi it remained only to begin the transformation and he needed to begin immediately because the transformation would take many weeks to complete chiano found bespi where he expected to find himsquatting on his little island in the reeds staring at an insect bespi did very little else since hed finally begun recovering from his injuries he stared at everything studied the most insignificant things for hours on end a man betrayed by the cause he had devoted his life to was trying chiano understood to find meaning in something even if it was only the reason that an insect climbed a stalk of grass chiano made no attempt to approach silently it would have been pointless anyway whatever else bespi had lost he had certainly not lost his assassins reflexes and senses by the time chiano appeared in the little clearing where bespi squatted the former assassin was awaiting his arrival staring at him with the same intentness he stared at everything bespi wanted reasons chiano would give them to him he held out his hand you must begin to eat these also now with the other food we bring you bespis burnscarred face held no expression he simply stared at the fly agaric and belladonna in chianos outstretched palm he said nothing you are not who you think you are continued chiano softly i have discovered your true name and your true purpose in my visions now you must discover them also these will help he said nothing further simply allowed bespi the time to examine the possibility of reasons eventually as chiano had known he would bespi reached out and took the substances he did not ingest them simply held them in a loose fist but chiano knew that bespi would begin eating them with his next meal there was no expression on the assassins face chiano had not expected to see one bespi was an empty man chiano would fill him he felt some qualms in so doing but not many it was after all mostly a change in orientation not in nature this without a doubt was what the goddess had intended when shed caused bespi to be stranded out here chiano was sure of it he rose and began to turn away he would return later that night once bespi was well into the trance and begin the transformation bespis first and only words that day stopped him what is my true name then he asked in a whisper they told me it was fortunato bespi chiano hesitated then squared his shoulders and turned back to meet the hollow eyes they lied your true name is harrow a hard name murmured bespi his lips seemed to tighten but not with distaste so much asanticipation chapter kat closed the door of the church of st hypatia di hagia sophia behind her it shut off the riot of the feast quite as effectively as one of her old tutor dottore marinas silencespells would have done the thought as always brought melancholy she missed the dottore terribly still after all these years this was a church designed to be full of light and space the floor was of creamcolored stone the timbers and woodwork of light ash even the wall frescos were painted so that the background colors recalled the white buildings and brilliant blue skies of ancient alexandria and the windows held clear not colored glass there was discreet gilding everywhere so that the light of sun or candles was multiplied the moment she entered the place her spirits lifted with her footsteps echoing on the pale marble of the floor she walked slowly around the walls until she came to the choir stalls the whole church was empty except for herself and a few of the members of the hypatian order by their white linen robes they were all full siblings sworn to chastity and celibacy and very probably magicians somehow that made her feel safer than she had felt in days as if no matter what horrible magics were running loose along the canals and the back streets nothing could come in here she eased into the choir stalls and knelt with her hands clasped before her on the rail the familiar frescos of the life of saint hypatia glowing on the wall opposite her they werent the most beautiful frescos in venice theyd been painted by a mere pupil of bellini not the master himself they had heart though that was what kat loved about them lucia astolanza must have felt a special kinship for saint hypatia of alexandria to have infused so much life into them in a procession around the walls were the important events of hypatias life nearest the door at the back of the church in the first panel she lectured on neoplatonic philosophy to her pupils not yet a christian hypatia was shown garbed in grecian robes with a laurel wreath crowning her closebraided hair to represent her great learning her pupils at her feet unlike many painters lucia had given this part of hypatias life as much importance as the incidents after her conversion next of course the unknown shepherd boy appeared for one of her lectures debating her in front of her amazed pupils and ultimately convincing her and all of her pupils as well that christianity was a logical extension of her own beliefs lucia had interestingly enough portrayed the unknown shepherd with a faint beard the halo of sanctity and the dove of the holy spirit above his head hinting that the shepherd was actually a visitation of christ very daring rather an interpretation that kat herself favored the next panel was more complicated showing on the right side hypatia lecturing to her pupils on the melding of christianity with neoplatonism into a new and inspiring philosophy on the left their faces scowling were the archbishop of alexandria and his followers lucia had painted them in colors and shadows that suggested prejudice closemindedness and treachery as they plotted hypatias murder their bitterness at her pulling more and more of their own congregation into her new flock and undermining their views was masterfully portrayed the next panel the last on that wall showed the miracle hypatia being surrounded on the steps of the great library of which she was the librarian by the followers of the archbishop they carried razorsharp shards of clam and oyster shells in their hands which they intended to use to slice her to ribbons hypatia stood facing them calmly lips parted presumably in prayer she was not praying for herself she prayed for them she prayed that they should receive hagia sophia holy wisdomthe truth as only a neoplatonist would mean it the first panel on the altar wall showed the moment of the miracle itself the moment when hypatias prayer was answered and god shown in the form of hundreds of rays of painstakingly applied gold leaf emanating from a cloud above hypatias head touched the minds of the wouldbe murderers they saw the truth only too surely all the truth about everything in the world all at once shoved into their narrow little minds until their skulls practically cracked with it lucia showed this with the shards of shell falling from their hands the bulging eyes the slackened mouths the knees bent in a way that suggested they were losing physical as well as mental balance hypatia was in the same pose still as in the panel before but the dove of the holy spirit hovered over her now kat had more than once thought that lucia had painted just the faintest of smiles on her lips and a knowing glint in her eyes kat wondered as she had before how much of the scene depicted was truly accurate from things which she remembered dottore marina telling her she suspected that the defeat of hypatias enemies had probably been a lot messier and more complicated than the artists portrayal of it and involved more in the way of intrigue and maneuverperhaps even violencethan the purely spiritual portrayal of the victory which was depicted on the wall of the church farther down the wall behind kat were the john chrysostom panels the first showed hypatia in her study writing to her fellow christian philosopher the two had formed an alliance a meeting of minds that would steer the course of the christian church from that moment again kat suspected that the portrayals were sanctified quite a bit with all the rough edges smoothed away she knew for one thingher former teacher had told her oncethat chrysostoms bigotry against jews had been the cause of frequent clashes between him and hypatia the famous alliance between the two theologians had not been as harmonious and troublefree as the frescoes made it seem the fact that the figure of the prophet muhammad was included in the panel alongside the jews and pagans made it obvious to kat that the artist had given scant heed to picayune historical accuracy muhammad had not even been born until a century after hypatias death she smiled for a moment she thought that most historical accounts were probably like that cleaned up as it were she leaned back and studied the ceiling in the fresco above lucia showed hypatia silverhaired but still beautiful being welcomed into heaven by the dove surrounded by the ancient prophets christ and the madonnaand muhammad againalong with a host of angels peris and figures that bore more than a passing resemblance to plato socrates and other pagan philosophers she held in her hands the library that she had guarded all her life the library that would have been burned to the ground if not for the miracle presenting it to god as representative of her lifes work if the library had burned all of the knowledge of the workings of magic that brought people from all over the world to study in alexandria would have been lost forever there would be no shining order of hypatia and the siblings who studied magic and used it to defeat the powers of darkness given the current situation kat found herself wondering if that would have been so bad after all for if there was no order of hypatia there would also be no servants of the holy trinity dont be an idiot if that knowledge had been lost wed all be worshipping chernobog right this very minute without the knowledge of the library the evil magicians of the barbaric north and east would have had it all their own way and their warriors disorganized as they were would still have conquered everything now ruled by emperor charles fredrik theyd probably be storming the gates of venice at this moment still hypatia and chrysostom hadnt prevailed not completely they werent as ruthless as their foes within the church the followers of saint paul if they had been there wouldnt be the fanatical order of saint paul nor its offshoots the servants of the holy trinity and the knights of the holy trinity with their inquisitions and their purgings what were you thinking kat asked the image of hypatia silently why did you have to be soso diplomatic and conciliatory they wouldnt have been if theyd gotten the upper hand you and chrysostom would have been walled up in hermits cells in the desert for the good of your souls and why were you so compromising with augustine without him there never would have been a pauline creed at all hypatias painted image didnt answer and kat sighed she was no theologian and this was getting her nowhere she needed to talk to someone older and wiser if she could have turned the clock back her first choice would have been dottore marina for all that hed only come twice a week in the evenings dottore marina had been the one among her her tutors who had always seemed to understand she still remembered the fight between her mother and her grandfather about his teaching her at all her grandfather had insisted for all that it was many years ago she could still remember what hed bellowed he is one of the doges own librarians yes he is magister magi and a strega to boot saint hypatia woman the child needs a bit of broadness in her education and no one in all venice has more broadness than dottore marina even metropolitan michael says he is a great scholar of christian philosophy at first shed been a little afraid of this pagan her mother had muttered about but hed been a good tutor kindly and patient he stuck out from all the rest like a beacon he listened for one thing and for another she could usetoday in a way she hadnt needed thenthe dottores understanding of the dangerous complexities of venetian politics but he was gone had been for several years so one of the hypatian counselors would have to do at least she knew she could trust them to keep what she said under the seal of counsel that was more than could be said of the counselors of some of the other orders especially the servants of the holy trinity she got up and left the choir stalls returning to the rear of the church to the line of three enclosed closets where someone in need of counsel could speak with one of the siblings anonymously she dropped the curtain across the doorway and sat down on the thin cushion over the bench inside waiting for someone to speak to her on the other side of the scrimcovered window compared to the brightness outside in the church it was dim in here dim and cool she didnt have to wait for very long a male voice one she didnt recognize the intonation slightly foreign coughed then said peace be with you my child how may i counsel you a very good question that im not sure how to start brother she said in frustration its all gone so horribly wrong you might start with what has gone wrong the voice replied helpfully although from the sound of your voice i fear that you are going to tell me that it is everything it very nearly is she tried to keep the bitterness out of her voice but it was still there but most of it is nothing i had any control overand its the situation now that i need advice with if it has any bearing on the present i should like to hear it anyway the voice sounded patient but kat wondered about her own patience level ill sound selfpitying and whiny i know i will despite that a sibling wasnt supposed to let such things color his counsel she couldnt help feeling that it would make her lookwell unpleasantly petty but the counselor had asked and you werent supposed to hold back kat took a deep breath and started she did her level best to keep the nasal complaint out of her own voice that she heard so often in her sisterinlaws she tried keeping things as brief as possible but the voice interrupted gently from time to time asking more questions about her father her grandfather and her own studies as a girl with a private tutor dwelling on dottore marina for reasons she couldnt fathom still that segued very nicely into the current situation that was whyi remembered dottore marina seeming so good you seethat when we needed money we began delivering things for the strega and not just the jewish community my family has always brought in some cargo that the doges capi di contrada never saw you know counselor every trader in venetia does a little at first it was just because of the duties i think then when the sotsi mean the servants of the trinitybegan to have more influence on the doge it was to avoid possible persecution then dottore marina just vanished she paused then prompted her counselor gently kat took a deep breath then the strega i knew became very frightened and needed me to get things for them more than ever we made more money from them and we became more reliant on it did they ever ask you to obtain things of athe voice paused delicatelydubious nature no i dont think so i dont know of course what some of the things were still even the best of things can be put to evil use counselor but i always wear the saint hypatia medallion that my father gave meits supposed to warn me when theres evil magic aroundor thats what the sibling who bespelled it for him told him she paused was that too superstitious for this counselor what if the medal was bogus but quite right the voice replied if there had been evil in what you handled you would have felt the medallion grow warm even hot depending upon the strength of it you should be certain to continue to wear it at all times kat bit her lip should she tell him about the warning it had given her when the knots and the sots brought that shrouded box into the embassy it had been so hot even when shed gone under water that shed been surprised the water hadnt boiled and equally surprised that there wasnt a burn on her chest so the strega have not asked you to convey anything for an evil purpose no well i dont think so its because of the persecution the preaching outside their houses and shops butwe dont dare take their commissions any more and i dont know what to do she cried if they arent asking me to help them in dark magics then why are the servants saying that dark magic is all they do and if the servants are wrong why is the doge going along with what they tell him to do the next package i carry might get me arrested if that happens grandfather will go mad and the house will be ruined why is everyone letting the servants do what they want anyway they arent venetian they arent even petrine why are they doing this to venice why has everyone gone crazy how am i going to keep my family from getting destroyed by all of this insanity the last came out in a wail and she clapped her hands over her mouth only belatedly realizing that she had blurted out far more than she should have but the voice only asked curiously before dottore marina disappeared had he said anything to you that makes you think now that he was warning you he was intending to leave the counselor seemed entirely fixated on dottore marinawhich caused kat to reply in a flash of irritation no if he did it was years ago when i was only fourteen and i dont remember and even if i did what has that to do with my difficulties today you rememberthe ones youre counseling me with there was a faint sound from the other side of the scrim something like a muffled snort of amusement and it didnt sound male it sounded female well maybe this counselor was new to the task and was being overseen by an elder sister if that was the casekat felt some of her annoyance fade he must have gotten distracted maybe he even knew dottore marina and was trying to find out what had happened to him i beg your pardon my child said the voice apologetically all anyone knows is that dottore marina just disappeared one night she told him earnestly i know ive asked all over in the years that have gone by since and no one knows what happened to him he wasnt even she gulped foundfloating ah just that one syllable but it held a world of disappointment but what am i supposed to do she continued stubbornly my house depends on me how am i going to help them when i cant even tell from moment to moment what next piece of insanity is going to threaten us silence if i told you to trust in god i suspect you would be tempted to throttle me through the scrim the voice said dryly which surprised a tense and strangled giggle out of her nevertheless that is all you can do for now but child believe me when i tell you that god and his angels are not far from us that they move to protect us at those moments when we have given the last of ourselves and have no more to give i know i have seen it there was something in his tone that sobered her she couldnt doubt him not for a second he had seen such interventions not that the archangel raphael is likely to drop out of the clouds bearing one of our lost ships in his hands you and yours are in the exceedingly uncomfortable position of being sardines in a sea in which great sharks are maneuvering the voice went on i cannot at this moment give you any counsel that will make you any safer her heart sank into her shoes but the counselor wasnt done yet i can advise you that regular counselingherewill not only be of aid to your soul but might also be of benefit to your secular self while i may not have any advice other than what i have given you today there is no saying whether something the order learns might not be of benefit to you on the morrow or next week he uttered a dry little laugh after all our blessed hypatia herself was no mean politician it will certainly be in the tradition of the order her spirits lifted a little at least this brotherwhoever he washad a firm grasp not only on sacred matters but on secular and he wasnt afraid to give advice on both sides of life all right brother she said feeling as if she was making some kind of a bargain ill make a point of beingmore regular in my devotions go in peace my child came the standard response signaling the end of a session once the sound of the girls footsteps on the marble had ended with the opening and closing of the door the priest emerged moving with a pronounced limp sister evangelina followed her lips compressed over the laugh that threatened to burst through them i dont know that ive ever seen anyone put you so firmly in your place eneko she finally said eyes twinkling merrily im overjoyed that you found it all so amusing gina he said dryly if i have brought a little humor into your humdrum existence my life has not been lived in vain he stared at the heavy doors through which the girl had left the church his face tight with calculation after a moment the sister at his side cleared her throat she spoke under the anonymity of counseling eneko the womans tone was halfadmonitory half almost fearful the priest twitched his shoulders irritably i am well aware of that apparently the answer did not satisfy evangelina you may not he waved her silent with an abrupt motion please i have no intention of violating the sanctity of counseling i just wish i knew who she was if we could find out anything about what happened to dottore marina for a moment evangelina seemed to shrink away from his intent gaze the priest recognized the expression which lurked halfhidden in her face he had seen that same expression many times now in the years since he received what he thought of as his calling respect for his wellknown learning and piety combined with uneasinessalmost fearat the intensity of his convictions he suppressed a sigh then managed a smile whatever else he was eneko lopez de onez y guipuzcoa was also a superb politician he needed to maintain good relations with the petrine clergy in venice whatever his misgivings concerning the laxity of their faith please relax gina i assure youagainthat i have no intention of violating the sanctity of counseling i neither asked the girls name nor did i make any attempt to see her face i have no idea who she isi wouldnt even recognize her on the street if she walked past me evangelinas lips quirked youd recognize her voice readily enough if you heard it again dont deny it eneko a soft laugh emerged from her throat your acuity is already a byword in venice even in the short time since the grand metropolitan sent you here lopez returned her words with a rueful little smile of his own true enough he admitted its odd really as a young man before that cannonball ruined my leg i was rather notorious for being hard of hearing but since i gave up a soldiers life he broke off twitching his shoulders with exasperation im hardly likely to encounter her again in casual conversation gina so i think you may set your fears to rest i am simply as always frustrated by the lack of clarity which seems to surround everything in this city i cant tell you how much i wish the grand metropolitan had allowed me to go on pilgrimage to the holy land instead of sending me here he stared at the door through which the girlwhoever she washad left the church his lips pursing and that young lady was quite right the things her family transports may not in themselves be evil tombdust is not evil but it can be put to evil use and i do not share her naive belief that all strega are simply harmless healers it is good that she has her medallion butas you well knowmagic can be shielded from detection by other magic he rubbed his crippled leg in an old and absentminded manner i just wish it were all less murk and shadows the sister laughed a bit ruefully it is a foggy city after all as often as not eneko shared in the laughter and then produced still more laughter by recounting several amusing anecdotes concerning the ways in which a rural basque priest had often found the metropolis of venice a most confusing place by the end whatever doubts sister evangelina might have had concerning his own intentions seemed dispelled she departed thereafter leaving eneko alone he drifted over to the wall where the frescoes depicted john chrysostom the golden preacher and stared up at the panels a few minutes later he heard the footsteps of two other men coming into the church he did not turn around eneko lopez knew those footsteps as well as he knew the arhythmic sound which his own limp produced he gestured with his chin toward the frescoes above him he was a false man you know in many ways intemperate harsh often arrogant full of error and wrongheadedness still they made him a saint and do you know why he swiveled his head to bring his companions under his gaze diego and pierre said nothing after a moment eneko looked away they made him a saint eneko said harshly because whatever his faults the golden preacher understood one thing clearly there is such a thing in this world as evil not simply the next words came out almost like a curse error and misunderstanding brother pierre spoke in his heavy savoyard accent true enough and what is your point eneko the basque priests lips twisted wryly then he turned his head again and looked at the other priest brother diego i need you to begin an investigation i have been led to believe that the strega grand master was once the tutor for a girl in this city fourteen years old she was when he disappeared find out who that girl is it should not be too difficult only a very wealthy and prominent family could have afforded his services as a private tutorand would have dared employ him for that matter brother diego nodded what was the source of your information that might help me in my search i have no doubt that it would i also have no doubt that you dont wish to know diego looked at the counseling booths sighed can you offer me any other clues and how do we know she is not a witch herself asked pierre eneko smiled faintly oh i think not whatever that girl might be i rather doubt you will find a witch you never know countered diego we are surrounded by evil here the basque nodded his eyes returning to the frescoes no you dont and yes we are still the hawk eyes of john chrysostom gazed down upon him he did not seem to find the weight of them hard to bear not in the least still i doubt you will find a witch there casa montescue lookedfrom the outsideas if it belonged to one of the wealthiest families in all venice it was only once you got inside thought katerina bleakly that you realized what a hollow front that was she walked the long corridor moodily it was a case of too much grandeur and too little upkeep show was very important in venice but more than one case vecchie family had found that keeping up appearances could be ruinous this place needed an army of servants just to keep it clean without them it deteriorated fast there had been six upstairs maids when she was a child her father had once told her thered been ten when he was young her musing was cut by the sound of her grandfathers voice nothing to do with us it was fortunato bespi who killed her he was a montagnard assassin she must have fallen out with her masters another voice higher pitched nonetheless you spent a great deal of money pursuing her sons milord montescue money long outstanding with our house the first voice again and now we discover that you just recently hired yet another assassin such men do not come cheaply even incompetents like the ones you apparently employ there came a snort of derision the mans body was found just this morning you know imaginea blade man poisoned by his target what kind of assassin kat winced grandpapas obsession with taking his revenge on the valdosta family disturbed her deeply more for its unhealthy effects on the old mans state of mind than the montescue purse but she hadnt realized hed started hiring assassins again and wincing again she could just imagine what kind of fumblefingered dimwits the old man could find with the few coins he had available the second voice continued we were promised a payment within this month and that is very nearly at an end we really dont want to inconvenience such old and valued clients milord but the truth is youre far behind weve had a delay growled lodovico montescue not a reversea delay he said the words with a confidence which was far from what his granddaughter was feeling about the matter grandpapa was talking about the money theyd get from the parcel shed had to drop into the water outside the imperial embassy what if that urchin benito had stolen it what if water ruined the contents what if they couldnt find it milord we cant give you endless time said the unfamiliar voice damn your eyes man snapped lodovico weve always paid at least the interest we should have a tranche of cash in the next three days i really hope so milord wed hate to even think of foreclosure katerina turned away if she went in now shed tear that moneylenders head off he was being politewhich shed gathered wasnt normally the case the trade they were in did make some powerful people beholden to them people she was sure had protected them in the past things must be dire now she came back some time later intent on at least trying to cool her grandfather down he was sitting at his desk staring at a piece of paper not looking angry just morose his craggy face seemed more lined than kat could ever remember it his hair thinner and whiter even his dark eyesalmost coal black normallyseemed muddycolored what sort of mess are we in katerina he said grimly first that damned moneylender now this they want their suppliesbut theyre too scared to even sign their names he waved the letter your greatgrandfather always told me stay out of politics and stay out of religion make money but he got involved in politics because he had no choice and we are involved against our will in religion still i think my fathers backing of rome was the start of the rot he granted the first mortgages kat groped for his meaning she understood the general point the principalities of italy were a maze of shifting alliances but there were always two poles romeand milan the milanese under the visconti were officially at least montagnardsbelievers in one united christian realm under the aegis of the holy roman emperor not without reason their neighbors viewed this lofty and alwaysdistant goal as little more than an excuse for the visconti dynastys insatiable lust for immediate conquests of territory in northern italy romes prioritieswhich was to say the priorities of the grand metropolitan of romewere more nebulous beyond opposition to having northern italy absorbed into the empire but those priorities had more than once involved taking occasional territory always for the good of the people of course grandpapa had said before that his fathers politicsthe montescues were traditionally allied with the metropolitans as the antimontagnard faction was calledhad gotten casa montescue into trouble but she hadnt realized the trouble had extended to their relations with the familys financial supporters it cant be that bad surely grandpapa he sighed im afraid it can dearest kat florianosand weve borrowed money from florianos since i was a boyhave actually started talking about foreclosure kat put an arm around him the feel of her grandfathers stillbroad but bony shoulders brought sadness she could remember as a girl thinking that her grandfather must be the strongest man in the world cant we sell off the farm or this place for that matter we cant keep it up anyway he shook his head sadly no the truth to tell we dare not sell anything we havent just borrowed from florianos much of what we have is double mortgaged if we show any signs of failing the gullgropers will be onto the flesh of montescue and rip it to shreds there will literally be nothing left weve been in difficulties for twenty years he leaned back from the desk pushing himself away with arms that had once been heavy with muscle only the size of his hands reflected any longer the strength which had once been a legend in venice one of those hands reached around kats waist drawing her close the worst of it of course has only been in the last three years since your father left vanished at sea he borrowed heavily for that venture she felt the hand squeezing her the slight tremble in the fingers was heartbreaking i dont know what i would do without you kat the old man said softly you have been the mainstay of this family since your father sadly and for the first time he whispered the word died kat didnt know what to say her thoughts were fixed entirely on a parcel at the bottom of a canal hoping desperately that it was still there and hoping just as desperately that a street urchin named benito could be relied upon to save the fortune of one of venices four oldest andoncewealthiest and most powerful families chapter when marco returned there was no benito at the dockjust a scrap of dirty paper wedged beneath it got a job come tamarra which left marco to go back to his hide again wondering if the job was a real task or something benito made up so he could enjoy another night of the festival or a ruse to lure benito into the clutches of them surely not surely they wouldnt go to all that trouble surely benito would smell a rat if they tried by this time marco felt faint with hunger and on his way back to shelter spotted a lone marshmallow just at the edge of what he knew to be dangerous mire he took a chance and worked his way out to itbut he had to stop just out of reach when the hungry mud beneath the water sucked at his foot and nearly pulled him down he stared at it in despair he hadnt eaten in two days now there was no way to reach it choking on tears of frustration he turned his back on the tantalizing plant and headed for the hide again he crawled inside too cold to shiver wrapped a scrap of blanket around himself and waited for the sun to warm the hide a little there was just enough room under the lumpy dome for him and a few precious belongings sunlight filtered through the mass of enmeshed weeds at the entrance as he got feeling back into his toes and feet finally for lack of anything else to do he picked through his packets of herbs and oddments to see if he might have left a scrap of food in there nothing except a single fishhook and a bit of line left from the times he had something to bait the hook with he paused with his hand over the packet it wouldnt be much of a sin maybe not any sin even in milan even in paulinedominated milan fishermen got blessings on their nets to increase their catch but he wasnt a priest to give such a blessing on the other hand if he passed out from hunger he wouldnt be able to warn benito saint peteryou were a fisherman blessed saint peter send me a sign there was an angry squawk and a commotion just outside and above his hidea thump a splash he shoved his head and arm outside just in time to wave frantically at the gull about to recapture its dinner from the water at his doorlost in a fight with the other two gulls circling overhead he snatched the handsized gray mullet out of the water and withdrew back into his protection as the gull stabbed at him with its beak thank you saint peter he took his knife and worried slivers of flesh from the bony fish eating them raw and thankful that once again he had been saved from committing a sin he spent a terrible anxious miserable day in the hide not even prepared to go and share his fear with chiano and sophia with the dusk he was off to wait again this time he was rewarded there was a pad of bare feet overheadthen tiny sounds that marked someone who knew what he was doing and where he was going climbing down among the crossbeams hi brother benitos whisper right here be right with you a bit of scratching a rasp of wood on cloth and skin and someone slipped in beside him with a quick hug and then pulled away riot out there tonight sorry about yesterday i couldnt get here in time i tried but i got held up benitoive got to go under cover again one of them nearly got me yesterday assassin he was waiting for me benito he knew who i was and where i was going it has to be them swift intake of breath godno not after all this time howd you get away i justoutran him dont let him know what really happened hell think he has to share the danger marco had been careful never to let his brother even guess that hed had to killand more than once all right the voice in the dark took on a new firmness thats it youre not gonna run any more big brother running dont cut it you need a protector somebody with weight get serious marco answered bitterly where am i going to find somebody willing to stand up for me benito chuckled been thinking about that new man in towngot contacts got weighteverywhere seems like been watching him big fat dealwhat reason is he going to have to help me names aldanto caesare aldanto familiar marco sucked in his breath lord and saints thought i membered benito replied with satisfaction marco did indeed remember that nameit went all the way back to their being exiled to venice an exile that grandfather delleste thought would take them out of the reach of mamas promilanese friends and of her lover caesare aldanto had been one of the milanese agents in ferraraa friend of mamas lover carlo sforza carlo was presumably benitos fatherthat was probably why the name aldanto had stuck so fortuitously in benitos memory you can never forget anything brother whats the aldanto you saw look like marco closed his eyes and rocked back and forth a little letting his mind drift backlord and saints hed been a seven maybe eightyearold boy blond pretty guy moved like a cat or a dancer blue eyestall dressed really well dunno about the eyes but the rest is him its the same man appears to me hed have reason to help us appears to me youd want to get mamas message to him no lord marco said not quite believing this turn of events its like that story you used to tell me yeah well maybe im more interested in seeing you safe and i think this caesare aldanto can do that right then well go find him now tonight marco started to scramble up but benito forestalled him no way youre going to pass in the town brother not dressed like that oh yes you wait herei wont be long benito thought hed managed that rather cleverly he thought hed remembered caesare aldantos name when hed first heard it and he had just been biding his time waiting for the opportunity to get marco to take the bait he was going to offer the marshes were no place for marcosooner or later someone or something would get him venice was safer by far besides since hed been thrown out from theodoros family benito had been getting lonelier and lonelier he had friendslola for instance well she was sort of a friend mercutio he was fun and he looked out for benito but it wasnt the same as having marco around he wanted his big brother back well nowfirst things first a set of clothing that wouldnt stand out in the solstice crowds benito took to the rooftops and thought while he climbed nearest secondhand clothing store was close to the palazzo mastelli that was the area he was hanging out in at presentno go off limits he could hear valentina now cracking him over the ear for even thinking about it never soil your own nest boy rule one the air up here was fresher the breeze carrying away a lot of the stink benito slipped around chimneypots and skylights as easily as if hed been on a level walkway so the next closest was over toward the ca doro old man mirko was a stingy bastardo too cheap to put good shutters in his windows and the dalmatian wouldnt miss the loss mirkos place it was he crossed the bridges on the support beams below keeping a sharp eye out for watchers finally getting himself up on the supports of the highlevel bridge that crossed the rio malpaga mirko had a secondstory window just below and to one side of it benito unwound the light rope and grapnel from his waist spied a sturdy cornice and made his cast solid he pulled three times always three times no matter how rushed you are came claudias voice from memory then he swung himself over in the shadows all the way within a few minutes mirkos shop was lighter by a pair of breeches a shirt and a cotte all sized for someone thin and not overtall along with some other small items and benito was most of the way back to the wharf dancing across the rooftops and bridgebeams like a halfgrown cat huhuh benito said keeping his grip tight on the bundle he carried and handing something small to marco instead it shone white in the starlight i stofound some soap too down brother in the harbor get clean first or theyll know you by the smell for marsh scum marco flushed with embarrassmentliving in the swamp was changing him and in ways he didnt like he used to be so fastidious he grabbed the proffered soap and dropped straight down into the water next to the wharftrying not to remember the twitching thing that had so lately floated there he was so used to being chilled that the cold water wasnt much of a shock to his system he soaped and rinsed and scrubbed until he thought his skin would peel off then washed his hair three times for good measure benito had shinnied down to his raft and handed him back up onto it with a sniff that held approval better you smell better than a lot of canaldwellers now here a piece of sacking to use for a towel and a comb getting the tangles out of his hair was a jobmarco had to be content with just getting most of the major knots out and smoothing down the rest tying it back with the piece of ribbon lordribbon benito handed him then into the clothingoh heaven clean and warm and not ripped in a dozen placesand even the right size the precious message went into his shirt pocket marco stood up straight with one hand steadying himself on the piling and felt like a human being again for the first time in years benito grinned at him teeth flashing white in his shadowed face know what brother you clean up really pretty i can think of a couple of girls just might like to share a blanket with you marco blushed hotly and was glad the dark hid it thought id warn youbecause thats who were going to go see first they took to the rooftops much to marcos bewilderment oh he still remembered how to climb he was fast and agile enough to keep upbut why not take the walkways openly andwhere had benito gotten this kind of expertise in roofscrambling it was more of a maze in veniceabove than it was in venicebelow if there was a level space up here on the roofs that was more than three feet square it was a rarity up here was a work of towers cupolas skylights and spires benito danced along the spines of peaked roofs and jumped from structure to structure as if he were half cat marco followed as best he could he was just lucky that above also sported rain gutters and collection pipes on every surface for without these aids hed never have been able to emulate benito from time to time benito would halfstart toward something marco knew was unclimbablethen glance back as if suddenly remembering his brothers presence and choose some easier path marco couldnt help but wonder what hed have done if marco hadnt been there benito paused on the roof edge overlooking the bridge across the rio della misericordia balancing carefully he scrutinized the bridge and its attendant walkways looks good he said finally in a whisper if anybody followed theyve lost us come on and he shinnied down a drainpipe to the walk below them marco followed suit shielded torches on the bridge danced and smoked they were placed so far apart they did more harm than good there seemed to be no one about in this area and their bare feet made no sound on the bridge which contributed to the gloomy atmosphere from here we go to rio del servi then down by the maddalenajust in case we get separated benito said in an undertone moving uncomfortably fast for marco who was accustomed to poling a raft rather than walking the ladies i want to talk to should be in a tavern called barduccis on the rio di san marinaits down on the water therell be a lot of canalers tied up at it got that marco nodded saving his breath good because once we get to the maddalena well be going up again they didnt get separated but marco was weary and aching by the time they stood at the tavern door and confused and lost only rarely had they crossed bridges by the normal pathsmore often theyd scrambled underneath on the cross beams or worse inched along the support cables overhead it made good sense in a wayfor surely no one would ever have been able to follow thembut marco was thoroughly exhausted by the time they reached their goal they descended to the walkway cold and wet under their bare feet and walked decorously enough to the wooden porch that marked barduccis front entrance there were boats tied up here and lanterns everywhere light and noise and confusion that dazzled marcos eyes and made him more than a little nervous the water of the canal looked very black and cold compared with all that light and warmth and marco found himself hoping they werent going to find out just how cold it was there was a foodsmell waves of garlic from the bruschetta toasting over the charcoal grilling sarde and the heady bouquet of young red wine there was smoke little wisps of it from the lanterns there was more smoke from the charcoal grill there was soundpeople laughing talking arguing and singing most of all singing just as they got to the wooden porch a great roar of a chorus bounced out of the open door and off the brick of the wall opposite hootheyre rabblerousing tonight for sure benito grinned they best hope there aint no schiopettieri around somewhat to marcos surprise he was talking just like the canalers chameleonlike acquiring the coloration of his surroundings marco began to make out some of the lyrics benito had the right of it the song skirted just the high side of treasonbut oddly enough he couldnt identify what faction the song was in favor of valentina and claudia and they aint on anybodys side benito elbowed his way in through front door with marco trailing warily behind they just like to rile people up i guess the tavern room was hot and redolent with the bouquet of food drink and humanity crammed full every table and chair occupied and people jammed in against the walls the objects of their attention were perched on the bar grinning insolently and singing for all they were worth their voices were amazingly strong and clear marco could hear them long before he could see them benito finally wormed a place for them in beside the bar and marco managed to get a good view under someones elbow they were something to stare at were valentina and claudia though which was which he couldnt guess one was playing a lute her hands moving on the strings so fast marco could hardly credit his eyes she seemed the older of the two by five maybe ten years the other was setting up a complicated pattern on a couple of hand drums but marco could see a mandola leaning up against the bar next to her both had dark nearly black straight hair tied around with red scarves the older one wore hers long past her shoulders the younger shorter than benitos both had sharp features and ironic grins both were wearing flounced redpatterned skirts both had pale pale skinas if they didnt see the sun much and both of them were wearing at least three knives that marco could see hope they get the crowd calmed down before they finish up benito muttered or with this lot halfdrunk as they are no tellin what they might do to marcos relief they did just that finishing up at last with something melancholy enough that one or two of the more sodden customers began sniffling into their wine then ignoring demands for more they picked up their instruments and hopped off the bar benito waved at them the older one spotted him and motioned him over seeing that hed been summoned by one of their darlings the crowd parted politely so that the two boys could make their way to the singers tiny table crowded into a cramped nook to one side of the bar itself there was barely room for both women the boys and the instruments the older one reached over the table and tweaked benitos nose whereve y been cull y havent been here since the feast startedwe was beginnin t think y didnt love us no more out an about earnin a wedge or two you tryin t get yourselves invited down to the doges torture chambers whatf thered been schiopettieri around huh schiopettieri are all dead drunk by now besides theres a crow on the door thats the latest ballad out of syracuse with additions by you valentina i got no doubt benito snorted the servants dont hold with moorish music yknow and they say the doge is favoring em these days god rot th senile old fool yere gonna find yourself at nubbing cheat an not because of what y do outside the walls listen to the kitten telling the old cats how to prowl the younger woman crowed who taught you hmm ins and outs ups and downs benito cleared his throat with a sideways glance toward marcoand only then did the women seem to see him well whos this cant be related to you kidhes too pretty marco felt his ears burning this valentina is my brother marco you know ohho brought him out of hiding hmm and y need something i dont doubt make him someones cousin claudiathe older womancaught marcos chin in one long sharpnailed hand and turned his face from side to side examining it closely just feeding himd do id think a little flesh on him and no oned tumble to im benito shook his head no go he needs more needs protection needs somebody with weight backing im so im askinyou seen that pretty blondthe one that aint from these partsin here lately claudia shook her head letting go of marcos chin not me valentinalove she too shook her head no know who would thoughthat canalrat that usedt work for antonio maria garavelli shes living with him people say oh no it was

bothers im point valentina agreed all right best i can say is try that runnergirl of yours lola shes been doin runs down along where he mostly seems t hang outspecially lately a fistfight broke out across the room interrupting them for a few seconds it remained confined to the original two combatantsbut a foot in the wrong place tripped one up and sent him into a table and its occupantsand things began to spread from there valentina and claudia exchanged glances filled with unholy glee shall we lets with reverent care they handed their instruments to the bartender who placed them safely behind the wooden bulwark they divested themselves of knivesthis was a fistfight after allthen charged into the fray with joyful and total abandon women benito said shaking his head ruefully well at least theyll come out of that with full pockets back way brother marco followed him outside with no regret benito led the way again back over the rooftops climbing towers and balconies inching over drainpipes and across the support beams of bridges until marco was well and truly lost yet again fatigue was beginning to haze everything and he hadnt the least notion where in venice he could beexcept that by the general run of the buildings they were still in the lowerclass section of town when benito finally stopped and peered over a roof edge marco just sat closing his eyes and breathing slowly trying to get his wind back with a gutter biting into his bony haunches hi he heard benito call softly lola there was the sound of feet padding over to stand beneath where benito leaned over the edge benito answered a young female voice you in trouble no just need to find someone by now marco had recovered enough to join benito in peering over the roof edge on the walkway just below him was a childcertainly younger than benito pretty in the way that an alleykitten is pretty im waiting she said and oh when she saw marco benito shook his head at the question in her glance not now later promise gotta find that blond youre droolin after she looked incensed i aint drooling after him i just think hesnice yeah and valentina just sings cute little ballads you know where he is she sniffed i shouldnt tell you oh cmon looki promise ill give you that blue scarf of minejust tell well all right hes in antonios over on the rio della frescada i just run a message over there and i saw him i think hes going to be there awhile hot damn benito jumped to his feet and skipped a little along the edge of the coppo tiles while marco held his breath expecting him to fall brighteyes you just made my day benito had traded on the fact that he was a known runner in order to get into antonios it wasnt a place marco would have walked into by choice the few faces he could see looked full of secrets and unfriendly they approached the table that aldanto had taken off in the darkest corner of the room benito with all the aplomb of someone who had every right to be there even if he was only fourteen years old marco just trailed along behind invisible for all the attention anyone paid him the place was as dark as barduccis had been well lit talk was murmurous and there was no one entertaining marco was not at all sure he wanted to be here milord benito had reached aldantos table and the man looked up when he spoke marco had no difficulty in recognizing the caesare aldanto from ferrara older harderbut the same man milord i got a message for youbutit aint public aldanto looked at him startled at first then appraisingly he signaled a waiter and spoke softly into the mans ear the man murmured something in reply picked up the dishes that had been on aldantos table and motioned them to follow the waiter led them all to a tiny room with barely room for more than a table and a few chairs in itbut it had a door and the door shut softly behind them aldanto seated himself at the table and put down his wine glass the way he positioned himself the boys had to stand with him seated between them and the door the lantern that lit the room was on the wall behind aldantos head and made a sunblaze out of his hair im waiting was all he said milord my brothers got information that you might be able to useit might be you and him know the same people we want to sell it he poked marco with his elbow marco shook himself into awareness information aldanto did not look amused what on earth could you two have that would be of any use to me milord somebody thinks its important my brother has been having to hide out in the marshes because somebody thought it was important enough to kill my mother but she passed it on to marco here see we know who you are we know where youre from we reckoned you would be the right man to know what hes got and we figured youd be the best man to pay our priceand thats to keep him safe after hes told you the blond man began to look angry if this is some kind of a scam brother marco said clearly and distinctly the viper strikes it was the password of those in the service of the milanese duke visconti aldanto who had just taken a mouthful of wine coughed and practically choked marco took the most recent of his precious copies of the message from his shirt pocket and handed it to him hazed with fatigue marco was blind to aldantos reactionsbut benito wasnt within a few moments benito had figured aldanto was not pleased with their recognition of him as a milanese agent moments after that he knew by the worried look that aldanto wasnt working for duke visconti anymore this required recalculation then aldantos mouth began to twitch as he read the paper marco had given him where did you come by this i told you benito said stalling for time our mama was something with the milanesepassed their messages and whatall except somebody figured that out an came for her and marco ran for the marshes to hide out with the last thing she got figured things were fine until he got jumped out there a day or so ago and it werent just any nightbird it was an assassin we are valdosta you might know the nameyou might know people mama knewventuccio you going help us out valdosta well well aldanto pointed at the paper nothing here for me he said his mouth was amused but his eyes were hard what youve got is an outofdate infiltration schedule useless and worthless marcos mind went blank all the hopethe plansall in ruins and the man aldanto didnt seem the least bit interested in helping much less being the shining rescuer marco had prayed for butsomebody must think i know something he said desperately or why try to kill me and why send an assassin they could have hired one of the marshgangs easy now all he wanted was to be able to think of something useful to aldanto something worth the cost of protecting both himself and benito it was far too late now to go back to the jesolo marsh maybemaybe i know something someone doesnt want outlike a name or a facecant you use that absolutelymarco never forgets anything benito chimed in thats why mama took him everywhere with her he knows all kinds of thingsthings maybe still worth knowing like i remember you milord you were with mamas man carlo sforzait wasaround the beginning of october i think about nine years ago you were wearing brown velvet and you and carlo talked about the bribes your fatherd been paying marco trailed off at the grim set of aldantos mouth besidesdamned milanese are out after us along with you benito interrupted stepping hard on marcos foot mama would have sold us to slavers if theyd told her to duke visconti never got us anything but trouble and i bet its him as sent the assassin you need something well i can get it or i know who can i can get things done tooget people disappearedget you disappeared too only less permanent weve got connections you cant get from the case vecchie or the boatpeople you need us milordabout as much as we need you interesting valdosta aldanto said then said nothing more obviously thinking hard marco turned on benito and tugged him into a corner of the little room what the hell truth damn it benito whispered harshly its all true and you know it mama used youwhy do you think she never paid me any attention theodoros folks knew what was going on told me too told me it was probably duke viscontis people that got mama uh thats why they turned me out couple of years ago they were afraid and i dont blame em lucky i ran into claudia and valentina theyre thieves i know thieves cant when i hear it course theyre thieves how dyou think i came by all that stuff for you whered you think it came from the moon ive been living in bloody attics for two years now look brotherive mostly given up thievingthe odds arent in it im a messenger now but i couldnt get stuff for you and feed me on what i make running and i wouldnt leave you without so i stole and i still steal and ill keep doin it cause youre worth itlike mama wasnt tell you what else this aldanto may have been montagnard before but he damn sure aint now or didnt you notice him have a fit when you hit him with the password our best bet is to figure something he needs bad the fog began to clear from marcos head as benitos words and his memory started to come together certain things were becoming a lot clearer than theyd ever been before item chiano and sophia had been trying to tell himin gentler termsexactly what benito was telling him now if three so very different peopleone of them his own flesh and bloodwere saying the same things about duke visconti and the montagnard cause and mamas involvement with it well it followed that he had probably been dead wrong and dreaming all these years item stripped of the fairytale glamour mama had decked them in montagnards were not in the least attractive take the rhetoric of united christian empire away and they became little more than highly trained professional killers item they were now alone with this unhappy professional assassin who was probably thinking that no one would miss them marco looked over benitos shoulder at aldanto who was contemplating them with a face of stone marcos blood ran colder than the springmelt water that the brenta carried down from the alps item they were a liability and aldanto was looking at them like someone who couldnt afford liabilities benito suddenly broke off seeing marcos face turn pale and still brotheryou all right he whispered unable to fathom why marco should suddenly look as if the great lion of san marco had come to life and confronted him he knew that some of what hed said was bound to come as a shock to marco but he hadnt thought any of it was enough to turn him white to the ears he shook marco a little beginning to feel worried the way marco was staring at aldanto sort of glassyeyedit wasnt like him marco was always the quick one the alert oneexcept benito went cold all over except when marco had been sick marco was watching aldantos eyes the only things in his face that were showing any change they were growing harder and marcos blood acquired ice crystals item they were quite likely to be dead very soon benito with the panache of a fourteenyearold unable to believe in his own mortality had led them into dangerous and unfriendly handsand with no way to escape aldanto was between them and the door in a room barely big enough to hold all of them and the table and chairs looking at those calculating eyes marco knew exactly what their fate was going to be they had at most a few more minutes he forced himself to smile at his brother he couldnt protect him from what was coming nothingjustyoure right about all of it ive been plain stupid benito shrugged no big deal everybody makes mistakes and hell i probably wouldnt believe anything bad anybody said about you either and i never told you how much i missed you half the old nickname made benito grin that was even stupider were the team right so from now on its going be you and meaye all the way benito dropped his pretense of adulthood and threw both arms around his brother in an affectionstarved hug marco tightened his own arms around benitos shoulder and stared at aldanto trying to beg with his eyes and figuring that it was a lost cause before he started but to marcos surprise caesare suddenly cleared his throat a little sound but the older boy started as violently as if a gun had gone off in his ear you say your mother had connections with ventuccio marco stared unable to get his mouth to work it was too much to comprehendhed expected the knife and hed only hoped aldanto was good enough to make it fast and relatively painless and thenthis his ears roared and little black spots danced in the air between his eyes and aldantos face ventuccio he heard himself say stupidly as his knees suddenly liquefied on him benito felt marco start to collapse and held him up by main force oh god pleaseno the last time marco had done this hed missed the meetings for the next month and when he finally showed up he was pounds thinner with eyes gone all hollow and a rasping cough that lasted for weeks please godhe begged struggling to keep marco on his feet long enough to pull a chair under him dont let it be fever he might not make it this timeand were almost home free milord just let me get him satmilord hes all right marco heard benito over the roaring in his ears over the scrape of a chair on the floor you dontmilord you dont need something shoved up against the back of his legs hands were under his armpits letting him down easy the same strong hands then pushing his head down between his legs stay that way for a bit aldantos voice and the roaring went away his eyes cleared when his head stopped spinning he looked up aldanto sat on his heels beside him benito looking frantic trying to get between them without touching the man better i marco managed i aldanto took his chin in one hand tilted his eyes into the light scrutinizing them closely im sorry milord im all right marco whispered thinking darent darent show weakness in front of this man honest im all right youre notbut you will be ignoring benitos worried protests great thought marco dizzily now he realizes we could be in trouble aldanto went to the table and brought his glass of wine to marco who took it with hands that shook so hard the wine slopped poison nonot likely not when hed had the chance to kill them easily and hadnt an assassin as physically capable as aldanto so obviously was wouldnt bother with anything other than a blade not at least dealing with two poor boys in a place like this get yourself on the outside of that marco sipped the alcoholic warmth spreading from his stomach to the rest of his body his hands stopped shaking slowly when did you last eat eat marco was taken totally by surprise by the question and the funny half smile on aldantos face uhi dont remember then its been too long small wonder youre falling at my feet theyre reserved for women you know as marco tried to adjust to the fact that aldanto had just made a joke the blond man turned to benito he held out a piece of silver go out there and get some bread and risi e bisi benito scampered and returned with a steaming bowl moments later some customer was going to have to wait a little longer for his dinner the thick green riceandpea soup was set down and benito scampered off to fetch bread and a bowl of shaved parmesan aldanto held out the spoon to marco marco stared at it as though it was alive not taking it go on eat aldanto pried one of marcos hands off the glass and pressed the spoon into it marco god and saints they were saved marcos head spunthis time with relief about the ventuccio marco took the bread which benito had now brought he dipped it into the soup and took a tiny bite he swallowed around a lump in his throat and began when marco had finished telling aldanto all he knew and most of what he guessed and when his knees could hold him upright again aldanto considered them both carefully for several long moments marco took advantage of his preoccupation to finish every drop of soup and every crumb of bread something must be done with you two aldanto said at last the safest you can be is in plain sight and ventuccio can do that better than anyone marco didnt argue with himafter all hed just proved how poor his own judgment was aldanto pondered something silently for a very long time while a young riot of shouting youths passed by outside and moved on i think its not too late to get speech of ventuccio aldanto said abruptly its solstice after all come along before marco could protest before benito could do anything more than look stunned aldanto had chivvied them out of the door and onto the walkway benito for once looked appropriately apprehensive but that could easily have been because hed run errands for ventuccio and reckoned on being recognized there aldanto had not been speaking rhetorically for a brisk walk brought them straight to casa ventuccio proper at least he didnt take them to the main door of the great house instead he led them down to a waterdoor where he tapped out a sequence of knocks and was answered the man who opened the door frowned ferociously when he saw who it was but at least he listened to aldantos whispered words and after a moment nodded ill see about it the man growled and allowed them grudgingly past the door to stand waiting in the damp entry while he went away somewhere presently he came back still looking displeased but jerked his head as a sign that they should follow he led them down long unlit halls of wood and stone and finally into a room piled with ledgers that was so brightly lit marco was blinking tears back now they fronted a man aldanto called by name and that man was coldly angry you have a lot of balls coming here caesare the man spat and for calling me away from my guests on a night of the feast granted aldanto said coldly however i think you happen to take your honor and your pledged word fairly seriously and i have just learned that you happen to have an unpaid debt and a broken promise you might want to discharge these boys are valdosta marco and benito valdosta marco had rarely seen words act so powerfully on someone the mans anger faded into guilt ive brought them here aldanto continued deliberately so that we can even some scales you made a promise to duke delleste and didnt keep it ilost you some people both these kids are useful now the man looked skeptical as if he doubted aldantos ability to judge much of anything milord benito piped up youve used me i know ask your people im a messengera good one i dont take bribes im fast you could take him on as a staff runner and train him for bargework as he grows into it and the older boy clerks aldanto continued you dont expect me to take that on faith marco took a deep breath and interrupted set me a problem milord nothing easy youll see the man sniffed derisively then rattled off something fast a complicated calculation involving glass bottlescost expected breakage transportation and storage ending with the question of how much to ask for each in order to receive a twentypercent profit margin marco closed his eyes went into his calculatingtrance and presented the answer quickly enough to leave the man with a look of surprise on his face well said the man for once i dont suppose he can write too aldanto had a funny little smile give him something to write with he seemed to be enjoying the mans discomfiture marco was presented with a quill pen and an old bill of lading he appropriated a ledger to press on and promptly copied the front onto the back and in a much neater hand you win the man said with resignation why dont you tell me exactly whats been going onand how you managed to resurrect these two aldanto just smiled the man took aldanto off somewhere returning after a bit with a troubled look and a bundle which he handed to benito you boyi want you here at opening time sharp and in this uniform and youre not valdosta anymore forget that name youre oro youre close enough to the look of that family got that benito took the bundle soberly yes milord as for you marco tried not to sway with fatigue but the man saw it anyway youre out on your feet no good to anyone until you get some rest besides two new kids in one dayhard to explain you get fed and clean real clean weve got a reputation to maintain and get that hair taken care of i want you here in two days oro is no good for you make ituhfelluci i dont suppose youd rather be sent back to your family no milord marco replied adamantly i wont put danger on them bad enough that its on me the man shook his head saints preserveyoure a fool boy but a brave one delleste honor is it well delleste can usually deal with most things too anyway right enoughnow get out of here before i remember that im not a fool ventuccio honors real enough but it isnt that hammered steel version the old fox insists on aldanto escorted them to the door stopping them just inside it this wasnt free he told marco quietly milord i know that milord just so we both know im going to be calling in this debtcalling in all those things you promised me i may call it in so often that youd wish youd never thought of coming to me milord aldanto marco replied looking him full in the eyes i owe you and i cant ever pay it all well aldanto seemed slightly embarrassed they say the one who wins is the one who is left standing so by all counts you came out of this a winner be gratefuland remember to keep your mouth shut marco figured that that was the best advice hed had in a long time benito hauled marco back to valentina and claudia before taking him home the marco that came from their hands was much shorter of hair by a foot or two and a bit darker of complexionnot to mention a lot cleaner and with a good hot breakfast in his stomach it wasnt quite dawn when he and his brother climbed up to the garret where benito had made his home benito gave him a pair of blankets to roll up in and he was sleeping the sleep of the exhausted before benito had gotten into his store clothes benito smiled to himself a smile warm and content with the world and set to one last task before heading back to ventuccio he pried up a particular board in the attic felt around until he located the little bag he had hung there and pulled it out caesares woman maria garavelli was bound to hear of thisand he reckoned hed better have a peace offering and there was that scarf hed taken off that duelist to prove to claudia that he was able after the ventuccio let him go for the day he waited under the ponto di rialto knowing shed be by when he spotted her he swung down to hang from the support by his knees he whistled she looked up maria he called peace huh truce okay heres something for sorrys hed knotted a pebble into one corner of the scarfand it was a nice one silk bright red he dropped it neatly at her feet and scrambled back up before she could get over her surprise with maria garavelli it was a good idea to get out of the lineofsight and find out about reactions later besideshe warmed to the thoughthe had to get back home his family was waiting and once theyd eaten there was a bit of swimming hed promised to do for that smugglergirl chapter what was that about wondered maria she stared after benitos rapidly receding form pausing for a moment in her rowing of the gondola peace truce i didnt know there was a fight between me and benito in the first place if there is well see whether theres a truce or not maria garavelli looked at the bright rectangle of silk lying on her duckboards and bent down and rescued the precious scrap before it got wet it was the expensive color that dyers called golden flame or oriflamme it was just the color of the evening suntrail on the water of the lagoon she shook her head clear of these impractical thoughts honestly sometimes she behaved as she was some case vecchie lady instead of a canalgirl that bridgebrat benito he hung about with young mercutio laivetti mercutio was trouble if shed ever met trouble and you didnt get to be sixteen as an orphaned girl on the canals of venice without being good at spotting it shed fended for herself for three years since mama died leaving her nothing but the gondola cousin antonio had offered to let her move in with them but heaven knew there were enough mouths to feed there saint hypatia and his wife was the worst shrew and gossip in all venice maria pulled a wry face and tucked the silk scarf into the top of her blouse she went back to sculling some of that gossip was about her in the last few months she was sure the cousins didnt approve of caesare they really really didnt approve of her living with him it wasnt just that they werent married a fair number of caulkerguild brides those of the garavelli cousins among them had tried for the reputation of having been the most pregnant at the altar cousin rosina had looked as if she might just have to get the priest to help with the delivery but caesare came from above the salt the garavelli were artisans mostly caulkers cladding venices great ships they had a pride in working with their hands and not much liking or trust for a man who didnt she worked the oar just a bit faster the only reason that bridgebrat benito could have been giving her a silk scarfa stolen silk scarf shed betwas something to do with her caesare she set her mouth in a grim line scarf or no scarf shed sort that benito out if hed brought trouble onto her all the same it was a gorgeous red that scarf it would set off her thick dark hair beautifully she craved for lovely things like thatnot for themselves but because theyd make her look a little less like a canalgirl caesare was so fine everything about him said case vecchie from the smooth curved golden hair that looked as if it were cast in bronze to the long white hands her hands were workhardened and brown shed kill young benito if hed brought trouble without even realizing it her fists were clenched tightly on the oars maria garavelli was not one to back away from a fight shed been fighting for most of her young life she could say it had even begun before she was born when her mamas own people had thrown her out for getting pregnant without the benefit of a husband like shed have starved except that she had a small boat inherited from her grandfather and a regular list of customers she made deliveries for gotten on her own initiative so mama had worked right up through the first labor pains so shed said and then headed for the canalside midwife shed already made arrangements with and the next day she was up and working again with maria wrapped up in swaddling in a cradle made of half a cask maria had grown up like every other canalbrat knowing that it was only fight and hard work that kept you that bare nailparing away from starvation and disaster shed worked at mamas side from the time she could stand and when mama took the fever and died she kept right on working and fighting she had to fight with the toughs who saw her as an easy mark and tried to take her cargo or her pay she had to fight with the other canalboat owners who tried to steal her customers with implications that a little girl on her own couldnt do what shed pledged she even had to fight mamas family who wanted her to come work at some miserable pittance of a deadend job for them she had to fight the boysrelatives and canalers and toughswho figured since her mama had been loose the daughters skirts were there for lifting they finally let her be when one of their number had to join a castrati choir when shed finished with him so it was no wonder that shed never exchanged so much as a single solitary flirtatious glance with a boy much less had anything like a romance oh shed certainly thought enough about it she wasnt made of wood after all when a goodlooking tough sauntered by flaunting himself for the admiration of the puttanas or shed see a wedding coming out of a church with the bride beamingwhen shed hear a snatch of song and see some lovesick student balanced precariously in a gondola serenading a window she couldnt help thinking even on the rare occasions that she went to mass at saint lucias and spent the entire time contemplating not god but the pale and beautiful face of father raphaelhow could she not think about the ways of manwithmaid but shed had no illusions either she knew she was hard and rough not smooth and silky she knew only too well that her skin was brown and weathered not soft and pink like rose petals shed had no illusions about her looks but stillshed had dreams she never told anyone just cherished to herself and played over in the theater in her head when she was halfway between waking and sleeping someday some handsome fellow would drop into her lifeshed rescue him from a flood or from footpads or hed hire her boat to visit some worthless heartless bitch who would throw him over hed look at her and see something in her that no one else ever hadhed take off her cap pull all her hair down around her face and say mariayoure beautiful in tones of moonstruck surprise and hed love her forever and it would turn out that he was the longlost heir to one of the old houses oh stupid dreams and she would never ever have admitted to anyone that she had them she would never ever have believed them either except that one night they came true shed been tied up for the night under a bridge to get out of the rain when she heard the sounds that no venetianboater canalside dweller or highandmightyever wanted to hear a scuffle the sounds of a blow then the sound of two men carrying something heavy up to the top of the bridge it was a dark night on top of the miserable rain what with the moon hidden by the clouds but she knew she didnt dare move or make a sound she huddled under the roof of what she grandly called the cabin of her little boat and hoped that the men up there wouldnt notice that she was tied up in the shadows underneath she might be able to fight off one or even two but from the sounds there had been more than that a grunt and a heave and something dark and heavy drooped over the edge of the bridge it hung up on the railing for a moment and before it dropped there were footsteps running away then as she strained her eyes against the dark and the rain in horrified fascination the thing tore loose from the coping and tumbled down into her boat it had been a fairly low bridge getting hung up had slowed the objects fall otherwise it probably would have overset the boat or even driven a hole right through it when itthe body for that was clear what it washad landed it had done so on its feet crumpling or else it would have bashed in its skull if it wasnt already bashed or broken its neck if it wasnt already broken probably the stone tied to its ankles had helped out there and all she could think of wasget it off my boat shed scrambled out of the cabin and fate or god or something had undone all of her good sense and intentions for just as she reached the body it gave out a groan and turned faceup and just as it did so the clouds parted for a moment and a ray of moonlight shone down on what must have been the most beautiful man she had ever seen apart from father raphael who was in any case a full priest and out of the running so far as romance went and that was how caesarethehandsome caesarethedangerous caesarethealltoopersuasivedamnhim ended up in her shack in her blankets and in her care and it was just like one of her daydreams from start to finish she moved caesare into her little shack near the canals where there would be no spying eyes and ears she nursed him and kept him warm and fed him from a spoon for daysand then suddenly one day he looked up at her with sense in his eyes and said who are you where am i and she answered him and then like hed been watching the same dreams he reached up and pulled off her cap and her hair came tumbling down and he said my god you saved my life and youre beautiful well what was any girl to do when a handsome man said that to her in her own bed in her own house on a moonlit night when the lagoon was bright and glassysmooth he didnt tell her a lot about himself afterwards except that he was a danger to her and he had to leave herwhich she expected really but what he said then she didnt expect how can i leave you i love you and she fierce as a lion with a cub swore she could help him keep him safe from those enemiesshed known they were enemies all along no footpad ever bothered tying a rock to someone to sink him but then he told her who those enemies werethe milaneseand that hed been working for them right up until the moment that they betrayed him almost almost she took it all back almost told him to leave almost but she hadnt and shed hidden him until she was able to get him to someone who could offer him for a price a precarious bit of protection then a little more and him with his sneaks ways and his angels face clawed and fought his way up to being very valuablealiveto enough people that it was no longer more profitable for him to be dead for now at least and that was why maria garavelli found herself rowing her boat along a backcanal in the dead of night roused by a messenger going once again to pick up her lover from whereverhewas now short on sleep short on temper and wondering if this time despite passwords and safeguards it wasnt him but an ambush and lovesick idiot that she was shed have been sculling through canals of fire if she had to to get to him the ache in her fists suddenly registered on her brain and she eased up her grip on the oar for some reason that reminded her of benito and his peculiar peace offering for a moment marias natural combativeness caused her to frown but within seconds the frown cleared away and she uttered a soft little laugh that scamp truth be told she thought she was probably fond of benito maybe and it was a lovely red that scarf chapter steel heavy steel angular and gothic the spikeshouldered breastplate had curlicues and inlays on the points for heavens sake not for the first time erik hakkonsen stared in irritation at the heavy plate armor as he stood sharpening the blade of his algonquian war hatchet he was waiting not with any eagerness for his squireorderly to help him into it hed drawn the guardstint for this state banquet he looked balefully at the closedpot helmet hed be sweating in one hour from now no good german ritter would consider wearing anything else but full armor only erik was not a german ritter an icelander wasnt as stupid and hidebound as these continentals any icelander much less one who had skirmished on the vinland frontiers would turn up his nose at elaborate plate armor a crossbow bolt would punch through it and a ball from an arquebus or a good pistol would shatter the steel for that matter at close quarters erik could find the joints and cut them apart with his bladeandpick tomahawk as easily as shucking clams and carrying all those pounds of useless steel without a horse to help he heard the creak of the door what kept you pellmann he snapped putting the whetstone down ive been waiting half an hour oh the visitor had flopped onto the caryatidpillared bed the accommodation was a far cry from the cells in the bleak monastery at greifswald it wasnt his churlish pomeranian squireorderly admiring the caryatides the bed protested as the large human negligently sprawled on it rolled closer to inspect the finely carved detail manfred whistled appreciatively his reaction to the carving was predictable perhaps even justified erik was willing to admit erik himself had blushed when he realized that the carved nymph was perfect in every anatomical detail the beds reaction was also quite predictableand justified young manfred was designed by nature to wear armor to wear armor without noticing it it never failed to irritate erik the steel would chafe his lean angular sinewy body raw manfred was better shaped and padded for this sort of thing the solid blocklike manfred grinned revealing slightly skew solid blocklike teeth in a jaw whose musculature matched the rest of him erik suspected manfred could crunch clams without even bothering to open them well youll just have to go on waiting the young knightsquire drew a bottle from under his cotte and tossed it to erik here try some of this erik drew the cork without thinking and took a deep pull he spluttered what is it armor polish then he remembered himself and his duty he was sworn to the order and god for another two years he rammed the cork home and tossed it back to the laughing knightsquire in heavens name manfred if abbot sachs catches you with that stuff hell have you pushing guard duties until you turn gray hes with sister ursula again doing abbotly duties no doubt said the worldlywise scion of the imperial court at mainz erik felt his face redden jesu manfred dont say things like that hes a man of god in reply the young knightsquire drew the cork from the dull green bottle with his teeth he took a deep pull he did not splutter he set the bottle down on the stoneflagged floor with beerbrown innocent eyes he looked mournfully at the icelander then sighed heavily erik alas i am a man of the flesh and this is venice its supposed to have the best courtesans and the best bordellos in all europe weve been here for nearly two days and i havent sampled them youre supposed to look after me what say you we cut this banquet tonight and go whoring these local girls will go wild over that blond head and that chiseled chin of yours erik felt himself blush again he couldnt help liking his young charge and he couldnt help wishing that manfred had been placed under someone elses eye he understood why hed been singled out for this it was he supposed a great symbol of trust and a great honor it was also a great headache he tried an appeal to piety and reason manfred youre a knight of the holy trinity even if only a confrere a moral example to these soft corrupt southerners not a mercenary out for the customary three nights of sacking the young knightsquire grinned thats why i was planning to pay my way not being a ladies delight like you ive got guard duty tonight interrupted erik hastily and so have you come to think of it manfred yawned ill swap out come on erik ill go without you otherwise this was a dire threat it had worked when manfred had wanted to sample the taverns of innsbruck but it was a vain threat this time abbot sachs himself put up the list said erik grimly and besides my breton friend your court frankish isnt going to get you anywhere without a grasp of the local dialect you couldnt ask your way to the nearest church never mind anything else thats why i need a linguist like you erik grinned manfred and i sure couldnt get back without my sober respectable mentor to guide me come on erik not a chance erik glanced at the light from the high enchased window now youd better leg it back to get suited up id better yell for that useless pellmann youd do well to shove his surly face up his hinderend instead said manfred rising and stretching erik had yet to get used to the way these continentals treated their servants thralls back home were more like part of the family and as likely to yell at you as you were at them but pellmanns insolent attitude toward serving anyone but a north german ritter was beginning to rub even the egalitarian icelander raw i think i will if i dont find him in two minutes he said grimly pellmann bustled in abruptly the nasty piece of work had plainly been listening outside manfred snorted ah well ill see you at the banquet maybe therell be some pretty women there he left leaving erik to pellmanns mercies the pomeranian knew by now that the worst erik would do when a buckle pinched him was curse under his breath erik would swear the pomeranian used this opportunity to make the foreign confrere knights life a misery pellmanns knuckles dug into his rib cage harder than was necessary erik clenched his jaws restraining a fierce impulse to use his own knuckles on the surly underlings pudgy face instead he satisfied himself with glaring at the walls of the embassy even in this modest suite the walls were covered with wood paneling ornately carved in the imperial manner the sight of those paneled walls darkened his mood further the very fact that this ceremony was being held here in the embassy of the holy roman empire was a sign of the rot by rights it should have been held in the knights own hospital and if the one in venice was too small for the purpose a suitably neutral site could have been easily found in a city as large as this one holding it here simply reinforced the common perception that the knights had become nothing more than an extension of the imperial power pure and simple erik sighed remembering his fathers words as he bade his younger son farewell remember lad stay out of politics church or state it matters not your duty is that of the clan to the emperor alone nothing less mindbut also nothing more nothing else but between the pomeranian squire and the prussian knightcommander it was hard the prussian von stublau was irritating him even more than pellmann prussian son of a bitch muttered manfred as he marched into the banqueting hall he said it quietly though hed been hoping for duty carrying the wodencasket from the chapel nave to the banqueting hall instead hed drawn the delightful duty of being one of the doorwardens to stand for the entire length of the banquet and watch while the church delegations and the imperials wined and dined the oligarchy of venice not for the first time he wished he could pack this up and go home to bretagne or even back to mainz however his mother and his uncle had made it painfully clear that he was going to do service as confrere knight in a monastic order or else and uncle charles was quite grimly capable of making the or else a long stay in the imperial dungeons on the whole being a confrere was a better option just if he had to be strictly honest about it and he usually was with himself manfred had brought it on himself going to the gothic grandeur of mainz from the impoverishment of bretagne had been a shock when he had been sent to the imperial court as a twelveyearold page when he went back home to bretagne hed run a little wild his mother had hoped the pious monastic knights would rid him of his taste for low companions and teach him piety and allow him to mix with people of his own order mother was swabian to the core and regarded her husbands court and the chiefs and duniwasals of bretagne as little more than barbarians so far it had made him dislike most saxons and positively detest most prussians he tried to find solace in what he could the one advantage of the closed pot after all was he could ogle pretty girls at will of course he couldnt actually speak to them as a penance he could watch the chased silver platters of delicacies being carried in on the plus side he got to watch abbot sachs flinch from an array of whole crispy fried baby squid to make up for it the sound of the rebecs seemed to be trapped in the helmet the venetian musicians were stilled the great doors at the far side of the chamber were flung open and the party bearing the captured wodencasket advanced and there was erik carrying one side of the spear bier the casket was transported on manfred almost laughed all you could see of the icelander were those chilly blue eyes impossible for most people to read anything in that gaze but manfred knew him well enough to sense the icelanders irritation with the man leading the little party prussian son of a bitch von stublau had the opposite end of the spear that erik had been assigned to he was even taller than erik which was unusual among the knights needless to say he had the shaft end of the spear pick it up higher auslander grumbled the burly german knightproctor as they clanked down the passage toward the hubbub of the embassys banquet hall erik lifted his side slightly von stublau was right the thing should be borne on a level the four knights advanced in step bearing the crucifix made from four lashed spears strapped to the crucifix with bands of steel was the wodenite casket to erik the weight of souls in that casket was far more than the mere heavy oak black iron studs and runeetched bands even if each soul it had devoured was lighter than swansdown true the capture of a svear heathen godeven that of a small tribe of smalanderswas a triumph for the forces of christ its public display and the enactment of the rite of forbidding greatly enhanced the knights prestige but erik knew that the creature of darkness had been taken from a temple of bells and bones the bones of infant sacrifices the bells made from the skulls like most people from the league of armagh even those of norse descent erik was a follower of the gaelic creed within the church that traditionthe more so in vinlandwas not given to theological stringency until arriving in the continent he had paid little attention to the endless doctrinal disputes between the petrine and pauline trends within the main body of the church he had known that the pauline creed was dominant in the holy roman empire and that the knights were specifically devoted to it but the knowledge had been abstract until he joined the militant order since then the icelander had come to find some of the practices of the pauline ordersespecially those of the servantsa bit frightening his private opinion was that it would be far better to destroy the wodengodling than to display it the banquet hall of the embassy nearly took eriks breath away part of the impact was the smell beeswax and alchemistic silvercleansers clogged the nostrils even over the smell of perfumes part of it was the heat produced by thousands of candles in silver sconces he was becoming almost inured to the wasteful opulence of the holy roman empire still the banquet hall took that opulence to extremes he had not witnessed even in mainz he wasnt as bad as the orkney islanders who made such a virtue of their unavoidable frugality but the sheer ostentation still bothered him the high walls were slit with lancet windows the intervening spaces hung with tapestry underfoot was soft with turkish carpets imported from the great realm of the mongol ilkhan the crowded room was silenced by the entry of the marching knights as they moved slowly into the chamber eric studied the crowd through the narrow slits of his helmet at least in one small way the venetian notables packed into the banquet hall reminded erik of the icelandic althinggatherings and vinlander volkmeets far more in truth than the people attending the court functions hed been to in the cities of the holy roman empire as the triumphant party of knights displayed their captured trophy in their progression down to italy those crowds had been composed almost entirely of the nobility whereas somemany erik suspectedof the grandees of venice were plainly just wealthy tradesmen something about their posture said it erik examined giorgio foscari the doge of venice was an elderly manan octogenarian in factwho looked as if hed be more at home counting coins on his estate than leading venices signori in the senate and grand council and the condottiere general aldo frescata on the doges right looked as though hed be more at home leading a fashion parade than a march the castillian consul sitting next to him engaged in quiet conversation with the elderly father maggiore head of the local chapter of the servants of the holy trinity looked far more like a soldier the venetians on the whole were dressed to display the fact that this was still probably the richest independent city in christendom a city which was itself the owner of a small empire still there was an underlying hardnessa sort of marine tangthat appealed to erik the servants of the holy trinity spiritual and magical guardians of the casket came forward from where they had been seated their leaders both of the local chapter and of the delegation from the monastery at hochstublau left the high table and joined them sanctus sanctus in mirabile dictu the low chant began as with swaying censer blessed salt and the sprinkling of holy water the monks began their ninefold circle sister ursula began preparing for the evocation of the guardians erik was not well versed in magic other than some of the practices of shamans in vinland but he knew it was going to be a long ceremony the weight of the casket seemed to press down still further out of the corner of his eye erik caught sight of manfred one of the armored doorwardens as he ripped a browned piece of the whole roasted chamois that had just been carried in by the liveried servants the supposed doorwarden cracked his visor and popped it into his face erik sighed in the private interview hed had with the emperor upon his arrival in mainz charles fredrik had said that his young nephew manfreds piety compared well to a vinlanders city polish being more or less half vinlander erik understood the metaphor too well in another two years hed have finished his stint as a confrere knight with the order and he could go back already hed more or less made up his mind vinland it was such a wide open place even compared to iceland conserva me eriks idle thoughts were interrupted by that sudden loud cry his eyes halfclosed behind the heavy armored visor opened wide he wasnt certain but he didnt think that shout was part of the ceremony the chanting stuttered to a halt father maggiore the local chapter head of the servants of the holy trinity had turned and was now staggering blindly into the orderly procession eric frowned he had halfsuspected that the elderly whinyvoiced prelate was beginning to lose his wits during his hourlong rambling sermon that morning now it looked as if he were having a minor fit the wispy whitehaired monk flailed out wildly knocking to the floor one of the brothers who had tried to approach him monks scattered like sprats as the elderly man began to shriek his voice quavered upwards above the panicky babble beginning to break out among the grandees of venice abbot sachs put down his censer and stepped forward his open hand was raised and he plainly intended to slap the old man before he could do so before he could even touch the man the abbot was flung away as if by a giant unseen hand he landed on his backside legs flailing above his head then the old man stopped his voice as whiny as ever seemed almost normal as he said conserva me domin then he shrieked terribly briefly and then as the flesh on his face itself began to bubble melt and flow laughter black deep and evil erupted from lips pulled into a parody of a grin manfred armor and all vaulted the table sending ornate venetian glassware wine and silverware flying he raised his broadsword and reversed it taking it by the guard to form a cross he advanced on the monk who was tearing aside his robes with frantic bloody fingers back yelled abbot sachs scrambling to his feet back you fool knights seal the doorways already the nobles and notables of venice were heading for the great doors in panicstricken streams knights positioned at intervals around the walls rushed for doors broadswords at the ready for a moment it looked as if they would be mobbed down but steel armor and the fearsome swords quelled the rush after a part of the crowd had managed to flee the chamber young manfred meanwhile continued to advance on the tortured and still obscenely laughing monkslowly as if through thick mud sparks leapt from his spiky armor put this damned thing down snarled erik he had to help the young fool it was his duty to god and emperor charles fredrik despite the fact that the hair on the nape of his neck was rising he had seen combat in iceland and the magic of pagan shamans on the vinland frontiers but nothing like this stand snapped sister ursula advancing with rapid strides on abbot sachs who was pushing his way toward manfred the abbot looked as if he was struggling through quicksand von stublau the nuns eyes singled out the burly altmark knight protect the casket at all costs do not allow it to be set down this is but a distraction then she snatched a basin of holy water from one of the horrified watching monks and strodeas if it was the easiest thing in the worldto link arms with abbot sachs together they held the basin together they dipped fingers into it and flicked the water onto manfreds armor the effect was cacophonic with a discordant jangle like the cracking of bells manfred was flung backwards he landed in a brokendoll sprawl against one of the spindly legged chairs the delicate piece of furniture splintered under his great weight fragments flying everywhere the nun and the graycassocked abbot advanced on the writhing remains of father maggiore little flames were beginning to dance above the bubbling flesh the two clerics reached their hands into the basin and the silver basin cracked in two as if it were a brittle stick the two clerics retreated hastily not quite running erik was relieved to see manfred sitting up feeling for his broadsword among the smashed splinters of the chair a circle commanded the abbot servants of the trinity form a circle knightsput a ring of steel around that casket the forces of pagan darkness seek to free the woden hastily the monks and knights moved to comply but it was too late for the former venetian chapterhead of the servants of the holy trinity the old monk would never give another whinyvoiced rambling sermon or come around demanding to know whether anyone had seen his missing cassock the naked figure was shriveling and blackening even as the monks chanted by the time the monks had closed in on the body and sprinkled holy water there was little more than ashes left father sachs stilled the monks then he marched up to the high table where he had been seated with doge giorgio foscari he turned on the signori of venice with a gesture he stilled the rising babble from the crowd hear now my words people of venice he shouted into the silence his voice full of righteous anger is it not written you shall not suffer a witch to live evil flourishes here within the see of venice evil i say evil flourishes and you are too lax to tear it out root and branch the accursed strega jews and mussulmen ply their sinful trades in the open mammon and belial have misled you from the holy path given to us by the apostle paul i tell you he who falters from the gospel is a heretic and damned to eternal hellfire with torments of whitehot scorpions your laxity has meant that the evil servants of the antichrist dared to attack even here in the presence of the master of your city what hospitality is this that your own guests can be so abused what has become of the sanctity of guests erik raised his eyes to the bacchanalian stringcourses near the ceiling in irritation at the waste of precious time every moment now was vital the miscreants must be among the guests but some had fled it was essential that they be pursued there was little doubt that honest steel would destroy the magic of pagans instead he stood and ground his teeth as abbot sachs continued to harangue the venetians chapter party lookin for you said lola greeneyed suspicion in her voice the runnergirl wore the scarf hed given her for telling them where to find caesare and a fine silver pin shed got from someone else that was lola for you you had to be loyal to her benito winked at her from his rooftop he had to get back to marco but it paid to stay on top of the canaltalk and lola knew most of it before it even got out whod that be brighteyes lola raised a dark eyebrow that girl we call the spook you never see her in daylight always wears a hood got connections on the rio del ghetto benito started guiltily kat hed forgotten he was supposed to meet her tonight getting marco to move out of the swamp had driven the whole thing from his mind where is she lola sniffed you find her come on lola pleaded benito when she was in this sort of mood which was most of the time lola could be very capricious lola just sniffed and shrugged benito tried reason cmon lola its a job the runner shook her head with that one youre safer chasing her body than getting into her line of work and she was off benito knew it was useless to chase after her even if he could catch up which was no certainty because lola was fast and knew every alley and shortcut in venice she wouldnt talk and pressing her was a bad idea anyway lola had several large and unpleasant friends he tried the arranged rendezvous but katerina wasnt there seeing as it was close to the noise of barduccis he slipped in it was early still and the sailors werent there in numbers yet on the spits they were cooking rows of toresani the juniper and rosemary scented squabs gave benitos stomach an abrupt pointed reminder that he hadnt eaten yet he hastened past to the bar where valentina was plucking a complex melody claudia was counterpointing it softly with a treble flute the audience was still a small one which was just as well this was crying in your wine music he waited when the tune was finished claudia tipped him a wink someone casting dabblers about for you that spook ive seen her on the water but never in here wants to meet you at the campo san felice about ten youd better take care benito those are bad people youre mixing with coming from claudia that was scary still all katerina wanted him to do was to recover that parcel shed offered an entire ducat for the job too shed been pretty pointed in her comments about what would happen to him if the stuff turned up on the market if youre lucky the servants of the trinity will get you before my associates do yeah hed fish that parcel out and leave her well and truly alone he had responsibilities now he might even have turned away from that ducat if he hadnt been feeling guilty about not getting to the rendezvous in the shadowy side of venice you were a man of your word or you didnt survive katerina montescue was feeling guilty being late had been unavoidable but you had to be careful here in the gray canal and dockside world it had its own rules you could kill someone no problem so long as you sank them quietly and didnt get the doges schiopettieri stirred up you could steal from them lie to them but a deal was a deal god help you if you broke it word got around only the marshes would offer refuge then she it was true could go back to the casa her identity unknown but casa montescue was in such straits that it could die it was likely to die if this cargo was lost she moved the gondola quietly along to the campo san felice and the boy detached himself from the shadows and dropped into the boat almost without rocking it he moved as lightly as the thief he undoubtedly was she shuddered this was a scary world that she was forced to move in they did a magnificent duet im sorry i was late problems you were late you were late why are you repeating everything i say snapped katerina im not i was late benito burst out laughing so we were both late huh i was delayed said katerina sourly unavoidably benito grinned me too so lets get to it tightlipped katerina poled away the shabby gondola prow cut a silent notch through the still water after a while though she found herself almost smiling for all his ragamuffin ways there was undoubtedly something a little charming about young benito from the high windows of the imperial embassy streamers of light spilled whitely onto the thin mistshroud clinging to the dark canalwater inside the building all might be warmth light music and occasional trills of laughter here in the shadowy darkness of the side canal it was cold katerina shivered at least she didnt have to get into it so what are you waiting for she hissed get on with it and we can get out of here the boy did not look eager the way he was taking off his jacket spelled reluctance she could understand that she wouldnt want to get into the smelly cold dark water either she gritted her teeth if necessary she would benito looked doubtfully at the canal water as he dropped his jacket into the boat it wasnt so much the swimming part as the getting into the water that he hated it was all right when you had the sun on your back or when things were dire but just to do it in cold blood on a misty night the worst part was when the water got to your upper thighs do you want to do it instead he asked crossly im just wary its early in the evening for no one to be around katerina shook her head irritably the schiopettieri did a clearout here earlier theyre doing regular patrols weve got a bit of time before the next one comes through get a move on he shrugged no sense in asking her where she got such precise information she wouldnt tell him and he wasnt sure he wanted to know he stripped off down to his breeches no sense in getting all his clothes wet he slipped into the water it was cold even at this time of the year a couple of deep breaths and he duckdived under the water swimming down for the bottom he forced himself to open his eyes he might as well have kept them closed well up was dimly lighter his hands touched ooze he felt around and realized this was not going to be an easy job after all the waterdoor was plainly where the embassy threw out its garbage he went up breaking water with relief katerina was a dark figure against the lights did you find it she hissed anxiously benito shook his head no he heard her sharp intake of breath it must be there it must there was more than a hint of desperation in her voice yeah maybe he agreed hastily but look there is lots of rubbish on the bottom you got something heavy i can use to keep myself down there she had the rock in a rope bag that did the poormans duty for an anchor it gave him something to pull down on and a point to feel around that was a broken pot that was eughh he pulled his hand back from something rotten enough to crumble it took willpower to feel again and then he screamed underwater which is never a good idea something slimy and snakelike had slithered up his arm by the time his conscious mind had worked that out he was already spluttering and pulling himself up into the boat he nearly had the gondola over in his haste saint marco saint theresa hush snapped katerina looking around whats wrong there is something dead down there and it is full of eels the venice lagoon was famous for its eels you didnt want to think too much about what they ate benito didnt even want to say that what hed touched felt like cloth katerina could see that the encounter with eels had scared this canalwise urchin nearly witless still they only had a short time left to find the parcel inquiriesdiscreet inquiries but nonetheless alarming inquirieshad begun to come in about when the consignment would be delivered theyd had to take money in advance for some of this lot the inquiries had been polite among that fraternity word had gone around that the montescue were to be treated with respect but theyd been insistent nonetheless she shook benito gently though it was only eels theyll have gone by now benito shuddered it was all katerina could do to suppress her own shiver of sympathy she knew only too well just what eels liked to eat but for the family it must be done you gave your word eels benito whispered katerina shook him hard this time come on weve only got a little time the boy looked at her with big eyes and took a deep breath one last try try and work out exactly where you put it in katerina gritted her teeth shed been frightened as hell and lying down too how would she know she looked about trying to gauge things a bit further out i reckon and maybe a bit more toward the grand canal its difficult to judge without the other boats here the noise from the embassy hushed they both tensed then from inside came the familiar sound of voices uplifted in the latin of a plainsong chant go said katerina roughly pushing him hiding her own shrieking nervousness in abrasiveness as benito slipped off into the water she decided that shed try on the other side of the gondola with the boathook shed brought as a last resort he wasnt going to find it the hook might damage the parcel but even damaged was better than lost completely he wasnt going to find it he knew he wasnt going to find it he was only making this last effort for honors sake the bottom had been stirred up by his precipitous flight from the corpse now it was so black down here that only the direction his body wanted to rise told him where up might be it was claustrophobic crushingly so down here he felt around very very tentatively and his fingers encountered fiber he almost repeated his rapid ascent before he worked out it was twine coarse thick twine the kind merchants use for baling he was almost out of air but he couldnt risk losing it he swam following the cord it was a fairly long swim his hands encountered fabric oilcloth he had katerinas precious parcel gripping it with both hands he turned and kicked for the surface something hauled at it trying to pull it away from him katerina was beginning to realize the boy hadnt lied her attempts with the boathook had so far dredged up some scrap metal it looked like an old birdcage and a piece of cord balingcord she dropped the boathook in her haste to grab it and it was plucked neatly out of her grasp swearing forgetting the need for silence she snatched at it nearly upsetting the gondola she missed her sleeve wet to the shoulder she hauled the boathook shed dropped out of the water fortunately the cork handleintended for idiots who drop boathookshad kept it afloat shaking the birdcage remains clear she hooked furiously thats me stop it you madwoman to katerinas horror she saw shed hooked the something all right benitos breeches he was clinging to the pole with one hand and her oilskinwrapped parcel with the other benito jerked angrily at the boathook pole and katerina lost her balance she landed in the water beside benito with a shriek and a splash benito swam away as she came up i cant swim she yelled spluttering fortunately there was quite a lot of air trapped in the thick serge of her dress benito backed off to the stairs at the waterdoor you tried to murder me he accused also forgetting to keep his voice down katerina shook her head she was getting lower in the water you were on the other side of the boat now get me out oh yes like i was supposed to stay where i went down benito clutched the parcel to his chest and retreated katerina managed to grab the edge of her gondola and having learned from last time hauled herself hand over hand along the boat to the mooring post and thence to the steps benito held the precious parcel in front of himself like a shield you come any closer and ill throw it back into the water katerina found herself trapped between fury and embarrassment look it was an accident i told you accident my foot by the tone katerina knew she was in trouble she couldnt offer him more money a ducat was stretching things as it was look i can offer you more work vafuncula spat benito are you crazy claudia warned me a terrible shriek a sound not intended to issue from a human throat came from the embassy behind them it silenced both of them briefly benito snapped out of it first holy saint mark what a terrible inhuman laugher erupted katerina felt the hair on the nape of her neck rise she knew she had little magical skill but she was sensitive to it this was magic something dark the medallion on her chest felt very hot never mind what katerina scrambled into the gondola come lets get out of here benito looked doubtful his face white in the reflected light of the unshuttered windows then there came more sounds from the windows as if tables were being overturned and glass breaking a mans voice shouting back back you fool knights seal the doorways followed immediately by a swelling chorus of many voices screaming in panic come on katerina barked get in you can hold the parcel just get in weve got to get away from here the boy jumped into the boat and cast loose hastily katerina pushed off with skill she turned the gondola and sent it gliding away from the embassy breathing a prayer she looked back and nearly dropped the oar it was hardly surprising really with all the noise theyd made and the goingson over at the embassy but at the casa brunelli the doors leading onto the upperfloor balcony were thrust open flooding the balcony with light she saw him clearly the same slight redhaired man the same single forbidding line of dark eyebrows he was staring at them katerina would swear the expression on his face was one of triumph she shivered and the shiver had nothing at all to do with her wet clothes benito felt for his dry jacket he was shivering it was partly the cold and partly the fright the boathook bobbing in the canal behind them had barely scratched his thigh hell he loved thrills it was the best part of being a roofclimber but this was deep dark water she could have her parcel then hed be off he wanted no part of this woman and her business fortunately theyd part ways in a few hundred yards and he would never have to see her again shed never be any part of his world he could look after himself but he didnt want marco involved with someone like this girl chapter the monster was dragged away from its feeding by a shrill of command from its master the masters servant rather through which chernobog usually spoke and gave commands emerging from the darkness of its feedsnarling reluctantthe monsters world began to take on a semblance of color insofar at least as various shades of gray could be called color after a time red streaks began to appear in the mist those were not real howeversimply reflections of the monsters own rage the sight of those scarlet flashes brought courage again the monster snarled and this time with bellowing fury rather than frustration the clump of gray that was the form of the masters servant seemed to waver as if she were cowering in terror the monsters moment of pleasure was fleeting in an instant the master himself billowed through the mist an eddy of gray so dark it was almost ebon silence beast do not challenge me again red streaks came into the mist but these were like blazing bolts of lightning overwhelming the monsters own fury as easily as a flooding river flushes aside a childs pond for just a fleeting instant the monster thought to catch sight of chernobog behind the shadows and the mist the master was terrifyinghuge and tusked and horned and taloned scaled like a dragon bestriding a broken earth like a behemoth one of the scarlet flashes curled through the mist like a snake and struck the monsters flank agony speared through it the monster whimpered broken words pleading forgiveness tried to issue from lips that had once long ago had the semblance of human ones but that semblance was too ancient now too far gone the words would not come any longer not over lips that were no more than a gash not shaped by an oxthick tongue writhing in a mouth that was more like an eels gullet than a mans palate and throat again the spearing agony the monster wailed wailing it could manageas could any beast some part of the monster retained enough intelligence to think if not speak a protest i was a god once only the shadow of one came the sneering voice of chernobogs servantas if she were anything but a shadow herself and he isnt much of a god anyway which is why he crouches at great chernobogs side wearing his masters leash the servant drifted forward now fearless for a moment the monster sensed a vaguely female form coalescing stooping it felt another flash of ragebut a quickly suppressed one she dared to inspect its feed not much left she purred jeering but then i imagine the old monks soul was mostly gristle anyway the form straightened and moved back into the mist the gray of the shadow servant merged at the edges into the gray mist that surrounded the monster everywhere only a vague fluttering was left to indicate her shape the monster recognized the pattern chernobog would now speak himself using the servants voice you have done well beast the monsters momentary relief was immediately shredded by another scarlet lash coming through the mist ripping into its flank like an axe grayblack blood spurted from a wound that was insubstantialhealing almost in the instant it was formedbut agonizing for all that the monster wailed again and again crouching in terror which is why i punish you so lightly for your insolence the servants vague form was replaced by another of those horrifying forward surges in the surrounding mist the ebony billow that was chernobog himself threatening to take full and visible shape do not forget your place beast i allow you to be powerful at my convenience i could as easily make you a worm for my dining pleasure for a moment the monster caught another glimpse of chernobog on that broken landscape hunching this time over a mound of squirming souls much like worms they looked especially as they disappeared into the maw that devoured them a few spilling out of the gigantic jaws onto the charredblack soil another image flashed through the monsters mind itselfhimself thenheld down by chernobogs enormous limbs while the master tore out his manhood with that same maw and left the monster a bleeding neutered ruin less than a eunuch who had once been a god the monster was now completely cowed its heavy brow was lowered the muzzle that had once been like a mans pressed into its chest oddly enough perhaps the chest itself was still hairlessquite unlike the shaggy limbs and the heavy spine that protruded like a ridge covered with a long and stringy mane of hair at another time the memory of what that hairless chest had once signified might have brought anguish now the monster had no thoughts beyond submission good the monster felt relief at hearing the servants voice instead of chernobogs own as much as the monster hated and resented taking orders from one who was even less than it was nothing was a terrifying as chernobog unshadowed good its master repeated your recent task also it was well done beast the priest burned very nicely though i believe you wavered once before this shadow restored your courage the monster whined the master was unfair a holy symbol held by such as that oneencased in steelwas a thing of great power the master knew that such a fearsome one should never have been allowed silence the monsters thoughts fled after a moment the master spoke again thankfully through his shadow voice no matter as elsewhere this servant has her uses and now the way is cleared for the creature sachs the gray mist swirled and billowed from experience the monster knew that chernobog was retreating into his own counsel it managed to restrain any overt sign of relief the master would know its thoughts of course since chernobog had taken its soul but so long as the monster maintained all visible signs of docility it would not be punished not much at least how long it was before the master spoke again the monster knew not in that mistshrouded place where it was keptcaged for all intents and purposestime had little meaning the servants voice rippled with the masters own amusement it was an odd soundas if a torrent in a cavern were being heard through an echoing chamber far distant raw and unrestrained male power channeled through the pleasant modulations of a female throat and now i will reward you beast tonight i will allow you to hunt in an instant the monsters fear and submissiveness vanished replaced by ravening eagerness hungry the servants voice echoed faintly the masters own humor not glee so much as simple satisfaction there was very little left in the monster of what had once been a gods mind but it understood vaguely that chernobogs pleasure was more that of a game master than the monsters own much cruder urges at another time had its lust not been so overwhelming the monster might have felt some grief it had played games once itself it remembered and played them extremely well even giantseven godshad trembled with fear at that gamesmanship indeed chuckled the servants voice and a better soul than the one you just fed upon i imagine younger at the very least the image of a man came to the monsters mind put there by the master the man and his raiment and the fine house where he lived and all the byways of the city by which he could be reached late at night in the darkness the servant gave him a garment something once worn by the victimtobe it was full of manscent full of tiny fragments of skin the monster snuffled and mouthed it he had the scent the taste of the intended victim i constrain you on this occasion you will abjure from feeding on any other or you will face the masters wrath hungry hungry do not feed too quickly commanded the servants voice the thing must be done in blood and ruinnot quickly the monster would have sneered if it still had lips that could do so as if it would hurry such a feast the time that came after seemed endless though the monster had no way of gauging it but eventually it came go now commanded the servants voice and the monster sensed the grayness vanishing soon enough the gray mist was gone altogether replaced by the darkbut sharpshadows of venices narrow alleys and streets the monster scorned the streets however the great tail it had acquired as if to substitute for its lost manhood drove it through the waters of the citys canals as quickly and silently as a crocodile though no crocodile had such a blunt snout or had a ridged spine protruding from the water or a spine that trailed such long and scraggly hair it was spotted only once along the way by a street urchin searching the canal late at night for useful refuse but the monster had no difficulty disposing of that nuisance beyond the fierce struggle to restrain itself from consuming the childs soul once they had sacrificed children to him their souls had a distinctive taste a quick turn in the water a powerful thrust of the tail the boy was seized before he could flee and dragged into the dark waters the rest once the monster overcame the urge to feed was quick by the time sunrise came the blood would have vanished and the fish would see to all but the largest pieces and those once spotted would be useless to any investigator the monster was not concerned with investigation in any event in what was left of a oncedivine brain it understood enough to know that its master would be pleased by the deed the small murder added to the greater one still to come this night would increase the citys fear among the canalers at least even if venices mighty never learned of an urchins disappearance the only thing the master cared about was that the monster itself not be seen by any survivor and so as the monster drove quietly through the canals the one eye that remained to it never ceased scanning the banks still blue that eye and still as piercing as evereven if the mind behind it was only a remnant of what it had once been but none of the few people walking alongside the canals ever spotted it the shaman trailed behind staying as far back as he could without losing sight of the monster completely whichin the murky waters of the venetian canalsmeant following much closer than he liked he had to force down time and again the urge to follow using scent alone the struggle was fierce because the temptation was so great in his fishform in the water the shamans sense of smelltaste reallywas much better than the monsters for anything except the scent the monster was tracking but in the end the shaman was more terrified of his master than he was of the monster his master had made clear that he wanted a full report and had demonstrated the depth of his desire by feeding the shaman the cooked skin of a retainer who had failed to satisfy him spiced with substances which had almost gagged the shaman at the time and still made him shudder so the shaman stayed within eyesight of the monster however terrified it was of the creature if the monster spotted him it would interpret its masters command to leave no trace in the most rigorous manner the shaman might be able to evade the monsterhere in the water he in his fishform and the monster in the shape it possessed but he had no doubt at all that if the monster caught him he would be destroyedjust as easily and quickly as the monster had destroyed the street urchin a creature it might be today but the monster had once been a god after all no longer however that oncegod had been broken by a greater one so however reluctantly the shaman stayed within eyesight just barely the final destination loomed into sight just as the master had planted the image in the monsters brain one of venices great houses its walls rising sheer from the grand canal once it entered the grand canal the monster submerged completely and continued swimming several feet below the surfacemuch too deep in those murky waters even in daylight to be spotted by anyone in a boat the grand canal at any hour of the day or night bore a certain amount of traffic the monster could hold its breath long enough to swim through the great waterway and enter the side canal that flanked the house it did so emerging slowly and carefully to the surface unlike a crocodile the monster could not simply lift its eye above the water half the misshapen head had to surface before it could see enough then for several minutes it did nothing but study the situation maintaining its position by slow sweeps of the tail and breathing as silently as it could it dismissed the side door without a thought there was no way to enter through that portal without alerting the house and the monster was not certain it could slaughter all the inhabitants before someone fled beyond its reach not in such a great house which would be full of servants as well as family members the one imperative was that it not be seen by anyone who could tell the tale afterward carefully it studied the wall itself then satisfied it sculled to the side and with a great heave hoisted itself onto the wall the ugly octopuslike suckers on what had once been a deitys wellformed hands and feet had no difficulty adhering to the rough surface moving up the wall like some great halflizardhalfape it worked its way quickly to the balcony three floors above had the shaman still been in human form he would have heaved a great sigh of relief when he saw the shape of the monster lift out of the canal his task was done for the moment in his fishform he could not follow the monster except in the waters not even his master expected that much the relief was shortlived however the greatest danger would come when the monster reentered the canal no longer preoccupied with its prey the monster would be more alert and in the meantime hidden in the shadows of the pilings across the canal the shaman studied his surroundings warily then began to relax there would be no danger from undines here he realized not now at any rate not after the monsters passage undines were not very intelligent true but they were quite intelligent enough to understand they were no match for the monster even if they didnt understand what it was if there had been any undines in any of the canals through which the monster had passed they were long gone by now just before reaching the balcony the monster paused and scanned the surrounding area there was no one watching another great heave and it slithered its stillwet bulk onto the balcony again it paused still no one had spotted itexcept a cat hissing in a corner of the balcony the monster could move with astonishing speed for such a large and clumsylooking creature the hiss was cut short by a yowl and the yowl cut short even quicker the monster had no difficulty restraining itself from devouring the cat it did not like cats never had then it spent five minutes studying the large doubledoor that opened onto the balcony from the room inside it was not studying the door itself so much as it was pondering a problem the monster could remembervaguelya time when it had been superb at pondering problems and felt a slight anguish at the memory today it was not good at problems but eventually it decided the risk was too great to simply break through the door and sweep inside with a murderous rush the master had not told it whether the intended victim rested in whatever room lay immediately beyond a mere servant might be sleeping there granted the murder of a servant would satisfy the masterin part not enough however to forestall a certain measure of punishment no matter the monsters ugly and bizarrelooking hands were capable of delicate work as well as other more congenial tasks it was the work of less than two minutes using one of its claws to open the impressivelooking but crude lock one half of the doubledoor was pulled open quietly slowly the room beyond was a short hallway empty and unlit except for a single taper at the far end there were two doors at that end of the hallway one on each side from their wellmade construction and ornate decoration they were clearly not the doors leading to servants quarters the monster was certain that in the rooms beyond the master of the house and his wife were sleeping but which one behind which door there was no way to know without looking moving slowly as silently as it could the monster slouched down the hallway until it reached the end then for no reason other than whimsy it reached up and tested the latch on the door to its right the latch came up easily and silently the door was unlocked slowly gently the monster eased open the door and peered through it darkness the faint sound of breathing the sounds of sleep the monster pushed the door open far enough to allow itself to enterwhich meant pushing it almost completely aside it remained on all fours as it crept toward the side of the bed then slowly raised its head to study the beds inhabitant it sniffed softly it was the wife for a moment a furious rush of lust almost overcame the monster driving it to feed it was an odd sort of lust with nothing of the sensuality the monster could vaguely remember from its former existence but if concupiscence had been replaced by something uglier the lust wasif anythingmore powerful still it could barely restrain itself even now after all that had passed the monster still preferred female victims but the master had made his wishes clear remembering the nature of chernobogs discipline the monster shrank back almost whimpering it turned and slouched away back to the door then once in the hallway closed the door behind it softly gently almost now the monster could feel the craving rise and no longer made any attempt to control it when it opened this door it made no attempt to remain silent just quiet enough not to awaken the woman in the other room the monster cared not in the least whether the sound of its entrance roused the man in the room from his sleep it strode across the room in great steps almost as erect as it had been in a former life by the time it reached the side of the bed the man in it had barely begun to open his eyes one great smashing thrust of the monsters left hand closed those eyes forever two talons pierced the eyes the clawed thumb hooking beneath kept the jaw from opening the suckers smothered the face there was no sound beyond the blow itself and the sudden thrashing of limbs tangled in bedsheets the mans strength was pitiful any mans strength would have been much less that of a middleaged and corpulent one the only real difficulty the monster had in what followed was keeping its gurgling delight from turning into a howl of triumph the thrashing ended quickly the monster began by breaking and dislocating the major joints its huge right hand moved from knees to ankles to elbows wrenching and tearing and crushing that done pausing just an instant to savor the moment it drove its talons into the mans abdomen and began disemboweling him by the time it was done the man had long since gone into shock the monster cared not at all the soul could not hide from it behind the veil of unconsciousness as much pleasure as the monster took from the physical torment it inflicted on its prey that was nothing compared to the ecstasy of destroying a soul much like a cat might knead a dying mouse the monster began slowly shredding its victims body while it turned its real attention elsewhere it paid little attention to the work of its hand just enough to make sure it did not kill the man too quickly mist again began to surround the monster blurring its vision not the gray mist of its masters cage but the savage and exciting colors of its spiritual hunting ground dark colors purplishreds so thick they shaded quickly into black as the monster plunged deeper into the hunt it followed the fleeing soul through that mist tracking it as surely as a hound tracks a hare then cornering its prey in a place which could not be described outside of a nightmare it proceeded to feed and feed until there was nothing left but scraps of pinkish violet fading away into the billows under other circumstances the monster would have saved a small portion of the preys soul to gnaw on afterward as a dog gnaws a bone but carrying even a scrap of soul back to its cage ran the risk of alerting some cleric who might by chance be encountered during its return if that cleric possessed magic ability the master wanted no complications not yet at least so reluctant but obedient the monster devoured the soul entire its vision began returning under its hands it could feel the lifelessness of the corpse even before its eye could once again see its surroundings the surroundings returned eventually the same dark room darker now that the bedding was no longer remotely white the monster had no idea how much time had elapsed exactly not much surprisingly little in fact what the monster thought of as feeding time always seemed much longer than it really was to the world at large it straightened and stepped back slowly from the carnage on the bed all of its senses alert once again nothing not a sight not a sound just the quiet and darkness of a great house in sleep the monster was not surprised for all the havoc it wreaked while feeding the process was actually almost silent had it still been capable of the pride that had once been a cherished vice it would have felt pride at its skill but that ancient god was gone only animal satisfaction remained before leaving the room the monster took the time to lick itself carefully and thoroughly not because of any fastidiousness but simply because the masters instructions had been clear leave no trace of your passage the thick purple tongue removed the blood and gore quickly and expertly then like an animal moving away to sleep after feeding the monster returned to all fours and slouched its way out of the bedroom down the hallway and out onto the balcony taking care to close the doors behind leave no trace on the balcony it paused long enough to lick away any large puddles of canal water left by its entry what remained would evaporate with the sunrise a lurch and a slither and it was creeping back down the wall scanning carefully to make sure there was no one to see it slid into the water with hardly a sound the tail began to move again and the monster glided through the canals the master would be pleased remembering chernobogs discipline the monster felt relief sliding alongside satiation although somewhere inside the mind that had once been divine a small rage burned and burned there had been a time when the monster had disciplined others and smiled coldly seeing relief on the faces of those he spared it might have wailed then with despair but the masters instructions had been clear leave no trace make no sound during the return the shaman barely managed to obey his masters instructionsand then only by the sketchiest interpretation several times he lost sight of the monster swimming ahead of him through the canals but he had no trouble following the creature the monster might have cleaned itself well enough to fool human investigators with their dim and dull senses but the shamaneven in his human form much less this onewas not fooled for an instant the monster left a trail of havoc and horror that reeked worse than anything the shaman had ever encountered except in the presence of his master part ii september ad chapter delleste tapped the sheet of paper well antimo how do you assess this bartelozzi said nothing just looked unblinking at the duke a lesser master might have taken it for insolence the old fox knew better antimo bartelozzi always considered his answers very carefully that was just his manner the duke waited bartelozzi tugged his ear caesare aldanto overstates his importance in caring for the boys but basically he is being accurate the old duke sighed grandchildren are for spoiling and dandling on your knee antimo for a moment he paused allowingonce again as he had time after time since antimo brought him the newsjoy and relief to wash through him but the pause was brief the grandfather was disciplined by the duke these two are not grandchildren he said harshly they are delleste bloodline if they survive you could bring them home my lord said the agent quietly as i suggested once before duke delleste shook his head grimly for a first thing they may well be safer hidden in venice for a second the delleste bloodline is like steel steel needs to be tempered to both harden it and make it flexible it must be heated hammered and quenched he took a deep breath some steel becomes the stuff of great swords but if the alloy is not a good one if it is not tempered between the furnace and ice then you must throw it away because it is worthless bartelozzi looked at the report on the desk by the part about the jesolo marshes written in marcos hand hes been through the fire young benito has i think also been tested perhaps not so hard theyre only fourteen and sixteen years old the duke shrugged different alloys take heat differently age has nothing to do with it and im worried more about the younger than the older anyway marcos father was a valdosta benito is carlo sforzas son they dont call sforza the wolf of the north for nothing antimo between that savage blood and his mothers recklessness it remains to be seen how benito will turn out the dukes eyes wandered to the swordrack on the wall coming to rest on the blades set aside for his youngest grandson but hopefully caesare aldanto will deal with him benito will get himself into the furnace i have no doubt of that aldanto must just deal with the quenching antimo bartelozzi was silent for a time and is this aldanto the right person to handle the quenching my lord he asked at last he is not a good man said the duke heavily but hes a survivor a great swordsman and something of a tactician i would struggle to find a tutor quite as skilled at all those things part of the quenching process is for those boys to learn their moral judgment when they realize aldantos natureand if they still choose to follow after him then theyre not fit to be part of delleste bloodline if they choose honor instead i will know i have good steel flexible ductile yet sharp and true he sighed they fell into aldantos lap by accident but he was among those you hired to search for them he is being well paid to care for them to watch over them while that income continues and while i am alive they are safe but if i die antimo caesare aldanto is to be killed within the day he is not to be trusted bartelozzi nodded i have arranged it already my lord and i will see it is done myself the old fox smiled he could ask for no better guarantee but as usual he accompanied the smile with a tease you always insist on doing my business in venice personally antimo i suspect you of keeping a woman for the first time in the interview bartelozzi allowed himself a smile we are all subject to weaknesses of the flesh my lord in my case however its the food venetian courtesans are far too intelligent for my taste dangerous that chapter midday at the house of the red cat and the house was as silent as a church there wasnt one of the whores who rose earlier than francesca and most didnt ever see daylight lazy sluts theyd never be more than they were now and most would begin a slow decline to canalside the moment their looks began to fade withered old fernando poked his head inside francescas door is it that he never learned to knock or is it that hes under orders not to you asked me to make sure you were awake francesca he said speciously she hadnt done anything of the sort of course she was always awake and dressed this time of day evidently the madame was checking on her im going out she said with an ingenuous smile she didnt say where she had no intention of saying where and although fernando lingered long past the moment of polite withdrawal she didnt add that information which was in all events neither fernandos nor their employers business she picked up her cloak and tossed it over her shoulders then headed purposefully for the door fernando prudently withdrew and when she shut the door behind her she saw him retreating down the stairs ahead of her by the time she reached the groundfloor salonsilent and tawdry with its shabby rubbed velvet and flaking gilthe was no longer in sight well if he intended to follow her he was going to get a sad disappointment and he was going to wear out his legs francesca always went out for exercise at this hour of the dayif there was one sure way to end up a dockside puttana prematurely it was to get fatbut today she was going to go a bit farther than usual all the way to the molo in fact and entirely on foot not only was it good exercise but francesca had no intention of spending so much as a single clipped coin on a gondola if she didnt have to besides it was a lovely day the sun was shining the sky blue even the most fearful of citizens had come out to do a bit of shopping shaking off their fear of the rumored monsters prowling by night francesca didnt bother with a mask although even in daylight a great many people did in or out of solstice season she wanted men to look at her and wonder though she gave no sign of noticing their attention that wasnt the game let them wonder if she was respectableor other there was nothing about her dress or her manner to mark her as belonging to either class if they wondered enough they might be on the lookout for her and find out for themselves a long chase always made the quarry more desirable it was a long walk francesca allowed the crowd to carry her along for the most part no point in hurrying but no point in dawdling either she was paying close attention to the scraps of conversation she heard though and the general mood of people and she didnt like what she heard death prowled the waterways in the shape of something other than fever and footpads the rumors of a bloodthirsty monster had gained in strength and detail since the last time she went out there were other rumors too of those foreign servants of the trinitysots people called them with sniggerswho came storming into churches surrounded by armored and armed knots making accusations of heresy and witchcraft and dragging perfectly ordinary people off their knees and out of the church no one had actually seen any of this of course but everyone knew someone who knew someone who had still the rumor probably had some foundation and if you couldnt go to your church to light a candle without facing the possibility of finding yourself up on a charge of heresy where could you be safe there was a great deal of fear in the telling of these tales but plenty of anger too how dared these foreigners come in and start dictating to venetian citizens how to conduct themselves how dare a lot of pauline fanatics lay down religious law to devout petrines in their own city very very interesting if bad for businessat least the business of someone in the midlevel like francesca the courtesans in whose number francesca was not as yet included were immune from the persecutions and difficulties of the working poor and lower half of the middle class in good times or bad unless ones fortune was lost entirely the rich were never troubled in their pleasures by sacred or secular dictates all the more reason to make the jump and make it soon francesca did not spend a single lira on dresses cosmetics perfumes sweets or any of the other indulgences that the other girls at the red cat squandered their earnings on granted she didnt need to her looks and inventive imagination were more than enough to keep the customers coming she ate lightly but well her teeth were her own her breath always sweet her skin kept soft as velvet with some very inexpensive unguents purchased from a little strega herbseller named donatella whose advice she was scrupulous in following the same herbseller provided her with some very efficacious little sponges she kept steeping in herbsandvinegar when they werentwellinside her it was from this same strega that francesca had gotten a name and an appointment if francesca was right the girl she was going to meet might provide her with what she neededpossibly with everything she needed midway between sext and none at fiorellas foodstall on the molo francesca knew fiorellas they had a pastry made with asiago cheese and artichoke hearts that qualified as a mortal sin she could eat it while strolling along the molo along with a piece of bruschetta i shall have to do something about my breath after though she thought ruefully too much garlic knowing she was going to the molo she had not lunched and had only eaten lightly of breakfast that and the brisk walk to and from the red cat should make up for the richness of fiorellas pastry her strega herbalist had strong ideas about diet that francesca did not altogether agree withmoderation in all things had been good enough for the ancient greeks she crossed the piazza san marco crowded at this hour just before the close of business with everyone who wished lastminute bargains except for her looks no one would have given her more than a passing glance so completely did her clothing blend in with that of the others who thronged the plaza every possible level of wealth and status passed through here during the day the poorest of the poor crouched in odd corners and chanted their beggars cries while the most wealthy of the case vecchie set paraded by in their silks and jewels housewives bargained sharply over foodstuffs and women who might be courtesans or might be the daughters of the rich fingered silks and laces the stalls continued down on to the molo the wide promenade that faced the lagoon francesca walked slowly towards the foodstall eyeing the other customers looking for someone who fit the description of the girl she was to meet aha there she is looking restless a young woman paced back and forth before the stall her head lowered casting occasional glances at a gondola tied up directly opposite her face was almost completely obscured by a hood only someone who stood close and looked carefully would be able to discern her features beneath her skirtplain but of good qualityfrancesca caught a glimpse of trews with the sots on the rampage liable to take offense at practically anything such an odd combination of clothing was a prudent move for a woman who might have to tie her skirts up above the knee in order to better handle a boat or cargo francescas hopes rose the extreme care the girl was taking in keeping herself from being recognized fit the tentative assessment francesca had made from the herbsellers rather vague description of herdeliberately vague she was convinced this was a girl from venices upper crust working the gray trade in disguise possibly for her own profit but more likely because the family was in dire straits she might even be from one of the case vecchie families which would be ideal francesca walked directly toward the young woman making certain to catch and hold her eye the next time the girls surreptitious glance swept searchingly over the crowd relief suffused the womans shadowed features and she stepped forward to meet francesca halfway im kat are you donatellas friend yes i am im francesca she paused for a moment im temporarily at the house of the red cat she waited to see what kats reaction would be but there was noneor at least there wasnt one visible which was all that mattered again that fit francescas assessment that the girl or her family was in narrow financial straits presumably money was needed badly enough that the source didnt matter which also of course explained why the girl would be running cargo for the stregawho were hardly in good odor with the authorities especially these days i havent eaten yet francesca began she wasnt really that hungry but the girl was so obviously tense that francesca thought it would be wise to allow her time to settle down and retreat to a less visible location sure enough i have so why dont you go get something and meet me at my boat we can talk there while you eat kat softened this slightly brusque response with a smile id rather not stay out in the open and your time is probably short anyway francesca nodded and made her way to the stall to purchase the pastry while the girl retreated to her boat when francesca was seated in the gondola kat waited politely while she took the edge from her hunger i understand there are some things you need kat asked hurriedly but i have to tell you in advance that i only handle highpriced items highpriced and low volume im sorry if thats not what youre looking fordonatella was not clear about itbut thats all i can handle i need she fell silent apparently unwilling to elaborate in her own mind francesca filled in the rest i need to generate a lot of money quickly with only my own labor and this little gondola francesca had to force herself not to show any signs of glee perfect the girl was from the venetian elite probably in fact nothing less than case vecchie im not really looking to buy kat she said easily although there are some items i could use mainly i want to set up a conduit through which i can sell information she hurried on seeing the frown already gathering on kats face not for cash but for ah some assistance in a delicate matter of my own advancement the fact that francesca wasnt asking for cashwhich kat was obviously in desperate shortage of herselfcaused a momentary fading of the frown but soon enough it returned what kind of information and im not sure how i might be able to help your advancement a bit mulishly i dont have any cash to spend francesca understood that she had to edge away from triggering the girls uneasiness on the subject of her own identity the easiest way to do that of course was to focus kats attention on francescas so bluntly and briefly francesca explained the exact nature of her professionand most important her plans for professional advancement when she was done she waited for kats reaction driving both her fears and her hopes under and sternly the girl would do whatever she would do whatever else francesca had learned in her life a stoic outlook was central to all of it for a time kat was silent her hooded eyes left francesca and simply stared out over the waters of the canal then to francescas relief the girls shoulders moved in a little shrugging gesture and she turned back to face her francesca was a bit surprised to see that the expression on kats face was one of disguised interestalmost fascinationrather than disguised revulsion for the first time she felt herself start warming to the girl whatever great house she belonged to it was clear enough that kat did not possess the typical noblewomans haughtiness toward her social inferiors most girls from venices eliteespecially from the case vecchie which francesca was now almost certain was true of katwould have been sneering at her indeed would already be ordering her to depart their presence id like to help francesca but im really not sure the kind of information you could provide me would be enough of a help for me to spend the time at it it depends i guess on what you want in return francesca smiled i think youll be surprised at how useful the information ill be providing you will be after im situated in casa louise of course the information i could provide you right now wouldnt be all that useful i admit except she gave kat a level gaze even now i could provide you with quite extensive information on the movements of the schiopettieri several of their captains are regular customers of mine for a moment kats face froze then suddenly the girl choked out a little laugh thatd be something ha she smiled all right thats enough for me to gamble a little whether it goes any further well see you mentioned a few items you could use what are they a gown perhaps more than one a cloak and accessories replied francesca somethingimpressive but not showy not the sort of thing that i would be able to purchase for myself as i am now kat nodded i think i know what you mean case vecchie impressive would you object to something old but newly remade francesca and kat exchanged the conspiratorial smiles universal to every pair of women discussing wardrobe something about this girl was striking a chord with her and she could sense that kat felt the same way you have anticipated exactly what i was going to ask for as i explained i am about to undertake a change in status and for that the two of them discussed gowns and undergowns fabrics and colors for nearly half an hour kat it seemed knew both a seamstress and someone who was close in size to francescaand with the latest mode in laced gowns a perfect fit was easy to attain provided the size was close when they were done kat hesitated her face tightening a bit understanding the awkwardness francesca immediately said im quite willing to pay for these items kat in cash it was francescas turn to hesitate the kind of clothing she needed was extremely expensive more than she could possibly afford to buy new to make the right impression she had to obtain the finest quality silk clothing that kind of silk cost between two and ten ducats an ell and it would take roughly ten ells to make a single gown even used she doubted she could find anything for less than twenty ducatsand that in all likelihood would be a handmedown for poor relations with all of the trimmings beads embroidery and buttons removed which would be useless to her whatever else francesca could not afford to look like a handmedown of any kind a courtesan had to seem in every respect as if she belonged to the elite herself and was not a street whore with delusions of grandeur few of her prospective patrons would really be fooled by the illusion but the illusion was nevertheless essentialin order for them to maintain face and there was this also now that francesca had made this initial contact with kat she realized that maintaining the liaison could of great value to her in the future francesca was sure that kat came from an uppercrust familycurti at the very least an elite house which had fallen on hard times but still retained its social glamour that was the reason obviously kat was so careful to remain incognito in venices complex and sometimes deadly social dance losing face was as dangerous to such a family as losing moneymore so in many ways which meant in turn francesca managed not to wince openly what it meant was that kats surreptitious gray labor required significant financial returns or it simply wasnt worth the doing there was no way the girl would agree to help unless francesca was willing to part with this time she was unable to completely prevent the wince from showing everything ive saved upthats what itll cost me but it was kat this time who bridged the awkwardness smiling what can you afford francesca as long as its enough not to ah embarrass me she chuckled a bit nastily the truth is my greedy sisterinlaw would eventually grab everything from my mothers wardrobe anyway id just as soon you get some of those items instead of her kat named a price a better one than francesca expected better enough in fact that she could afford a few extras there was a little bargaining and the arrangement was concluded the transaction would still take practically every ducat francesca had managed to save up but it was well worth it with that wardrobe she could saunter confidently into any salon in venice including a soiree at the doges palace the remaining arrangements were settled quickly the first gownthe one she would need for her interview with the madame of casa louisewould be ready within a day and the rest within three if casa louise accepted her francesca would have the remaining gowns sent there to await her arrival that was fast work but if this seamstress was as expert as kat claimed it would be no great task for her to remake gowns in an older modeperhaps a matter of new trim adding the sidelacings redyeing as earnest francesca handed over half the agreedupon price and kat generously offered to pole her to the red cator near it anyway by the time they reached the red cat francesca sensed that the younger woman wanted to be friends not simply business associates that astonished her even as it warmed her heart the knowledge was a bit of a treasure even leaving aside the obvious advantage it would provide francesca at a later time when we need to meet again where can i send word she asked as she got gracefully out of the gondola without assistance which was no mean feat kat hesitated a moment donatella can always find me she said at last not quite willing to trust me yet or else shes afraid her family will find out what shes been doing if she was the sole support of an old family they would not necessarily want to know what turns she was making to keep them solvent having a summons come from a house of whores would certainly change that situation excellent and thank you francesca replied i will be waiting eagerly to see the results of our bargain by wednesday afternoon kat promised and pushed off francesca turned and walked sinuously back to the door of the red cat there that went much better than id even hoped she thought blithely greeting fernando on her way to her own room next the interview with the madame at casa louise but before that a full night at the red cat she licked her lips and tasted garlic i had better go rinse out my mouth chapter a piece of plaster bounced off marcos nose accompanied by a series of rhythmic thuds from overhead by that sure token he knew despite the utter darkness of his bedroom that dawn was just beginning he reached over his head and knocked twice on the wall he was answered by a muffled curse and the pounding of benitos answer he grinned to himself and began groping after his clothing thudathudathudathudapausemarco braced himselfthud a series of plaster flakes rained down a professional dancetroupe had the studio above their apartment from dawn to the noon bells from noon till dusk it was given over to classesnoisier but less inclined to great leaps that brought the ceiling down from dark to midnight the thuds were less frequent the groans muffled nobody around the campo dellanconeta talked about what went on then and nobody watched to see who went in and out marco knew though at least what they looked like thanks to benitos irrepressible curiosity theyd both done some balcony climbing and windowpeering one night a dozen or so hardfaced men and women had been there and it wasnt dancing they were doing it was some kind of battle training and all of them were very very good who they were why they were there why they were practicing in secret was still a mystery marco smelled fanatic on them of whatever ilk and kept clear of them then from the midnight bell until dawn claudias old acting troupe had the run of the place that meant less ceilingthumpingbut a lot of shouting elena deary do you think you might pay less attention to kristos legs and a little more to your lines all right children one more time from the top marco had learned to sleep through it all though noise generally made him nervous it was friendly shouting for all the mockhysterics being directly below the studio was one reason why this place technically a threeroom apartmenta room and two closets more likewas cheap enough for two kids to afford now marco hurried to pull on his pants and shirt in the black of his cubbyhole bedroom wanting to be out of it before the other reason evidenced itself because the other reason was due to start up any minute now right on time a hideous clanking and banging shook the far wall marco pulled open his door and crossed the living room the worn boards soft and warm under his bare feet he stood blinking for a moment in the light from their lamp after pitchy dark it was painfully bright even turned down to almost nothing he reached and turned the wick key and the odor of cheap lastpress olive oil assaulted his nose until it flared up then he unlocked the outer door and slipped down the hall to the big ewers and garderobe shared by most of the apartments on this level that incredible ruckus was the rio san marcoula boatyard it started about dawn and kept it up till the late afternoon and sometimes later there was another apartment between them and the repair shop but it didnt provide much in the way of soundbaffling fortunately for him the tenant of that place was deaf benito still hadnt turned out by the time marco got back so he pulled open the door to the other bedroom just big enough for a wallhung bunk and a couple of hooks for clothes identical to marcos and hauled him out by the foot there was a brief laughing tussle which marco won by virtue of his age and size and benito betook himself off to get clean there werent any windows in their home so there was always the oil lamp burning up on the wall the lamp was a curious blend of castoff and makeshift the brass container had once been good and still could be polished to a soft golden gleam the multiple round wicks were scrounged the lamp came with the place so did the castiron grate in the fireplace the fireplace smoked but provided some heat in winterwhen they could find fueland something to cook on the main room was small but it was still bigger than both the bedrooms put together all of it was bare woodenfloored and sootywalled but warm and without drafts and it was too many floors beneath the roof to get leaks when it rained on the wall opposite the oil lamp and next to the stove was a tiny firedclay basin and an ewer of safe water from the rainwater cisterns everything else was theirs and compared to the little marco had owned in the swamp or what benito had had in the attic hed been hiding in it was paradisiacal they now boasted a couple of cushions to sit on a verminproof cupboard for foodand even a second cupboard for storage which currently held two tin plates two mugs two spoons a skillet and a battered saucepan and assorted odds and ends they also owned their bedding and three changes of clothing each as well as a precious box of half a dozen or so battered dirty and mostly coverless books the last were marcos property some he had bought at secondhand stores like the precious anatomy book much in demand with medical students some were gifts from claudia a few from benito he knew the ones that benito gave him had been stolen and he suspected the same of claudias but a book was a book and he wasnt going to argue about its source all that hadnt come out of nowhere word had gone quietly upriver with a ventuccio barge that marco and benito still livedand a special verbal message had gone to duke delleste from marco as to why they werent coming home again back down again just as quietly had come a bit of real coinnot so much as to call attention to the recipient but enough to set them up comfortably with the coin had come another verbal message to marco from his grandfather you salvage our honor was all it had saidand marco nearly cried grandfather had clearly felt that his mother lorendana had befouled the family honor by her activities with the milanese he had said as much when he sent them into exile there was honor and there was delleste and valdosta honor which had been something special for many hundreds of years delleste honor was famous throughout italy and the valdosta were not just case vecchie they were case vecchie longi one of the old families one of the oldest families one that claimed to have already been living here in the marshes when holy saint mark was greeted by an angel in the form of the winged lion all venice knew how dearly the valdosta casa held their honor that upright stiff old man of marcos earliest memories had sent those few words and that parcel of coin to do even that he must have felt marco had redeemed what lorendana had besmirchedat least as far as the delleste were concerned that that had been worth more to marco than all the money marco hoped that the rest of what he was doing was worthy of that honoralthough he was fairly certain in his own mind that it would be honor required that debts be paid and he owed a mighty debt to caesare aldanto so hidden under the books was his secret beneath a false bottom in the box pen ink and paper and the current chapter of mamas doings back in the milanese days when he had five or six pages they went off to caesare aldanto usually via maria he had written up to when hed turned ten now how much of what he remembered was useful he had no idea but surely there was something in all that stuff that aldanto could turn to a purpose something to even up the scales of debt between them marco watered some wine and got breakfast outbread and cold grilled sarde bought on the way home last night benito bounced back in the door fighting his way into a tootight liveried shirt no one would ever have guessed to see them side by side that they were brothers marco clearly showed his ferraresedelleste ancestry taking after his mother lorendana straight black hair sunbrowned skin fading now into ivory and almondshaped eyes in a thin angular face making him look both older and younger than his sixteen years had he been back in ferrara nobody would have had any trouble identifying which family he belonged to for lorendana had been a softened feminized image of the old duke whereas benito roundfaced and roundeyed with an olive complexion and wavy brown hair looked like a gettingtobehandsome version of the venice typeand not a minute older than his true age of fourteen need to get our clothes washed tonight benito said gingerly reaching for his watered wine or tomorrow spares clean marco asked around a mouthful of bread inwardly marveling at the fate that had brought him full circle to the point where he and benito actually had spare clothing of course things had been a great deal better back in ferrarabut no point in harkening back to that to go back home would put the entire delleste house in danger and with the worst kind of enemythe visconti they were like the vipers of their crest deadly unforgiving and prone to use poison there was no way marco was ever going to take that grudge home yes im wearing em dummy som i tomorrow then thats my day off besides i got to see caesare tonight washing clothes meant getting the washroom after everyone else had gone to work clearing it with the landlord and paying the extra three pennies for a tub full of hot water besides what they were allowed as tenants there was an incentive to marco to volunteer for laundry duty benito was still kid enough to tend to avoid unnecessary baths but marco used laundry day as an excuse to soak in hot soppy soapy water when the clothing was done until all the heat was gone from it before rinsing the clean clothing and himself out in cold after two years of alternately freezing and broiling in the mud of the swamp a hot bath was a luxury that came very close to being a religious experience for marco hence marco usually did the laundry benito sighed all right ill clean the damn fireplace and the lamp slaver and the lamp what are you seeing caesare about dunno got a note from him at work yesterday just asked me to meet him at giaccomos because he was calling in favors and had something for me to do hey can i come along benito never missed the opportunity to go to giaccomos or barduccis if he could manage it unlike marco he loved crowds and noise marco thought about it then shrugged dont see why not caesare didnt say alone and he usually does if thats the way he wants it why gotta keep you safe from maria dont i marco blushed hotly hed had a brief crush on maria garavelli very brief it hadnt lasted past her dumping him headfirst in the canal benito still wasnt letting him live it down the memory of that embarrassing episode led marco to thoughts of his current romantic predicament he rose abruptly turning away from benito enough to hide the deepening flush on his cheeks he hoped profoundly that benito never found out about angelinahed rather die than have benito rib him about her he much preferred to worship her quietly from afarwithout having half the urchins benito ran with knowing about it too he still didnt know too much about his idolthe only reason he even knew her name was because he had overheard one of her companions using it oh angelina enough of daydreaming get a move on were going to be late he replied while benito was still chuckling evilly there had been plenty of gossip among the other clerks today and because of it marco made a detour down to the calle del vin on the way hometo the casa dorma he felt drawn there as if by some overwhelming force what was really at work was the powerful almost frantic romantic urges that come suddenly upon any sixteenyearold boywhich they are incapable of analyzing clearly and marcos years in the marsh had made him even less capable of understanding himself at least in this respect than almost any other boy his age there had been no girls his age in the marsh with whom to gain any experience at all so there he was at dormas gatehouse facing the ancient doorkeeper through its grate half of him feeling he was in a state of sublime bliss the other half feeling like a complete idiot he was glad it was nearly dusk glad his dark cotte and breeches were so anonymous glad beyond telling that the shortsighted doorkeeper of house of dorma couldnt see his face it took all his courage to pretend to be a runner with a message to be left for milady angelina he moved off as fast as was prudent eager to get himself deep into the shadows once the folded and sealed paper was in the doormans hands his heart was pounding with combined anxiety embarrassment and excitement maybewell probablyangelina would get it if only when the head of the household demanded to know what this is all about andjesutheyd want to know what it was about all right because it was a love poem the first love poem marco had ever written anonymous of course so angelina would be able to protest honestly that she had no idea where it had come from and why and marcos identity was safe hed written and erased it twenty or thirty times before it seemed right then with a carefully newcut quill and some of the fine ink from master ambrosino ventuccios desk he had copied it out on the best vellum and the only reason hed found the courage to deliver it was because today hed finally found out who she was milady angelina of dorma the daughter of the house not above marco valdosta even though she was at least two years older than hebut definitely above the touch of marco felluci if casa dorma discovered some ragamuffin like felluci had dared to send a love poem to milady angelina the best he could hope for was a beating at the hands of dorma retainers if young noblemen of the family got involved marco felluci might very well find himself run through by a rapierand these great old families usually had a bakers dozen of brawling young cousins lounging around all of them ready at an instant to defend their familys honor marco sighed he had buried marco valdosta quite thoroughly and not even for the sweet eyes of angelina dorma was he going to resurrect the name hed been born to marco felluci he was and marco felluci he would remaineven though it meant abandoning all hope of ever winning the girl he was quite certain was the love of his life but even if he couldnt touch he could dreamand perversely even if she were never to learn who her unknown admirer was he wanted her to know how he felt so hed spent three hours struggling over that poem just two weeks ago it was that hed first seen her at giaccomos with a couple of companions until then his daydreams had been confined to something just as impossible but hardly romantic the accademia lord and saints what he wouldnt give to get in there to study medicine buthe had no money and no sponsor and the wrong political history not that he gave a fat damn about the montagnards anymore and their fanatical determination to bring northern italy into the holy roman empire but there was no way he was ever going to pass for one of the young nobles of venice or even a son of one of the casa curti still marco was young enough that sometimes sometimes when the day had really gone well it almost seemed possible because a longburied dream had surfaced with this new life marco wanted to be a healer a doctor hed had that ambition as far back as he could remember mama had owned a drugshop for a while which shed set up with what money she had after her family cut her off marco had been just old enough to help her with it and hed found the work fascinating the patrons of the shop had teased him about itbut right along with the teasing theyd asked his advice and had taken it too that perfect memory of his again he remembered symptoms treatments alternatives everything hed helped old sophia out in the marshes later with her herbs and weeds dispensing what passed for medicine among the marshfolk and locos of course since seeing angelina for the first time shed crowded out that particular daydream more often than not but it was still there rooted so deeply he knew it would never go away and so as he made his way from casa dorma marcos thoughts were brooding and melancholy two heartbreaks at the same time seemed a bit much at the age of sixteen he consoled himself by beginning to compose in his mind another love poem a brooding and melancholy one of course his feet were chilled as he padded along the damp wooden walkways he couldnt get used to shoes again after two years without them in the marshes so he generally went as bare of foot as a bargee the temperature was dropping fog was coming off the water the lines of the railings near him blurred farther on they were reduced to silhouettes farther than that across the canal there was nothing to see but vague hulking shapes without the clatter of boot soles or clogs he moved as silently in the fog as a spiritsilent out of habit if the marshgangs didnt hear you they couldnt harass you breathing the fog was like breathing wet smoky wool it was tainted with any number of strange smells it held them all fishy smell of canal smell of rotting wood woodsmoke stink of nameless somethings poured into the dark cold waters below him he hardly noticed his thoughts were elsewhereback with the inspiration for his poem oh angelina he wondered if hed see her tonight at giaccomos halfhoping halfdreading she tended to show up at giaccomos pretty frequently marco was under no illusions as to why caesare aldanto of coursethe most handsome and glamorous man there hell caesare even had claudia and valentina exchanging jokes and comments about him marco wondered hopelessly if hed ever havewhatever it was that caesare had probably not his feet had taken him all unaware down the cobbled walkways and the long black sotoportego through to his own alleyway to his very own door almost before he realized it he started to use his key but benito had beaten him home and must have heard the rattle in the lock about time he caroled in marcos face pulling the door open while marco stood there stupidly key still held out you fall in the canal they kept us late marco said trying not to feel irritated that his daydream had been cut short there any supper it was your turn there will be got eggs and a bit of pancetta frittata do he returned to the fireside and the longhandled blackened battered pan he began frying garlic a chopped onion a handful of parsleystolen no doubt from someones rooftop gardenand the cubes of pancetta marco sniffed appreciatively benito was a fairly appalling cook but always got the best of ingredients and as long as he didnt burn it there wasnt much he could do wrong with frittata benito tossed the fried mixture into the beaten egg in the cracked copper bowl then after giving it a swirl and putting in a lump of lard he tossed the whole mixture back in the pan and back on the heat they gave me tomorrow off too like yousomething about a merchant ship all the way from the black sea you got anything you want to do after chores i mean not really marco replied absently going straight over to the wall and trying to get a good look at himself in the little bit of cracked mirror that hung there benito noticed cocking a quizzical eye at him as he brought over an elderly wooden platter holding marcos half of the omelet and a slice of bread something doing i just dont see any reason to show up at giaccomos looking like a drowned rat marco replied waspishly accepting the plate and beginning to eat huh benito took the hint and combed his hair with his fingers then inhaled his own dinner hey big brotheryknow somethin funny benito actually sounded thoughtful and marco swiveled to look at him with surprise since you started eating regular youre getting to look a lot like mama and that aint badshe maya been crazy but she was a looker marco was touched by the implied compliment not so funny he returned i gotta look like somebody you know the older you get the more you look like carlo sforza in the right light nobodyd ever have to guess who your daddy was benito started preening at thathe was just old enough to remember that the great condottiere had been a fair match for caesare aldanto at attracting the ladies then marco grinned wickedly and deflated him its just too bad you inherited mamas lunatic tendencies also hey now dont start something you cant finish marco warned as his brother dropped his empty plate seized a pillow and advanced on him benito gave a disgusted snort remembering how things had turned out only that morning and threw the pillow back into its corner no fair lifes like that marco replied so lets get going huh giaccomos was full but subdued no clogging not tonight no music even nobody seemed much in the mood for it the main room was hot and smoky not just from giaccomos lanterns either there was smoke and fog drifting in every time somebody opened a door which wasnt often as it was getting cold outside lamps tonight were few and wicks in them were fewer customers bent over their tables their talk hardly more than muttering dark heads under darker caps or bare of covering no one here tonight but boatmen and bargees marco looked around for the only blond head in the room but had a fair notion of where to find him when he had a choice aldanto preferred to sit where he could keep an eye on everything going on pretty paranoidbut normal if you were an exmontagnard especially an exmontagnard from milan even by the standards of italy intrigue in milan was complex and deadly milan was the stronghold of the montagnard cause to which the duke of milan paid faithful homage but filippo visconti had his own axes to grind and his own doubledealings with respect to the montagnards the imperial cause was a marvelous thing for the ruler of milanso long as it did not actually triumph if it did the essentially independent realm of milan would become just another province within the holy roman empire and duke visconti was not the man to take kindly to the thought of being a mere satrapany more than his condottiere carlo sforzas bastard son benito took kindly to his older brother marcos attempts to rein in his lessthanlegal activities politics in milan in short was like a nest of vipers marcos own mother had been destroyed by that nestand caesare aldanto who hadnt made sure he always sat where no one could get behind him marco had been known to choose his seats that way too whether he liked it or not and despite the fact that he no longer cared about such things his heritage had entwined him hopelessly in the coils of italian politics there he wasblack cotte dark cap golden blond hair that curled the way the carved angels hair curled as marco had expected caesare was ensconced in his usual corner table but as marco and benito wormed their way closer marco could see that he was lookingnot quite hungover but not terribly good limplooking like it was an effort to keep his head up and his attention on the room and the people in it minor mental alarms began jangling still if the man wanted to binge once in a while who could blame him ventuccio had plenty to say about him not much of it good marco picked up a lot by just keeping his mouth shut and his ears open doing the accounts they set him and staying invisible what he heard didnt seem to match the caesare aldanto who had given two dumb kids a way out of trouble especially when it was more logical for him to have knifed them both and dumped them in the canal he had a feeling that someday hed like to hear caesares side of things he also had a feeling that if that day ever came it would be when aldanto was on a binge if he ever lowered his guard enough aldantos table had a candle over it not a lampcandlelight was even dimmer than lamplight the two boys moved up to the side of the table like two thin shadows marco had brought his weeks worth of recollections neatly folded into a packet maybe it was the dim lightbut they stood by the side of the table for nearly a minute before aldanto noticed them marco bit his lip wondering if hed offended aldanto in some way and the man was paying back in arrogancebut no it was almost as if he was having such trouble focusing that he could only attend to one thing at a time as if he really wasnt seeing them until he could get his attention around to the piece of floor they were standing on when aldanto finally saw them and invited them to sit with a weary wave of his head marco pushed the sealed packet across the table towards his hand aldanto accepted it silently put into a pocket then stared off into space like hed forgotten they were there marco sat there long enough to start feeling like a fool then ventured to get his attention milord now aldanto finally looked at them again his eyes slowly focusing he did not look hungover after all he looked tired to death and ready to drop you asked me to come here remember there is something you want us to do i aldanto rubbed one temple slowly as if his head was hurting him his eyes were swollen and bruised looking and there were little lines of pain between his eyebrows there wasi know there was a reason this was nothing like the canny caesare aldanto that marco was used to dealing with alarmed now marco took a really hard look at him eyes alert for things sophia had taught him to take note of he didnt like what he saw a thin film of sweat stood out on caesares forehead his blue eyes were dull and darkcircled aldanto was fair but hed never been this white before his hair was damp and lank and not from the fog marco would bet on it and his shoulders were shivering a little as if from coldyet giaccomos was so warm with closely crowded bodies that marco was regretting hed worn his thick cotte and now marco was remembering something from this morning and the gossip among the other clerks at ventuccioa rumor of plague in the town maybe brought in on that black sea ship maybe not marcos bones said that whatever was wrong with caesare had its roots herebecause marcos bones had once shaken with a chill that hed bet caesare was feeling now milord are you feeling all right he whispered under cover of a burst of loud conversation from three tables over aldanto smiled thinly to tell you the truth boyno afraid ive got a bit of a cold or something felt like death two days ago and now it seems to be coming back a bit worse if anything he broke into a fit of coughing and his shoulders shook again and although he was plainly trying not all of his iron will could keep the tremor invisible marco made up his mind on the instant marco turned to his brother benitogo find maria get benito got aldanto looked at marco with a kind of dazed puzzlement shes probably on her way what youre drunkact like it marco whispered harshly unless you want giaccomo to throw you in the canal for bringing plague in here i dont much imagine hed be real happy about that he rose shoved his chair back and seized aldantos arm to haul him to his feet before the other could protest or react and that was another bad sign aldanto had the reactions of any trained assassin quick and deadly only tonight those reactions didnt seem to be working marco had always been a lot stronger than he lookedwith a month of regular meals he was more than a match for the fevered caesare aldanto now milord caesare he said aloudnot too loudly he hoped but loud enough i think a breath of air would be a proper notion no im afraid milord giaccomos drink is a bit too good tonight there were mild chuckles at that and no one looked at them twice as marco halfcarried halfmanhandled aldanto towards the door which was fortunate for they both discovered when aldanto tried to pull away that his legs were not up to holding him they staggered between the tables weaving back and forth marco sagging under the nearly deadweight aldanto had become out of the double doors they wove narrowly avoiding a collision with an incoming customer and down onto the lanternlit front porch down a set of stairs were the tieups for small boats only half of them taken tonight and pulling up to those tieups was a gondola sculled by a dusky girl in a dark cap maria garavelli and no mistaking her marco eyed her uncertainly not sure whether he was actually relieved that benito had found her maria was notorious along the canals her mother kin to half of the families in the caulkers guild had done the unthinkableshed gotten pregnant by some unknown father refused to name him refused to marry in haste some scrapedup suitor and had been summarily thrown out on her ear by her enraged father the woman had outfaced them all bearing her child openly raising her openly and taking the gondola her grandfather had left her and making a place and a reputation for hard honest work right up until the day she died maria had continued that reputation though she had been only just big and strong enough to pole the boat over difficult passages when her mother went to the angels or the devil depending on who was doing the telling with her skirts tied up between her legs for ease in movement that dark cap pulled over her ears and all of her hair tucked up into it she was as androgynous a creature as any castrati working a boat from the time she could walk had given her wide strong shoulders and wellmuscled arms her pointed chin and high cheekbones looked female but the square jaw hinges and deepset brown eyes usually narrowed with suspicion would have been more at home in a mans face there wasnt anything about their expression that looked soft or female nor was there in the thin lips generally frowning she hadnt a womans complexion that was for sure she was as brown as any bargeman if there were breasts under that shapeless shirt it wouldnt be easy to tell but there was more than a hint of womanly shape in the curve of her hipsand her legs were the best on the canal of course if you dared to tell her so shed probably punch you in the jaw so hard it would be three days before you woke up they were just in time to see benito catching the line maria was throwing him light from giaccomos porch lantern caught her eyes as she stared at them there was something of a mixture of surprise and shockyes and a touch of fearin the look she gave them i think we need to get this fellow home marco said loudly praying maria would keep her wits about her she might not know him well but she knew that aldanto had trusted them to spy for him and guard his back more than once he just prayed shed trust him too and follow his lead she did playing along with him except for one startled glance fools been celebratin she snorted legs braced against the roll of her boat hands on hips looking theatrically disgusted she pushed her cap back on her hair with a flamboyant and exaggerated shove ought to let him walk home that i should ah hell hand him over aldanto was in no shape now to protest the hash they were making of his reputation he was shaking like a reed in a winter storm his skin was tight and hot to the touch as maria evidently learned when she reached up to help him down the ladder onto her halfdeck lookyou was all he managed before another coughing fit took him and maria got him safely planted she gave no real outward sign that she was alarmed thoughjust a slight tightening of her lips and a frightened widening of her eyes think wed better come along maria marco continued in what he hoped was a bantering tone of voicefor though they seemed to be alone there was no telling who had eyes and ears in the shadows or above the canal afraid milord is likely to be a handful wont like being told what to do that last was for aldantos benefit while he talked he stared hard into marias eyes hoping shed read the message there go along with this he tried fiercely to project i can help you think so the tone was equally bantering but the expression seemed to say that she understood that silent message well guess it cant hurt right enough then benito give maria a hand with that line marco climbed gingerly down into the boat where aldanto sat huddled in misery as benito slid aboard the bowline in his hand what the hell maria hissed as soon as they were out of earshot of the bank hes got fever looking at him i think it is just the marshfever what they call malaria not the plague you got something to keep him warm without the need to guard her expression marco could read her nearly as well as one of his books first there was reliefthank god it could have been worse he could have been hurtand that was quickly followed by anger and resentment he couldnt guess at the reasons for those emotions but that expression was chased almost immediately by stark naked fear then she shuttered her face down again and became as opaque as canal water at her mute nod toward the bulkhead marco ducked under it and out again and wrapped the blanket hed found around aldantos shaking shoulders aldanto looked up eyes full of bleary resentment i cough can take care of cough myself thanks marco ignored him first thing we got to get him back home and in bed but we gotta make out likes hes drunk not sick maria nodded slowly marco was grateful for her quick grasp of the situation because if the people figure hes sickthey figure hes an easy target damn will you two leave me alone muttered the sick man this time marco looked him right in the eyes no he said simply aldanto stared and stared like one of the piers had up and answered him back then groaned sagged his head onto his knees and buried his face in his hands right marco turned back to maria swiveling to follow her movements as she rowed the gondola into the sparse traffic on the grand canal she wasnt sparing herselfmarco could tell that much from what hed learned from poling his raft which meant she was trying to make time which meant she was worried too second thing is we need money i got some but not too much how about you or him some what for suspicion shadowed the glance she gave him as she shoved the pole home against the bottom suspicion and more of that smoldering anger and fear touchy about money are we maria medicine he said quickly some we send benito for people are always sending runners after medicine especially in fever season nothing to connect caesare with that marco fell silent for a moment you said some ill decide the rest after we get him back marco said slowly and i know how bad it is campo san polo at last up the stairs at water level they went stairs that led almost directly to aldantos door aldanto tried to push them off to get them to leave him at that door but when his hands shook so that he couldnt even get his key in the lock marco and maria exchanged a lookand maria took the key deftly away from him caesare complained bitterly but weakly all through the process of getting him into his apartment and into the bed in the downstairs bedroom not even with three of them were they going to try and manhandle him up the stairs to the room he usually used ominously thoughat least as far as marco was concernedaldanto stopped complaining as soon as he was installed in bed just closed his eyes against the light and huddled in his blanket shivering and coughing marco sent benito out with orders for willow bark and cornpoppy flowers also for red and white clover blossoms for the cough not that he expected any of them to do any good this wasnt that kind of fever he knew it now knew it beyond any doubting i hope you can afford to lose a nights trade maria he said pulling her out of the bedroom by main force maybe more ill tell you the truth of it caesares in bad shape and it could get worse its just a cold or somethin aint it her look said she knew damned well that it was worse than that but was hoping for better news than she feared not for him it isnt marco replied figuring shed better know the worst same thing happened to me when i had to hide in the swamp i caught every damn thing you could think of marco shook his head well he needs something besides what we can get at the drugshops the calle farnese she said doubtfully marco shook his head firmly more than quackmagic either he took a deep breath now listen im going to write down exactly what i need you to do with those herbs when benito gets back i cant read she whispered marco swallowed with marias pride you tended to forget she was just a woman from a large poor caulker family even the menfolk could probably barely manage to cipher their names never mind benito will read it for you it should help him to stop coughing enough to sleep the coughing is not serious the fever is the part that is worrying it should break soon and just leave him weak and tired then itll start up again right now he needs sleep more than anything else you stay with him dont leave him that might be enoughhell feel like he wants to die but hes not exactly in any danger so long as he stays warm but marco paused to think all right worst case if he gets worse before i get backif his fever comes again or his temperature goes up more that was an ugly notion and hit far too close to home he steadied his nerves with a long breath of air and thought out everything he was going to have to do and say what he was going to order her to do wasnt going to go down easy maria garavelli didnt like being ordered at the best of times and this was definitely going to stick in her throat i know maybe more about our friend than you think i do im telling you the besthell the only option if he starts having trouble breathing or hallucinating you send benito with a note to ricardo brunelli you tell him if he wants his pet assassin alive hed better send his own physician and fast marias eyes blazed and she opened her mouth to protest marco cut her short look you think i want my brother going up there you think were in any better shape than caesare is in this town i dont know what you know about us maria but we got as much or more to lose by this i dont know if caesares let on about us but god god the chance but they owed caesare more than they could pay look at mebelieve me maria if brunelliany of emever found out about me and benito wedwed wish we were dead thats all we know things too and we got nobody but caesare keeping us from getting gobbled up like sardines caesare they got reasons to keep aliveuswell you can figure out how much anybodyd miss two kids so trust me the risks a lot more on our side if he gets worse its the only way to save him damn it marco she started then sagged defeated by his earnestness and her own fear and worry all right yeah i pretty much know about your situation hell thoughwhat youve been doingi dunno why wed need a real doctor youre as good a doctor as i ever seen like bloody hell i am he snapped more harshly than he intended he saw maria wince away her expression chilling and hastily tried to mend the breach lookim sorry i didnt mean that the way it sounded maria im scared toofor all of us he managed half a smile when he saw the hard line of her lips soften and you juststepped on a sore toe thats all see id give my arm to be able to go to the accademia to learn to be a doctor and ive got about as much chance of that as your gondola has of flying he sighed thats the problem with having things get better i guess when i didnt have anything i didnt want things because i knew id never get em but now i got a little seems like i want more things ive got no chance for he hadnt really expected maria to understand but to his surprise she gave a little wistful glance back toward the bedroom sighed and nodded i reckon we both got a notion how that feels she agreed buti dunno brunellihes a sharkthat doctor could just as easy poison caesare as cure him so i just gave you what to do in the worst case hey worry about that when the time comes caesares luck with skinning through hell be all right but if notill tell you nowyou might just as well chance poison cause if you want caesare alive you get him a real doctor as soon as he starts getting worseif he does before i make it back back from where she only now seemed to realize that he wasnt planning on staying i told you i know this fever i had it once too and caesare needs moren what we can get from the drugshop so im going to get the medicine he needsthe one place here i know i canwhere i got what saved me the place i spent the last two years the marsh he smiled crookedly at her stunned expression how are you going get there she stammered i i said you had to stay here didnt i and keep benito here to help when he gets back ill get in the same way i did the last time walk or swim the tide is out and i know the channels i should do i lived there for long enough chapter youre not going out again not for the first time or even the thousandth time katerina montescue wondered what had possessed her brother alfredo to marry alessandra and why he had to die and leave kat to cope with the silly shrewish bitch who never thought beyond her clothes or belladonawidened eyes except for finding new ways to snipe at everyone and boast about her highborn family connections kat took a deep breath yes she volunteered not one word more alessandra looked at the dowdy roughspun woolen hooded cloak katerina put on over her plain gray twill she sniffed disapprovingly im surprised your lover will let you wear things like that its not even clean it was and this from an idle cow who never did a damn thing in a house that had ten servants too few to maintain it who pestered money they could ill afford out of grandpapa to buy more frippery clothes to add to the cupboardsfull she already owned kat was too angry to keep her tongue unlike you i dont have to chase everything that wears breeches sandi alessandra hated having her name shortened ive got better things to do battle was now fairly joined i hope so said alessandra loftily the way you are ruining your hands with that rough oar its commoners work and youll never get a man then forgetting that shed just said there was no chance of kat getting a man she went on maybe he is a commoner but even you couldnt sink that low surely kat ground her teeth what im doing has nothing to do with men or with you either i wish youd stay out of my room i never invited you in im your sisterinlaw alessandra said righteously as the married woman of the house i have a duty and responsibility to see to your welfare i dont think i should let you go out to tryst with your lover as if you were some common whore what if news of this got back to the brunellis try stopping me sister just try ive got grandpapas permission she walked purposefully towards the waterdoor hes senile youll bring the plague back with you its rife out there kat stopped hes not senile hes just old and and hurt alfredos death marianas death the baby and papa not coming back and mama and then grandmama too its just been a bit too much for him even thinking about it left her with a catch in her voice and guilt alessandras baby son had died too after all but alessandra dealt with the guilt with her next silly statement so youve got his permission to turn yourself into a courtesan because of that kat looked at herself in the mottled fulllength mirror like many things in the casa montescue it was past its prime the reflection that looked back at her was at best merely pretty she had too wide a mouth and too pert a nose carrotycolored slightly curly hair that alessandra was always at her to bleach a bit so that shed lookat least from behindmore like the glamorous lucrezia brunelli unlike alessandra katerina didnt claim cousinship and intimate knowledge of the doings of venices most famous beauty and after alessandras endless stories she didnt want to she looked away from the mirror knowing that its mottled surface was not disguising the truth her face unlike lucrezias would certainly never garner her any love poems neither would a nonexistent dowry and shed never have alessandras statuesque figure either or alessandras perfect rosebud mouth with the tiny mole accentuating it or her white skin and ravenblack hair she sighed sandi be reasonable im not a beauty never will be and thats all there is to it now excuse me ive got things to do she pushed past heading for the waterdoor up the passage as often happened alessandras mood underwent an abrupt change oh katerina she cried clutching at kats cloak take me with you im dying cooped up in here in this mausoleum we could go to barduccis i hear its all the rage to go slumming there a lot of the younger crowd are going kat snorted and shook off the soft slim white hand saints sandi one minute im going to my lover the next im bringing plague and the next you want to go off looking for thrills with the commoners you despise well sorry ive got other things to deal with practical things anyway you go out more often than i do you go over to murano at least once a week curiositya source for gossip a vital feature of alessandras shallow lifetook over tell me what things cant somewhere montescue was leaking secrets telling alessandra anything that the spying cat didnt already know would add another leak mean horrible little bitch the waterdoor slammed behind her leaving katerina to get into the shabby gondola tied to the post out on the water in the darkness katerina felt her temper begin to subside by the way the wind was blowing off the lagoon there would be a storm soon great all she needed was to get wet again still that would be better than when the previous cargo had come in the one shed nearly lost rain even a thunderstorm took a while to wet you to the skin jumping or falling into the canal didnt she sculled a little faster this delivery was to the far side of the grand canal too not that that meant anything she never delivered anything to calle farnese anymore it was just too risky there were more prowling agents of the signori di notte and those creepy servants around there than there were strega nowadays she sighed never mind the way that it was weighing on her grandfather this pressure was making her snappy and shrewish after all the difficulty of getting the last parcel from ascalon shed hoped their fortunes would revive alas it had only just staved off the creditors so theyd gambled on going into a colleganza on a cargo of silver on the galley fleet bound for the black sea after all there was so little risk in a galley cargo that they didnt even need to insure it and then the galley had been one of three lost in a storm snapped in half by the waves if the few survivors could be believed the illfortune that plagued casa montescue seemed endless now they were bankruptalmost anyway reduced to the desperate business of organizing highrisk cargos to and from beyondthesea kat tried to find solace somewhere at least her grandfather couldnt blame this disaster on casa valdosta that ancient house was completely destroyed all of the family members dead except foraccording to rumors gathered by grandpapas agentsone or two boys who even if the rumors of their survival were accurate could hardly pose a threat to montescue again she sighed not that her grandfather cared about threats for reasons which had never been very clear to katand shed been afraid to askthe old man blamed casa valdosta for the misfortunes of the montescues he was consumed with a desire for vengeance on anything valdostaeven boys who could not possibly be held responsible by any rational person that was what worried kat the mosther grandfathers obsession with revenge was not entirely sane it was dark and cruel and evilfor all that grandpapa was not a cruel and evil man in any other respect and it was expensive too spies did not come cheap and assassins even less so the old man would still be hiring assassins if there was anything left to hire them with kat didnt doubt that he would do so again if her efforts brought in some significant money what a waste kat tied the gondola up beside the shabby waterdoor lightning rippled across the eastern sky showing a waterworn step and an odd gargoylefaced doorknocker the iron eyes seemed almost alive in the sudden sharp light it gave her something of a shiver and it took quite some willpower to lift the ring that the gargoyle was devouring and rap out the coded knock thunder rumbled in the distance the door opened with an oiled silence that belied its decrepit look a dark hooded figure loomed behind the candle she went in little was said on these rendezvous these days buyerswho used to greet her by namewere trying to pretend they didnt know her and that shed never even met them these were dangerous times the hooded man led her to a desk at which yet another hooded figure sat silently kat handed over the little oilcloth parcel putting it on the table the hooded figure reached eagerly for it a little silver and steel knife appearing suddenly in the long shapely feminine fingers the knife hilt kat noticed was fashioned like a dragons head with little chips of clear red stone for eyes eyes seemed everywhere tonight she hoped none of them had followed her here the packet was slit and the hooded woman gave a little crow of unpleasant glee before hastily sweeping the vials back into the packet not for the first time kat wondered what they were doing in this business it had started with letters to and from the jewish community after all her greatgrandfather had been a jew even if hed married out of the faith and the family were good petrine christians now somehow needs had driven things to this when shed been a child shed often gone to meet the strega with grandpapa she suspected that grandpapa had been halfway to being a convert but theyd been a different community then gentler the woman motioned her henchman forward he reached inside his cloak and produced money that was always a relief kat knew she could get killed instead silently he counted out ducats kat slipped them into a washleather pouch and slipped the pouch between her breasts obviously her pleasure in receiving the cargo had loosed the womans tongue you deliver to many kat shook her head i really dont think i should say understood but i will make it worth a great deal a very great deal indeed to know of one man ten times your fee if you tell me where i can find him his name is marina dottore luciano marina this is how he looks the woman flicked a handful of powder into the air and an image appeared therein the man had an arrogant tilt to his head but a kindly face there was a wiry youthfulness about the face which didnt match the eyes the eyes looked as if theyd seen a lot kat remembered it well he had been a great figure of learning at the accademia before he disappeared grandpapa had said and her favorite tutor as a girl kat shook her head he hasnt been around since i was about fourteen he is still around the woman spoke very firmly more to herself than kat i can feel him i just cant pin him to a place kat shrugged and looked at the desk she must have lost a strand of hair therenot something you wanted to leave with the strega she twitched it off the table and into a pocket while the hooded womans attention was still distracted havent seen him for years she repeated the woman appeared to notice her again you may leave she said imperiously outside with the wind from the storm ripping and yowling between the buildings and the first heavy drops beginning to splat onto the water kat shook herself the money would help but the hole that the casa montescue was in meant that theyd have to continue with this she flicked the bowline loose and began sculling as she came out onto the grand canal she realized that she should have left earlier ahead the rain was coming down like a solid dark wall obliterating all light the water in the grand canal was already chopped into endless dancing myriadpeaked waves water slopped over the gunwales as kat struggled to turn back into the relative shelter of the smaller canal shed emerged from there was no going home until this was over she might as well find somewhere to try to keep dry even here angry gusts were rattling and shaking at hastily slammed shutters this was no time to be outside never mind in a boat the nearby church of san zan degola was small and poor but it would be open she moored the gondola to a post hitched up her skirts and ran for the shelter the storm wouldnt last chapter rain the watcher in the reed bank noticed it without caring too much about it his name was harrow and he was by nature a predator when intent on a target he was not distracted by discomfort the slim willowy figure out there in the lightningtorn darkness wasnt his prey but harrow stalked him anyway from long habit this marshland was not harrows environment and the only way hed learn it was to practice to hone his inborn skills besides if it wasnt prey it could possibly be someone hunting harrow or fortunato bespi as they would still think of him they had tried to kill harrow burn him drown him somehow news could have leaked out of the swamp that he wasnt dead bespi had given his all to the visconti for the montagnard cause hed always found peace in obeying orders pleasure in hunting down his human prey in repayment francesco aleri had done this to him and harrow did not doubt for a moment that the orders had come from the duke of milan himself hatred forgehot seared at his gut for a moment with an effort that was difficult because it came newly to him harrow tried to drive it under no that was not the way the marshwizard who had saved him and taught him his true name claimed he should turn his hatred to good cause instead harrow who had cut down lives with no more compunction than most people had killed mosquitoes had listened to his talk with intense concentration and had listened to the visions with an even greater one strangely so perhaps given his history but harrow believed in reasons he believed that he had a purpose in life believed it with a fanatical intensity as bespi hed always assumed that purpose was to serve the montagnard cause yet they had been the ones to order his death and what disturbed harrow the most was that there had been no reason for it none good enough at any rate harrow as much as fortunato bespi wanted reasons and so as lightning lit the sky with white tracery he watched as the trudging figure came closer not much more than a boy he was harrow could see now he could warn him easily that there was a prowling loco on the trail aheada bad one by the pitiful local standards but harrow was a hunter and hunted man himself as well as a man who believed in reasons so he simply waited silent and invisible in the recesses of the marsh as the boy passed by him in the storm then followed stalking from habit partly and partly hoping he might find some logic in a reasonless world marco could hardly feel his feet they were so numb and cold still it wasnt winter then hed have had to worry about losing his toes instead of just feeling like hed lost them he was halfway out to chianos territory and he was already regretting the decision hed made with the kind of remote regret of one who didnt have any real choice the pack on his back was large and heavy the goods he had to trade with old sophia for her herbs were bulky blankets didnt compact well no more did clothing the cold was climbing up his legs and his breeches were misery to wear wet and clinging and clammy and liberally beslimed with mud and unidentifiable swampmuck hed forgotten how much the marsh mud stank it was far worse than the canals the reeds rustled but otherwise there wasnt much sound but for the wind whistling and the water lapping against what few bits of solid stuff poked above the surface of the lagoon the wind was bitter and ate through his clothing also there was a storm brewing which meant that hed be soaked before the night was out even if things went well he was halfsoaked already just because it was possible to walk into the swamp that didnt mean it was easy he was just grateful that his memory of the trail was clear so clear he could find his way back in pitch darkso clear he was only mud caked to his thighs instead of to his waist overhead the clouds blocked out the stars and thunder rumbled cloudshadows taking the last of the light but now the swamp itself flickered with an eerie phosphorescence making it almost like dusk there seemed to be more of a glow than there had been beforeand a kind of odd sulfurous bitter smell he didnt remember as being part of the normal odors the thunder came again accompanied by flashes of lightning and the wind off the sea began to pick up bending the reeds parallel with the water marco had just enough time for his nose to warn him and then the rain came the first fat drops plopped on the back of his neck and trickled icily down his back adding to his misery this morning hed been sure that there was no way he could begin to even up the debt between himself and aldanto at this point he was beginning to think that the scale might just be tipping the other way hee hee hehehe well lookee what th storm washet ep the voice that brayed out of the dark and the rain was one marco had hoped never to hear again i heerd ye gone townie on us marcoboy the speaker was little more than a black blot against the phosphorescent watera large blot i heerd ye niver come back t see yer old friends i heerd ye figger yer bettern us now it was big gianni and he had the next segment of the trail completely blocked to either side was deep water and dangerous mudsome of it bottomless sucking mirepits cmon marcoboyaint ye gonna run from big gianni aint ye gonna give im a race lightening flickered once twice the blot shifted restlessly marco fought panic get out of my way big gianni he shouted over the thunder leave me alone i never hurt you ye hurt big giannis feelins marcoboy the hoarse voice came back ye wouldnt play with big gianni ye sent that chiano t warn gianni off ye did but chiano he aint here now now its jest me an you marco could run he could shed that heavy pack and run back along the safe path until he came to one of the branches then he could get into an area he knew better than gianni did where he could outdistance him and get safely back to town butwithout what hed come for and it was just possible that without sophias spellwoven medicine caesare aldanto would die fighting for breath chokingliterally drowning as his lungs filled the way that marco had almost died his knife was in his hand without his really thinking about it and he slipped the straps of the pack off his shoulders dropping it to the reed hummock he was standing on with the feel of the hilt in his hand his breathing steadied he wasnt fifteen any morenor was he armed with nothing but a scrap of glass he had most of his adult growth now and a good steel blade in his hand watching from his hiding place in the reeds harrow was impressed not by the way the boy held the knifepitiful that wasbut the mere fact he would do so and stand his ground in face of such a threat harrow had observed the one called gianni before the creature was not dangerous to harrow himself of course but he was a fearsome monster for the marshdwellers very large strong halfcrazed and driven by savage and perverted reasons harrow wondered at the boys reasons powerful they must be to cause him to stand his ground harrow had little doubt the boy could elude gianni in the marsh if he wished to do so the one called gianni was strong yes but also clumsy and slow afoot yet the boy clearly intended to fight very powerful reasons he must have and thus harrow suspected reasons which were also true and clean so a man covered with slime waited silently and invisible in the marshes just watching to see if the reasons he so craved himself might emerge in such an unlikely place marco had to swallow before he could speak then im warning you gianniget out of my way ye gonna make me if i have to marco replied unsteadily big gianni had sloshed a step or two closer and now his knife seemed all too small gianni stood as tall as marcoand marco was still standing on a hummock that rose several inches above the underwater surface of the trail and gianni had a knife too marco could see the lightning flickering on the shiny surface of the steel it was ribbonthin honed almost to invisibility but marco would bet it could leave bleeding wounds on the wind gianni cackled again and there was no sanity in that sound ye try marcoboy ye gwon n try big gianni dont care he cn play wi ye liveor he cn play wi ye dead marcos nerve almost brokeso before it could give out altogether he attacked before gianni had a chance to react he threw himself at the bigger man with an hysterical and suicidal leap marco had no chance at all except one which was so desperate that not even a lunatic like gianni would think to counter it he drove the open palm of his left hand frantically down on giannis knifeaiming at the blade not the knifehandhoping to impale his hand on that blade and render it useless his dive off the hummock had caught the loco marshdweller by surprise marco had always run before giannis twisted mind wasnt ready for him to attack so marcos halfsketched plan worked better than he hoped harrow rose from his crouch his soul ringing like a cymbal he understood at once the boys maneuverit was a theoretical gambit all assassins had consideredbut had never once in his violencefilled life seen anyone actually do it such reasons the boy must have the point of giannis knife sliced into marcos palm as he rammed his hand right up to the hilt the pain split his arm like the lightning that was splitting the sky marco screamed and closed his fist around the crossguard anyway wresting it out of the bigger mans hand giannis grip was loose he was so stunned by marcos unexpected action then as marcos feet skidded in the mud he fell forward throwing all of his weight awkwardly behind an impromptu lunge with his own knife giannis screams were a hoarse echo of his own as the knife sank up to the hilt in his gut he beat at marcos head with both hands marco slipped and slid some more and fell to his knees but held onto the knife hilt ripping upward with it gianni howled and tried to pull himself off the blade pushing at marco but marco slipped more falling underneath the bigger man gianni lost his balance on the slimy rock of the trail falling forward farther onto the knife blade as thunder crashed the big man collapsed on top of marco screams cut off pinning marco under the muddy water all the air was driven from his lungs as the crazy man fell atop him marco tried to fight free but the slimy mud was as slick as ice under his knees then he lost what little purchase he had and the kneedeep water closed over his head the surface was just inches away from his facebut he couldnt reach it he clawed at the twitching thing that held him there tried to shove it off but could get no leverage raw panic took over he thrashed and struggled his lungs screaming for air his chest and throat afire with the need for a breath he was caught like an otter in a drownsnare he was going to die trapped under the body of his enemy the mud conspired to hold him down now sliding under him sucking at his limbs sparks danced before his eyes and he wriggled and squirmed and struggled for the air that his hands could reach but not his head he had a strange crystalclear vision of himself floating lifelessly beside the trail touched by the morning sun suddenly the weight of the corpse on top of him was removed with a last frantic writhe marco freed himself slipping off the trail into the deep water on the right his head broke the surface and he gulped the air great sobbing heaves of his chest a powerful hand seized him by the scruff of the neck and halfhurled him toward firmer ground marco reached for and caught a clump of reeds and pulled himself to the trail he hauled himself back onto the hummock where hed left his pack crying with pain and fear and gasping for breath while lightning flashed above him and thunder followed it almost deafening him he clung there with only his right hand for giannis knife was still transfixed in his left his frantic eyes flitted across the landscape looking for whoever had lifted gianni off him and dragged him to safety marcos rescuer could also be a threat but he saw nothing his rescuer had vanished why did he do that marco wondered for what reason my god boy chianos eyes glared out at marco from the shelter of his basketlike hidey he and sophia had anchored their rafts and their hides sidebyside on a bit of old wood chiano had driven into the muck of the bottom to use as a safe tieup lemme in chiano marco said dully his hand felt afire he was shivering so hard that it was only because he was holding his jaw clenched that his teeth werent rattling he swayed back and forth drunk with exhaustion and pain he could hardly use his arm much less his wounded handit felt like a log of wood hed tied up his hand as best he could but he hadnt been able to do more than stop the bleeding he knew he was probably falling into shock but didnt care any more wait a moment chiano propped up the edge of the basket with a stick reached out and shook sophias hide wake up you old witchits marco and hes hurt what what the edge of sophias basket came up and she peered out at marco for some reason the sight of her struck him as funny and he began to laugh hystericallyand couldnt stop he was still laughing when they propped the baskets together like two halves of a shell and helped him up onto their combined rafts then unaccountably the laughter turned to sobs and he cried himself nearly sick on sophias shoulder sophia held him wrapping her tattered old shawl about his shoulders and keeping him warm against her rain pattered on the baskets and for the moment there was no place marco would rather have been in the corner of his eye he saw a strange expression come into chianos face the kind of expression a man gets when he suddenly unexpectedly remembers something long forgotten puzzled despite the pain and weariness marco turned his head in time to see chiano straighten his back and spread his arms wide luminescence spareze a mercurio there was a commanding tone to chianos voice seeming to be as forceful for the brief time it took to utter those peculiar words as the storm itself maybe it was the pain or the shock but in the sudden flare of witchlight the lean sinewy man seemed somehow taller his weathered face outlined in stark sharp shadows marco his pauline training coming to the fore flinched from the sight an old halfsuspicion was now confirmed chiano really was a strega manwitch his reputation carefully cultivated in the marshes was a double front he really was a paganand a magician to boot marco wasnt at all sure how he felt about that still sophias wrinkled face and chianos weathered one were a heavenly sight he decided not to worry about it for the moment drink this boy when the sobs diminished and the shivering started again chiano thrust a bottle into his good hand let the old girl see to your hand he drank not much caring what it was it was harsh raw alcohol and it burned his throat and brought more tears to his eyes he put the bottle down gasping then gasped again as sophia took it from him and poured its contents liberally over the wound the clouds were clearing now and the moon emerged you could see it from under the edge of the basket sophia propped up one side of the basket and held his hand in its light examining it critically he had occasion to stifle a cry and seize the bottle back from chiano more than once before she was through with her probing should be stitchedbut the grappa will stop the fleshrot ive a poultice against the swelling you tied it off right well i don reckon ye lost too much blood what happened gianni marco coughed his throat was still raw from screaming and crying he mustve seen me followed me in ambushed me sophia was smearing something onto the wound that first burned and then numbed the pain then she reached back into the darkness behind her locating rags by feel and bound his hand tightly i settle that one tomorrow chianos eyes narrowed for good n ever this time marco shook his head weakly you wont have to once the meaning of the words penetrated sophia looked up into his face with stunned awe gianni was a legend among the marshdwellers for his crazy viciousness that marco should have taken him out there was someone else too marco added halfgasping the sentences never saw him helped me at the end i would have drowned otherwise never saw him not once the alcohol had shaken marco out of his shock and he was beginning to take account of his surroundings again he noticed chiano and sophia exchange a glance well chiano said just that one word but it held a world of approval in some obscure way marco understood the approval encompassed more than just he himself boy you neednt hide again ye didnt come crawlin out here in th dark an th rain fer the fun a it sophia came right to the point that woke him fullyreminded him of his purpose nno im fine in townbut sophia i need something from you one of your cures i got a sick friend in town hes got a feverthe one with the chills and the sweats every two days getting worse he hardly knows where he is i know it sophia nodded her face becoming even more wrinkled with thought only it dont genrally get that bad except my friends not from venice then thats bad boy thats real bad hell die like as not less ye can get im t take my herbs look i brought stuff to trade youhere he shrugged out of his pack and passed it to her whatever you want i got two blankets a couple of good woolen cloaks fish hooks a knife haw boy haw ye got enough there t trade me fer every last dose i got then give it all to me sophia i got more friends this fever is startin to go through town like a firemore of em may get sick strega came into town at solstice claiming there wouldnt be any plague this yearmarco noticed chiano stiffening at thatbut i guess they were wrong you can get more cant you sophia nodded aye aye stuffs just wild weedsknow where theres a good bit of it still good enough t pick aint no cure thoughye know that herbs with artemis blessing said chiano quietly marco smiled wryly remembering the nausea and the delirium i know it just keeps you from dyingbut makes you feel like you want to remember i got it first winter i was out here an ye can get it agin so ill keep some for myself deal sophia sioh si si boy tis a deal she grinned a twisted halftoothless grin as one hand caressed one of the damp blankets this stuffll make livin right comfy out here come winter tell ye whatill pick all i kin find dry it up nice ye figger ye need for more why just come on out hereby daylight this time boyan ye bring old sophia more things to trade you got yourself a bargain marco smiled inwardly at peace with an old debt sophia would somehow not keep many if any of the luxuries theyd all end up with marshfolk keeping other people alive sophia was the one person in the reedfringed jesolo marshes who slept deeply she could not even the most loco would put a hand to her her reputation as a healer was more potent even than chianos reputation as a worker of magics youve got to go back tnight chiano interrupted marco looked at the swamp and shivered but nodded reluctantly got no choice chiano my friends bad sick and you heard sophia no nonot soaked through like that and it getting up chilly sophia pack your herbs in the boys sack this old man knows the harbor day or night i got a dry blanket here you wrap up int ill pole you back to the wharf say some words over those damned weeds for you too i will marco accepted the shred of blanket speechless with gratitude and witnessing the witchlight and certain hitherto unexplained mysteries of his time in the swamp maybe those words held more power than hed realized previously ecclesiastical magic could heal perhaps strega magics were not the fraud the petrine church claimed they were nor the unadulterated evil which the paulines labeled them chapter the church door had been slightly ajar the rain and wind had sent more than just kat scurrying for shelter two bridgebrats a boy and a girl had decided it would be warmer than huddling under a bridge they were engaged in bridgebrat mischief down at the altar playing with one of the candles that burned there doubtless a sacristan would emerge in a minute or two and give them both a thick ear in the meanwhile they were having fun kat shivered slightly she pulled out a dry scarf and covered her hair she was cold and wet if shed been close to a tavern she might have broken her own rules and slipped into the warmth instead she took a seat on a pew at the back the brats hadnt even noticed her they noticed the next incursion however kat was so startled she almost leapt from the pew the door swung open forcefully slamming noise through the church kat spun her head in time to see a party of knights and monks pushing into the church theyd obviously been to some function or off on some official business because the knights were in full armor sheened and dripping with rain seeing the triple red crosses of the famous twin orders of the pauline creed kat felt a sharp rush of fear in times past the servants and knights of the holy trinity had not held much sway in venice since the city was traditionally a stronghold of the petrine creed the more so since the servants and knights were closely associated with the holy roman empireas was in a different way the montagnard faction in italian politics the montagnards had their adherents in venice of course but venice was traditionally a neutral in the bitter montagnardmetropolitan conflict if anything the citys populace was inclined to the metropolitans so the servants and the knights were doubledamned in the eyes of most venetiansby religious and political creed alike but since the current doge began favoring the two orders they had begun throwing their weight aroundand the servants especially were notorious for their heavy hand katerinas mouth dried up surely they couldnt be looking for her they couldnt be anyway she reminded herself the cargo had been delivered all she had now was the money quite a lot of it true but still just money probably theyd just come to get out of the rain this was confirmed by one knights comment off that godforsaken water he snarled i thought wed drown there when that tub started to take water abbot sachs when do we leave this cursed city a knight should ride this boatwork is not for nobles the abbot was the same stooped man that kat had seen perform the rite of enclosure on the imperial embassy we leave this place of sin when gods work is done he snapped in reply the abbots eyes left the knight and quickly ranged through the church he did not spot kat sitting all the way in the back since his gaze became fixed almost instantly on the two bridgebrats at the altar and look he cried triumphantly pointing an accusing finger at the children god has guided us to his work the devil cannot triumph against the workings of the lord katerina was astonished to see the abbot striding down to the altar for all the world as if he were marching on the forces of the antichrist at armageddon was he insane the two terrified children who were the subject of his wrath stared at him guilt written all over their small hungry faces the abbot grabbed one of the children successfully the other the girl ran screaming for the door one of the knights slammed the door closed he tried to catch the girl the child squirmed clear to find herself in the steel gauntlets of another knight in the meantime sachs the struggling little boy held in one hand was peering at the candle see he shouted triumphantly see the devils work they make waxen mammets from this consecrated candle to work their evil here within the very nave of the church venice the corrupt and rotten they will burn for this you shall not suffer a witch to live several things happened with all the outcry first the sacristan bleary eyed and none too steady on his feet appeared through a side door with a branch of candles demanding querulously to know what all the noise in the house of god was about the second was that two of the knights finally spotted katerina before she could decide whether to slide under the pew or run for the door moving much faster than she would have imagined an armored man could do one of the knights grabbed her shoulders with rough steel hands the same one who had complained about the weather then even more roughly dragged her out to face the abbot got another one abbot sachs hold her there commanded sachs almost violently he thrust the boy into the hands of a monk who had come to join him then stalked back up the aisle to stand before kat the abbot gripped her jaw and lifted her chin examining her as he might a vial of poison with his left hand roughly he pulled off her scarf the witch mistress he pronounced solemnly overseeing her children and their demonic work we have made a fine haul tonight truly the hand of god must have guided that storm panic surged through kat im not a witch im not i just came to get out of the rai the abbot slapped her hard and with obvious satisfaction silence witch you will be put to the question and you will answer when we tell you kats cheek burned the blow had been savage enough to leave her dazed for a moment her mouth tasted of blood and her head was cloudy with fear and fury the moment was soinsanethat she couldnt seem to bring her mind into focus the only clear thought she had was why hadnt she stayed outside and gotten wet a new voice spoke one of the knights kat dimly realized a very cold voice abbot the abbot turned on him go and ready our boat erik we must take these prisoners back and put them to the question the knight shook his head the gesture was abbreviated quick and very firm no my lord abbot we cannot do that why demanded sachs angrily the weather is not so bad not for pious men the implied slur did no more than cause the knight to square his already very square shoulders and harden a face that to kat already looked as hard as an axeblade she was almost shocked to see that the knight was not much older than she was because we cannot remove these people from the sanctuary of the church said the knight calmly even though kat could sense the effort the knight was making to keep his teeth from clenching it is my solemnly sworn oath he continued almost grinding out the words as a knight of the holy trinity to defend the sanctuary of the holy church i will not break my oath sanctuary for a moment kat simply gawped at the young knight of all the scarylooking armed and armored men who surrounded her he was the scariest the last one she would have expected to come to her assistance thunder pealed and she could hear a fresh squall of rain sheeting down outside in the sudden silence even the two terrified children seemed to realize their survival hung on this rigid man with the harshly nordic appearance the young knight seemed made entirely of sharp angles and icy ridgesas if his body and face had been shaped by the same glaciers that created the norse landscape from which he so obviously came his hair long enough to peek below the rim of his helmet was so blond it was almost white his eyes were a shade of blue so pale they were almost gray his chin was a shield his nose a swordeven his lips looked as if they had been shaped by a chisel and scariest of all lurking beneath that superficial calm she could sense an eruption building kat had been told once by her tutor marina that iceland had been forged in the earths furnace not knowing why she was suddenly certain that this man was an icelander himselfa land as famous for its clan feuds as its volcanoes and that he possessed the full measure of the berserk fury that sleptfretfullyjust beneath an outwardly still and chilly surface she noticed finally the peculiar weapon attached to his belt a hatchet of some kind an oddly plain thing compared to the aristocratic sword hanging from his baldric then her wits finally returned and kat seized the opening as a drowning man might an entire haystack i claim sanctuary in the name of the knight holding her clamped a gauntleted hand across her mouth kat tasted blood inside her lips remove your hand pappenheim the blond knights command was not a shout so much as a curseor a sneer driven into words a challenge so cold so full of contempt that an angel facing hellspawn would have envied it except kat could imagine no angel looking as purely murderous as this man the young knight was on his toes now as light on his feet as if he were wearing nightclothes instead of armor he seemed to prance almost his whole body as springy and coiled as a lion about to pounce and his thin lips were peeled back in a smile that was no smile at all teeth showing like fangs his hand flashed to his belt so quick she could not follow the movement the next she saw the hatchet was held in his fist in a loose and easy grasp that even katno expert on such matterscould recognize as that of an expert and she realized now that this was not really a hatchet at all no utilitarian woodsmans tool thisit was a cruel and savage weapon from a cruel and savage forest what was sometimes called a tomahawk she remembered remove your hand pappenheim the knight repeated as coldly if not as forcefully as well as the hand on her shoulder his hand flickered the war hatchet blurring back and forth the lion lashing his tail or i will remove them for you the sheer sudden violence of the young knights words and actionsall the more violent for that they had not yet erupted in the blood and mayhem they promisedhad momentarily paralyzed everyone else in the church now finally the other knights began to react kat felt the knight holding her flinch his fingers almost trembling she understood then that her own impression of the blond norseman was no figment of her imagination the knight too found him just as frightening and presumably in his case from past experience the other knights shifted their feet their hands fumbling uncertainly at their own weapons it was clear as day that they had no idea how to handle the situation suddenly one of the knights who had been standing in the background moved forward a very large knight this one built so squarely he resembled a block of granite on thick legs very young also kat thought he was perhaps her own age for gods sake erik he exclaimed why are you the blond knight held out his other hand staying the youngster with a commanding gesture be silent manfred do you think the world is nothing but a toy for your pleasure you are nothing but an oaf a spoiled child begone this is a mans business the words caused the young knights face to flush a sudden bright pink then grow pale with rage then grow paler still and paler still shock now kat realized the young knights jaw sagged loose he stared at the one named erik as if he were seeing him for the first time then as suddenly as everything else was happening his face seemed to snap shut he shouted something kat did not understandwords in gaelic she thoughtand strode forward to the knight holding her an instant later manfreds huge hands closed upon her captors own shoulders and wrenched him loose as easily as a man wrestles a boy suddenly released kat staggered on her feet for a moment by the time she regained her balance the knight who had seized her was crashing down onto one of the pews turning the cheaply made wooden bench into so much kindling she found herself marveling at the strength that could send an armored knight flying through the air like a toy almost giggling at the sheer absurdity of the sight but she had no real difficulty suppressing the giggle the situation was now on the brink of utter carnage almost a dozen knights ready to hack each other into pieceswith herself right in the middle of them the young knight named manfred whipped out his own great sword and brandished it dia a coir he shouted then took two steps toward the abbot and commanded him unhand the child sachs the abbot through all this had been paralyzed kat realized now that he was a man whose authority had always come from his positionnot respect gained from his subordinates in action it was obvious that sachs had absolutely no idea what to do now that he was faced with open rebellion neither did any of the other knights for that matter but it was also obvious even to kat that they were about to react the way fighting men will when faced with such a naked challenge these men were cut from the same cloth as the bravos of any great house of venicebut were far better trained and more deadly in open combat at least if not in the subtler skill of the assassin the hands on swords were clenched now not loose and two or three of those swords were beginning to come out of their scabbards frightened they might be at eriks savagery and manfreds incredible strengthbut they were not going to crumple under it not men like these suddenly one of the other knights thrust out his hands his arms spread wide in a gesture commanding peace a somewhat older knight this one most of them were men in their early twenties his face though not creased with middle age was that of a man in his thirties a man accustomed to command enough he shouted enough no weapons his voice seemed to calm the situation instantly kat thought he must be the knight in command of the party the hands on sword hilts loosened some were removed entirely even erik and manfred seemed to settle back a little erik is right the older knight said forcefully quite right and every true knight here knows it he turned to sachs and glared at him you have completely exceeded your authority here abbot abused it grossly in fact the abbot gaped at him butvon gherens shut up growled the older knight you disgust me sachs seeing the abbots hand still on the childs shoulder the knight reached out his own hand and flicked it off as he might flick off an insect my family has held the frontier in livonia for six generations unlike you sachs i have faced real demonsnot figments of your fevered imagination stolidly the knight examined the stilltrembling boy had you ever seen a childs body on a pagan altar abbotthe term was a pure sneeryou would understand the difference von gherens erik manfred as always kat found northern names harsh and peculiar but for the first time in her life she began to understand them better also harsh yes rigid and intolerant yes yet sometimes at least names which rang clear clearer perhaps than any of the soft names in fogshrouded venice oddly for a moment her mind flitted to old lessons of her tutor marina lessons in theology she had not understood at the time there was a reason child that hypatia compromised with augustine if not theophilus and treasured chrysostom for all his rigidity and intolerance there is such a thing as evil in the world which cannot be persuaded but only defeated and for thatharshness is needed in the ranks of christ also neither shaitan nor his monsters will listen to mere words she remembered his lips crinkling even a strega you know does not doubt the existence of either christ or the dark one the graycassocked abbot looked as if he was about to have a strokeor faint even in the candlelight kat could see his face was suffused simultaneously with rage andfear his lips trembled as he groped for words words which apparently he was unable to find yet another knight had no such difficulty with a slight clashing noise he thrust his sword firmly back in the scabbard and removed his hand from the weapon von gherens is righthakkonsen and manfred also we cannot take them out of here by church law the law which as knights of the holy trinity we are sworn to uphold the knights eyes glanced at kat then at the children his lips peeled back in a halfsnarl and my name is falkenbergalso a name of the frontier and also one who can tell the difference between brats and devils now there were nods and murmurs of agreement all around the circle of knights the tension was draining out of the scene as rapidly as water through a broken dam all danger of physical violence was past whatever might be left would only take the form of words words which sachs was still quite incapable of uttering it seemed only one of the two monks who accompanied him seemed disposed to argue the matter any further we cannot let witches go free he protested almost squeakily god has guided us to this evil we must root it out didn do no evil whimpered one child just came to get outa the rain finally abbot sachs tried to salvage something from the situation he cleared his throat noisily if we cannot take them away we will put them to the question here he essayed a sneer of his own a feeble one or do you deny my ecclesiastical authority for that also ritters hakkonsen and von gherens the blond knights cold eyes did not waver for an instant yes abbot sachs i do deny you the authority von gherenss words rolled right after the right to afford sanctuary without arrest or violence is inviolate and by church law they may only be expelled by the priest of the parish flushing furiously sachs turned on the terrifiedlooking old sacristan fetch me your priest then ill have these hellspawn so help me godi will have them the sacristan left with as near to a run as the old man could muster and never mind the rain sachs turned on von gherens as for youim going to make an example of you von gherens barked a laugh for obeying the oath of the order i think not and who will enforce your example abbot asked the blond knight the question was posed quietly but grimly the war hatchet was back in the scabbard but his hand was still perched on it yeswho demanded the big one called manfred quite a bit more loudly if not as grimly the tone was almost mocking kat saw the knights clustering together a bit more closely one order closing ranks against another she realizedand realized as well that the identity she had always assumed existed between the knights and the servants of the holy trinity was not as solid as shed thought which she remembered vaguely was something else dottore marina had once told her silence followed for some time while they waited for the sacristan to return with the priest the silence was so thick with hostility between the knights and the monks that it could almost have been cut with a knife the only movement during that time was the slow and painful return of pappenheim to consciousness stumbling back onto his feet from the splintered pew where manfred had sent him he seemed too dazed to really comprehend what was happening simply collapsed on another pew leaning over with his head in his hands his helmet had apparently come loose in the force of the impact kat was a bit amazed that he had no broken bones manfreds strength was genuinely incredible he had not so much tossed the knight into the pew as he had hurled him down upon it finally the sacristan returned the priest close on his heels the priest was a young man who like the two bridgebrats looked as if he could have used a few more meals himself it was a small church he looked in puzzlement at the scene and then bowed to the abbot i am father ugo and this is my parish why have i been called here we have called you to throw these evil miscreants out they were defiling your church with satanic practices the little priest blinked taking in the steel and the miscreants with a start kat realized she knew the little man of course hed been smaller and plumper then ugo boldoni she said incredulously the priest peered shortsightedly at her then gasped there were some advantages to her distinctive carrotycolored hair even if it was not fashionable katmilady katerina what are you doing here kat shrugged i was caught in the rain and came in to take shelter she was practicing satanic rites shouted one the monks waving a threatening finger at her i was sitting on a pew she snapped back at him quietly sitting getting some shelter from the rainwhen you came inlike demons yourselvesand grabbed those children who were playing up there they were fooling around with one of the candles i assumed the sacristan would come out and give them both a clout instead this she glared at sachs this foul man who calls himself an abbot came in and behaved as if they were having a black mass instead of just fiddling with the candle wax the priest looked puzzled but but where was old giovanni they bewitched me into sleep said the old man hastily demonspawn they are im allus chasing them out of the church allus up to mischief the big young knight named manfred snorted smell his breath unless the children magicked him a bottle of wineand if they could do that theyd have magicked themselves some food they dont need questioning they need a square meal and a place in a household the priest nodded alas sir knight this is a poor parish there are many such souls sachs glaring back at kat attempted a commanding sneer the expression failed of its purpose seemed more childish than anything else these are mere lies and the poor you have with you always it is their souls not their bodies we must deal with now as your senior in the church i order you to put them out of here fatherah the priests name had obviously escaped him priest i will have a word with bishop pietro capuletti and see you are moved to a more worthy station well have the truth out of them the servants of the trinity have ways of dealing with the most hardened servants of satan a look of pleasure came into the abbots hooded eyes the kind of pleasure that comes to a man when he finds himself back on his own ground after stumbling into a marsh kat shivered the knights she suspected would obey the abbothowever reluctantlyif the priest who had actual authority here denied sanctuary to her and the children and how could oncefat timid little ugo boldoni stand up to this yes servants of satan have no place demanding sanctuary put in one of the two monks unctuously such rights should be denied the likes of them and the abbot is your superior that was apparently the wrong thing to say to ugo boldoni his spine straightened you attempted to remove them from the sanctuary of the church you you had no right he glared at the abbot nor is he my superior in this see that is the metropolitan michaelno other in this church i am the final arbiter the little priests anger was peppery hot get out of this church get out right now go and that was enoughmore than enoughto end the whole affair the knights were entirely in support of the priest not the abbot within a minute all of them were gone the abbot and the two monks scurrying ahead of the knights as if afraid that if they didnt move fast enough they would be manhandled out which kat suspected was not far from the truth on the way out manfred seized the stillgroaning pappenheim by the scruff of the neck and using only one hand dragged him out of the church as easily as he might drag a sack of onions when theyd gone father ugo turned to katerina just what are you doing here milady the casa montescue is a long way from here and it is late kat shrugged boldonis father had been a sailing master a good one too apparently and it showed in the sons manner she reflected about my fathers business she said quietly she knew that hed know that carlo montescue was long overdue back from sea missing presumed by nearly all dead ugo nodded he knew perfectly well that the montescue might be case vecchie but they were in financial trouble all of venice knew quickly enough whenever one of the famous old houses fell into difficult times and knew as well that there were some tasks only family could be relied upon to do you swear that there is no truth in what that abbot said your soul is clean i swear by all the saints and upon the holy cross that it was a complete lie her conscience twinged slightly these two children are naughty but were not practicing any kind of witchcraft she took a deep breath and turned around so that ugo could not see she reached into the pouch and took out one of the ducats the casa montescue was in a desperate state but not that desperate not compared to those two children still wideeyed and frightened she returned the bag to its warm nest and turned around here she held out the coin father ugos eyes bulged slightly ducats didnt come his way often but he was of iron principle you cannot pay me to free you of sin katerina he said sounding extremely doubtful its not for you it is for those two children a small thank you to god for sparing me from the servants of the holy trinity his voice was troubled they do gods work katerina montescue that one young blond knight did gods work had it not been for him that abbot she shuddered anyway forget it im grateful so is montescue so take this for those two children you also saved he took the warm ducat ill buy a candle kat shook her head food theyd only play with the candle it was the ragged little girls turn to shake her head so fiercely that it looked as if it would come off her skinny shoulders never play with no candles no more she looked earnestly up at the priest promise a smile lit father ugos countenance he patted the childrens heads gently do you both promise they both nodded eyes still wide with fright good when the rain is over i will go and check that the servants have really left now i think we will go to the altar and i will lead you all in some prayers tomorrow i will go to speak with monsignor about this be easy katerina he is venetian you know as the party of knights and monks trudged through the rain erik and manfred bringing up the rear von gherens paused to allow them to catch up with him then walking alongside spoke softly i am forever in your debt hakkonsen his square solemn face was creased with worry i fear i have allowed myself the next words were almost hissed damn the servants and their witchhunts anyway theyre twisting my mind sachs sees a witch under every cobblestone in venice manfred snorted witchhunts what witches so far all weve uncovered are a few quacks selling charms as magical as a brick von gherens nodded who then took the holy test of faith before venices metropolitan without fear he sighed heavily i miss father maggiore he was often a bit obnoxious true butfar better than sachs and he was familiar with venice he had knowledge of the city spies who knew something instead of sachss absurd gaggle of informers since his horrible death the servants have blundered about like hogs in a salon eriks words were clipped were doing nothing more than spreading fear and mayhem ritterand for no purpose if sachs were trying to he couldnt damage the reputation of the knights worse than he has this is the most gossipy and intriguefilled place ive ever seen everything we do is spread all over the city within a day for the first time since theyd entered the church von gherens smiled true but i daresay what you did tonight will spread just as fastand go a long way to repairing the damage what we did insisted erik quietly von gherens shook his head then placed a thick hand on eriks shoulder and gave it a little squeeze no erik what you did had it not been for you the rest of us would have allowed sachs to drag us further into the pit i will not forget it the knight raised his eyes and glared at the dim figure of sachs in the rain ahead i will not forget he repeated von gherens is a proud name respected by all feared by none save demonridden pagans my family is in your debt as much as i am he said nothing further and a short time later quickened his steps in order to resume his rightful place beside the abbot manfred watched him go odd really hes also prussianyet so unlike von stublau erik said nothing manfred sighed and me too erik i will not forget either finally a touch of humor came to eriks face really no more carousing no more not that choked manfred i meant the other stuff his great hands groped in the fog and the rain trying to shape the distinctionand failing quite miserably it was only later sculling home playing over the events of the night that it occurred to kat that whoever her mysterious customer was she wasnt strega her knife had been steel and silverboth metals the strega would avoid like the plague but kat was too tired to think too much about it getting free had cost her one ducatand her scarf which the wretched abbot had apparently keptbut the rest would soon be sitting safe in her grandfathers nearempty strongbox when she got home katerina collapsed into bed and slept the sleep of the infinitely relieved the gold was safe enough good pure unpunched venetian ducats the coin valued beyond all others in the world it was well into bright morning when she awoke there was someone in her room looking through her clothes from the night before theyd just been dumped in a soggy heap when she came home reaction had set in and shed been just too exhausted her first halflucid thought was that someone was going to steal the bag of ducats she sat up and yelled before her groggy mind recalled that shed taken the gold to the old man the night before it was only alessandra snooping as usual theres no need to shout the house down just because youve spent the whole night with your lover and are too lazy get up she added tartly oh go away snapped kat rubbing her tired eyes it was certainly bright out there leave me to sleep theres no loveras you know perfectly well alessandra cocked her head on one side raised a perfect eyebrow oh whats this hair then im going to look for men with honeyauburn hair with just that touch of red i mean i know youve got no dowry but i didnt really think what are you talking about this hair from your pocket she held up something goldenred in the sunlight kat blinked hair oh yes she remembered now one of hers shed not wanted to leave with that strega actually nonstrega she thought remembering that knife its one of mine ha the day you have hair that color she snatched it from alessandras hand true in daylight katerina could see it was thicker and more curled and it certainly didnt match hers soshe must have picked up a hair from the woman herself not one of her own in the poor light she hadnt realized she shrugged i was snuggling up to lucrezia brunelli last night in my sleep now go away before i throw this ewer at you alessandra turned im going to tell grandpapa if you dont tell me she threatened kat reached for the ewer alessandra showed a remarkable turn of speed leaving the room quite out of keeping with her normal languid progress kat lay back again but like alessandra sleep had left the room there was a greater risk of being recognized but she was going to have to start doing more deliveries in daytime chapter marco was out on his feet by the time he got to caesare aldantos apartment near the campo san polo even if he could have found a gondolier at this hour he had nothing to pay withall his money and marias had gone into trade goods for sophia he had stopped at his apartment long enough to drink some watered wine and get into dry if dirty clothing figuring that a halfhour more or less would make little difference in aldantos condition once dry and warm he slipped on a waterproof cloakthe rain had begun againcast a longing look at his bed and went out again into the night he was ready to drop and staggering like a drunk by the time he got to aldantos door it was a process that was not aided by the fact that he had had to walk a few miles through the winding dark alleys because he didnt have a single lira for the canal traghetto hed had to go the long way over bridges walking then wet footed along the tile rail to the waterdoor before actually reaching it but there was no other choice for him to make he was not up to an argument with the guard on the gated street doorway the stair seemed to go on forever and the door looked like the portal to heaven when he finally reached it he leaned wearily against the lintel and let his fist fall on it the door opened the barest crack whos out there said a muffled voice s me maria marco lemme in before i fall down the door opened so quickly he almost did fall in ye get th stuff uh huh how is he sleepin dont seem no worse but i had to pour a helluva lotta brandy in him t get im t sleep got him upstairs marco slogged the few steps into the sitting room let his pack fall to the floor peeled his cloak over his head and dropped it beside the pack wheres benito sleeping too upstairs i figured if i needed him i could wake him up and its not a bad idea having him bedded down across the door up there no the least somebody forces it he cn scream his lungs out may kill a boarding party by scarin em to death marco made his way leadfooted to aldantos bedsideyou dont try to walk silently around an exassassinand stood in the dark listening to the sound of his breathing a little wheezy a little hot but not bad hed gotten back well in time there would be no need for a real doctor satisfied he dragged himself back out boil me some water would you maria i got to get this stuff measured right as she trotted back to the kitchen he sat down on the soft warm carpet beside the pack and began taking out parcels of herbs wrapped in rags identifying them by smell eye and sometimes taste sophia had literally given him her entire stock the artemisia could be tricky to usetoo much and you got even more horrible side effects maria he called softly think you can find me a couple of big jars or bowls or something i need something to put this stuff in besides a rag lemme look she clattered down the stairs and returned a moment later these do she brought him a pair of canisters the kind spices came in with verminproof lids perfect sophia had gone by handful measurementbut it was a very precise handful although it was a little awkward to work onehanded marco weighed the herbs in his palm adding or subtracting a few leaves at a time until he was satisfied then carefully crushed what hed selected into the tin trying to get it as fine as possible he crushed the resulting canisterful yet again until he had a mixture as fine as possible then crushed a second bunch of artemisia into the second canister maria that water ready aye she must have seen how tired he was and brought the pan of hot water and spoon and cup to him show me i intend toyoure going to have to do this from now on look exactly two flat spoonfuls of this for every cup of wateryou can put it in the cup or the pan dont matter which he measured two spoonfuls into the cup and poured the stillbubbling water on it right so im taking another flat spoonful of this stuff from the other canister and adding it you want to keep him alive you do the same now you let it steep for as long as it takes to count to a hundred he concentrated on the dull throbbing of his hand while the mixture seeped he noticed with a tired little chuckle marias lips moving silently as she marked the time she could count if not read he resolved quietly to teach her at least to cipher her own name his own good fortune demanded that he pass it on it ready now its ready we strain off the leaves if you leave them itll get stronger and can kill a man he suited action to his words here he handed the cup to her while he got himself slowly and painfully to his feet lets wake him up maria brought a candle with her and lit the oil lamp beside the door across from aldantos bed some of his instincts at least were still holding caesare was awake and wary as soon as the light touched his eyes got somthin for ye layabout maria said cheerfullyreal cheer marco was touched at her implied trust marco here says itll fix ye right up oh aldanto blinked but before he could continue he began shaking great tremors that shook his entire body caesare marco had never used aldantos first name to his face before but it slipped out i mean milord aldanto caesare is fine aldanto said wearily when the coughing fit was over caesare aldanto ive had what youve gothonest this will help and if you dont drink it you could get a lot sicker believe mei almost died you dont come from venice kids here get it when theyre small lot of them die but if they live then they will live when they get it again but you could die now this medicine is going to make you feel even sicker but i swear to you itll help on my familys honor i swear but it is going feel like death aldanto gave him a long appraising lookthen wordlessly took the cup from maria and drank it down in two gulps fehthatisvile he choked face twisted in distaste that better work fast because if it doesnt im not drinking more thats more words in a row than youve managed yet tonight marco pointed out well sugar it next time without being asked maria brought the brandy and looked inquiringly at marco good notion he approved thinking that a bit more brandy wouldnt hurt and might help keep aldanto in bed caesarei hate to askbut is there anything around here i can use as a bandage i love old sophia but i hate to think where her rags have been spare room said aldanto around the brandy ill get it said maria aldanto sagged back against his pillows eyes going unfocused again marco carefully unwrapped his hand the poultice of coltsfoot and lanceleaf plantain and heaven knew what else was working quite welland sophia had included more bundles of the herbs in his pack to allow him to put fresh dressings on the wound despite the herbal poultice the wound looked bad red and swollen but it was sealing shut and marco thought by the look of it that it wasnt infected he was just beginning to realize how lucky he was his hand ached but so far as he could tell all the fingers were still working he could have easily gotten some tendons sliced and wound up with a crippled hand thats a knife wound aldanto was staring at the wounded hand surprised and shocked alert it is caesare i know you think im a kid and youre right sometimesbut youre not right this time i had to go into the jesolo for that stuff sophia was the only place short of a real doctor where i was going to find what you needed a man tried to stop me now aldanto was looking wary even perhaps a bit alarmed marco could have kicked himself for not thinking of course aldanto would suspect those enemies of his of trying to follow marco no no he hastened to assure him nothing to do with you he was a marshloco i had to fight him to get through thats where i got this and lost my own knife was was and dont you ever tell benito i killed a man he wasnt the firstbut i dont want benito to know about that you have a reason aldanto was staying focused which rather surprised marco given the amount of brandy and the artemisia he had in him not to mention the fever because marco looked up from his hand and he knew his eyes and mouth were bitter hell think he has to be like me next thing you know hell go out looking hell either get himself killedor hell kill somebody and for all the wrong reasons and that would be worse than getting himself killed i remember more than just you from home i remember what some of the younger montagnards were like when they were my age and benitos they started like thatfirst each one trying to outrisk the otherthen it got worse i dont think hed ever turn out like them but im not taking any chances on it aldanto nodded slowly relaxing and letting himself give way to the drugs and the alcohol i think maybe ive been underestimating you only sometimes you getting sleepy yet aldanto shivered hard again then got it under control getting thereand feeling a great deal less like death would be welcome thats the whole idea caesare an idea occurred to him and he decided he wanted to broach it while aldanto was in a generousand intoxicatedmood could you do me a favor when you feel more like talking maybe aldanto replied wearily obviously wishing marco would leave him alone whats the favor maria came in with clean bandages salve and a cheap broach marco felt his face flame with embarrassment he hated to ask in front of maria but this might be his only chance could youcould you tell me some timehow tohow to get a girltoto like you and what do you do with her after that he thought but didnt say oh mercy aldanto shut his eyes and leaned his head back on his pillow his mouth twitching marco had the uncomfortable suspicion that he was trying to keep from laughing behind him he heard maria choking a little as if she hadnt quite managed to suppress her own humor if youd rather not later marco well see about it later aldanto opened his eyes and gave him a notunsympathetic wink shivered again harder this time and lost his amusement as a shudder of chill shook him surely it can wait suresure marco hastily backed out of the bedroom taking the bandages from maria as he passed her by the time she joined him he was sitting on the couch trying to rebandage his wound onehanded here you fool let me do that she took the things away from him and undid his clumsy work he leaned back into the soft upholstery and allowed her to do what she wanted how much of this stuff of yours he gonna need just whats in the canister she looked suspiciously at him i looked in your pack you brung back a lot moren that he shrugged i know i could catch it again or benito or you theres likely to be a use for it before a cold snap kills the fever sophia says i can come trade her for more anyway and i brought other herbs maria looked thoughtful you knowthis could be worth something you say this is the same fever that kills the little ones the thought crossed my mind but i was mostly doing it for caesare i owe you one marco she said softly earnestly he relaxed and shut his eyes feeling his tired and bruised muscles go slack dont go talking debts at me i owed him damnfool case vecchie honor she jeered back there was respect in that jeer however the scoulo families like hers might be poor but their honor was as deep and as precious she worked slowly gently and precisely first cleaning the wound with some more of aldantos brandy he could tell it wasnt the first knife wound shed dealt with just one of ventuccios clerks fatigue made irrelevant thoughts swim past and one of them caught what little was left of his attention a thought and a memory of a couple of days ago what the hell hed risk her temper mariaits arent when youre talking about you or more than one person and isnt all the rest of the time except when youre talking about yourself then its am not got it think thatll help he cracked an eyelid open to see her staring openmouthed at him how did you noticed you fishing for it the other day figured nobodyd ever given you the rule hard to figure things out if nobody tells you the rules claudia could help you better than i could she was an actress for a while and she knows all the tricks he yawned she could make brunelli sound like a bargee or a bargee sound likeyawnbrunelli his lids sagged and he battled to stay awake aint nobody put it quite like that before she said thoughtfully huh damn this is a bad un looks like it hurts like hell whatd you do here ram your hand down on the point had to he outweighed me by about twice it was the only way i could think to get the knife away from him he ran his right hand up to check the lumps on the back of his head and encountered his nottoonice hair and remembered oh hell maria looked up startled whats the matter i hurt you theres no food in the house i need a bath worse than i ever did in my life all the clothes are filthy and have to be washed and i dont have a copper for any of it i spent every last coin i had for trade goods for sophia oh hell he squeezed his eyes shut to stop their burning but a few shameful tears born of exhaustion and frustration escaped to embarrass him to have gone through this whole night only to have to run against this oh dont get upset maria still had his hand and he managed to get enough control of himself to open his eyes to look at her she was smiling broadly and pointedly not looking at his tears i reckon caesare owes you a good bit we got food here we have a tub and a fireplace and good soap you want i can row you back to cannaregio when benito wakes up get your things bring it all back here given this hand i reckon i could help you with the clothes even you just be damn sure not to waste nothing that suit you relief turned his muscles to slush and he sagged back more than suits youve got that thinking look again you get most of your work at night right she looked more than a little uncomfortable but nodded we work days soif you wanted we could stay here just long enough for him to get better orhell half the towns sick you could take a note to ventuccios saying we are and we could even spell you in the daytime that way saints the way i feel right now it wouldnt even be a lie i figure caesare should be getting better in four five days a week tops we watch for trouble while youre out whenever we can feed him too make sure he takes the medicine keep him from going out when he isnt ready to the last two sentences came out a little uncertainly keeping caesare from doing whatever he felt like doing was an improbable scenariosick or not and you get asked maria food and a hot bath i know damn sure caesare can afford to eat better than we can he grinned wearily his bruised facial muscles aching youll have to talk him into covering the pay well lose though hell maria you know we cant afford to lose pay any more than you can i know he trusts you she looked back at the hand she was holding and finished pinning the new bandage with the broach i expect after tonight yeve proved it out we got weapons enough here between the two of us and if i dont show up for too long its gonna look funny we dont dare let anybody guess he aint well enough to fight all right you do that she sniffed her mouth quirking a little contemptuously hell the way he throws his money around hell cover you if i say so well cook and clean up after ourselves youd damn sure better cause i aint gonna she looked up to see hed fallen asleep wedged into the corner of the couch his head was sagging against the couch cushion and hed gone as limp as a loaf of watersoaked bread she chuckled and went to find him a blanket chapter francesca waited on the walkway outside the red cat for kat to arrive with the last package madame was not going to object if any of her girls chose to take a little sun on the walkway while she waited for a delivery it served as good advertisement and when that girl was francesca it guaranteed a full house the sots though they might harass women they suspected of being whores in and around their own stronghold or inside churches had not yet become brave enough to go after the scarlet women at their own doorsteps for that much francesca was grateful from kats own lips shed heard the story of the incident with the sots at the church two weeks before it had sent chills down her spine it wasnt so much that theyd dareda fanatic would dare anything any time any placeas it was that their leader had so instantly seen heresy and witchcraft where there was none small wonder the strega she knew were digging holes in the water to hide in she wanted her talisman and she wanted it badly as if the mere thought of kat had conjured the girl the next gondola to make the turn and negotiate its way into the rio dei mendicanti was hers francesca waved cheerfully to her with both hands on her pole kat could hardly wave back but she nodded there was no need to hide anything kats usual costume with the hood that covered her distinctive hair disguised her well enough from anyone except people who knew her well which meant francesca was now certain anyone from the case vecchie circles as a young woman of the case vecchie kat would not be known to anyone in venices lower classes except the few people with whom the girl had set up commercial arrangementswhich for their reasons as well as her own would be kept highly secret so there was no danger of kat being recognized here so long as she kept her face shadowed and her hair covered by a hoodnot in the vicinity of this bordello the house of the red cat did not have a lowclass custom true but it was still several cuts below the kind of establishment that the citys elite would frequent nor did francesca have any reason to hide the transaction from the watchful eyes of the madame of the red cat prostitutes received frequent parcels from boat girls not even a suspicious brothel keeper would wonder about this parcel in fact the very openness of the delivery was the surest protection besides francesca was too impatient for the pose of the languid lady she caught the rope that kat tossed to her and tied up the boat with her own hands kat threw her the package she had been waiting for then balanced up and over the deck and onto the walkway jumping across the water to land beside francesca do you want to check it and make sure its all right kat asked the gown within the outer wrappinga very special gownhad been an extra ordered after the successful interview with the madame of casa louise madame wanted her to make an entrance and a stir when she first arrived officially at the house kat had promised she could come up with something spectacular tonight or tomorrow depending on what fate presented in the way of opportunity saucy and inventive francesca of the red cat would vanish and francesca de chevreuse gracious and educated courtesan from aquitaine would appear at casa louisewith no way of connecting the two certainly her potential customers would never guess the social strata that patronized casa louise wouldnt even glance down the rio dei mendicanti as they passed by on their way to some important social or business function all the rest of the new gowns including the interview gown were in her new apartment at casa louise conveyed there by the everresourceful katerina francesca was taking no chances on the madame of the red cat sniffing out her imminent defection a bruised and brokenboned courtesan was not an object of desire and the doorman had heavy fists kat had cleverly managed to squeeze everything into a rather small package that looked exactly like a parcel from a foodstall i dont suppose youd care to come in would you francesca asked doubtfully she was surprised by the answer i would love to id liketo ask your advice on what i wonder kat knew donatella the same strega herbalist who provided francesca with the means of preventing pregnancy so it couldnt be that could it unless kat wasnt aware that there were such things ridiculous she couldnt be making deliveries on these waters without finding out within a fortnight then by all means please come in francesca gestured that kat should follow her it was too early for the doorman to be on duty and plenty of the other girls had female friends or relatives from outside the house so fernando paid no attention to kat whatsoever they reached francescas room in short order and francesca dropped the latch into place when kat was inside i hope youll forgive me but theres really no place to sit but the bed francesca said apologetically kat shrugged and took a seat at the foot looking around with curiosity ease my mind and have a look through there i think youll like what i found and i want to make sure that the goldsmith gave me the right thing thing that would be the talisman francesca smiled she wouldnt wonder that kat was suspiciousit didnt look like something a goldsmith should have held in his keeping she cut the string holding the parcel together and unfolded the dark tabbyweave cloth ah the cloak kat had used the cloak shed asked for as the wrapping liningside out inside were the dress the undergown the shifts the hose with one of the undergowns wrapped around another bundle these are perfect francesca assured the girl especially the choice of colors every other courtesan is going to be in blue or red not only are these good colors for me but theyll make me stand out immediately she untied the shift and shook out the ornaments these are even better if thats possible she pronounced whoever taught you about jewelry was a wise woman never choose fake anything when for the same price you can have something genuine she held up the sparkling strands of murano glass beads that she would weave through her hair then the threetiered necklace with carved amber pendants and the matching earrings can you see how much richer and substantial these look than gilt chains and faux pearls i didnt like the look of the other things i was offered replied kat i cant explain it and no one taught me then you have very good instincts francesca told her taking out the last piece her precious amulet it had been her mothers and had come all the way from aquitaine with francesca it was very crudea wooden heart encased in a plain silver cage it was also very old and would probably get her burned on sight if one of the sots ever got wind of it it held a luckspirit not a terribly powerful one but powerful enough to keep francesca safe so long as she didnt do anything monumentally stupid and quite powerful enough to keep her safe from prowling canal monsters by making her invisible to the eyes of evil creatures and black spirits it was also indisputably pagan which was why francesca had chosen her jewish goldsmith to hold it for her while she was in the red cat instincts good enough for me to do what youre doing came the bitter question francesca clutched the amulet to her breast quite unconsciously and stared at the girl you cant possibly be saying you want to become a whore she blurted kat flushed but persisted you seem to be doing well enough and if my grandfather dies i may have no choice francesca had known from the first day she met kat that the girls family was in dire straits she was fairly certain she even knew from the rumors that swirled through venice along with the tides which of the old houses it wasmontescueeven though she had never made any attempt to find out but this she sat down on the head of the bed put her talisman aside and seized kats hands in both of hers i am the exception to the general fate of women in this profession she said bluntly or at least i intend to be ive had to fight and scheme my way with every step i took since i came to venice and if i had not had the training from early childhood and exceptional looks i would not be going where i am she was not going to speak the name of casa louise aloud not here until the moment she went out of the door in this dress there was still danger listen to meim not going to give you my lifes story but im going to tell you enough my family was the equivalent of case vecchieelsewhere my father was ruined by another old house when i was fifteen then excommunicated and executed for supposed treason my older brother was murdered within a month my mother fled with me and a single muleload of her belongings she set herself up as a courtesan in another city by appearing at a very exclusive house in one of her fine gowns and letting the madame know that sheand her daughterwere available the madame tested herand myself as well a courtesan is not a whore if she were no man of wealth and taste would bother with what he could have cheaper elsewhere simple rutting however luxurious the setting is not sufficient for the price that a man pays for a cortegiana kats face flamed but francesca was going to give the girl the whole truth as brutally as possible my mother prospered until she did something unbelievably stupid she had the opportunity to strike back at the man who had destroyed her husband and son and she took it she was condemned and hung as a murderess by then however i wasin the business i took my accomplishments and what i could carry and the madame kindly assisted my flight to venice the madame and my mother saw to itas the next generation in their professionthat i had every accomplishment i read and write in four languages i speak six i play the lute and sing i dance i can converse with a learned dottore of letters on the works of the greeks and romans or on the works of the poets and philosophers of our own age i even write poetry myselfits bad poetry but i can write it i know as much about politics within italy and the wider world as most of the gentlemen of the case vecchie quite a bit more in fact and as for the games of the bedwell let me just assure you that i am a notable athlete that is what is required to be a courtesan she paused thoughtfully you may believe the rewards are great and they are or can be at least i will in the course of a year earn as much as a good ships captain and that is my sharethe madame will earn as much from my labors as i do but to get to this point i have had to strip my soul down to the bones and be more ruthlessly honest with myself than anyone other than a priest should ever be forced to be i must look in the mirror every day and rather than admire my own beauty search ruthlessly for any flaw i must keep my body in a state of perfection i must lie gracefully and believably to my customersi must be able to read them so well that i seem to read their thoughts every day i face the possibility that a customer will injure or even kill me and if he does no punishment will come to him lately there is also the threat that the star of the servants of the trinity will be so on the ascendant that they will dictate venetian moralitythey will be looking for women to make into examples and they will take the ones who stand out nowconsider what i am what my accomplishments are and ask yourselfare you my match can you do what i do every day if notyoull find yourself here in a house like this one the risks are greater here the likelihood of a customer committing some outrage higher the schoppies are frequent visitors and demand pleasure as the price of leaving us alone the servants are spies and the madame herself can order her girls beaten as punishment for some infraction real or imagined unless extreme care is taken the risk of disease as well as injury is very high oh kat said and gulped i quite understand that from the outsidealthough my life is ridden with sinall this looks moderately attractive francesca said more gently i am also aware that the life of a courtesan looks well quite glamorous in a tarnished sort of fashion and it is quite possible for a clever and careful woman to find herself wedded to the man of her choice youve heard the whispered gossip no doubt perhaps you even know of such a woman but let me tell you now that although i fully intend precisely that sort of fate for myself it will require all the resources i can muster all my energy thought and time the planning of a great general and frankly a certain amount of luck ah said kat she looked both disappointed and relieved and francesca patted her hands and let them go such luck as you have been for me francesca continued a courtesan remembers her friends kat i think youll soon find that the information i can provide you once i move will be of considerable help in mending your fortunes as you have done the things that helped me to repair mine she smiled if worse comes to worst a grand house like the one im moving to often requires discreet boatmen to ferry messages as well as clients who need a certain privacy and what would be even better francesca hesitated not wanting to bruise kats already damaged pride any further but kat she said firmly within a much shorter time than you might expect i will be well not exactly awash in wealth but certainly rich enough to affordeven requiremy own gondolier having one who was herself a pretty girlor better still a pretty girl cleverly disguised as a very pretty boywould give the thing a certain cachet which a courtesan requires more than anything else so if your fortunes come tumbling down and you find yourself destitute and aloneplease come to me first before you think of taking any ah desperate measures all right as she had made her suggestions the color had faded from kats face but it returned soon enough and her expression had become almost hopeful when francesca came to the part about the private gondola that gave francesca a feeling of great reliefkat did not have the makings of a courtesan and she didnt want to see the girl in the situation that most of the red cat women were in kat she knew would not survive that life for more than a handful of years now i know you must have deliveries and i have an evening of work ahead of me she fished for the pouch of coins she owed kat and pressed them into her hand i do kat said springing up from her seat on the bed she paused at the door and turned around francescathank you for everything you are most welcome dear francesca gave her a knowing wink that made kat blush all over again before she whisked out the door and was gone chapter the monster waited until the vessel was completely engrossed as always chernobogs shadow voice aroused the pathetic creature to a frenzy of uncontrolled emotion every emotionanger and fury as well as lust the vessel was careless and so as he combined fury with lust satiating himself on the servants body while he imagined an insolent young witch in her place he gave not a moments thought to the effect his emotions would have on the monsters shackles the monster could sense the coming moment when the vaporous cage that restrained it would soften grow tattered it could escape then without either the vessel or the servant noticing its passage into the outer world the monsters own lust grew rapidly as the gray mist that surrounded it began to take shape and color some small part of its mind urged cautionthe master will be angrybut the monster ignored it why should chernobog care if the monster devoured another soul and it could always claim that it had been commanded by the masters own servant had she not aroused the vessel had not the vessels own fury and lust sent the monster on its wayeven selected the prey somewhere in what was left of what had once been a keen mind the monster knew that chernobog would see through the deception but it no longer cared let the pain come later for the moment the monster could think of nothing beyond the immediate prospect of feeding and such a magnificent feed the monster could barely restrain itself from clawing at the cage too soon too soon wait until the gray mist faded and faded finallyit was enough the monster glided through and found itself once again in the outer world the small room was dark more of a crypt than a room with the casket at the center once it had been a small chapel but no longer it was devoted to a different creed nowas the bones and infant skulls and arcane symbols on the walls attested the monster ignored its surroundings it was not really part of any faith and found the trappings meaningless instead moving slowly it opened the door that led to the room beyond the door was neither locked nor bolted there was no reason for it to be since the larger room beyond was given over to the privacy of chernobogs servant it was a spare and austere room lit only by a single candle the monster crept through the room toward another door on the opposite side behind that door was the bedchamber where the masters voice slept slept and every night aroused the vessel the door to the bedchamber was not only unlocked it was ajar the room beyond was dark before entering the monster listened for the sounds it was hoping to hear yes the vessel was grunting his lust atop the masters voice in the bed against the far wall the monster could hear the voice responding with soft cries of faked passion the sounds meant nothing to the monster it had a different lust to satisfy silently stealthily so as not to disturb the rutters the monster crept on all fours through the bedchamber another austere room it was well designed to disguise the servants true nature the monsters thin lips peeled back in jeering scorn seeing the crucifix attached to one of the walls normally it would avoid such a holy symbol but this one was meaningless the servant had long ago as she had with all the paraphernalia of her supposed faith defiled the crucifix in such as way as to make it harmless still the monster did not come any closer than necessary to the holy symbol as it glided toward the pile of discarded clothing on the floor the item it sought was there just as it had sensed it was still tucked away forgotten in a pocket of the vessels tunic carefully slowly the monster teased it out with its long thick tongue savoring the taste absorbing the scent it was enough it could find the prey now easily the monster sidled away backing toward the crypt where its cage was kept again being careful not to disturb the rutters on the bed and again staying as far away as possible from the crucifix on the wall once back in the crypt the monster reentered the cage with an eagerness it did not usually feel for that act but that was because the cage was a cage no longer not with the vessels mindless lust shredding the vaporous bars the cage was now a portal as soon as the monster felt the waters of the canal and was finally able to see the outer world again it flinched it had not realized the time of day the vessel and the voice usually rutted at night but night had not yet arrived it was only sunset with a quick thrust of its tail the monster drove beneath the surface and hid amidst some pilings shoring the side of the canal cursing silently at the frustration but unable to do otherwise it would risk chernobogs anger at an unauthorized feeding but it would not risk the masters rage if it were seen on that matter chernobogs instructions had been far too clear for the monster to claim an unfortunate misunderstanding so it waited for the sun to disappear and the darkness to come and as it waited felt its frustration mounting to the point of sheer fury especially when it saw the prey herself passing by not forty feet distant the monsters eye peeking above the surface of the water in the shadows amidst the pilings watched the prey row her gondola past its eelthroat gaped wide thick tongue writhing in the water like a giant worm tasting her scent the prey was sosplendid fresh young innocent the monster knew that her soul would taste as fine as her hair shining like copper in the sunset so much tastier a soul than the wretched things the master had been feeding it it would be so easy the monster could capsize the gondola in an instant then seize the prey once she was in the water and drag her to a hidden feeding ground so easy now now but not even the monster not even when it was burning with lust was crazy enough to do it not while it was daylight not with people in other boats on the water and walking alongside the canal no matter how fast it moved someone would witness the act might even catch a glimpse of the monster itself chernobogs rage would not stop at mere punishment then chernobog would feed on the monster itself and not be satisfied with simply a portion remembering the one time the master had fed upon it the monster almost whimpered its lust receded replaced by terror enough at least to enable the monster to bring itself back under control wait night is coming and i can find her anywhere the scent will be easy to follow the monster was so intent on its own desires that it never noticed the priest standing on the opposite side never noticed that the priest was also watching the prey as she receded down the canaland with as much concentrated attention as the monster itself nor did it notice the moment when the priest suddenly started and cast a gaze across the canal then scrutinized everything in the area as if a hunter had suddenly heard a noise in the forest and was trying to detect its source nor did it notice when the priest spun on his heels and began striding hurriedly away the shaman however did notice naturally enough since the shaman had been sent on this incredibly dangerous expedition for that very purpose the monster thought it had escaped in reality chernobog had foreseen this eventuality and had decided to use the monsters lust to test his opponents the shamans master did not understand either the purpose of these peculiar priests in venice nor their power chernobog also the shaman understood wanted to test the depths of the lions slumber once before the shamans master had misgauged the lion when he tried to murder the strega grand master with too open a hand that attempt had roused the lion from his sleep the ancient spirit had not only slain the assassins before they could finish the work but had carried the stillliving marina himself into the jesolo three years ago that had been the time had come chernobog decided to see if the lion had returned to his slumber the shaman understood the logiceven agreed with it abstractly but it was he not chernobog who was forced to lurk in the shadows of the canal and watch while a monster roamed loose a monster which would not hesitate for an instant to devour the shaman as readily as it would devour its intended prey the time finally came it was dark enough now if the monster moved carefully it eased out of the pilings and began driving up the canal with slow and powerful strokes of its tail keeping a wary eye for boats and passersby and diving below the surface whenever necessary the scent was strong as easy to follow as blood spoor but far more delicious when pierre came into the room his face was as pale as a sheet his eyes open and strained he looked for an enemy but not one of this world something is out there eneko lopez rose from the table where he had been writing a letter his head cocked yes the savoyard priest shook his head violently and shuddered at the same time i dont know i was watching the girl the one you wanted to find out more about thensuddenlyi felt something something horrible evil more concentrated than anything i can remember in my life the basque at the table turned his head and stared out the window was it she herself perhaps pierre shook his head again less violently this time i dont think so eneko it was connected with her somehow i felt but i had the sense that it was something watching her rather than she herself reluctantly as a priest will speak of such things it seemed very lustful a horrible sort of lust and not the sort of thing that anyone would draw willingly unto themselves and i am not so sure now that it wasnt actually hunting her and not just watching her lopez limped out through the open door near the table and onto the balcony beyond then peered down at the canal below the waters were already dark with the evening he raised his eyes and studied the massive edifice across the canal that housed the imperial embassy something watchingperhaps hunting something evil a true innocent might might be safe from such a thing but how many people were true innocents once out of leadingstrings too late he murmured for anything except prayer he turned back sharply and decisively join me pierre here now whatever it waslet us test the thing if it is what i think it is chernobog has made a serious error pierre hesitated the basque priests solid bar of eyebrow lowered it is not forbidden pierre he snapped and what is the alternative to allow a girl who may be guilty of nothing more than venial sins to be devoured by chernobog the savoyards uncertainty vanished a moment later he joined eneko on his knees crucifix in hand protections pierre asked eneko shook his head no time but we are not the ones it is hunting eneko cleared his mind of the distracting worry that this might be a trap for him and his own people saint mark ah pierre caught his meaning i found a prayer in the accademia library that might be what we need the savoyard bent his head over his clasped hands and began murmuring the words eneko concentrated on them and on special sacred magic of a hypatian priestmage that of directed aimed prayer with power behind it blessed saint mark patron and protector the power flowed outward and upward as eneko concentrated he felt another power join to hispierresand their souls sought for that place where prayers were answered but then what he had not dared hope for he felt something stir sensed sleepy eyes opening somewhere in that place that was outside space and a time beyond time in that other where spirits dwelt something ancient what he did not have the means to answer that question it could not hear him he lacked a voice it would respond to but he didnt have to answer it he sensed it was now looking for just an instant eneko thought he saw a pair of great eyes opening the monster was at the waterdoor not because it sought entry by that meanstoo riskybut simply because it wanted to be certain it required only a moment of soft snuffling licking the door with its tongue yes so strong so delicious it moved slowly down the canal searching the walls a very great house this was still massively impressive despite the little signs of disrepair that disrepair would be of good use to the monster there was a route up the wallsas easy to climb as a chimney to an experienced mountaineer the monster almost chortled with glee then restrained itself again it was still too early night had fallen yes but the house would not be asleep the monster could not risk chernobogs anger that much wait wait something else awoke stirred from long slumber by prayers opened golden eyes and then understanding the meaning of the prayers great muscles rippled down a tawny back huge wings began to unfold in my city you grow too bold chernobog there was some fury in the thought not much mostly the thought was just amused christian priests no less theyre not usually that smart from his hiding place in the pilings nearby the shaman watched he was awash in fear the shaman understood what the monster was doing and he knew that the slightest motion on his part would draw its attention should that happen the shaman was far too close now to even hope to escape in open water with enough of a lead the shaman in his fishform could outswim the monster but here in the narrow canalsthe shaman had seen how quickly the monster could move in a lunge the shaman prayed to his pagan deities prayed desperately hoping that time itself would move faster in its course it was time still almost silent for all its eagerness the monster heaved out of the water and began climbing up the wall it made swift progress even stopping from time to time to scan the area in order to be certain there were no observers the heavy walls disrepair made climbing easy the shaman still almost shuddering with relief after seeing the monsters form lift out of the water froze with new terror something new was stirring he could sense it something immensely powerful he turned and began swimming away but an iron thought came from his master stop slave i must see this your life is of no consequence there was no balcony providing ingress to the house but the monster had seen the roof garden and it served the purpose just as well a quick slither and the monster was into the garden being careful still not to crush or disarray the vegetation leave no trace silently on all fours it crept through the lush vegetation too lush reallythe garden also showed signs of poor maintenance eneko thought he heard a thunder of wings and felt a shadow pass over him before he and pierre fell back into their heavy mortal selves it is done he whispered let us pray it will be in time a little shudder passed through pierres shoulders i wouldnt worry about that eneko if the legends are even half true he gave his basque companion a look that was almost baleful what have you gotten us into when the monster reached the glasspaned double doors that opened onto the garden it thrust its misshapen head cautiously between two large potted plants the curtains on the doors were not closed and the monster could see into the room beyond could see everything quite clearly despite the overcast and the absence of a candle in the room itself the monster was a creature of darkness after all it could see as well at night as in daytimebetter in truth since the sun was painful to it its great body grew taut as a drum almost stunned by its good fortune it had expected a difficult time creeping through the house in order to find the prey instead she was there sleeping in the bed it made sense of course even the dim mind of the monster could understand that much a girl with such coppery hairsuch a coppery splendid soul hungry would want to wake to the sunrise feel the coppery rays bathing her in a new day a new day which would never come again soft laughter began to gurgle up in the monsters thick throat but it forced the sound under just a moment more of silence and it wouldfeed a claw reached up for the latch the monster knew for a certainty that the door would be unlocked such an innocent soul it gathered its haunches hungry the vise that clamped down on its head struck like a gods hammer it vaguely remembered such a hammer but there was no time to think of ancient weapons the monster writhed like a lizard caught by a hawk its limbs thrashing and flailing thrashing and flailing innothing talons smote thin air a tail lashed in emptiness everything was dark a darkness not even the monsters eye could penetrate dimly stunned it realized that its head was in a giant maw realizeddimly stunnedthat it was being carried through the air like a lizard caught by a hawk the monsters thrashing grew frenzied something smote its back almostnot quitebreaking the spine but the blow was enough to paralyze the monster not even his fear of chernobog could have kept the shaman from fleeing in terror now the spirit that had passed over him had seemed like a golden avalanche of fury and destruction as it happened the shaman was quite safe he was beneath the lions contempt nor did he have to fear chernobogs wrath his master was far too busyfar too frantically busyforging his own defenses to worry about the doings of a pitiful slave some time laterhow much the monster was too dazed to knowit was tumbled to the ground its head spit out of a maw like a bad seed wildly scrabbling to get back to its feet the monster looked around it was back in the cage except even as it watched the tatters in the vapors closed in barring any exit no not closed in were driven in by the flapping of great wings seeing the size of those wings the monster flinched then flinched again as it finally looked at its assailant flinched and sidled away whining in its throat there are rules creature the voice hammered into the monsters brain this is no longer our timeneither yours nor mine but there are still rules the monster howled as a great paw slammed into its flank ripping gouges in the flesh the blow was terrifying in its power for all its own strength the monster knew it was no more than a mouse at the mercy of a cat a very large and angry cat another blow which broke the arm the monster raised to fend it off another blow which shredded its snout fangs like swords clamped on its haunches the monster was jerked off its feet shaken like a mouse in the maw of a cat this time the monsters spine did break so did its shoulder when it was hurled to the ground so did its rib cage under yet another hammerblow of a paw the size of an anvil the monster was shrieking pure terror now another blow shattered its jaw bringing silence thats better youll live of course here in this foul cage heal soon enough those too are the rules the growling voice turned into a rumbling laugh but i dare say youll not try that again a giant paw was raised in question frantically the monster gargled agreement through a broken jaw remember beast this is my cityno one elses tell that to chernobog when you see him next he may attempt to destroy it if he can but he may not do as he pleases there are rules another blow came crushing the monsters skull diego found his two companions in enekos room looking wan and exhausted did you see a ghost he asked cheerfully they glared at him near enough muttered pierre he pointed a weary finger at the basque he summoned the lion i think diegos eyes widened eneko chuckled it was pierres prayer you know how odd that he didnt mention that the basque priest lurched to his feet and walked out onto the balcony he leaned on the balcony and studied the imperial embassy across the canal the huge edifice was now somber with nightfall only a few lights could be seen tapers and lamps flickering behind curtained windows behind him eneko could hear pierres murmured words as he explained to their castillian comrade what had transpired his companions joined him on the balcony a short while later are you certain it was not she herself asked diego quietly we must be certain about this eneko the basque shrugged im not certain of anything but no i am now almost sure the girl is an innocent the more so since you discovered her identity the name montescue is an old one eneko said diego uncertainly evil enough in that family over the centuries again the basque shrugged and of what old family can that not be said with a little laugh certainly not mine did i ever tell you about my greatgrandfather several times growled pierre just as diego has bored me endlessly with tales of his own wicked castillian ancestors my own progenitors on the other hand he added cheerfully were virtuous peasants his companions bestowed skeptical looks upon him each and every one he insisted the moment of levity was brief diego returned to the subject like a dog chewing a bone still eneko we must be certain the basque was back to his study of the imperial embassy his gaze was intent as if he could penetrate the heavy stone walls and see what transpired within it doesnt make sense diego ive discovered as you know that casa montescue is in dire financial straits and the girl katerina is the only member of the family young enoughand trusted enoughto be working at the gray trade her grandfather is too old her sisterinlaw his lips tightened with distaste untrustworthy by all accounts thats enoughmore than enoughto explain her mysterious habits diego began to say something but eneko drove over it besides consider the logic of what just happened he gestured with his head toward the savoyard pierre is wrong incidentally im sure of it we did not summon the lion we simply woke it up for a time to actually summon the thing requires knowledge i do not possess andif the legends are to be believedthe participation of one of the four ancient families of venice which are terrio lacostoboth families long vanished valdostadestroyed presumably by the montagnards and he paused giving the next word added emphasis montescue diego stared down the dark canal in the direction of casa montescue you think the evil one was trying the same legends also specify a son of the families eneko objected pierre but his demurral was not spoken with any great force eneko smiled grimly yes i know but does chernobog he sighed the next words came iron hard for all the softness of the tone enough i say im satisfied that the montescue girl is innocent weve got few enough resources as it isjust the three of us weve learned all we canand needfor the moment concerning katerina montescue time to concentrate on two more important matters what really happened to the strega grand master mused diego thats one whats the other enekos little chuckle was quite absent of humor what do you think what really happened to the children of lorendana valdosta two sons i remind you casa valdosta was destroyed protested pierre everyone says so eneko stared into the darkness this is the murkiest city in the world brothers we cannot assume anything agony led the way dragging the monster back into consciousness in the cage true enough its bones and flesh would knit and heal butnot without pain immense pain in this instance worse than the pain however was the terror once the monsters returning mind understood that chernobog himself was here here and in a rage another blow destroyed most of the healing a second broke the monsters spine anew you imbecile you had your orders the monster tried to babble its excuse but it was impossible with a stillmangled snout it would have done no good in any event chernobog was not to be misled and the monsternow that its mind was no longer clouded with lustknew how foolish that thought had been you awakened the lion another blow sent gouts of blood flying along with gobbets of flesh thankfully it felt chernobog receding the fury in the masters voice ebbed slightly replaced by a colder and more thoughtful anger nothing for it i cannot punish the servant for there is nothing left to punish nor the vessel either for the moment since i still have use for it but you the brokenbodied halfparalyzed monster whined begging forgiveness on you i will feed the monster howled for some time thereafter as chernobog held it down and tore out its innards not gobbling the intestines so much as chewing on them slowly and with apparent relish when chernobog was done there was not much left of the monster but in the recesses of what had once been a mind the monster knew that there was still enough it would survive barely the healing would be painful agonizing i trust you will obey me henceforth the monster tried to whine its abject obedience but failed quite miserably the only sound it made was that of spilling blood chernobog had also devoured its tongue chapter caesare aldanto leaned back in the dark corner of the tavern where he had taken a table for a moment he closed his eyes scowling inwardly as he felt the continuing effects of the disease hed contracted it had been almost two weeks now since marco had begun medicating him and while that medication had certainly helped enormouslyquite possibly saved his life in factcaesare was still feeling some lingering weakness damn venice and its miserable swamps anyway he sighed he couldnt afford any weakness not at any time in his life much less now in venice less so than in any city in the world except possibly his home town of milan itself in truth he detested venice still it was an excellent place for a man like him to make his fortune so suppressing all else caesare reopened his eyes and gave the gloomy interior of the tavern another careful examination this was not caesares usual haunt but it suited his purpose today the tavern was dark the food and wine were inferior enough that it wasnt very popular and he wasnt known here sensing movement at the door his eyes flicked in that direction caesare had taken a table in the rear as he had specified to the contact so when sachss man entered he didnt have to stand in the doorway peering around which would have made him suspicious and uncomfortable as the new arrival made his way past the tables caesare realized that this man would have had no difficulty recognizing him anyway they were old acquaintances after all relishing the shock hed give the fellow caesare leaned forward taking his face out of the shadows good evening francesco he said genially francesco aleri was good caesare had to give him that except for a momentary start aleris astonishment was quickly covered not surprising of course for the man who was duke viscontis chief agent in venicewhich meant in practice if not in theory also the head of the montagnard faction in the city caesare by sheer willpower forced any trace of the weakness produced by the disease from his face the grin that creased that face was purely savage he could not afford to let aleri suspect he might be ill and besides caesare was genuinely enjoying himself this must be a dreadful moment for francesco who had thought until nowand with good reasonthat caesare was safely dead after all aleri had been the one responsible for cracking him over the back of the head and dumping him in the rio dei mendicanti that would have been the end of the matter for caesare if francesco hadnt chosen to dump him off a bridge rather than rolling him over the side of the canal but as it happened there had been a small boat tied up under that bridge and in the boat had been a young girl alone and very susceptible to a handsome young man in obvious danger especially one who was as consummate an actor as caesare aldanto you look prosperous caesare aleri said pleasantly taking a seat across from him the motion was easy casual relaxedbut francescos back needless to say was prudently to the wall caesare smiled i do well enough he said in tones as smooth and bland as unflavored cream despite the ungentle fashion in which i was discharged from my previous ah position you seem to have landed on your feet francesco said shrugging aleri said nothing else although caesare had expected a retort at least from aleri who had been the one who had discovered that caesare had been selling his information outside of montagnard circles aleri who had denounced him as a traitor aleri who had volunteered as executioner as he always did at such times aleri prized his position of being duke viscontis enforcer among the montagnards it had been aleri also who saw to the disposal of bespi although in bespis case the cause had been an excess of enthusiasm rather than cynical peculation like many true believers bespi had eventually found the contradictions between montagnard ideals and milanese realities too difficult to handle and had then been stupid enough to send a protest to duke visconti caesare toyed with his wineglass it was only there to give him an excuse for being here he didnt intend to drink the vile stuff not on top of lingering illness he actually had landed on his feet if hed gone headfirst into marias boat he probably would have died anyway of a broken neck as it was hed been limp enough to collect nothing worse than a few more bruises hed feigned worse naturally when he realized where he was hed have been a fool not to he had no money no resources and a montagnard death sentence on his head maria had realized as much the moment he landed next to her and had kept him safely hidden becoming more and more infatuated with him with every day that passed for his part he had seen to it that the infatuation was fed until it spread through her veins like a fever and overcame the tiniest vestige of her common sense love was the surest hold a man could have over an inexperienced girl like maria he also made certain that she remained everconscious of the difference between their ranks it made her unsure of her ability to keep him with her without making her jealous jealousy might break the spell he had over her selfdoubt and the uncertainty of being worthy of him kept her eager to please i believe you requested a meeting caesare said lazily as i informed your contact not a meeting with you aleri snarled softly i was supposed to meet the milanese agent broke off abruptly muttering something under his breath caesare wasnt certain but he thought the phrase had been that idiot monk assuming he was correct caesare pretended to sip from his wine and then added what can you do francesco and the german cretins call us auslanders as if they could find their own assholes here in venice but like it or not i am the idiot monks chosen man for the job whatever the job might be he set the glass of wine down on the table so why dont you tell me about it and save us both the useless recriminations i dont have any hard feelings after all despite being the injured party in the affair aleris features were not distorted the only sign of the rage that caesare had no doubt was filling the montagnard was the coldness of his gaze your services were always for sale caesare there was ice in aleris voice too just like every other putta in this filthy city caesare did not rise to the bait hed been expecting it aleri was a true believer himselfwhich was odd really for a milanese so close to viscontiand that was his achilles heel he would do anything for faith caesare would do anything for money they were two of a kind and the joke was that francesco didnt even see it the job he prompted gently and my pay aleri caesare thought was very near to throwing his own wineglass in his face but the memory of how good a duelist caesare was prevented him as good as francesco was with a blade caesare was betterand they both knew it instead after a moments tense struggle with himselffor a moment his face looked like a winter stormaleri reached into his cloak and brought out a leather purse he slapped it down on the tabletop id have hired a dog first myself but this incident youre to organize and carry out is a fools business anyway if the german cretin wants to hire a traitor for it why not it matters not to me caesare took the purse and made a little show of pouring the coins into his hand and counting them aleri scowled slightly stop being a fool you always were too clever for your own good itll get you killed soon enough and good riddance caesare didnt rise to the bait tell me about it he murmured the job francesco save the speeches for your faithful followers by the time aleri finished caesare was waging a fierce battle to keep from scowling himself that idiot monk typical german head as thick as a hogs his mind raced that the plan would work on its own terms caesare had no reason to doubt but what is the point of it and the trouble it might stir up does that clerical cretin have any idea how he broke off the thought it was none of his business after all for whatever reason caesares new employer and protector had given his approval to the abbots silly schemes though why brunelli whose fortunes were tied to the metropolitans should have done so was a mystery to caesare not for the first time caesare wondered if casa brunelli always operated with a single mind interesting thought but he had neither the time nor the inclination to pursue it soon enough caesare had little doubt he would have to look for another employer anyway and for the moment the one he had paid well and he smiled across the table at aleri and keeps this one and his cohorts from peeling the hide off my back aleris chair scraped slightly on the floor as he pushed back from the table and rose to his feet youd better keep one eye open from now on when you sleep he growled because the moment that your new patron finds you too expensive to support is the moment when i finish the job i bungled caesare continued to smile in that case i neednt worry he mocked youll have a long gray beard before that day comes aleri stared down at him and did you tell your new woman your real history caesare caesare must have shown something in his face he cursed himself silently as aleri continued of course theres a new woman there always is with beautiful golden caesare you betray everyone women even quicker than men whoever the girl isand ill find out soon enoughi pity her but my pity wont keep me from killing her also an example must be set for what happens to traitors and their whores the milanese turned and stalked out caesare continued to play with his wine and wait for young benito to saunter in as a signal that it was safe to leave the place as he did so his thoughts drifted over his new associates maria was invaluable for the moment leaving aside the pleasure her fiercely enthusiastic lovemaking provided very unskilled enthusiasm to be sure and caesare was beginning to get bored with it but that problem was easy to solve after all caesare gave it no further thought beyond an idle moment of curiosity as to which of several case vecchie girls would be the first to climb into his bed and provide him with more expert entertainment alessandra for one he was quite certain the montescue woman was eager to rekindle their old affair the boys on the other handbenito in particularwere proving far more useful than he would have guessed no one ever looked twice at a child particularly not a canalbrat like benito aleri and his ilk would be looking for a woman that theyd discover maria soon enough caesare didnt doubt for a moment any more than he doubted what would happen to the canalgirl once the situation changed but the montagnards would never suspect caesare of employing the boys as his aides particularly not those boysgiven how their mother had died and by whose hand but that after all was part of the dance wasnt it caesare flexed his right hand for a moment remembering the feel of lorendanas throat as bespi slid the knife between her ribs she had been quite shocked when she died he remembered not so much with the knife as with the hand that kept her from crying out she had always understood the risk of assassination moving in the circles she did what she hadnt expected was that her own lover would set up the killingand time it for the moment she was most defenseless naked in her own bed right after they finished making love a stupid woman in the end for all her quick wits she should have known that once she lost the favor of carlo sforza she was sure to receive the delayed vengeance of filippo visconti yet shed been careless enough to accept a milanese adventurer as a new bedmate stupid as stupid as bespi with his idiot ideals caesares lips twisted in a little smile remembering the look on bespis face as he killed lorendana the assassins eyes had been on caesare not his victim eyes cold with loathing and disgust caesare had never been sure but he suspected that killing had been the one which finally tipped fortunato bespi over the edge no matter caesare was not stupid and he enjoyed the irony of having lorendanas orphans as his new underlings it was the best proof imaginable that his own view of the world corresponded to reality caesare considered the wine and sat back into the shadows the wine was execrable the shadowsideal chapter erik shifted his feet in the antechamber before abbot sachss door he took a deep breath then reluctantly knocked on the thick oak he waited hed just knock again and go he could try later he raised his hand enter said a voice from within erik walked in the room was sybaritically appointed his eyes were still drawn first to the deepset glowering stare of the abbot rather than the furnishings fit for a prince of the blood sachs sat behind one of these an escritoire of dark wood inlaid with ivory you wished to see me abbot asked erik evenly the air in the room was overly warm and full of an acerbic incense and maybe just a hint of perfume erik found himself wondering if manfreds frequent witticisms about the relationship between sachs and sister ursula might not have a basis of truth whatever the scents nature it was making his nose itch and his eyes water the abbots sour countenance twitched then to eriks amazement his face did something the confrere knight had never seen it do beforethe thin lips dragged themselves into a smile ah hakkonsen yes i have a task for you erik wondered whether it was too late to bolt for the door it was either boltor sneeze soon if there were two things erik was certain of the first was that abbot sachs disliked him violently the second was that this incense was driving him mad but as a confrere knight he was by order of bishopcommander von schielbar under the authority of the leader of the servants of the holy trinity in venice that remained true even if erik had forcefully reminded the abbot less than a fortnight ago of the limits of his authority the months theyd spent here in venice had made their dislike mutual the incident in the church over sanctuary had brought it into the open in the two weeks that had gone by since the abbot had spoken not a single word to erik prior to now the only official notice of the clash had been a summons to the quarters of von stublau where the knightcommander began a stern lecture on the proper conduct of knights when dealing with abbots it had been as brief as it was stern because erik had turned on his heel and left before von stublau finished his third sentence the prussian had been outraged no doubt but not even von stublau was prepared to press the matter any further eriks conduct in the church had given him a reputation among all the other knights as a man to be dealt with very very gingerly the more so when the reaction of official venice to the incident in the church made it as clear as crystal that eriks behavior had been the only thing that had saved the knights from what might very well have been a political disaster as sachs had discovered two days later not even the usually sympathetic doge wanted to hear the abbots side of the story canalbrats are canalbrats you idiot not servants of satan such had been the entirety of foscaris opinion before sachs had been summarily dismissed and the doges reaction had been mild compared to that of metropolitan michael who by all accounts had been livid when father ugos story reached him the prestige of the pauline orders always low with the petrine patriarch was now as low as it could possibly get rumor had it that the patriarch had only been dissuaded with difficulty from demanding the forcible eviction of the servants and the knights from venice and dissuaded by his advisers solely because they reminded the patriarch of his policy of trying to avoid clashes with foscari nor was there any doubt that if the pauline orders lost the favor of the doge they could be expelled from the cityby force if necessary there were only a few hundred knights in venice leaving aside the actual military forces at the disposal of the doge which were much larger the sixteen thousand workers in the arsenal where venices great fleet was built were famousor notoriousfor their willingness to take up arms readily they were also famous for their solidly petrine allegiance in religious matters and for being a hotbed of metropolitanism not even the servants of the holy trinity were rash enough or arrogant enough to try to enforce their attitudes in the vicinity of the arsenal or the quarters of the city where its workers lived being shown to be utterly wrong hadnt needless to say made abbot sachs any fonder of the icelandic knight he had said nothing to erik in the two weeks afterward but erik had not failed to notice that each and every day since he had been given nothing but arduous and menial duties to eriks surprise however the incident had also caused a number of the knightsespecially the younger ones and the confreresto view him with much greater warmth than they had done previously some bolder than most had even whispered quick congratulations into his ear when no one was watching it was clear enough that sachss arrogance grated on many others besides himself stillthe abbot was his lawfully appointed superior so long as sachs made no further attempt to transgress law and honor eriks own stiff sense of honor obligated him to obey the man and pay him at least the outward signs of respect even if the wretched creature did use the vilest incense erik had ever encountered so all he said was i am yours to command abbot the abbot blinked he looked as though he hadnt expected it to be so simple for a moment sachs seem to fumble for words then well the mission we have for you is not simple or easy this city is full of corruption and evil we need to root it out i personally would like to put half of these ungodly ones to the question ill bet you would thought erik wearily personally and by the time youd finished with them theyd confess to anything you pleased but he held his tongue and simply concentrated on not sneezing sachs plainly expected a reply or a comment well i am yours to command abbot repeated erik woodenly the abbot looked intently at him then laced his fingers very well i shall command you tonight just before midnight you will proceed to the calle largo di lorenzo you will be unarmored and without your sword but wearing your surcoat showing yourself to be one of the knights of the holy trinity get one of the boatmen to take you as youll never find it on your own you will have wine on your breath and you will be seen to be unsteady on your feet do you have that clearly you will be seen to be unsteady you will turn into the third alleyway and proceed down it perhaps you should sing you will go to the last house on the lefthand side and demand entry erik swallowed was this some kind of trap why in the seven hells was the abbot sending him to visit one of venices most notorious brothels he didnt need a boatman to show him the way he knew perfectly well where it was down to which door hed hauled manfred out of there not two nights ago the madame was not going to be pleased to see him again why he rasped at last sachs looked genuinely pleased because i have commanded you yes abbot and then erik could contain it no longer he sneezed then he sneezed again sachs had obviously not expected this answer because he did explain it is an ambush one of our agents has brought us information that a large group of the ungodly pagans will be conducting their evil rites there when you have gained entry you will create a disturbance you will continue to do so for as long as possible while the knights force entry at the waterdoor haaachoo yes abbot ndow will you excuse me by dose is streaming the bed groaned as manfred did his customary flop onto it as usual he gave his attention to the bedpost caryatides before turning to erik whats up why are you pacing about rubbing a thoughtful hand on that pious sharpcut chin of yours erik took a deep breath ive got to go brothelcreeping manfred leapt to his feet in a single movement like a crossbow snapping straight it was at moments like this that the big knight revealed his true strength and agility he rubbed his hands gleefully and grinned revealing those blocky teeth oh me too me too but this time just to watch whats suddenly come over you my pure icelandic friend besides the need for female company that is erik scowled ive got orders from abbot sachs to go to the house of the red cat you will be staying here even if i have to lock you up you will be staying here and its not funny he snarled seeing the young knightsquires expression manfred put his hand in front of his grin trying to hide it his shoulders began to shake then he gave up he laughed he guffawed eventually he collapsed onto the bed again still fighting off paroxysms of chuckles while erik stared at him in icy irritation eventually he stopped long enough for erik to start speaking its a direct order this provoked a snort of derision from manfred ill bet tell me another one unless sachs is learning more from sister ursula than we realize im supposed to be a decoy for a raid you young fathead i should take you out into the practice yard and teach you some decorum snapped erik manfred sat back and raised his big hands in a pacific gesture im all decorum i swear i havent forgotten the last time neither have my ribs has sachs got wind of your last little visit and the friendly little chat you had with the madame and her bouncers jesu i hope to god not erik crossed himself let me tell you about what he wants me to do by the time hed finished manfred wasnt laughing he wasnt even grinning i suppose theyll be waiting by the waterdoor for the ruckus this smells to the heavens erik that idiot sachs will get you killedand i wouldnt doubt thats really what he wants why in the hell no sword and no armor erik pulled a wry face i suppose they dont want the bouncers too alarmed and deciding not to interfere im supposed to create a disturbance manfred had the grace to look shamefaced i think theyre going to be a little alarmed just to see your face thanks to you yes replied erik grimly manfred stood up slowly true enough are you going anywhere in the next while erik shook his head not until i leave smelling of wine shortly after compline manfred pursed his lips that gives us plenty of time the knightsquire headed for the door wait here that pellmann is nowhere about is he erik raised his eyes to heaven and shook his head when he doesnt have to be not likely manfred nodded and walked out and away up the passage he could walk fast and quietly for such a big man a short while later he was back with a bag and an oilcloth roll he closed the door and bolted it before tossing the bag onto the bed it clinked erik raised an eyebrow manfred unrolled his oilcloth onto to the table and revealed a set of tools that would have done any torturer from damascus to vinland proud get out of those clothes if youve got a closefitting quilted shirt put it on if you dont well have to get you one well need to fit this thing its too small for me these days but likely itll be still too big for you erik looked doubtful what is it manfred stepped over to the bag on the bed he hauled out a shirt of tiny chain links they gleamed with an odd black pearly sheen koboldwerk my uncle had me wear it at court somebody must have washed it because its shrunk erik snorted particularly across the belly it was an unfair observation manfred was as square as a foundation block but he was also solid muscle hed been a great deal softer before erik had started on him he trained with manfred from an hour before dawn until lauds every single day then theyd put in at least an hour on the pells then theyd join the knights for morning drill to give the breton squire his due nowadays manfred gave the training his heart and soul at first erik used to have to haul him out of bed but lately it was getting to be the other way around despite the fact that manfred had managed to explore the wilder aspects of venices nights quite successfully also hed noticed how the squire had put on inches particularly across the shoulders in the months theyd been together the boy was finishing his growing and it certainly wasnt around the waistline erik suspected that manfred had been genuinely shocked to discover how much more capable his icelandic keeper was than he when it came to any kind of extended fighting manfreds incredible strength and athletic ability had not been matched by enduranceleaving aside the fact that he had little of eriks actual combat experience and the brutal skills the icelander had learned in the islands savage clan feuds as well as frontier skirmishes in vinland one thing erik had come to realize about his charge for all of manfreds roustabout ways the young scion of the imperial family was quite capable of learning something when he put his mind to it and if it accomplished nothing else the incident in the church seemed to have finally brought a certain amount of seriousness to manfreds outlook on things the big young man had brooded for days afterward obviously ashamed of his initial reaction to eriks defiance of sachs erik suppressed a snort not that manfreds newfound solemnity went all that deep if abbot sachs kept the knights here much longer he didnt doubt that manfred would even learn to speak the local dialect well enough at least to ask directions to any location in venice hed already learned how to find the taverns and brothels manfred slapped his stomach its the wine he said mournfully i need more erik shook his head and smiled ruefully that is the one thing you dont need this is a matter of opinion now get out of that cotte and put on a quilted shirt erik did as he was told the chainlinks were heavy and cold despite the shirt and while it was loose around the waist and a little tight around the chest it fit across the shoulders manfred grunted in satisfaction too big i can fix too small would have been a problem stand still he reached for the tools displaying a familiarity that surprised erik the icelander watched in some amazement i thought you were a prince not a blacksmith manfred twitched a lockring loose with an evillooking set of longnosed pliers according to my father the breton chiefs were once bothblacksmiths as well as princes this was his idea i got to run tame in the castle smithy back in carnac beat spending time with the tutors mother inflicted on me thats for sure his thick fingers moved with expert skill thats the difference between mainz and carnac he continued too bookish in mainz the aristocracy either reads or fights in carnac according to our old seneschal my father used to do the winter slaughtering before mother got there and civilized him now stand still old sachs didnt say anything about that hatchet of yours did he the subject never came up said erik standing still as he had been told books were a treasure up in iceland especially in winter but he could see where sitting still with a tutor might aggravate a boy like manfred erik sighed he was supposed to watch over him guard him teach him but it seemed to erik that manfreds supreme skill was slipping off to have a good time taking his watchdog with him if that was the only choice but without him if he could manage it it had been from one of those expeditions that erik had retrieved him from the house of the red cat manfred whistled tunelessly between his teeth stretch your arms out erik complied bring them round in front of your chest can you move easily erik nodded its not very comfortable but i can move manfred snorted its never comfortable and be grateful i even had to sleep in it erik looked grimly at manfred sooner or later the boy had to accept the fact that he was in close line of succession to the throne of the holy roman empire the largest and most powerful realm in christendom your uncle wanted to make sure you stayed alive and that is why im supposed to watch over you no one but the high abbot at wurtemburg knows who you are and that is your best defense but somebody may just possibly recognize you even with that moustache manfreds responding grimace was so like that of a boy denied a days play that erik almost laughed he could sympathize with manfreds plight inwardly if not openly by manfreds description life in rather ramshackle relaxed celtic carnac had been a far cry from the stilted imperial court at mainz but there was no point in letting his charge see that sympathy manfred would only try to take advantage of it chapter maria waited for them in the kitchen of the apartment it was homelike having them living here the boys tried to keep quiet but they were in the manner of boys not much good at it maria found the noises comforting she hadnt been aware of caesares catlike quietness until shed had the contrast the occasional clatter and slip from whisper into a laugh or hastily stifled yell was pleasant almost comforting maria had never had a real family the way most people did it had been just her and her mother as she was growing up since then her huge pack of cousins had offered to provide her with a homewell until she took up with caesarebut maria had always declined the offers she valued her independence too much but the boys didnt really impinge on that independence they just made her home warmer of course shed never tell them that they obviously found the apartment pleasing too they hadnt moved out although caesare was getting up for part of each day now there was not much wrong with him any more that maria could see except he tired quickly she wanted a word with marco about that and shed better sort benito out before he got into real trouble she felt a little awkward at the thought of trying to discipline benito he wasnt more than two years younger than she was after all but somebody had to do it and marco for all that he was a good soul and gentle as a dove wasnt up to dealing with his little brother she grabbed him by the ear when he came in benito you listen to me ow leggooo how do i listen when youre pulling my ear off maria snorted you listen with the other one and if i pull this one off maybe things wont just go straight in one ear and out of the other im listening im listening just let go said benito on tiptoes she did now if this doesnt go in next time i will pull it off i hear from giaccomo youre still hanging out with that laivetti boy mercutio yeah said benito defensively hes a friend of mine see his tone was surly maria didnt like that tone hes trouble she snapped if youre going to stay with caesare and meyou keep your nose clean caesare doesnt need extra troubles benito was silent for a few moments he bit his lip its not as simple as all that maria he said quietly and why not benito shrugged you know when youre living on the canals um some of the bigger boys they use the little uns like girls some of them are real fond of little boys marias eyes narrowed this mercutio no mercutio hes a ladies man but he looked out for me kind of let it be known that hed deal with anyone who tried anything helped me out with food andand a bit of coin a time or two showed me a few things that claudia and valentina left me to find out the hard way andhe made me laugh when i needed a few laughs stubbornly i cant just turn my back on him i cant maria maria nodded she understood this level of loyalty it made her think better of benito actually si i can see that nito but theres a difference between being a friend maybe sitting at giaccomos talking and doing the kind of crazy thievery and stunts that he likes to pull youll get killed so will he benito shrugged again thats what claudia always says but mercutiohes lucky maria shook her head she hadnt really gotten through to him luck runs out you stay away from his stunts benito some of the grimness in that must have gotten to benito hes out of town anyway maria from what i can work out no ones seen him since twothree days after caesare took sick maria smiled i know hes your friend but i hope he stays away benitos brother walked in looking preoccupied morning marco you been to see the patient hope you not lookin like that cause hes going downhill marco smiled sorry i was just thinking about something si ive been to see caesare hes fine maria itll take him a little while to get his strength back his endurance ratherhis strengths pretty much back to normal if he rests well another few weeks and hell be like this never happened maria snorted i cant make him resthell be out and about again today he just wont accept it that he cant run around for very long thats a nasty sickness marco looked embarrassed um thats the treatment not the disease if you live through the disease without the herbs youre better in a week or so maria gawped at him what marco held up his hands without the herbs a lot of people just die but the herbs are poison too you can kill someone with them if they have too much old sophia reckons the herbs make the body too poisonous for the sickness to live it takes the body a while to rid it itself of the toxin it wont do caesare any harm to be up and about hell get tired quick thats all well thats good to know said maria with relief although i wouldnt tell him you poisoned him the relief went away quietly anxiously hes organizing something i can tell by the way his eyes go thoughtful out on the water carrying a cargo of copper nails to the arsenal maria had time to think about what marco had said she just hoped the poison didnt make caesare slower he kept most of what he was involved in from her he always said what she didnt know couldnt be tortured out of her but on at least one occasion it had been a duel which was strictly illegal the young nobleman caesare had pushed into it had been a thorn in the side of ricardo brunelli hey maria she looked up it was antonio plying his usual load of fresh crabs for the fishmarket it was a good line that housewives wanted their crabs still alive and they paid extra for it but it meant antonio was often ferrying a load in before lauds ciao tonio hows trade bit slow always is at this time look i know you work nights a bit im just passing a warning out they found what was left of one of those young ponto di reggio brats dead in the water stuck in some piles maria thought of benito maybe he owed his friend mercutio more than he realized what killed him tonio shrugged somethin bad real bad the body was pretty much missing and what there was the eels and fish had eaten most of it but the head they say was bitten in half what kinda fish can bite right through a skull eh no natural one thats sure and certain like nothin anyone ever saw they reckon it must be some of this witchery thats going on the kid disappeared months ago and they say it was the same night that rich banker got torn apart in his own bed does that sound like happenstance to you he glanced around searching the water uneasy even in broad daylight just thought id tell you to keep a weather eye out maria clutched at the amulets she wore two were from the calle farnese supposedly protection against demons of the night the other sidebyside with pagan charms was a little leather bag containingwell supposed to containa fragment of st ursulas skull she hoped theyd protect her because she didnt have a whole lot of choice about working nights moving stuff for giaccomo sometimes marco felt very uneasy here this was the last place the very last place where a pauline belonged this was if not the headquarters of the enemy at least a bastiona chapel of saint raphaella one of saint hypatias fervent followers martyred not by fire sword or persecution but by accident saint raphaella had allegedly stood firm in the face of a tide of dreadful injuries all over alexandria in the wake of the terrible earthquake of had used herb and skill and yes magic to hold off the scythe of grim death from thousands who were dying she cured them of injury or illness or both and perished only when an aftershock toppled a broken column down on her as she was trying to help more who were trapped in the rubble and still alive and even then she did not cease her work apparently for all those who prayed to her recovered and there were many who dreamed of her laying gentle hands on them in the night and woke healed in the wake of so many miracles it would have taken a stronger man than the thengrand metropolitan to deny the voices on all sides who called for sanctification marco remembered his mother denouncing the saint once when he was a small boy he only remembered because of his phenomenal memory lorendana valdosta had denounced a lot of things she was headstrong disobedient not modest and selfeffacing as saint paul told women to be she defied her own priest even when he ordered her to stay out of the city told him to take his orders to the devil if she hadnt how many would have died marco could remember himself wondering that after his mother finished her little peroration and today much older he could look back on the episode and realize how absurd it was for his motherthe notorious montagnard agent lorendana valdostato be denouncing other women for being headstrong and disobedient as if she herself had not been and for a far less worthy a cause than saint raphaella still marco was unsettled whatever doubts he might have begun developing about all the tenets of the pauline creed it was the one he had been raised in after all and this was a tiny dark little place squeezed in between two warehouses on a waterway so narrow a boy could jump across it the reason marco had come was that brother mascoli who presided here had sent a message that he wanted to speak to marco about his herbs at least hes hypatian horrible thought that had they heard it spoken aloudand had they enough authoritythe servants of the holy trinity would probably drag marco up in front of a tribunal and in less time that it took to say knife have him declared a heretic the last light of day couldnt penetrate these manmade canyons and although the sky had just begun to show the colors of sunset down here it was twilight marco pushed open the door to the chapel and eased inside there wasnt much in the way of light here just the few candles that burned in front of the statues of hypatia and raphaella and the presencelight on the altar someone knelt in front of the altar someone in a lightcolored robe and not ordinary clothing who got to his feet and turned around as the door creaked closed marco cleared his throat awkwardly the man who approached him was not terribly prepossessing balding with little more than a gray fringe over each ear thin yet roundfaced he blinked mild blue eyes at the newcomer peace be with you my child he said in a reedy voice how may i help you im looking for brother mascoli marco replied he asked to see me the little mans face lit up with a smile that transformed it then you must be marco please will you come back to my quarters id like to ask you a few questions about those herbs you have been giving some of my flock marco would rather not have gone with him but there didnt seem to be much choice reluctantly he followed the sibling through a door behind the statue of saint raphaella and into a tiny closet of a cell that didnt hold anything but a pallet on a wooden platform a stool and desk a crucifix on the wall and a lamp please sit down marco the sibling said taking the stool leaving the only place for marco to sit being the bed he sat very gingerly on the edge as brother mascoli took out pen ink and a roughly bound book opening it to a blank page now if you would be so kindi wonder if you could tell me the words were gentle the interrogation ruthless brother mascoli extracted every particle of information marco had about sophia and chianos herbs even going so far as to take out an enormous herbal from beneath the bed and leaf through all the pages until he had identified the exact plants to his satisfaction the herbal marco noted was handwritten the drawings quite accurate and the script identical to brother mascolis had the sibling actually ventured out into the marshes to collect samples of all of those plants himself if sohis estimation of the rabbitty little man went up several notches now what incantation did you use brother mascoli asked briskly marco froze the sibling raised an eyebrow at his silence well he prompted none he said stiffly none the other eyebrow rose surely not none he repeated his voice cracking with strain brother mascoli carefully blew on the page to dry it and closed the book he regarded marco for a very long time with a deceptively mild gaze marco couldnt move marco the sibling said quietly why are you so afraid of your magic marco began to sweat what magic he squeaked he can tell how can he tell how does he know chiano knew brother mascolis gaze ceased being mild after another very long time he sighed marcoi am one single man serving people who are the poorest of the poor i have no help and very little money and although i am something of a mage i am absolutely the least powerful of any in this city and yet the people i serve number in the thousands and they are the most likely to become ill to be seriously injured now i continue to serve them because god saw fit to grant me a gift and it would be a sina sinnot to use it to help as best i am able and not a venial sin either but a mortal sin the sin of pride pppride marco stuttered in confusion brother mascoli nodded pride the pride of a man who would believe that he knows better than god god has seen fit to give me this gift and gifts are meant to be used for the good of all to be shared to refuse to do so is to refuse gods blessings and to do so out of selfishness and that he added examining his fingertips for a moment would be yet another sin sloth perhapsthat one was too lazy to exert oneself avarice that one wished to keep ones energies all for oneself i suppose that it all would depend on the motive behind the selfishness marco wasnt going to cave in that easily to this facile petrine use of magic should remain in the hands of anointed priests who wont be tempted by such power what in heavens name makes you think that priests can resist the temptations of power the sibling retorted all the more reason then marco mascoli said sharply give over for a moment allow someone who has actually studied magic to speak will you marco snapped his mouth shut flushing magic as even the most rigorous pauline practices it is prayer nothing less but certainly nothing more we hedge it round with ritual we beg angels to attend us and fence our work off from the outside world and the interference of the evil one but when it all comes down to cases it is nothing but intensely focused prayer god allows us to use our own strengths to accomplish some tasks and grants us his strength or that of his angels to accomplish those that are beyond our strength but we never force we only ask for these graces mascolis rabbity face took on a distinctly mulish look now if you can find me anywhere in scripture or holy writ a place where the faithful are told that only anointed priests may pray to god i beg you to show it to me that will certainly be a revelation to every christian alive or dead marco had only thought he was flushing before now a painful heat crept up his neck and over his face until it felt sunburned he couldnt counter the sibling and he knew it and brother mascoli knew that he had won the point at least he was gracious enough not to gloat about it just think about what ive said will you he asked you dont have to make any decisions right now just think about it and while youre at it think about all those poor creatures up and down the canals that i cant help because i havent the strength all right marco mumbled and when he got to his feet and shuffled out the door mascoli didnt stop him he had already told benito and maria that he was going to be late so he didnt go straight back instead he wandered the walkways and bridges trying to poke holes in brother mascolis argument if you took him at his word that all of the ritual and incantation of magic at least as a good christian would practice it leaving out all the invocations of heathen spirits and elves and whatnot was nothing but prayer then what he had been taught was dead wrong now mascoli could have lied of course he had every reason to lie he served the poor he needed help and here was marco who could give that help if he chose to but mascoli was if not a full priest certainly an avowed and oathbound sibling of hypatia if he liedwhich was after all a sinit was a worse thing than if marco lied and more especially if he lied about something like magic tempting marco into deep black sin marco twisted and turned the problem every which way and still came up with the same unpalatable answer that what hed been taught was wrong finally having worn out quite enough shoe leather he turned his steps back to caesares apartment and walked into yet another mess at least this time it was none of his doing when he opened the door maria all but ran into him only to choke off a muffled curse and half a sob when she saw that it was him in the doorway whats the matter he asked alarmed hes gone she said and fled up to the room she shared with caesare fortunately benito had been right behind her and filled in the rest caesare decided he was well enough t get up an off he went benito said grimly right after maria got back she couldn stop him no more could i an he wouldn tell us where he was goin when he was gonna get back nor what he was gonna do he just went it was right after he got some message just after dark and he took it with him so we dont know what it said marco realized immediately their concern for a man in caesares condition to leave the apartment was no source of worry in itself not so long as he was going to a tavern or taking a walk or anything except caesares business marco cleared his throat ah ah was he carrying yeah he took his sword said benito instantly answering the unfinished question oh hell marco said weakly caesare normally didnt carry any weapon but a poignard if id been here oh you couldn have done nothing with him neither benito asserted he was that set said that things was gone to hell with him laid up an that if something or other went wrong cause he wasnt there hed be in deep an off he went think was he shaky did he stagger lose his balance he asked desperately actually benito put in a moment of thought actually he looked pretty good kinda pale maybe but he moved all right we fed him good he just might get through this as long as he dont do something stupid more to the point something stupid that takes him too long to finish his strengths okay its justhe doesnt really understand i dont think that hes got little stamina left he took a deep breath then sighed ill go talk to maria he said and went resolutely up the stairs to the room where he heard cursing and sobs which might possibly be one of the bravest things hed ever done in his life chapter here away from the occasional smoky oilbrands in deep shadows where the moonlight did not penetrate it was pitch dark erik wished he had the eyes of the cat hed almost stumbled over the only light was the red lantern at the end of the alleyway obedient to his orders erik did his best to sing that would tell the waiting knights he was coming according to the family skald back home his singing was good for frightening seagulls well with any luck the waiting knights were tonedeaf as well as accustomed to repetition erik only knew one line of the song hed heard manfred caterwauling one evening it still made him redfaced even here alone in the darkness making as much raucous noise as he could within the limits of his straightlaced temperament erik staggered to the door he felt like a complete idiot certain that his playacting would fool no one who was not another complete idiot it was almost with relief that he reached the door of the red cat and started pounding upon it the worst that could happen to him now was an ambush which was something he knew how to handle the door swung open erik saw the back of the man who opened it receding into the darkness of the gloomy salon beyond and thought he recognized one of the brothels bouncers fortunately the man didnt seem to have recognized him he stepped through the door hastily and closed it behind him relieved that his ridiculous behavior was no longer subject to public scrutiny then he began following the bouncer toward the corridor on the other side of the salon after taking not more than two or three steps however erik suddenly realized that the redvelvetandbrocaded salon was much darker than the last time he just had time to understand that an ambush was in fact awaiting himand a far more ferocious one than sachs had impliedwhen someone stepped through a side door and flung an entire jug of coarse brandy over him momentarily blinded by the harsh liquor erik sprang toward the far corner of the salon avoiding whatever blow might be coming along next he heard the heavy door to the brothel being bolted and knew that at least one more man had come into the room his eyes cleared crouching in the cornerhis hatchet was already in handhe quickly scanned the room there were four of them and erik was not surprised at all to discover that he recognized not a one these men were not the brothel bouncers with whom he had clashed on his last visitalthough he could see the figure of the one bouncer who had let him in the door huddling in the far hallway almost cowering it seemed no these men were killers not bouncers professional criminals he suspected hired for the purpose they consisted of three swarthy stevedorebuilt men lightly jowled but not exactly fat and an athleticlooking palefaced blond and unlike last time when a cudgel had been the worst hed had to deal with this time three of the four had daggers the fourth the blond man had a sword just by the way he held the weapon erik knew he was skilled in its use the blond swordsman spoke make him scream boys the biggest of the lowbrowed solid bruisers moved in feinted in the way that an experienced street brawler does before striking his main blow he was obviously a bit disconcerted by eriks lefthandedness the contest of knife against hatchet was entirely onesided erik ignored the feint entirely and slashed the hatchet across the thugs empty hand which the man had carelessly extended a forefinger and half a thumb flipped through the air streaking blood the thug began to howl with pain the howl turned into a gasp of shock when the hatchet swung back and caught the knifehand at the wrist a thick fist still holding a dagger flew through the air and slapped wetly against the wall the mans gasp of shock an instant later gurgled into a death rattle eriks hatchet now held at the base of the blade had chopped straight through his throata short punch with a razoredged fist erik seized the dying thug with his free hand turned and flung him across the room with a hip roll the man crashed into his two companions and brought all three of them down to the floor erik kept movingfastheading for the blond swordsman he knew full well that was the truly dangerous one and hoped hed gained enough time to deal with him before the two surviving bravos could jump him from behind if not he had time for a quick prayer that manfreds mailshirt was as good as the breton prince claimed he might well need it to guard his back the blond swordsman was caught by surprise both by the speed with which erik had killed the first thug and his instant attack on him still he was a cool one he ducked under the first whistling hatchet blow and lunged erik managed to parry with the hatchets wirebound shaft the swordsman made an excellent recovery before erik could riposte once again he pressed the attack this was no amateur swordsman the blond didnt seem in the least confused by the fact that erik fought lefthanded his sword skittered on the hatchet handle as he beat back the young knight with the greater reach afforded by the sword and the blonds obvious level of skill erik knew that he was in severe trouble even if the other two did not intervene there was certainly no chance he could finish the blond assailant before the other two were back in action in fact he wondered why they werent back in action he risked a quick glance and immediately saw the reason manfred you idiot grinning cheerfully manfred had both of the remaining thugs in his fists practically holding them up off the ground then he began slamming them together like a gleeful boy might pound cymbals if he was carrying a weapon manfred showed no inclination to use it cursing bitterly erik parried another sword thrust the curse was aimed as much at manfreds recklessness as it was at the damnable expertise of his opponent he should have guessed of course the young breton knightsquire had made no mention of his intention of being here if necessary erik would have taken him to abbot sachs to prevent it manfred knew that he also had a habit of getting his own way erik snatched at a curtainripping it off its rail if he could get that wrapped around his left hand the blond swordsman chose that moment to close erik dropped the curtain and grabbed his opponents arm staggering him the bare arm was hot as the man twisted away eriks hatchet slashed across fine linen first blood spilled but it was anything but over the swordsman still had the advantage a feint and a fleche and erik was on the defensive he caught his foot in the carpet as he dodged away the swordpoint hit his side the koboldwerk links didnt give but erik lost his footing falling backwards over the body of the first thug the blond man rushed forward for the coup de grace as he did so erik saw manfred lift one thug and with a huge grunt fling him at the swordsman the blond ducked but was still knocked sideways by a flailing foot then was forced to duck again to avoid the other thug whom manfred heaved at him erik was impressed with the mans agilitythe more so since judging from that one touch he was suffering from illness id hate to see what hes like when hes well and then there was an outburst of shouts and whistles and the sound of rattles from outside schiopettieri bellowed someone open up in the name of the signori di notte and the doge of venice the assault on the heavy door showed they werent waiting for it to be opened by the shouting and female shrieks theyd already made entry by the waterdoor the blond man stooped quickly hefted the two thugs onto their feet and darted down the short hallway toward the door at the other end with much less agility almost stumbling they began to follow him then one of them stopped and stared back his heavy face creased with emotion alberto he cried weve got to erik heard the snarling voice of the blond swordsman roll down the hallway hes dead you fool come on a moment later all three men were gone the door slammed shut behind them manfred hauled erik to his feet erik shook his head i should have guessed youd come here how am i going to explain your presence here to abbot sachs manfred smiled grimly you wont have to those are schiopettieri not knights since when do knights sound rattles eriks eyes narrowed do you know any other way out of here he looked at the side door from which one of thugs had emerged to toss the liquor over him but saw at once that it led only to a closet manfred shook his head get thrown out or leave after paying your shot either here or by the waterdoor erik grimaced lets get out of this room anyway the schiopettieri might want us to explain why were sharing this salon with a dead body that way manfred pointed to the door at the end of the hallway the ambushers had used for their escape leads upstairs maybe we can find a balcony or something to jump from the staircase began just behind the door to the left they began running up it three steps at a time erik in the lead he still had the hatchet in his hand his eyes scanning ahead to watch for another ambush he didnt expect one though since he was almost certain the blond swordsman and his two surviving companions had no further purpose beyond making their own escape they had just made the second landing in the winding staircase when they heard the street door burst open erik grabbed manfreds arm and stopped him gesturing for silence from below came a voice of authority wearing a white surcoat with three red crosses on it he must be taken kill him if you must manfred pulled a wry face some goddamned ambush he muttered it looks like you were the target he went up the stairs cried another voice from below must be the bouncer whispered erik manfred shook his head i put the bastard to sleep first come on give me a hand with this couch the couch was a venerable piece of furniture either it had been intended for some unusual antics in a higher bedroom before its carriers had been defeated either by its weight or the angle of the stairs or it was for elderly patrons who needed to lie down before going on to visit the delights on higher floors it was solid and heavy and made of some exotic black wood that erik did not recognize this was venice strange things found their way here even wood the couch was about six cubits long and must have weighed at least four hundredweight even with manfreds oxlike strength lifting it was not easy they struggled to raise it above the banisters on the other hand the bunch of arquebusarmed men who came running up the stairs were unable to resist it as it came hurtling down at them neither was the wooden staircase up to this sort of treatment it splintered amid the thunder of gunfire the shoutingand screamingof men and the partial collapse of the staircase erik and manfred fled upwards again there are other stairs panted manfred stone ones theyll cut us off up those erik pointed take that next passage any room and a window if need be well break our way into the next house corner room give us two sides they legged it down the passage ripped open the door and erik suddenly remembered just where he was in a notorious venetian brothel the woman on the bed languorously raised herself up her very voluptuous self she tilted her head and twitched full red red lips into an easy provocative smile two of you she had an ornately arranged head of auburnred hair and pale olive skin she wore a string of goldnetted millefiori beads that was all she wore so the skin was very obvious despite the circumstances erik found himself staring at the almondskin color of the broad areolar rings around her nipples like a snakehypnotized rabbit his eyes were drawn down instinctively until he wrenched them upward and away with a tremendous force of will she in turn stared thoughtfully at the three red crosses on his surcoat manfred shut the door hastily behind them he had no trouble looking at her your friend seems a little shy there was amusement in her rich contralto voice manfred snorted dont mind him demoiselle in fact dont mind us were just passing through demoiselle she chuckled most of my visitors are just passing through darling her accent was a little strange to erik despite his skill with languages not that he was interested right now in worrying about where she came from well we mean really passing through your room said manfred heading for the window if youd oblige us by not screaming about it ill come back for a longer and more generous visit when the fuss has died down oh the oh was aimed at the closeset steel bars in the window the woman laughed her laughter was low and cool much like her chuckle madame claudia doesnt like customers leavingor coming inwithout having to pass through her cash box in the background they could hear the distant sounds of the pursuit getting closer wed better get out there manfred said erik grimly heading for the door well have to try and fight our way out wait commanded the woman there is another way out youll just have to wait until the passage is empty she had inserted herself between erik and the door as effectivelyin his caseas a portcullis theyre likely to search said manfred unlike erik he had no problems looking at her or at picking her up and moving her her means of thwarting him was to blow a kiss at him i think i can hide you for few minutes for a she broke off as if shed reached a sudden decision never mind she looked appraisingly at erik and then turned to manfred you and especially your shy friend present me with something of a challenge she laughed wickedly come on big boys both of you get those clothes off there must be twenty of them out there ill go said erik hastily theyre only looking for me manfred grabbed him dont be a fool erik the demoiselle is right if there are two of usah occupied with hertheyre likely to look elsewhere come on erik get them off especially that surcoat the woman began expertly removing the horrified eriks trousers i have some wigs some of my clients like a little masquerade and youd better call me francesca as charming as demoiselle is my clients do know my name looking up at manfreds hairy thighs standing over him was erik decided the best view from a moral standpoint even if it was not attractive in any other sense he couldnt just close his eyes when a murderous bunch might burst in on him at any moment not with him trapped in this position with francescas silky thighs straddled over himmuscular thighs for all the soft smoothness of her skinif he looked forward his view was of large naked breasts better to look at manfred even if large hairy the situation was grotesque especially because manfred and francesca didnt share any of his own sense of modesty he couldnt quite see just what francesca was doing with manfred but the noise didnt leave much to the imagination and she didnt have to roll her hips on him like that it wasnt as if he could do anything when the schiopettieri captain wrenched open the door moments later he was greeted with the sight of three naked people on the bed indulging in what his wife would have called unnatural acts that he himself would fantasize about for weeks thereafter the slimmer darkhaired fellow who was being straddled was plainly putting in a tremendous effort to judge by his bright red face francesca removed part of her oxlike clients anatomy from her mouth were busy luigi youll have to come back later she said lazily the schiopettieri captain shut the door hastily give it a minute and i think you can leave unless youd like to finish off also she added coquettishly tickling the hastily dressing and redfaced erik in the ribs nothing erikd like more said manfred smothering a guffaw but im afraid weve got to go just how do we get out of here she took a key from the drawer i was in a house that caught fire once since then i have always made sure i had a way out there is a door at the end of the passage with a hoistbeam for bringing furniture up from the canal ah going to be a splashy wet landing you dont want to drink this canal water if you can help it erik said manfred francesca smiled lazily at him youd make an even bigger splash than i would wait a moment i have some rope manfred nodded sounds good beats jumping erik wondered why there would be rope in such a room then seeing the paraphernalia in the closet from which francesca withdrew the rope found himself blushing more fiercely he had never seen such things although he had heard of them but by now erik had finished dressing and the relief of being no longer unclothed brought back his usual calm he turned to the stillnaked francesca carefully looking only at her face will you be all right should we take you with us francesca shuddered three stories when the buildings not burning no thank you im not planning on staying in this establishment much longer anyway but when i do leave i will use more conventional means i am certainly not built for the climbing of ropes her smile widened to a grin my strength is in my legs i shall use them to walk out of the front door quite soon in fact this house does not have sufficient cachet for someone of my talents shall we say i have no intention of remaining a mere brothel puttana although it has taken me a while to gather resources now i shall move to the casa louise she chucked his chin just remember that you owe me a favor and now get out of here before luigi comes back they slid down into the darkness it was just as well they hadnt jumped thought erik when he dropped lightly off the end of the rope he found not water but the deck of a vessel the boatman who had been waiting for the schiopettieri didnt expect the prisoner to land on his boat not at least when that prisoner was armed and unescorted except for an even larger friend but with eriks algonquian war hatchet at his throat he wasnt going to argue about taking them away from there they left him tied up in his own boat on the edge of the grand canal a hundred yards away from the imperial embassy manfred looked back with regret you know that francesca had a certain something erik shuddered she had a great deal of everything but still i owe her a debt i owe her said manfred shaking his head that sort of thing doesnt come for free thats a mercenary profession if there ever was one even ladies of that stamp must have kindly impulses said erik stiffly manfred pulled a wry face despite being five years younger than erik he knew a great deal more about whores he remembered the look on francescas face when shed first seen eriks surcoat it had been calculating the knights were all at least minor aristocracy many were confreres merely serving a threeyear novitiate he would certainly not put it past that worldlywise woman to know that hed already prepared himself for a hasty argument on price when shed suggested hiding them until she suddenly changed her mind or thought of something else a few moments of eriks reactions to a naked woman would have convinced the stupidest harlot that this one was a pure young knight francescad been very speculative very suddenly manfred gave a low chuckle he could see that perhaps hed have to protect erik against predatory female wiles well it might not be unpleasant yep maybe she did was all he said i will have to reward her said erik slowly mary magdalen too oh i think shell be happy enough with a few ducats said manfred calmly with an ease he didnt feel in the moonlight erik looked doubtful do you really think so i mean it was an act of great vvvirtue he stammered manfred swallowed his amusement only erik could describe a harlot performing fellatio on one man while straddling another as virtue and believe it too for all the icelanders ferocious skill in combat he was an innocent country boy in so many other ways im sure he agreed cheerfully and i think abbot sachs will be surprised to see you back unharmed erik shrugged maybe it was just some kind of mixup thatll be his story growled manfred with courthoned wisdom far beyond his years chapter well that was certainly interesting francesca pulled on an openfronted robe in case someone came back tied it around her waist with a tasseled cord and shook out her hair then she turned to the ewer and basin on the top of the table across the room where it wouldnt be knocked over in a moment of passion she rinsed her mouth with herbscented water and spat it into the basin and why did i do that anyway it was not an idle question francesca had reacted to the situation based on reflex because there had been no time to think things through carefully but her reflexes had been honed by a perilous life and she had come to trust them now that it was over and she did have a chance to think she probed her memory to discover what twisted chain of logic had led her almost without conscious thought to behave in a way that she would normally have not most certainly not if men wanted her favors they could damn well pay for them she was no silly maiden to rescue a handsome man from danger without good reasonmuch less two of them neither of whom was really that handsome anyway a pair of knots ambushed by the schoppies and not just any pair of knots either whoever arranged this particular episode either had no idea what kind of a mess he would createor intended to i wonder which she picked up the wooden comb from beside the basin and ran it through her hair walking back to the bed as she did so francesca had not come from the streets before her familys ruination they had been skilled players in the subtle and deadly intrigue which was the principal sport of aquitaines aristocracy her father had trained her in the political and diplomatic arts as thoroughly as her mother had trained her in other ways so a mind far better educated than anyone would have expected to find in that brothel worked at the problem while she sat on the edge of the bed and combed her hair she had known of course from the moment she saw the two men that they were what her motheras chauvinistic as any aquitainewould have called disdainfully etrangers the embarrassed blond was too fair to be prussian or austrian and his companion had called him erik he could only be a norse of some kind and that was odd because there were very few norse in the knots the christian norse who belonged to the holy roman empire were danes and the danes were rivals of the knights of the holy trinity in the baltic the other christian branch of scandinavia were the icelanders and their various offshootsbut they gave their allegiance to the league of armagh not the holy roman emperor except her eyes widened like a flash her mind focused on the other of the two menthe very large and square one very large she remembered with some amusement and in all respects but he hadnt been rough at all so she didnt hold it against him he had spoken with a pronounced breton accentunmistakable to one born and bred as francesca had been in the aquitaine and his name was manfred his companion erik had used it once her eyes widened still further manfred of brittany the manfred of brittany is it possible hairbrushing was too sedate francesca set down the comb got to her feet and began pacing slowly about her quick mind raced tracing the connections nephew of the emperor probably second in line to the throne third in line for a certainty still a just a youth hed be bit of a rakehell supposedly what would charles fredrik do with such an imperial scion of course its practically a tradition now with the hohenstauffens back and forth back and forth her bare feet made no sound on the floor that too her mother had taught her noise is something you make to please a man when it suits your purpose otherwisemove silently yes it all made sense charles fredrik would have reached beyond the empire altogether called in that ancient clan favor brought in someone who could be trusted in such a matter have no ties or links to the complex web of imperial politics and also be quite capable of she winced slightly remembering the noise that had erupted earlier from the entry salon downstairs those fools they might as well have tried trapping a tiger with a fishnet she was sure of it now the two men she had rescued were an imperial princemanfred of brittanyand his icelandic bodyguard then remembering kats description of her frightening encounter with the knights in the church two weeks earlier francesca began laughing softly kat had not mentioned the name of either of the knights who had come to her defense on that occasion but she had described them her description of course had borne precious little resemblance to the two men francesca had just finished entertaining in her room granted manfred was very big but he was not a giant norhere francescas laugh almost gurgledhad the shy and redfaced erik seemed quite the nordic werewolf that kat depicted still thinking about it francesca could well believe that those two young menespecially erikcould be utterly terrifying under different circumstances judging from the sounds she had heard coming from below earlier that evening a number of wouldbe ambushers had certainly found them so she had not however and now that she was certain of their identity francesca found herself strangely delighted by the entire episode she had chosen to rescue the two men out of halfconscious calculation true but kats a friend of mine so i suppose i owed those two boys a favor anyway notagain the little gurgling laughthat erik seemed to enjoy it much even if manfred certainly did the laugh died away favors were favors true but selfinterest remained where was the benefit to her in this thing this called for more leisurely reasoning once again francesca resumed her seat on the bed and went back to combing her hair she began by examining the ambush she hadnt seen it of course but she didnt need to she had seen the key piece of evidenceeriks naked body completely unmarked by any wound whoever set that trap had no idea what kind of ferocious prey would be walking into it which meant they were quite unaware of the true identity of erik and manfred whatever had been the purpose of the ambush it had been aimed at twoor perhaps only onejunior members of the militant order not an imperial prince and his special companion that ruled out any of the venetian factions immediately neither the metropolitans nor the montagnards would have any reason to ambush ordinary knights not in such an elaborate manner at any rate in a wellknown brothel where there was bound to be a risk of capture by the schiopettieri if either of the factions had a quarrel to settle with a common knight they would have stabbed him in the streets a quick thrust from a doorway followed by easy escape through crooked alleys in the dark then why had the schiopettieri shown up so quickly that was completely atypical to have gotten here so quickly the schiopettieri had to have been forewarnedsuborned in fact and whoever could wield that much influence would hardly have done it for the petty purpose of killing or injuring a simple knight nor again was it something either the montagnards or the metropolitans would have done anyway not for their own purposes at any rate it was conceivable one of them might have done so as a favor to an ally or for pay what ally or paymaster not any of the powers within official venice for a certainty the last thing official venice wanted was any cause for quarrel with the holy roman emperor charles fredrik was a grim and dangerous man to have ruling the most powerful realm in europe especially one which was almost a neighbor of the island republic butunlike some emperors of the past charles fredrik was not given to grandiose ambitions he was not a conqueror by temperament despite occasional frictions venice had gotten along quite well with the empire since charles fredrik came to the throne all things considered it would be sheer insanity for the venetian oligarchy to attack the emperors nephew all of which led francesca to one inescapable conclusion she set down the comb folded her hands in her lap and stared sightlessly at the far wall of her room whoever was behind that ambush and whatever the reason it was someone whose motives were imperial or aimed at the empire thiswhatever it isgoes far beyond petty venetian squabbling she made no attempt to pursue that train of thought any further she lacked sufficient information instead she considered another question so was it a blunder a piece of idiocy or a calculated attempt to throw a tremendously big boulder into the already roiling pool of venetian politics at present for purposes which go quite beyond venice itself after a minute or so she set that question aside also again she simply lacked the necessary information to make any kind of intelligent assessment that left her with the final and most important question so what do i do pursue this any further or leave it be the answer to that question came almost as fast as the question itself if shed had any intention of not pursuing it her welltrained reflexes wouldnt have led her to assist the two men in the first place and as always francesca trusted her reflexes for a rare moment francesca allowed herself a sheer grin not a seductive smile but a true baring of the teeth with unrestrained glee what a grand game this would be the grin faded quickly enough she was neither rash by temperament nor certainly by training patience had been drilled into her as a small girl for the time being meddling with this immediately or directly would make me a dangerous woman i think i would rather not be dangerous at the moment when i have my own pot to stir there was still a lot of noise and todo going on in the rest of the house good shed intended to leave very soon anyway now that katerina had provided her with the last things she needed francesca had planned to wait a day or two more but no tonight would be ideal once everything was sorted out and the appropriate bribes paidthis time to the madame of the red cat for a wonder and not from herthings would be very quiet the other girls would be upset especially the young and notsoexperienced ones the servants would be nursing bruised bodies and illtempers and since by now the word had spread all up and down the grand canal that the red cat had been descended upon by the schoppies in force customers would be thin on the ground tonight tomorrow of course theyd be thick as fleas on a feral cat wanting to know what happened but not tonight tonight in a hour or so she could envelope herself in a cloak and walk out without anyone noticing fernando the aged servant who usually saw to the needs of the girls on this floor stuck his head into the room without knockingas usual francescaare you all right he asked she pouted i am but my customers werent happy i only finished one off and i suspect they sneaked out without paying there were twoa big circassian and a little moor there now if anyone thinks to connect me with manfred and his keeper theyll be disabused of the notion i doubt the captain was paying attention to complexions and hair colors other than mine fernando frowned fiercely half the house sneaked out without paying i hope madame soaks those schoppies good he withdrew and shut the door francesca laughed softly to herself she waited still as a statue her hands folded in her lap while the house settled eventually except for the murmur of distant talking and the hysterical sobbing of some girl too overset to be comforted it did francesca bound her hair into a net to keep it in order until she could put it up properly and got out the package that kat had brought her early this afternoon putting the latch on the door just in case if anyone tried it let them think she was having a case of the vapors herself just as well that she was already naked under the robe because she was about to go up several steps in the world sartorially speaking and the transformation would have to be from the skin outward staring with perfumed oil none of this had been cheap but it was all necessary just as the red cat would turn away a mere putta who came calling at the door so casa louise would turn away a whore from the red cat silk hose silk knitted hose which clung to the leg as mere cutandsewn hose couldnt silk shifts three of them as fine as cobweb and trimmed with lace undergown of silksatin once white but redyed in ochrenot new but no one would ever know that unless they got their noses within an inch of the seams overgown also not new but very very cleverly put together from two donor gowns one of which was the source of the embroidery the other of the foundation fabricsilkandlinen twill in a rich redyed brown now how am i going to use this little entertainment its too soon to throw any netsand too dangerousbut a bit of bait young manfred was very much attracted to her of that she was quite certain but would he remember where she had told him she was going probably not he did not strike her as the kind of young man who would remember such things sohow to remind him it was as she was tying the embroidered girdle just under her breasts that it came to her and she laughed of course she would send him a short length of perfumed rope with a card saying only casa louise she would pay a messenger to see that it went only into manfreds hands he must go outside of the chapter house and the imperial embassy sometime the sobbing had stopped the buzz of conversation increased good time to go she gathered all that she wanted to take with her in a very small bag she hadnt wasted any of her earningsuntil nowon cosmetics or clothing as the other girls did but her savingsexcept for enough to take her to her new homewerent here they were on deposit with a goldsmith so the cosmetics and hair ornaments and jewelry all fitted into a very small bag she left her robe lying on the floor with her two dresses some other girl could have it and welcome she flung over her splendid gown the cloak that had come wrapped around the dress and the restthe plain side a dark tabbyweave linen that no one here would look twice at she drew the hood over her head and slipped out the door the doorman was gonenursing a bruised and possibly broken skull she suspected there had been no one in the madames room either luck smiled upon her tonight she did have to walk a little and this was the most hazardous part of the undertakingfootpads toughs she was fair game for anyone who saw herbut they too had been frightened out of the area along with the gondoliers when she finally found one free and flagged him to the side of the canal she was far enough away from the red cat that no one was likely to connect her to the place casa louise dont hurry she ordered the gondolier she drew the curtains around the tiny cabin but did not blow out the lamp for she was going to need itand every moment it would take to get to casa louise by the time the boat nosed into the mooring at this most prestigious of houses francesca had completed her transformation her hair was now arranged as elegantly as that of any merchant princess twined with strings of lustrous glass and semiprecious beads held in place with bejeweled pins the careful use of cosmetics turned handsome features into something dramatic and the cloak now turned rightway around showed its true face of ochre velvet and gold cording when she drew back the curtains and the gondolier stooped to offer his hand to help her up his eyes widened in admiration he aided her onto the walkway and when he withdrew his hand there was a coin of sufficient worth in it to assure his satisfaction and silence casa louise unlike the red cat boasted a landing lit by lanterns with more lanterns on either side of the door and two footmen beneath each one the place was a welllit stage for very few of those who arrived here were reluctant to be seen francesca glided up to the footmen with practiced grace and studied aplomb francesca de chevreuse she told the righthand man taking up her new identity and name for the first time with immense satisfaction she did not have to add i am expected because he would already have been informed madonna the footman murmured and opened the door to the next stage of her life chapter as marco carefully dressed and bandaged the long slash on caesares shoulder he inspected their host caesare aldanto should still be abed he was definitely still pale and it wasnt just loss of blood from that cut still this wasnt the right time to ask how the man was feeling by the grim set of caesares jaw whatever had been going on when he acquired the wound hadnt gone well as caesares memoryman and scribe marco was still only privy to a small amount of caesares doings the former montagnard agent played things very close to his chest one of the things marco had realized quite fast in their relationship with caesare aldanto was that it was never wise to pry the man had an uncertain temper cornutto caesare swore watch what youre doing marco handed him the waiting glass of grappa sorry caesare but this is going to hurt youve got some dirt in there that needs to come out caesare tossed the brandy off make it quick then as marco was working maria came in through the front door as she turned to close it two heavyshouldered men bundled their way in behind her maria bit at the big hand that was clapped over her mouth and struggled vainly to reach for her knife her assailant clouted her hard we want to talk to him see now stop biting and you wont get hurt i told you never to come here caesares voice was icy there was no sign of fear in it marco felt in the bag for the comforting handle of the small sharp knife that caesare kept in with the dressings he knew full well who these two were you didnt mess around with the matteonis they were enforcers debt collectors and rentabeating boys he remembered how the crowd had parted around the three of them in barduccis hed asked valentina about them valentina had turned quietly to him pulling a wry face matteoni alberto stephano and luciano descended from a long proud line of barroom thugs and backalley stabbers claudia had snorted and this generation has sunk even lower stephano matteoni stalked forward albertos dead aldanto you mincha marco smiled wryly to himself well of course alberto would be dead if hed attacked caesare yeah luciano snarled you promised us the knightd be unarmed and unarmored marco swallowed this wasnt quite what he had envisaged he was well aware that the former montagnard agent dealt sometimes in deaths as well as in information but so far theyd had nothing to do with that part of caesares trade you fools snapped caesare he is a knight i told you hed be dangerous stephano had a big clumsy badly made handcannon in his hand calling it an arquebus would be stretching the point you said youd deal with any real trouble and caesare shook his head there were two of themnot one like i was told and the first one had that damned handaxe instead of being unarmed like he was supposed to be and he was wearing some kind of armor he blew out his breath then the schiopettieri arrived you promised wed be out of there before that interrupted luciano furiously things go wrong caesar shrugged then winced as the movement pulled at the cut now get the hell out of here before youre seen were not going until weve been paid said stephano sullenly marco felt his mouth fall open hed thought theyd come for revenge because their brother was dead they hadnt theyd come for money caesare stood up his eyes narrowed for what the man was supposed to be maimed in a brothelfight and apparently drunk when the schiopettieri arrived you failed and the schiopettieri failed too i dont pay for failure he added dangerously stephano backed off a step then he remembered the handcannon he steadied it aiming straight at caesares chest of course it might not go off this was one of the cheap firespell scroll ones they were notoriously unreliable but it might just work at this range he could hardly miss albertos dead he repeated grimly you owe us i owe you nothing orrichioni said caesare dismissively the jobs not done that means i dont get paid and you dont either and if you dont stop pointing that thing at caesare said benito from the stairlanding im going to have to blow you bastardos in half he had caesares arquebus resting on the handrail pointed straight at stephanos swelling belly the slowmatch far more reliable than a spell scroll smoked and fizzed im giving you to the count of five one his voice cracked but the muzzle of the arquebus was rock steady lucianos grip on maria must have slackened with the sudden intrusion of firepower maria bit savagely and broke away she didnt go far just far enough to pull her knife and hiss like an angry cat at luciano and if you pull that trigger stephano said marco producing the knife your surviving brother might have to explain to brunelli just what you were doing i think the schiopettieri would be glad to hang him this time luciano looked uneasy at the mention of the casa brunelli distinctly uneasy stephano sized the situation up all right were going but we want money aldanto we want money or well go straight to aleri aleri marco pricked his ears he knew that name well from his mothers montagnard days francesco aleri the milanese controller duke viscontis spymaster in venice caesare laughed easily unpleasantly you do that he wont pay you either now get out keep out of trouble and there may be work for you again open those mouths of yours and you can join alberto now go get dont ever come back here i dont know you they backed out like whipped curs marco felt the tension drain out of his shoulders you can put that knife away said caesare startled marco dropped it back into the bag sorry then he realized that caesare had actually been addressing maria looking at her stormy face marco realized that maybe hed been too hasty about relaxing the matteonis had been a minor danger comparatively how could you caesare matteoni figlio di una puttana theyre filth slavers they sell and make castrati to the east and they broke my cousin tonios fingers you know how a caulker with broken fingers finds work put the knife away maria i work with what i have to work with her response was to put the knife down on the table snatch a platter off it and fling it at his head it shattered against the wall behind him testa di cazzo if my cousins hear you work with the matteoni they dont never work for you again caesare picked a pottery fragment out of his hair his eyes blazed angrily in his pale face he snapped right back at her theyll damn well do what theyre told and youll keep your damned mouth shut to everyone about it bitch damn you to hell aldanto she snarled ill talk to who i want to talk to when i damn well want to benito up on the landing put the arquebus down carefully hed already snuffed the slowmatch he gestured to marco with his eyes and head marco nodded wideeyed and ducked as the next piece of crockery hit the wall with a quiet that was quite unnecessary above the shouting he headed to join benito moving for the door even the risk of lurking matteonis seemed less dangerous than staying in the relative quiet of barduccis marco turned to benito does that sort of thing happen often what the fights yes benito shrugged its happened a couple of times that i know of marias pretty quick to flare up they always patch it up after caesare needs her and shes crazy about him marco looked across the room angelina dorma and her case vecchie friends hadnt come in this evening barduccis was only one of the taverns they frequented quite frankly that crowd of hers worried him i thought caesare was too independent to feel like that about maria benito snorted into his wine he plays the field but carefully he needs marias cousins is rather what i meant oh marco let his curiosity get the better of him he thought of marias extended family of cousins even if she had no parents she had enough of those cousins to start a tribe a poor tribe though and not well the sort of people youd think would be of any value to caesare in his shadowy world most of them were just caulkers not even thugs like the matteoni brothers it was the poorest guild putting the outer planking and caulking on venices ships not for the life of him could he see why someone like caesarewith contacts like ricardo brunelliwould need to have anything to do with them why benito looked around the tavern come on big brother finish up im tired that girl youve been mooning over isnt in tonight if we take the long way back we should get back after the kissing and making up and with any luck after the sweeping up too marco drained his goblet he hadnt realized that benito was aware of his fascination with angelina dorma he felt a little embarrassed about it on the other hand he felt hed better find out what benito was talking about with marias cousins he owed caesare it was only right to take care of his business for him and he couldnt do that unless he knew what it was obviously his eternally curious brother had found out something equally obviously he wasnt going to tell marco here he stood up and stretched very well it must be well the other side of midnight anyway they followed benitos habitual upper route even after all these weeks in town and his frequent clambers after his brother marco would never possess half of benitos catlike surefootedness across the pantiles he would never have benitos love for high places either they stopped up against a chimney stack while marco caught his breath benito explained its a great scam a couple of marias cousins do the outer cladding at the arsenal theyve been hollowing out a section from the actual keel timber of the galleys then it is fitted with a cunningly made cover that you have to know exactly where to release the doges customs and excise officers will never find it you can only get to it from underwater oh well that was relatively innocuous everyone tried to evade the doges customs to a greater or lesser extent benito yawned come on lets get back they both approached caesares apartment rather nervously but all was quiet and someone had swept up most of the broken crockery chapter the next day caesare and maria were being very careful around each other but at least the worst of their fight seemed to be over one of marias cheeks was distinctly bruised but otherwise there was no obvious damage except a shortage of breakfast crockery that no one mentioned ive an errand for you marco said caesare carefully slicing a piece of frittata and placing it inside a flap of bread this evening before moonrise youd better go with him benito along that upper highway you boast about because i want this scroll delivered without anyone knowing but marco will go inside alone it was a sign of increasing trust marco knew up to now hed only taken messages to captain della tomassobenitos fence and a coast trader who added confidential message carrying to his quiver of expensive services this was a step up but he would have preferred it if benito werent involved the rooftops were slippery curled with mist the only light was that reflected up from windows and the occasional torches in the street below marco wished like hell he was down there roof climbing was difficult enough when you could see although it didnt seem to make much difference to benito but for all the inconvenience marco understood why they were going along the rooftops he understood at once the moment caesare had told him exactly where he was going the casa brunelli ricardo brunelli was caesares protector among venices upper crust he was a power in those elite ranks brunelli saw himself as the dogeinwaiting and there was no doubt that the information caesare had been able to furnish him about the montagnards and their adherents in venice had been valuable from a comment that maria had made marco was sure that caesare performed other services for the head of casa brunelli the whispered knowledge that caesare lay under the mantle of brunelli protection was a shield the former montagnard agent needed brunelli was a power in the metropolitan faction in venice even if he kept a public distance from it and although the metropolitans did not have quite as savage a reputation as the montagnards they had one savage enoughand theirs was the stronger of the two factions in neutral venice so long as caesare enjoyed brunellis favor the montagnards would steer clear of him revenge was not worth the risk of metropolitan retaliation brunelli shielded caesare just as caesares own mantle protected marco it was a precarious way to survive no wonder that caesare didnt want to go himself to casa brunelli with a scroll destined for someone other than ricardo to be kept secret from ricardo in fact for a guest at the casa well there it is benito pointed down at the glass windows of the casa brunelli across the canal marco could see the massive edifice which served the holy roman empire as its embassy in venice you stay up here said marco sternly dont try and peek ill be out presently benito shrugged huh cant see anything on the south side anyway unless i climb up the imperial embassy and i hear theyve got some of the knights of the holy trinity on watch on the roof just stay here repeated marco as he dropped off the guttering to a narrow rickety wooden outside loftstair it was only when he was close to the cobbled street that it occurred to him that benito knew more than was comfortable about watching the casa brunelli with a boldness he didnt feel he went up to the arched doorway and raised the heavy knocker before the hollow boom of it had even died away the door opened the liveried door warden looked disdainfully at marco yes he asked frostily i have a message began marco the doorwarden snorted messages for those in the casa brunelli are carried by the house messengers not by scruffy urchins the door began to swing closed for senor eneko lopezyour masters castilian guest said marco hastily putting a foot in the way and hoping that the heavy ironscrolled door would not simply crush it the heavy door stopped hes basque not castilian for some reason the point seemed important to the door warden from his slight accent marco suspected he was originally from spain but marco found italian politics confusing enough without wanting to know the quirks of the iberian variety i will have it taken to him the door warden added grudgingly marco shook his head no my master said i must give it into his very hands and carry his reply the doorman snorted again but he plainly did not want to anger his masters guest reluctantly he opened the door and allowed marco to enter watching marco as if he expected this cockroachinhumanform to instantly begin laying eggs or stealing the silver he tinkled a small bell a footman appeared hastily wiping his mouth with the back of his hand the door warden sniffed louis take this messenger up to senor lopez he says he is to wait for a reply the tone said and watch him like a hawk the footman led marco to the back stairs not for the likes of him the front steps they walked up four flights of illlit stairs and then were nearly knocked down them again by an extremely angry woman who was so busy looking back up that she failed to see them even in poor light she was a truly beautiful lady clad in a lowcut azure damasksilk gown trimmed with a jabot of finest venetian lace her hair was on the red side of auburn her skin except for flaming patches on her cheeks a perfect unblemished cream the footman nearly flung himself up the wall to get out of her way with a hasty terrified scusi marco pressed himself against the wall too she didnt say anything to either of them but her angry look promised retribution later marco was glad he wasnt the footman and that hed never have to encounter her again he had a feeling that despite her legendary beauty lucrezia brunelli and this could only be her would enjoy making someone elses life a misery and she looked mad enough about something to be looking for a victim shortly but even angry she was beautiful marco shook himself guiltily how could he think this of anyone but angelina they walked on to the upper floor the footman knocked i am at my devotions lucrezia said the voice from within the accent was distinctly foreign but the tone had a suggestion of tried patience the footman cleared his throat he gave marco a quelling look senor lopez it is i louis i have brought a messenger to see you my apologies bring him in louis marco found himself bowed into the presence of a short slightly built man who was carefully placing a marker in a book he too had reddish hair for a moment marco found himself wondering why the woman who was considered to be the reigning beauty of venice should interest herself in this man then eneko lopez turned and limped toward him and marco realized what attracted lucrezia brunelli to this foreigner power there were the eyes of an eagle under that solid heavy single line of dark brow even without a word spoken between them marco knew this to be a man in whom the fires of spirit burned high and by his calm assurance someone to whom command was almost inborn thank you louis that will be all the footman bowed respectfully and left you have come from mainz or from the grand metropolitan the basque held out his hand to take the scroll marco swallowed and passed over the scroll neither sir my master is here in venice he said i must wait and take a reply lopez sighed i had hoped never mind all things will come to pass eventually sit so marco sat down the guest of brunellis occupied a room that filled him with envy it was full of books leatherbound volumes on volumes marco gazed hungrily at them in the meantime lopez had taken his own seat at a small desk nearby he cracked the seal and scanned the contents of the scroll when he finally spoke his voice was cold you may tell your master that i am neither prey for blackmail nor interested in treachery he misinterprets my work here on the rio del ghetto as he does my messages to rome marco rose hastily rio del ghetto where the magicians sold their charms and wares where the jews were supposed to remain although in tolerant venice that practice was widely ignored very close to where he and benito had shared lodgings rome well the grand metropolitan was not overly enamored with venices religious health if father del igilo was to be believed but this was no time for debate yes signor was all he said as marco turned to leave the basque rose from the desk and said grimly stop since you chose to come here i will have a few words with you as well marco froze i ddidnt choose anything sir my master how old are you demanded lopez ssixteen old enough not to think like a boy any longer what is your name the mans force of personality was too great to resist marco sir uh marcoahfelluci the basque snorted felluci i doubt it but if you chose a false surnamechose young marcothen you need to give a thought to all your choices at sixteen you can no longer use the excuse of being a boy you are a man now and a man chooses his own masters marco said nothing lopez sighed not a man yet it seems very well he resumed his seat and turned his face away studying a document on the desk when you do decide to become a man marcowhosaysheisfelluci i advise you to find another master this one walks a path to ruin if you continue to follow him you will share his fate the footman was lurking outside the door he saw marco off the premises with no comments but a tight set to his face well thought marco at least he was being shown out and didnt have to deal with lucrezia brunelli in a foul mood benito was loitering in the street i thought you were going to stay on the roof said marco when benito joined him came down to meet you how did you know marco sighed never mind youve been peering in windows again havent you youd do this side of caesares business much better than i can benito shuddered believe me brother this was one time i was really glad it was you thats a scary guy ive seen him before that time when never mind now come on lets climb up there and get moving if you still want to drop in at barduccis tonight marco thought of angelina the thought was enough to get him moving up to the slippery coppo tiles benito was already walking up the rickety stairs that had given them such an easy descent the roof was an easy jump and haul from there marco sighed it wasnt the roof walking as much as the looking down that worried him benito peered over the roof edge theyd have to descend here again then he put out a hand to stop marco there were two people coming out of a sotoportego into the broad calle dei fabbri below to discourage cutpurses and cutthroats there were oil lamps burning in niches there you could see the two men clearly just for a moment they were both tall and one of them very large the large one was darkhaired the other blond the darkhaired man moved with a sort of solid determination the blond with catlike grace knights of the holy trinity even if theyre not in uniform whispered benito i saw both of them his voice trailed off an errant nightbreeze stirred the mist and brought a snatch of conversation up from below shouldnt have come this is my affair manfred a snort i think i owe her more for services than you do erik the two stopped outside a building with long moorishstyle arched windows and knocked benito gave a low whistle well well well who would have thought it he chuckled so much for their holiness marco looked it seemed a fairly innocuous if moderately welltodo threestory building what is it benito looked startled sorry i forget that you lived in the marshes for so long thats the casa louise its um a place where wealthy merchants and some of the case vecchie maintain their mistresses i guess you could call it a bordello but its as highclass as it gets benito studied the two knights below squinting a bit its funny though i wouldna thought knightsnot that young anywaycouldve afforded the women in this place marco shook his head his brothers knowledge of vice worried him he supposed that having lived in town for all these years the boy would have more knowledge of things like that than he did chapter oh my kat stood in the doorway wideeyed at the sight of francescas new suite of rooms francesca smiled wryly dont be too impressed my dear she said remember how this is all paid for my five current patrons are all over fifty two are fat one is bald and has a nose the size of a melon and the last poor man needs she considered for a moment how to phrase what she wanted to say delicately a great deal of encouragement to achieve his desires kat blushed a charming color of pink francescas smile widened however things may be on the verge of improvement in one respect at least do you recall that very large knight who was one of your rescuers at the church seeing kats nod francesca cheerfully related the incident where she had provided manfred and erik with a means of escape from an ambushsparing no details at all kat blushed a charming color of scarlet francesca laughed dont be so innocent that young knight certainly isntthe large young one i mean in fact he and his blond friend visited just yesterday evening to tender their thanks they said which i have no doubt is all the blond one intended but not large young manfred her smile was now almost seraphic so i do believe i shall be acquiring a new patron and very soon hell tire me out more of course but itll still be a nice change of pace kats blush was beginning to fade all the faster as her face was creased by a frown of puzzlement i wouldnt have thought that a young knight could afford you in the first place even if she stumbled over the next words trying to avoid offense even if his morals were scandalous for someone supposedly devoted to holy orders finished francesca grinning such an innocent kat one of my existing patrons is quite highranked in the churchand no temporary confrere knight either the grin faded and francesca looked away as for the other id just as soon not talk about it better for you also if i dont girl trust me just remember that confrere knights whatever their current state are often young men from the elite of the empire so a large purse is not really that surprising large enough at leastwaving her hand aboutfor these purposes she shook her head but enough of that i am really so glad that you accepted my invitation francesca continued merrily my afternoon is entirely free today as it happens i made certain of it she gestured at the sofa chaise and chairs inviting kat to take her choice among them kat gingerly took a seat on the sofa which betrayed her with its softness as it was intended to do drawing her into a cushioned embrace kat resisted for a moment then wearing a sheepish smile allowed the sofa to have its way with her francesca reclined on the chaise which bore more than a passing resemblance to an ancient roman diningcouch not only was it an attractive pose it was supremely comfortable help yourself to the fruit next to you by the way she offered if you dont it will only spoilone of my admirers sends it every day far more than i can eat evidently his last inamorata had the appetite of an elephant as kat reached for a grape she continued ive already taken some measures to protect you if your personal situation becomes worse i spoke to the madame about having a house gondola although she doesnt believe we need one yet francesca emphasized the yet she agrees that we could use a very discreet courier for various errands which could include patrons who for one reason or another would rather not make use of public boats or their own and she also agrees that i will soon need a private gondolier of my own in any event it wouldnt pay a great deal but kat let out a sigh it would enable me to survive whatever else she tried to look on the bright side if nothing else itd be safer than what im doing now no ones going to pester case vecchie in a gondola or a courtesan going to visit one discreetly that was my thought also althoughanother grini saw no reason to mention your current activities to the madame youd probably want to wear a mask of course since i imagine youd want to keep your identity secret from other case vecchie most of all since yours is one of the four oldest houses she paused for a moment allowing kat to absorb the fact that francesca had learned she was montescue but kat was neither surprised nor worried shed realized very soon after meeting francesca that the courtesan was far too intelligent for kat to be able to keep her family identity a secret from the woman for very long and perhaps oddly given francescas selfadmitted say better selfproclaimed mercenary nature kat was not worried about betrayal for reasons she could not pinpoint but didnt doubt at all she knew francesca could be trusted completely in this matter at least if no other so she simply returned francescas gaze with a level one of her own and then slowly smiled francescas face softened her eyes even seemed to acquirejust for an instanta slight film of moisture thank you for that kat she said very softly friendship does not come often to a courtesan we treasure it all the more for its rarity but her gaiety returned immediately and nowenough of all this gloomy business lets look to a brighter future information i promised you information i have thats really why i asked you to come here so lets trade gossip gossip kat asked incredulously francesca laughed when women talk its called gossip when men do it its called information in either case its an exchange that could profit one or both of the parties that was our arrangement wasnt it i suppose kat looked dubious now and francesca shook her head believe me dear men are far worse at holding their tongues in the presence of a woman than a woman is in the presence of anyone i may know something that you can turn to profit that i can reveal without breaking confidences but lets start with you whats the current news down on the water when they were done perhaps two hours later francesca was no longer smiling none of this is good kat although im glad youll be able to turn some of my tidbits of information to profitable use but somethings deeply wrong something she hesitated groping for words good times and bad times shrugged kat the world is like that certainly venice francesca shook her head quite forcefully this is more than simply bad times somethingsomeoneis deliberately making things as bad as possible kat frowned why do you think that and why would anyone want to do it before francesca could answer kat made a little waving motion with her hand forestalling objections oh sureduke visconti wishes venice all the ill in the world but even he has nothing to gain by creating turmoil in the city no matter how desperate venetians ever got the last thing theyd accept is milanese intervention in our affairs the courtesan sitting across from her lifted herself up from the chaise and began pacing about slowly kat was struck by how silently she moved intervention no but what if the purpose wasnt intervention what if it was simplydestruction and what would be the point of that cried kat if milan tried to destroy venicewhich they couldnt do anywaywere an island and our fleet is far more powerful than anything they could muster her words were coming in a rush it was francescas turn to wave down an objection not milan kat not at least as anything but a tool i was thinking of lithuania kats face went completely blank she stared at francesca for a moment as if she had suddenly found herself confronted by a raving lunatic seeing the expression francesca chuckled im quite sane i assure you yes kat the grand duchy of lithuania and poland is very far from venice and has no common border with it no apparent source for mutual conflict she shrugged not even the commercial rivalry which periodically agitates the hungarians and the genoese and the greeks in constantinople exactly so why in the world who is the great rival of lithuania kat interrupted francesca the holy roman empire of course precisely and what will happen if venice is destroyed who will fill the sudden power vacuum in northern italy and the adriatic not milan kat stared at her then slowly remembering things her fatherand even more her grandfatherhad told her in times past things dottore marina had told her also now that she thought upon it her face began to pale francesca made a most unfeminine grunt precisely grand duke jagiellons reputation for insensate brutality is wellearned girl but dont be fooled by it he is also a consummate manipulator a man who prefers to let others bleed themselves to death if at all possible kat spoke in a whisper if venice is destroyed the holy roman emperor will have no choice if he doesnt come in the hungarians surely will andand and charles fredrik with lithuania and the borderlands to deal with already cannot also afford to see a more powerful kingdom of hungaryespecially not one with a toehold in italy especially not with a man on the throne like emeric who doesnt quite have jagiellons reputationoutside of hungary that isbut comes in a very close second thered be war between the empire and hungary francesca nodded for a certainty withfor a certaintymilan and rome sucked into the vortex as well genoa also be sure of itsoon enough the greeks as well she resumed her slow silent pacing ever since he took the throne one of charles fredriks policies has been to stay out of italian affairs hes resistedharshly at timesevery attempt of the montagnards to drag him into this morass of endless bickering the po pisshole hes been known to call it despite her own mild reflex of italian chauvinism kat couldnt help but laugh a little at the crude expression and admit privately at least that there was some justice to the barb it was a fact that italiansnorthern italians especiallywere prone to endless and ultimately futile feuds and vendettas had not her own beloved grandpapa an otherwise sane and even kindly man been obsessed for years with his feud against the valdostas a house which no longer even existed except in vague rumors and her grandfathers heated imagination what can we do francesca francesca shrugged us nothing you must tend to the affairs of casa montescue i can think of few things which would be better for venice than to have that house back on its feet again me she chuckled im just a very fancy whore girl she spread her arms wide in a gesture of helplessness do i look like the emperor of the holy roman empire kat sighed no then giggled a little ive never met him but i dont think hes got your cleavage the emperors cleavage at that moment was quite invisible covered as it was not only by the thick velvet of his imperial robes of office but by his own thick hands clasped and folded across his chest as he listened to his adviser baron trolliger came to the last item on the agenda oh yes he sighed that obnoxious father francis is still pestering you for another audience i assume youll want to me brush him off again hes seen you once already thats more than enough for the demands of courtesy irritating man ill tell him send him in interrupted the emperor trolliger stared at him hes just a priest your majesty not even from what i can tell one in the good graces of rome hes certainly not an official emissary from the grand metropolitan charles fredriks lips twisted into a wry smile i should think not given his purpose here i rather imagine the grand metropolitan has been tempted more than once to strangle himeven more so the father lopez from whom father francis takes his directions the look of surprise vanished from trolligers face replaced by impassivity for all that the baron was one of the emperors closest advisers and agents he knew full well that there were matters which charles fredrik chose not to discuss with him this mysterious business of giving an obscure and apparently unimportant priest another private audience was obviously one of them as you command majesty trolliger rose from his chair and began making for the door the emperor stopped him id just as soon you were here for this audience hans have a servant bring the man the baron cocked an eye at the emperor then sighed i suppose this means ill be traveling soon charles fredrik smiled and spread his hands in a gesture which expressed in part uncertainty but which mostly expressed irony at the complicated world of political intrigue most likely trolliger managed more or less not to scowl an hour later after father francis had come and gone the baron was making no effort at all to keep his scowl hidden its insane your majesty what these lunatics propose amounts to creating a petrine version of the servants of the holy trinity as if the servants arent enough grief already and thenthenthey want your permission to operate freely in imperial territory i dont even want to think about the mess that would create charles fredrik studied his adviser under lowered brows his heavy hands clasped over his purple robes of office ive already got a mess on my hands hans or are you so naive as to think that the mission which the servants sent to venice was as innocent an affair as they claimed trolligers lips grew pinched the emperor chuckled a suggestion of naivete was perhaps the ultimate insult in the barons lexicon no i didnt think so murmured charles fredrik he rose to his feet and moved toward the narrow window nearby then tell me hanswhat are the servants doing in venice not to mention all those knights theyve assembled there now at the window he cocked his head and gazed at his adviser trolliger shrugged i dont know your majesty my spies tell me nothing interrupted the emperor curtly nothing worth knowing he slapped the stone wall theyre up to no good hans i can feel it in my bones and ive felt for some time anyway that the empire was relying on them too much at this point i dont have a single magician worthy of the name who isnt a damned sot where does that leave meespecially if jagiellon is undertaking a campaign against me which i am now certain is whats ultimately at the bottom of these mysterious doings in venice not even trolliger could keep a look of surprise from his face jagiellon for a moment he fumbled for words buthes the archdemon in the servants pantheon of evil has been ever since he came to the throne four years ago so shrugged charles fredrik it wouldnt be the first time in history that people got too close to their enemy would it he scowled through the narrow window which is what i suspect happened to jagiellon himself until he seized the throne from his father there had been no indication that jagiellon was anything more than another ambitious and bullying lithuanian prince since then theres something dark about the man admitted the baron even by the standards of the lithuanian nobility dark snorted the emperor say better black as night he rubbed his heavy jaw thoughtfully why does he wear that mask at all times for instance simply to disguise the scars he claims to have received when he tried to fend off his fathers assassins charles fredrik turned away from the window and resumed his seat behind the heavy desk he used for working audiences i think not i dont believe for an instant that grand duke jagiellon is truly blind nor more than you i think he keeps his eyes covered so no one can see the monster shining through them trolliger took a deep breath and let it out slowly that is he admitted my deepest fear also exactly said the emperor nodding which means that if lithuania is behind the situation unfolding in venice we face something far worse than simple political intrigue and if thats true then i think id be a fool to keep relying on the servants of the holy trinity the empire is pauline your majesty the populace and the dynasty both to allow bah the emperors thick hand slammed down on the desk do i care about the quarrels of theologians i have an empire to maintain hans be damned to all that again the baron took a deep breath again let it out slowly then abruptly nodded his head true and as always i am at your command he pushed back his chair beginning to rise venice it is then god in heaven i detest that city the emperor waved him back down again its not quite that bad i think we can rely on father francis to pass on my message to his father lopez in venice no reason for you to go there instead trolliger didnt so much resume his seat as fall into it the baron was quite familiar with the intricacies of northern italian politics he could see immediately the logic of the emperors train of thought oh no he groaned charles fredrik grinned ferraras not so bad a very pretty little city in fact as i recall the barons scowl would have frightened ogres who cares about the city have you everpersonallynegotiated with enrico delleste you think they call him the old fox for nothing the emperors grin didnt so much as waver thats why i have advisers and trusted agents chapter maria had observed that hooded look in caesares eyes for the last few days he was planning something again that always worried her he seemed quite back to his strength now and that new wound had nearly healed entirely but stillit always worried her she often wished shed fallen for a man who had some kind of ordinary safe boring job but he was so fine right said caesare that evening after theyd eaten ive got some documents coming down from milan stuff from a contact back in the old days the worst of it is one of my informers tells me half the town also knows about it my old friend aleri will have his watchers out for sure i hear that someone probably that montagnard bastardo aleri has tipped off the council of ten ive got stuff in that parcel for ricardo brunelli stuff which will bring a nice sum in rome and some things i want none of them to see this is worth a good bit of money and were short so im going to use people theyre hopefully not watching i havent used you maria for much of the serious stuff and im pretty sure you boys arent marked at all he paused pulling a wry face the parcel is being dropped off at old grazzis factory on murano thats close to your regular wednesday run anyway maria marco goes across under that tarp and jumps out under the ponto san donato marco you wait a bit and when no ones around you can go and pick the stuff up ill give you a ring to show the old man then you come and meet up with maria then coming back marco can slip off under the ponto at the calle del erbe go across and into riccis for a brioche and glass of wine as if he was just on his way to work at the booth on the piazza one of the barmen the greek is one of mine i have him absolutely by the balls and im damned certain nobody knows it yet hell come up to you and say im nicothedes you give it to him then you go to work at ventuccios as usual im much better at sneaking than marco protested benito let me do it ill be out of marias gondola like a greased rat and into old man grazzis so quietly caesare looked coldly at him if youll just wait a moment boy your job is the tougher one the way this works is the other side doesnt know exactly when its coming into town theyll be watching me theyll be watching my associates theyll be looking for any break in the pattern so youre going to be both yourself and your brother he normally leaves here a good bit before you benito punched marcos arm he likes to dawdle along the way caesare smiled wryly fortunately youin his clotheswill go as far as riccis that hat hes been wearing to show off to the girls is quite distinctive then you cut out and come back here over the rooftops then in that green cotte of yours you go out again and to work marco cant do the rooftops its a pity youre shorter than he is but ten to one itll be foggy tomorrow morning and at that time of day the lights bad youll also have to get marco out of here and into the bottom of the gondola maybe two hours before lauds marias gone long before then but theyll be watching that waterdoor she must leave alone maria looked at the boys marco looked nervous benito well benito looked delighted marco had found it a grim morning so far firstly benitowhom he normally had to roust out of bedhad woken him in the pitchblack then made him dress in the dark and climb out of a tiny window next to the kitchenchimney it wasnt meant for someone his age and size benito had led him across what seemed a mile of coppo tiles to eventually bring him back to marias gondola he lay cold and decidedly uncomfortable on the duckboards under the tarp the tarp smelled of old spilled wineprobably from the barrels she sometimes transported the wait seemed interminable he tried thinking about angelina but the thoughts were just frustrating he still hadnt got up the courage to speak to her and doubted he ever would angelina dorma case vecchie miles above his touch now but oh so beautiful the waterdoor banged moments later the gondola rocked as someone stepped aboard it had to be maria no one else whistled quite like that she didnt say a word to him as she cast off and began to scull they were out in the open water judging by the rising and falling of the deck beneath him before she said you can probably stick your face out if you want a breath of air marco did the air was indeed wreathed with fog well that much caesare had predicted right hopefully the rest would go well also where are we he asked on our way across to murano we should be there soon after the marangona starts to ring this fogll hold a while yet you should be able to get off nicely hidden by it by the time we get back itll have burned off though maria grinned sardonically down at him then youll have to run instead of lying flat on your back while i work in the distance the marangona bell began to ring calling the arsenalotti to work two minutes later marco was clinging to the rotting bricks on the damp underside of the bridge nervously he waited then without anyone seeing him he climbed out and made his way to the glassware factory the old proprietor was waiting for himobviously as keen to get rid of this parcel of potential trouble as marco was eager to get back to meet maria and get his part in this over with he waited and waited it was getting brighter next to the bridge more and more people were about when she did finally arrive maria wore a scowl that would have frightened cream into unchurning itself back into butter dont get on she said we got trouble marco looked around warily tch maria clicked her tongue in annoyance not here think id be stupid nough to bring trouble back in venice the schiopettieri and the capi di contrada are searching all the small craft coming across from the east someone must have tipped them off what do we do maria shrugged i go back to town ive organized a lift across to the mainland for you theres a pirogue heading for mestre you remember tonios cousin alberto his boat hes down the glass warehouse at the end of the fondamenta serendella you go there and slip onto his boat then in mestre you cadge or buy a ride over to the westside quays youll miss some time at work but caesare has leverage with ventuccio i wouldnt come home with the parcel see if you can get to riccis and deliver it to that greek of caesaresnicothedes now im running behind schedule id better get along or itll look suspicious and they might start wondering where ive been theyre probably going to search and harass me anyway itll keep em busy and with a flick of the oar she was gone to face the waiting schiopettieri marco got himself along to albertos scruffy pirogue two hours later he was near emptying his meager purse to get across the west quays he was going to be very very late for work he was also very very nervous benito hurrying along to riccis literally ducking in one door and out the other had his plans go awry too he slipped the new hat that was marcos pride and joy off his head as he got inside the door this time of morning there shouldnt be many people around the marangona bell had only just started to ring over at the arsenal except the pasticceria was full full of schiopettieri benito hearing the door close behind him felt sick right to the pit of his stomach then just before he bolted he realized that his only crime was wearing his brothers hat personally benito had always felt the hat was ugly but wearing it was still not a crime hat or no hat the schiopettieri werent interested in him in fact they were discussing something hed love to have stayed to listen to venice was buzzing with rumors about magical murders and demon killings if he heard the horrified talk aright thered just been another and this time it sounded as if someone had actually caught sight of whoeveror whateverhad committed the deed no wonder the schiopettieri were in having a drink so early as benito wormed his way across to the side door that would give him access to an alley with some easytoclimb beams he picked up snatches of the conversation suckers like an octopus blood everywhere poor priest was shaking so much he could hardly speak and then he was out heading upwards to the rooftops later he walked along to work as usual which was fine until one of the older ventuccio came and asked him if he knew why marco wasnt coming in after that it was torture waiting in worry and uncertainty always is where the hell was marco marco alighted from a bargeload of chickens at the fondamenta zattere ai gesuati to his relief there were no watching schiopettieri now it was just a short cut across the accademia take a traghetto across the grand canal and off to riccis he was already trying to think of a good excuse to use at ventuccio when he realized he was being followed or thought he was anyway he wasnt sure someone big in a black cloak this was even more frightening than schiopettieri marco paused and looked back surreptitiously he couldnt see the big man in the black cloak any more maybe it had all been a figment of his imagination then againmaybe not if he was being followed by an agent of the montagnards it would be someone good enough not to be easily spotted the montagnard and metropolitan factions had plenty of skilled spiesand assassins his mother had been a montagnard spy herself far more skilled than marco at maneuvering in these murky waters but that hadnt prevented them from killing her had it had she too once been followed like this his panic was rising rapidly a montagnard agent one of his mothers killers now following him marco rounded the corner into calle pompea and started running the street was crowded at this time of day dodging between the pedestrians and the porters the students heading for classes and the barrows of vegetables marco made fearful time around the corner doubling back toward the docks and down into an alley he looked back and he ran smack into someone who was coming the other way he dropped the precious parcel the other person dropped a variety of things including a folding easel and at least a dozen brushes as they both bent to retrieve their possessions they looked at each other with mutual recognition rafael de tomaso he and marco had struck a kindred note in each other from the first words theyd exchanged marco still remembered de tomaso coming in to mamas place the first time looking for plants for pigments rafael had been grinding and preparing his own paints already then theyd struck up a conversation with the ease of two boysunaware of the difference in politics or background theyd met up again later one evening at barduccis and it was once again an immediate encounter with a kindred spirit it was as if the intervening years hadnt passed marco rafael smiled rafael can you hide me someone is after me at leasti think so maybe rafael didnt hesitate liciasmy lodgingits only a door away will that do marco looked around nervously and nodded in a few moments he was upstairs in a dingy room long on artists supplies and short on space or comfort what are they after you for asked rafael curiously now that marco felt relatively secure his fears were ebbing in fact he was starting to feel embarrassed there were a lot of big men in venice after all plenty of them wearing black cloaks he was beginning to think hed just imagined the whole thing well i might have been wrong maybe there wasnt anybody but if there was he held up the package clutched in his hand theyd want this parcel im supposed to deliver it to riccis rafael smiled better safe than sorry what i say im on my way across to castello to paint a portrait its not much of a commission but every bit of money helps ill toss it in my paintbag and deliver it for you you can stay here in the meanwhile marco felt his muscles go slack with relief that would be fantastic the relief on benito and marias faces when they saw him was almost worth missing a days pay for and caesare was pleased with his parcel too benito and maria did quite a lot of yelling at him of course chapter petro dorma studied the body lying on the kitchen table the two chirurgeons were still working on the pitifully mangled thing but it was obvious to dorma that the shopkeeper was as good as a corpse the amount of blood spilling over the table onto the stoneflagged floor was enough in itself to doom himleaving aside the ghastly trail of blood that led from the shop where the merchant had been attacked blood and other things horrid pieces of a halfdismembered human body whatever had done this had been as insensate in its violence as in the previous murders this was now the fourth victim dorma had examinedassuming that the street urchin killed the first night had been one of them an assumption which petro had made long since all of them displayed the same characteristics bodies ripped apart as if by some kind of huge animal not simply stabbed or bludgeoned in the manner of a human murderer he turned away and walked out of the kitchen taking care not to ruin his expensive shoes by stepping in the blood once in the room beyond he paused and examined the area once again he had done so already but dorma was meticulous by nature that was one of the reasons his fellow senators had elected him to the signori di notte the lords of the nightwatch who controlled the citys schiopettieri were too powerful a group to be given into the hands of careless men the more so if one of them like petro dorma was also a member of the council of tenthe shadowy semiofficial body of the senate which had almost unrestricted powers to investigate and suppress whatever they saw as threats to the security of the city petro dorma had the reputation for being judicious as well as intelligent and not given to factionalism or fanaticism of any kindexactly the qualities which the oligarchy that controlled the venetian republic looked for in its most powerful officials the republic had now lasted for a millennium maintaining its prosperity and independence in the face of many challenges by being cautious and methodical venetian diplomats were famous the world overnotorious perhapsfor being the most skilled at their trade the challenges which had faced the city over that thousand years had been internal as well as external venices secret police were every bit as expert as the citys diplomats petro dorma never thought of himself as a secret policeman much less as the effective chief of the secret police in truth he never really thought of his status at all he simply took it for granted the male head of one of venices most prominent houses a wealthy and highly respected merchant very prominent in the senate and also the dominant member of the lords of the nightwatch and perhaps the most influential within the council of ten so it was petro dormas position in venetian society was as much a matter of fluid custom and tradition as it was of any official title he did not care much about titles did not even think of them very often he was petro dorma and so it was the room was plain unadorned the narrow and cramped shop of a simple dealer in linens nothing more as with most small merchants in venice the shop was simply the front room of a residence the kitchen adjoined directly the bedrooms and living quarters were upstairs accessible only by a narrow staircase leading from the back of the kitchen absolutely typicaland completely different from the locale of the previous murders the first victim had been a very wealthy financier slaughtered in his own bedroom on the upper floor of one of the citys premier mansions the presumed second victim a street urchin killed by the canalside the third a poor prostitute butchered in an alleyway where she plied her trade that fact alone was enough to tell dorma that he was dealing with no typical fiend in his experienceconsiderable experiencehomicidal maniacs were obsessive in the way they selected their victims as obsessive as they were in the manner with which they murdered this fiend however seemed not to care not at least with respect to the nature of hisor itsvictims and if the grotesquely brutal manner in which it killed the prey seemed obsessive dorma suspected that it was not he suspected more and more that the fiend killed in this manner simply because it came naturally is a shark obsessive because it rends bodies into shreds with huge teeth or a lion with talons and fangs petro did not believe any longer that he was dealing with a human murderer as skeptical as he normally was whenever he dealt with charges of witchcraftcharges with which he had as much experience as he did with mundane crimesdorma had become convinced in this case that he really was facing something supernatural and that being true his thoughts wandered for a moment to the stillunsolved mystery of what had happened to father maggiore the servant of the holy trinity who had been burned alive months earlier at the ceremony in the imperial embassy as it happened dorma had been present himself on that occasion and had personally witnessed the horrifying death of the monk there had not been the slightest resemblance between the manner of that death and the ones which came after but who can say what form true demonwork can take this might all be part of the same thingwhatever that thing might be he turned to the schiopettieri captain standing respectfully nearby a quick check of his excellent memory brought up the mans name ernesto have there been any cases reported of people being burned to death say over the past six months not murder casesi would have heard of thosebut things which simply seem like accidents the captain frowned a few lord dorma but nothing which seemed more than misfortune dorma pursed his lips do me a service if you would discreetlydiscreetly mind youdoublecheck all of those reports and tell me if anything strikes you amiss for instance a death with no eyewitnesses or a death whose cause seems unexplained and while youre at it now that i think upon the matter check to see if there have been any kind of mysterious deaths whether by burning or his eyes glanced for a moment at the door to the kitchen or by any means the captain nodded dorma was satisfied that the man would do a thorough job petro was a polite man by nature but that innate temperament had been reinforced by experience he had learned long ago that treating his subordinates with courtesy produced far better results than arrogance and browbeating that done dorma sighed nothing for it but to deal with the family now that was the aspect of his work he truly detested the grisly parts of investigation he could handle with reasonable aplomb controlling his squeamishness easily enough but talking with griefstricken relatives then he remembered and felt a little flush of guilt at the relief that flooded him the poor man was a widower no si lord dorma his wife died two years ago no children no sir wellnot here not alive two children once apparently but one seems to have died long ago of the plague and the other took ship and has not been seen for several years a son lives now somewhere in constantinople ive been told estranged from his father according to rumor petro nodded and again felt some guilt he really should not feel relief at the misfortunes of a poor family simply because it removed an unpleasant task from his shoulders for a moment he wondered at the life of that family one child dead of disease another estranged and long gone the mother dead and now the father horribly murdered it was a melancholy thought he could only hope that the couple had gotten along well enough in the years they had spent together at the end childless and alone but there was nothing he could do about it now or could have at any time once again petro dorma reminded himself of the sharp limits to his power for all its outward trappings and in so doing although he never once considered the manner reconfirmed the wisdom of venices senate in selecting him for his post one of the chirurgeons emerged from the kitchen wiping his hands on a rag seeing dorma he simply shrugged very wearily as expected dorma nodded a nod deep enough to convey to the chirurgeon his respect for the mans efforts then started for the doorway leading to the street outside take me to the priest now ernesto if you would be so kind the priest was in the nave of his little church located not much more than a block away the elderly cleric was hunched on one of the pews his head bowed clutching a cross in his hands and trembling like a leaf clearly enough reaction to the horrifying event which had transpired not long past was now setting in dorma did not begrudge the man his uncontrolled shivering from what he could determine at the moment of crisis the priest had done all he couldand done so with a courage which would not have shamed any of the churchs great martyrs the fact that afterward a humble parish priest had fallen into quiet hysteria was quite understandable he was not after all a great condottiere like carlo sforza accustomed to scenes of horrendous carnage and brutality dorma stepped up to the priest stooped and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder please father can you tell me what happened the priest raised his head and stared at petro his brown eyes were blurry with moisture its very difficult lord dorma he whispered shakily the fact that the priest knew the identity of his questioner did not surprise dorma even though to the best of his knowledge he had never met the priest in fact he did not even think about it everybody in venice knew who petro dorma washis appearance and official position at least if not the full range of his powers and his membership on the council of ten im sure it is father and i apologize for disturbing you at such a moment but i really must learn as much as i can about what happened the priests nod was as shaky as his whispering voice yes yes of course its justi cant remember much it was dark andvery confusing and and i was very frightened confused myself dorma gave the shoulder a reassuring squeeze you handled yourself as well as any man could have under the circumstances just tell me what you can father visibly trying to bring himself under control the priest took several deep and slow breaths then it was very late at night near dawn in fact i had been spending the night with luigithe linen merchantsitting up with him and talking mostly i was worried about him since the death of his wife he has been very unhappy ive been concerned that he might even be starting to think of suicide the priest paused for another deep breath we heard a noise downstairs in the shop nothing loud in fact i didnt hear it at all but luigi had a shopkeepers sensitivity to such things of course so he excused himself and went down the stairs carrying a candle again the priest paused for much longer this time clearly now that his tale was approaching the moment of horror he was reluctant to continue petro made no effort to hurry him along he took advantage of the delay to review in his mind everything he had seen in the shop and was struck againas he had been at the scene of the financiers murderat yet another contradictory fact the same creature that slew in such an incredibly excessive manner was also quite capable of delicate work the financiers mansion had been entered in so sure and subtle a manner that the schiopettieri were still uncertain as to the murderers exact route of entry and if the entry to the linen sellers shop was obvious the lock on the front door had been skillfully picked not broken dorma suspected that the only reason the shopkeeper had heard anything was because he had been wide awake and as often happened with elderly merchants had become extraordinarily sensitive to the risk of burglary the priest was ready to continue then i heard a scream he rushed on luigis voice i raced down the stairs through the kitchen by the time i got to the front room he gasped a moment it was horrible luigi was being held bysomething i couldnt see it clearly he must have dropped the candle so there was no light in the shop only what little light came through the open door from outside not much because sunrise wasonly still coming everything was dark dark horrible was it a man i dont think so lord dorma if it was it was a huge and misshapen one butno it couldnt have been a man i saw a taili swear i remember that andthen when it must have heard me enteringi was probably shouting myself i dont remember clearlybut i know i was holding up my cross and calling on the virgin the priests voice was starting to rise hysterically dorma calmed him with gentle pressure on the shoulders kneading the old clerics thin bones and flesh with his hands after a moment the priest continued his voice now dull and leaden it flung poor luigi at me and fled from the shop i sawsomething like suckers on its arm like an octopus except it was more like a mans armhuge onethan a tentacle then it was gone racing out the door i saw the tip of a tail like a reptiles of some kind no more he shuddered please lord dorma no more dorma nodded gave the priests shoulders a last little reassuring squeeze and straightened up enough father get some rest on the way out of the church he had a few words with the schiopettieri captain see to it that a guard is maintained here at night for the next few weeks i dont expect therell be any trouble the fiend doesnt seem to have returned to any of its other crimes but ernesto nodded the priest is the only eyewitness and the only one who interrupted thewhatever it isbefore it finished ill see to it lord dorma later that day after hearing lord dormas report the metropolitan of venice summoned the special envoy from the grand metropolitan of rome to a private audience in a secluded room in the cathedral metropolitan michael was becoming more than a little impatient with the envoy so he did not preface his first words with the usual phrases of polite greeting how much longer he demanded by the saints man you should at least meet with petro dorma he could be of great assistance to you the envoy shook his head firmly metropolitan michael almost hissed with displeasure the grand metropolitans envoy did everything firmly it seemed he even managed to limp firmly somehow and why not the envoy frowned firmly of course i still do not know the identity of the evil your eminence the source of it yes it comes from lithuania like most of the worlds demonry but i still havent determined the channels or the conduitsnot all of them at leastnor most important of all its ultimate purpose for all i know petro dorma himself is entwined in these plots the metropolitan threw up his hands with exasperation thats absurd you might as well consider me a suspect the grand metropolitans envoy studied the metropolitan calmly saying nothing in response as if he were examining him after a moment realizing the man was immovable michael sighed even the mans eyebrows annoyed him they too were firm it rather like a solid bar of rusty iron above implacable eyes chapter eventually the punishment ceased the monster lay on its side its flanks heaving still trying to beg for mercy the effort was pointless since chernobog had crushed its throat but the monster knew from experience that so long as it was in the strange graymist casketworld its wounds would heal quickly any wounds even mortal onesand it wanted to be pleading for forgiveness as soon as any word at all could issue from its throat else chernobog might renew the chastisement in the end the monsters fears proved groundless by the time the first croaking words issued from its healing throatquavering with pain those words since healing was almost as painful as punishmentthe masters rage had subsided chernobog was deep into cold contemplation the monster could sense his dark form in the surrounding mist hunched with thought be silent beast lest i return you to the place from which you came the thought brought a fierce yearning to the monster to roam free again but the urge was fleeting chernobog possessed the monsters soul still the monster had no illusions that the master would return itnor that it would be cast back into its homeland uninjured chernobog would surely rend the monster before he set it free and outside of the casketworld mortal wounds were genuinely mortal the monster would simply bleed to death disemboweled in a forest leaving its soul to be chewed by chernobog for eternity besides the pain was receding now as it always did and the monster was able to remember the pleasures as well as the agonies of serving chernobog it would feed again soon enough that knowledge brought reliefrelief from frustration this time not pain the monster had not been able to devour the preys soul because of that cursed priest it was hungry eventually chernobog ceased his ruminations the monster could sense the dark form shifting somewhere in the surrounding grayness as if some huge beast roused from torpor were stirring again it will have to be the burning again at least for a time i cannot risk another premature encounter especially not now with the shadow stirring in slumber the monster had to struggle not to cry out a protest it was in the end a creature of the forest and the lakes and the mountains who much preferred the corporeal rending of flesh in its beastform to less fleshly methods but the struggle was brief very brief there was a certain pleasure in burning also more ethereal perhaps but not without its own rewards yes the burning again and soon the monster sensed chernobogs form seething with anger but knew the anger was directed elsewhere lest my enemies think a mere priest with a common holy symbol can bring them surcease their growing terror must be fanned like flames in a forest until all of the city burns yes the burning again the monsters wounds were almost completely healed by now enough certainly to enable it to utter words of obeisance and submission and if the tone of those words contained a trace of regret there was not enough to reawaken the masters displeasure again the monster sensed the great form swirling a darkness in the mist as if an enormous arm was moving in a gesture of command in an instant its body began to shrivel and shrink soon enough the beastbody with its talons and teeth and clawing suckers had vanished replaced by something which bore a vague resemblance to a salamander as always the monsters regrets vanished with the change of form there was no room in that salamanderlike body for anything but salamander thoughts burning soon hungry part iii december ad chapter the old fox smiled angelina dorma well well well how serious do you think it is antimo the duke of ferraras agent considered this silently finally he said angelina dorma is a young woman of some beauty and absolutely no common sense your grandson marco is besotted with herto the point of foolishness angelina has bragged about her secret admirer to several confidantes both inside and outside the casa it was easy enough for my spies in the household to get wind of it to see young marco and to track him this was done as part of our ongoing research into casa dorma milord not with our agent being aware of whom he was tracking the old fox raised an eyebrow we were all young and foolish about women once werent we antimo bartelozzi didnt respond with a smile foolishness gets people killed milord and dorma is very protective about his family the duke pulled a wry face his weakness is his family antimo his mother and sister can be used against him its been a factor which has held me back in my approaches to him despite his many impressive qualities and as for the foolishness those it doesnt killlearn so i want dorma watched closely i see possible alliances here as well as possible dangers and it is conceivable my foolish grandson may have found a way to remove one loose cannon from the casa dorma and tie it down antimo nodded the duke put a hand to his chin and looked speculative given the current positions of the major factions in venicehow do you assess petro dormas strength he waited patiently for the reply he knew antimo would eventually formulate privately he regarded antimo bartelozzi as his personal version of the mills of god the agent ground slowlybut he ground very very fine wellsuperficially his faction is the smallest the weakest and the most diverse and divided petro is very able but he is not charismatic he lacks the flamboyance and panache of ricardo brunelli for instance the old fox looked at him through halflidded eyes the languor might have fooled a lesser man ah but you think there are other factors to be considered yes the agent smiled wryly should circumstances prompt either the metropolitan or montagnard factions to lose support in venice that support may easily go to dorma he has long been seen as the firmest advocate of a centrist neutral stance his partys weakness is its diversity but as a broad church it offers space to former adherents of both the other partiesthe softer ones if not the fanatics and venices peoplethough they might lean montagnard or metropolitan with the blowing of the factional windshave a strong tradition of independence like a heavy keel to a ship that is dormas central creed if either rome or the empire truly threaten venice i think its populaceand most of its senatorswill remember that heritage while dorma has the smallest support base and is not flamboyant like brunelli he is respected you can find very few people who dislike him and he has a reputation for hard meticulous scrupulously fair workas you know the old fox gave a smile that had he really been his fourfooted namesake would have sent every peasant farmer who saw it off to sleepuneasily with their boarspear and their doginside their henhouse thats all shaping up nicely then and now that baron trolliger has arrived antimos smile almost matched that of his master its such a pleasure to have a capable emperor sitting on the throne in mainz is it not agreed the duke cheerfully hohenstauffens of the past more often than not would have already been planting their great clumsy boots on the brenner pass but charles fredrik is almost an italian the way he thinks i assume hes offering us money not soldiers baron trolliger hasnt been specific yet he only arrived yesterday after all i doubt he will be milord until you meet with him personally but those are the signs yes the emperor clearly enough wants a proxy army here in northern italyjust in case the situation in venice proves to be as dangerous as he and we both think it is and hes more than smart enough to see that ferraralittle innocuous ferrarais the logical choice antimos smile grew very wry baron trolligers praise for the honor of dellesteas well as the cunning of the old foxhas been most ah fulsome as it should be chuckled the duke ive spent a lifetime developing that reputation after all send the man in for a private audience then as soon as hes ready is he still cleaning his boots probably replied antimo theres a man who genuinely hates to travel his curses on that subject were almost as fulsome as his praise for delleste and im sure quite a bit more heartfelt theres no rush negotiations will be lengthy in any event i intend to squeeze as much money as i possibly can from the empire charles fredrik can certainly afford it antimo nodded and what about marco do you wish me to take any steps the old fox raised an eyebrow no let him alone perhaps practice will improve his poetry chapter lies that was what his whole life had become over the last few weeks lies and evasions and dirty little twistings of what scraps of truth he had told marcos gut ached like someone had punched it hard it had ached like that for days his throat was so choked most of the time he could hardly swallow and his heartif it wasnt broken it was doing a damn good imitation of being broken marco valdosta he who called himself marco felluci these days had good reason not to own to the case vecchie family hed been born into his ferrarese mother had made sure of that with her fanatical montagnard beliefs and the longburied secrets that went with what she had done to further the cause still this wasnt why he felt as if he must be one of the most pitiable sixteenyearolds in all of venice he was looking miserable enough for benitos friend claudia to comment on it claudia had told him to his face that he was drooping like a fourdayold leftover bunch of finocchio leaves and had wanted to know the reason he hadnt dared tell her he hadnt dared tell anyone although he really didnt intend to be that way his disposition wavered between sullen and terrified he spent most of his time moping around like a moonsick idiot his brother had given up on him in disgust maria garavelli and caesare aldanto only knew he was pining over a girl and being unusually peculiar about it caesare was being more than patient he was being condescendingwhich marco was overly sensitive to just now maria having failed to jolly him out of it had taken to snapping at him frequently they repeated the same scene at least twice a day it usually started with him glooming about in her path and maria stumbling around him until she finally lost her temper then shed explode canalers cap shoved back on her dark hair strong hands on hips dark eyes narrowed with annoyed frustration dammit marco cant you get the hell out of my way even the memory made him wince she snapped he sulked they both got resentful and caesare sighed the problem was they didnt know the half of what hed gotten into marco who was just home from work at ventuccios booth on the piazza san marco huddled in a soft plushcovered chair in aldantos living room he had lit one lamp on the right side of the window tonightthat was to tell maria that all was wellbut had left the rest of the room in gray gloom he was curled around the knot of anguish that seemed to have settled into his gut for good every time he looked up the very room seemed to breathe reproach at him there was frost on the windowbitter cold it was out there here he was warm and dry and eating goodhe could have been out in the jesolo marshes freezing his butt off but he wasnt thanks to caesare aldanto he could have been shivering in benitos attic or in their little barren apartment in cannaregiohell he could have been dead but he wasnt again thanks to aldanto caesare had taken him and benito under his protection he had protected them and then taken them into his own home hed been feeding them and housing them and keeping them safe because the town was in a turmoil and that was the only way he could be certain they were safe and now marco had gone and compromised the whole damned setup and compromised caesare himself maria was right he was an ingrate he was more miserable than hed ever been in his life more miserable than the time hed hidden out in the marshes because that had only been physical miserymore miserable than when his mother had been killed because that was a cleancut loss thisthis tangle of lies and halftruths hed woven into a trap binding him and aldantothis mess had him so turned insideoutthat it was a wonder he even remembered what day it was oh angelina he thought mournfully if only id never seen you it had seemed so innocent sending that love poem to angelina dorma she wouldnt know who had sent it so what harm could possibly come of it but angelina had assumed it had come from aldanto because she was in love with caesare not surprising that caesare aldanto was a man not a lovesick boy caesare aldanto was urbane and sophisticated and to top it off tall goldenhairedin a city full of short dark folkand as handsome as a sculpture of apollo no girl would think twice about marco with caesare aldanto in the same city marco didnt blame angelaand truth to tell he hadnt really expected her to respond to the poems so strongly but she had and she had come to her own conclusions about them shed caught marco delivering a third lovepoem shed got him so twisted around with the way shed acted towards him that all he could think about was that shed guessed about his own passion and she was being case vecchie and coy hed been so bemused he hadnt left her until long after dark caesarestill recovering from the fevermaria and benito had all been in a fine case over him by then worrying that hed been caught by montagnards caught and maybe been tortured or killed but he was so full of angelina and how shed guessed at the identity of the author of the poems and sought him out that all he could feel was resentment that they were hovering over him so much it was only after hed read her notethen reread it and reread itthat he realized that shed guessed wrong shed figured that the author was caesare and he was the errandboy and shed set him such a tempting little trap toooffered to have dorma sponsor and fund him into the accademia and make his dream of becoming a doctor come true so that he could be conveniently close to deliver more such messages so tempting he could at least see and talk to her any time he wanted he could also have his other dreamall he needed to do was to keep up the lie to keep writing those poems and pretending caesare was sending them that was all just as simple as original sin and just as seductive and now he was afraid to tell caesare because hed been such a fool and worse got them tangled up with a romantic case vecchie girl one with power and connections he was afraid to tell maria becausebecause she was maria she was capable and clever and shed laugh him into a little puddle of mortification and then shed kill him if caesare didnt beat her to it and he couldnt tell benito benito was put out enough over the notion of his brother taking a sudden interest in girlsgoing stupid on him was what benito had said hell hed gone stupid all right so stupid he couldnt see his way straight anymore and that was dangerous for him and for all of them with the town in a dither over the magical killings marco himself was sure that the killings were montagnard work not magical in the least sure as death and taxes and caesare was exmontagnard and knew too damned many montagnard secrets for that matter so did marco and the city was simmering with suspicions he marco might be sure the wicked viscontis were moving again but if you got three people together you got eight opinions strega or jews were the most common suspects of course but the council of ten and the agents of rome were accused too of course there was no certainty who might or might not be in one of the factions so opinions were voiced very carefully complications were not what caesare needed right now yet complications were exactly what marco knew hed gotten them into and this left him unable to tell the truth because the truth hurt so damn much and he couldnt force it past the lump in his throat and the ache in his gut but he had to tell somebody had to get some good advice before what was already worse became disastrous he could reason out that much somebody older but not too much older somebody with experience with nobility somebody who knew how girls thought wild and romantic case vecchie girls in particular a face swam into his mind surrounded with a faint shimmer of hope almost like a halo rafaelrafael might help him to think straight again rafael de tomaso was a student he was lord knew smarter than marco wasand a little older more experienced he dealt with case vecchie families all the time in the form of his fellow students and he was old enough to know how to handle girls maybe even how to handle angry girls yes hed be willing to give advice he was the right person to see marco made up his mind to go and find rafael right then and there before he got fainthearted again he jumped up out of the chair and padded across the soft carpet to the bottom of the stairway listening carefully at the foot of the stair for the faint sounds of aldanto dozing in the bedroom above caesare had been sleeping a lot the past couple of weeks since brunelli wasnt using him much lately although marco was beginning to realize that caesare aldanto had plenty of other irons in the fire poor caesare damn near everyones hand was against him nowor would be if they knew what he was and now one of the kids hed taken in had gone and messed up his life even more and he didnt even guess the danger that kid had put him in marco felt like a total traitor benito was in the spare bedroom downstairs sprawled on his back halfdraped across the foot of the bed and upside down trying to puzzle his way through one of marcos books and making heavy work of it this one had illustrations though which was probably what was keeping benitos attention he writhed around at marcos soft footfall ive got to go out an hour maybe ill be back by dark si why benitos dark face looked sullen rebellious not only was he mad about marco getting mixed up with girls but marco had had it out with him over obeying caesare and treating him with respect benito had been smartmouthed and marco had finally backed the boy up against the wall and threatened honesttogod serious mayhem if benito didnt shape up benito was still smoldering with resentment and marco still wasnt sure the lecture had taken ive got to see rafael ive got to take some of sophias herbs for him one she says will give him a deeper red than madder root i promised him some and ive never taken them benitos expression cleared he nodded and his brown eyes got friendly again because it wasnt a girl that was taking marco out and it wasnt one of aldantos errands si reckon he can make something off them probably what with all the painters at the accademia he isnt much better off than we are you know he deserves a break just you best be back by dark benito admonished shaking a tangle of brown hair out of his eyes only to have it fall back in again or mariall have the skin off you talk about pot calling kettle marco bit back a retort he dug a bundle of herbs out of the box under the bed noting wryly that benito was far more respectful of maria than caesare even now after all marco had told him one of these days benito was going to push caesare aldanto too far and his awakening would be abrupt and rude and probably involve any number of bruises ill be back he promised shoving the packets into his pack huddling on his cotte and shrugging the pack strap over his shoulder and probably before maria is in he slipped into the dark hallway walking quietly out of habit and eased the front door open so as not to wake caesare the last rays of the evening sun were not quite able to penetrate the clouds and venice of the bridges and waterways looked bleak shabby and illused there was snow coming to the alps marco could smell it in the air and shivered inside his woolen shirt and canvas cloak the grayedout gloomy bleakness suited marco down to his toenails and it was just dark enough that if he kept his head down and muffled in his scarf it was unlikely he would be recognized foot traffic was light what with the bitter wind blowing anybody with cash was hiring gondolas even this early in the evening that suited him too hed almost made it down the waterstairs when somebody called his name recognizing the voice he swore to himself but stopped on the steps above the landing rowing to his night tieup was tonio della sendoroand clinging to tonios prow was a kid marco sighed and padded down the last three stairs to wait for tonio to toss him a cold stiff line ciao tonio he greeted the canaler once hed gotten the gondola tied got another one for me tonio nodded his face a comical mixture of relief and reluctance her papa says her ear hurtsshes been crying since yesterday and he cant get her to stop her names leonora no last name not that marco was surprised he rather doubted that tonio was even telling the parents exactly who he was taking their sick kids to they probably suspected strega that would be bad enough but to take them to see one of maria garavellis pet bridgeboys who were probably thieves or something worse and were definitely going to come to no good end the idea would have appalled them they would have laughed at tonio for the very suggestion the ragged little girl huddled on tonios halfdeck was still crying the kind of monotonous halfexhausted sobbing that tore marcos heart right out of his chest he eased down onto the gondola in the overcautious fashion of one not very used to being on a small boat then slid along the worn boards and crouched beside her so that his face was level with hers come here little one he held out hand coaxingly its all right leonora im going to make it better she stopped crying stared at him for a minute then sidled over to him and didnt resist when he gathered her into his arms trying to warm that thin little body with his own children trusted him so did dogs he murmured nonsense at her while he gently felt along the line of her jaw and checked for fever relief washed over him when he found neither a swollen gland nor a temperature elevated beyond what he would expect in a kid whod been crying in pain for a day or more with every kid brought to him he expected to find one too sick for his knowledge or experience to help then what would he do ah he knew what he would do tell tonio the child needed real helpand if the parents couldnt afford it tell him about claudia and her strega healer and let the parents decide whether it was worth the risk of having strega strings attached to their childs soul or maybe kidnap the child and take it there himself and take the damnation onto his own soul this onelike all the others so far thank godwas an easy one infection a scratch just inside the little ear gone septic he went back up to his rooms and fetched some deadnettle tea he mixed it with a little of tonios grappa poured into a spoon and heated it to justbearable over tonios little boat stove this he poured into leonoras ear she cried out briefly but then was still then he heated a small pot of deadnettle tea along with a pinch of aromatic pine resin scrounged from the timberyard he gave her a pebble now honey you suck on this pebble and sniff that steam up her nose was a bit stuffy but the inhalation would clear that if he was right the ear would drain and the pain would suddenly go he and tonio watched he could see it in her facethe sheer wonder of the moment when the pain went away looking at him like he was an angel he blushed and his heart melted a bit more now he said softly and mocksternly you have to promise me something when the wind blows and its cold you will keep your scarf tied around your ears good and tight you hear otherwise your earll start to hurt again the tiny girl gazed at him from eyes so big they seemed to take up half of her tearstreaked face dont got no scarf she protested he sighed again and reached under his coat collar to pull yet another of benitos souvenirs off his own neck that was the fourth one used so fartwo gone for bandages and one as a sling benito must surely think he was eating the damned thingsit was a good thing they werent the silk ones benito liked to sport his brother would have strangled him in his sleep he tied the scarf under her chin making sure both ears were covered now you have promise she nodded then unexpectedly threw her arms around his neck and kissed him messily he hugged her back and she squirmed out of his grasp to go and crouch at tonios feet he knew he was still blushing a little but he was feeling better than he had all day kind of warm inside she was a little sweetiea lot nicer than the last one whod kicked him he got gingerly to his knees and edged carefully off the pitching boat onto solid land tucking his chilled hands under his arms as soon as he got there tonio cleared his throat and marco knew what was coming next dammit tonio ive said i wont take anything about a hundred timesand i damn sure wont take anything this time either you folks havent any more to spare than i do and i havent done a damn thing this kids papa couldnt have done if he knew how but he didnt did he so you tell him and he will marco set his chin stubbornly and dont you go bleating debts or imperiled souls at me either there is nothing magical about this and by the lion of saint mark even if there was then surely christ himself would have blessed it he said let the children come to me after all i dont believe in counting favors i do what i can let the accounting be set in gods hands thats true enough may be tonio replied just as stubbornly but this babys papa does believe in the payment of debts he may be poor but hes proud and honest that just about described all the boatmen caulkers and fishermen of venice only the rich and the rogues had other standards oh hell marco sighed pulled the rope loose and stood up holding it in both hands braced against the tug of the sluggish water and the icy wind on the boat all right i tell you what if you people are so worried about debt heres what you do when theres a few lira to spare have the people ive helped put it in some kind of common pot against the day when i cant help one of these children and they need a real chirurgeon i suppose you might as well hold the pot tonio since youre always the one bringing them here if they do that i figure were even si that should solve two problemstheirs and his tonios face still looked stormy but he must have reckoned that that was the only concession he was going to get out of marco si he agreed after a long moment of stubborn silence he signaled to marco to toss back the rope and poled back out into the current marco headed back along the walkway resuming his interrupted journey his leathersoled boots made no sound on the damp wood as he kept to a warming trot no bare feet in this weather not for him or benitoaldanto had bought them boots when he caught them without footcoverings another undeserved kindness sounds were few above the wind the occasional murmur of voices from above the slap of waves on boats and buildings the everpresent creaking of wood canalers calling out to each other down on the water coldgod it was cold weather for sickness thats for certain in the swamp down on the canals weather for dying too winter would be bad this year he thought funny this business with tonio della sendoro it had started when marco caught rafael de tomaso with a cut hand going septic and forced him to let marco clean it out then de tomaso had brought him a child with a bad case of the fever then tonio had gotten into the act always children though never adults eleven no twelve of them so far marco couldnt resist a sick childnot even when they kicked or bit soft heart to match my soft head no matter marco knew damned well he could no more see a child in pain and walk on without doing something about it than he could stop breathing well one thing for sure no matter how badly hed messed things up with caesare aldanto there were a dozen poor boatpeople or fisherfolk babies hed made a bit healthier from across the canale di cannaregio on the ghetto side the three priests watched the boy trotting away then their eyes followed the gondola as it made its way up the canale and turned into a smaller canal which entered the heart of the cannaregio sector of the city that boy has become a bit of a blessing for this poor neighborhood said diego approvingly thats at least the seventh child i know of that hes given medical attention nine grunted pierre that i know of good treatment too by all accounts enekos expression was grim not sharing any of the approval so evident in the faces of his companions hes also the same boy who brought that message to me from caesare aldanto that despicable offer i told you about pierre and diegos eyes widened aldanto choked pierre are you certain asked diego eneko nodded quite certain i was struck at the time by the incongruity between the villainy of aldanto and the boys own facethe face of an angel almost but pierre lapsed into silence for a moment then i dont believe aldanto is guilty of black magic true enough but i dont doubt hes guilty of almost any other crime treacherous to the core by all accounts a pure mercenary he pointed a finger toward the distance into which the boy had disappeared whereas he he refuses to accept any payment eneko ive spoken to that canaler myself tonio is his name it just doesnt make sense added diego shaking his head no it doesnt mused eneko which is precisely what interests me the most why is such a boy working for such a man orperhaps more importantwhy has such a man taken such a boy under his wing he cocked his head at his two companions aldanto is indeed as pierre said a pure mercenary so what is his mercenary reason in this instance his two companions looked at each other pierre shrugged diego sighed i suppose this means you want me to investigate something else eneko chuckled i dont think it will be as bad as all that diego if the boy is a healer eneko pointed across the canal at the cannaregio district youve met father mascoli i introduced you to him just a few weeks ago ask him first if the boy is as well known in this area as all that as a lay doctor mascoli will know who he is the cannaregio muttered the castillian the ghettos reputation is bad but overrated there are other places in cannaregio whose reputation is not ill protect you said pierre stoutly from sin of course footpadsyoure on your own eneko clucked the only danger youll face in the cannaregio is from cutpurses and since neither of you has a purse he ignored the glares coming his way insouciantly righteousness brothers always the best armor chapter marco made good time across to dorsoduro hed have at least an hour with rafael before he had to head back he was glad to get there the overcast had given birth to flurries of cold rain and his nose felt numb if rafael was there the al caraveillo tavern was the likeliest spot to find him marco poked his head in the door and got hit in the face with the light and the noise it was almost as bad as a physical blow after the chill gray of the canalside it took him a moment to adjust to it but when he finally did he breathed a prayer of thanks to the saintsfor at a table in the rear book propped up in front of him and huge orange cat spread out like a rug on his lap was a tall thin darkhaired young man wearing an accademia cotte so thats the whole mess marco concluded miserably he slumped on his hard wooden chair staring at his own clenched hands surrounded by the clutter of artwork books and other paraphernalia of a student and artists life that filled the tiny room that made up rafaels lodgings the lanky student across from him lounged on his unmade bed chewing his lip thoughtfully marco had laid out the whole storysaving only aldantos exact identity and what he was involved with rafael de tomaso had simply been told that aldanto was a man with enemiesa lot of enemies that was enough for rafael to add into his calculations without his knowing enough for the information to be a danger to caesare at least de tomaso hadnt laughed at him youve got yourself a problem all right rafael said finally putting his hands behind his head and staring at the ceiling a bad one the dormas are rising in influence rising fast from what i hear im almost certain that petro dorma is in the council of ten already from the little i know angelina dorma would be a very bad enemy for your friend to have and if you go through with this charade shell find out eventually when she does she will want his hide as much as yours her older brother petros a calm one sure still it is a family thingand like i said council of ten a lord of the nightwatch for sure i figured marco replied dismally you werent planning on trying to carry it off were you for about five minutes maybe marco admitted after thatdammit rafael it isnt right thats all i can say it isnt fair even if i could make it work rafael de tomaso smiled a kindly smile as if he were giving marco credit for honesty how much of your hide are you willing to part with the lump rose in marcos throat nearly choking his words all of it he said at last shes going to hate me forever no matter what happens if theres a way to keep my friend out of it ill take it and take my lumps you got some place you could go to get out of sight for a couple of weeks long enough to let things cool down marco thought as best he could not aldantos place not the apartment in cannaregio that he and benito had shared that would be the first place a searcher would look claudia and valentina theyd take him inno doubt of it but claudia was a strega and a thief on top of thatbenito had confirmed that all of it the two singers had been benitos protectors and mentors in his early days on his own claudia more than valentina but he knew most of what there was to know about both of them claudia had been courting marco ever since shed found out he wanted to be a doctor dangling a secret stregarun healer school in front of him he was mightily afraid that his resolution not to get involved with any more religious or factional fanatics would crumble under the slightest pressure at this point it would be such a logical move cut ties to caesare get under the protection of somebody else drop out of sightand get his dream into the bargain so easy no he wouldnt even think about it easy usually had strings attached that wouldnt show up until later and what if the strega used him to get at caesare or benitoor maria and her boatmen friends the jesolo marshes back into the muddy velme and hide in barene he gave that one a second thought and then a third maybe not such a bad notion he could move a hide into old giannis territory it might still be open with gianni dead by marcos knife even if it wasnt no marshlocos would fool with the man whod killed gianni theyd leave him alone maybe clear out altogether themselves there were a fair number of food plants there and some good fishing spots it was cold sure but he could take blankets and medicine out with him he could tough it out for two weeks or so maybe getting back to the basics of surviving would clear out his head i think maybe i got a place he answered rafael slowly why i think if i were you this is what id doand first thing is you arent going tell anybody anything youre going to write to them it was almost dawn benito was so dead asleep he didnt even stir when marco slipped out of bed marco hadnt slept more than a few minutes all night lying there in the bed with every muscle so tight with nerves that they were ready to cramp he dressed quickly in the dark putting on every bit of clothing he possessed here not daring to light a lamp lest he wake benito his pack was back in the cannaregio apartment already made up with the clothing hed left there and the blankets from that bed there were other things there too things hed boughta spare knife a tinderbox fishhooks and line and lures hed been afraid to bring the pack here lest somebody catch him at it and try to stop him the jesolo marshes had been a really good notionexcept that he hadnt any money to buy the gear he needed to survive in the end hed had to get back to their apartment in cannaregio retrieve his precious booksand sell them hed already spent all the money he had saved on the goods hed traded with sophia for herbs to treat caesares fever his books were all he had left in the way of portable wealth it had damn near broken his heart all over again to part with them but this was his only choice he couldnt live for weeks out there without supplies and coldweather gear not in wintertime he knew that chiano and sophia would have stripped his hideout of everything useful once they were certain he wasnt likely to be coming back to the marsh and maybe hed have to stay out there for longer than a couple of weeks the more hed thought about it last night the more logical that seemed hed just about talked himself into staying out thereunless his plan worked the other plan hed thought of lying in the dark last night now he crept to the spare room one careful hushed step at a time he had to get into aldantos medicinechest for the last of what he needed he hated to steal but he wasnt sure sophia had been able to collect any more artemisia in the marshes even if hed had the money to pay for it and aldanto had enough to cure a dozen feversor to kill four men marco was glad there was a nightlamp left burning in the room else hed probably have broken something and roused the whole house the herb was right out in front in neat twists of paper marco knew exactly how many there were since hed weighed and made the twists himself it was he supposed something hed traded for still marco took half of them neither aldanto nor maria was likely to need it and marco might very well before the winter was over if the fever got him hed need it for sure he stuffed the packets into his pocket and stole out now he crept quietly into the kitchen ran his hands along the shelf until he found the old bread and a bit of cheese then found the round hard bulk of the wine carafe the same way first thing that aldanto did when he wandered downstairs in the morning was to take some watered wine so that was where marcos letter to him would go dear caesare i am a bigger fool than you ever thought i was ive gone and got both of us into trouble it began and went on from there it had been a torture to write and marco wasnt entirely clear on what hed put down hed fought down the ache in his gut and the swelling in his throat all through writing it so it wasnt exactly a miracle of coherency but it did lay out the whole sordid story and finished by telling caesare not to go looking for him he rather doubted caesare would want to waste the time looking for such a fool as he was butbetter assure him that marco was going to be hidden where nobody was likely to be able to find him marias letter was shorter by about three pages that was going to her cubbyhole at giaccomos it occurred to him belatedly that she wasnt going to be able to read it anyway but he owed her some explanation he wasnt going to leave a letter for benito best not to although it caused him a physical pain as sharp as giannis knife to do so he left angelinas letter folded up inside caesares under the wine carafe so caesare would be able to see for himself how angelina had woven a fantasy around him his throat and stomach were hurting again but he forced the bread and cheese down he wouldnt be getting any more of that in the swamp there was no way of keeping anything for more than a day or two in the marshes anyway if it didnt go moldy it drew vermin from now on anything he atenot that food was real attractive at the momenthed have to catch or find it when he wanted to eat hed oiled the hinges of the door last night now he eased down the hallway and slid back all of the locks and bolts as carefully as he could he froze half a dozen times agonizing over the slightest sound and finally inched through the door opened just enough so that he could slip through the sharpedged cold hit him hard waking him completely he closed the door and relocked it he couldnt do the bolts of course but at least the door was locked he posted the key gently back under it then he went softly down the waterstairs and sneaked past old minnas and tonios and marias empty gondolas all tied up at the bottom the gondolas stayed silent their occupants tucked up in all the blankets they owned except for maria who was tucked up with caesare he stomach lurched oh angelina now came the hardest part of all he knew angelina would never be up this early the case vecchie kept hours like caesares he trotted down the wet walkways watching carefully for slippery pools as the sun began turning the edge of the sky a bloody red no fog this morning but it was as cold as brunellis heart and there might be more rain or even sleet before the day was over the wind was cutting cold and bitter there were a few hearty souls about even this early boatmen folk on their way to work or coming home from it the cold kept the stink down the sharp breeze smelled mostly of smoke and wet wool once he thought he saw claudias raven head with her bold red scarf tied about her hair to confine itso he quickly chose another way claudia could be damnably persuasive when she wanted to be and he didnt want to be talked out of the only honorable course he had left dormas doorkeeper wasnt even awakethank the lord marco managed to slip his sealed letter to angelina into the hollow block she had shown him to leave her private billetsdoux in billetsdoux she thought had come from the fascinating dangerous caesare this was no love letter it was however five pages longand ended with a poem so that shed believe it really was him who had written the others now shed hate him forever it couldnt be helped it wasnt in agreement with valdosta honor that he leave caesare entangled in a lie nor that he let angelina continue to believe that same lie so why didnt he feel better now to cannaregio for his pack then giaccomos lying staring into the dark hed made some hard decisions last night given all the trouble hed caused him the best thing he could do for caesare aldanto was to cut his ties with the man all of his ties including the job with the ventuccios so not even they could hold that over his head he sniffed in the cold his eyes burning and wateringsurely from the earlymorning woodsmokeand rubbed his eyes and nose across his sleeve woodsmoke sure be honest with yourself marco valdosta even if youve lied to everyone else this was hurting more than hed ever thought it would for a little while hed had a family a weird family but a family all the same it hurt to cut loose and he had to cut loose and do it before he managed to do something that couldnt be repaired benito could still be useful to caesare and if he ever needed anything marco could supply marco could send it surreptitiously through benito honor could still be satisfied that way but he needed some wayif he was ever able to poke his nose back into the cityto keep himself housed and fed and maybe maybe save enough to sneak into the accademia perhaps with yet another changed name if he could find some way to make enough money medicinal herbs werent all that could be found in the marshes after all the other things that were abundant enough were bones and the way marco figured it if someone was superstitious enough to want relics or charms well he might as well get the benefit of the money being thrown away he only knew of one person though who might know where he could safely dispose of smuggled relics giaccomo who scared the hell out of him giaccomos was just open marco went up to the front porch and through the door open and aboveboard he walked barefoot because hed stowed his socks and boots in his pack silently and ohsocarefully across the wooden expanse of floor he gave over marias sealed letter then asked of the man behind the bar in a soft and very respectful voice if milord giaccomo might be willing to talk with him on business jeppo left the bar in the care of one of the other helpers and vanished briefly as it happened milord giaccomo evidently hadnt gone to bed yetand was apparently willing to see the frequent bearer of so much of aldantos coin jeppo returned and directed marco with a silent jerk of his thumb the office the door to the office was next to the bar facing giaccomo scared the liver out of him to sit quietly at giaccomos invitation all alone in the cluttered cubbyhole while the dim gray light smudged the dirty windowpanes and stammer out his offer took all of the courage he had left giaccomo sat behind his desk tall baldingand big most of it not fatand looked at him hard and appraisingly melting away the last of marcos bravery you want to sell relics huh he asked marco bluntly why marco could hardly think under that cold cold starehe stammered something about needing a lot of money and didnt elaborate what saints bbones saint theodoro marco stuttered saints bones were fairly commona cure and a protection for everything from pox to plague caesare had once said that it was a good thing that the saints had such numerous and big bones the rate the city used them and and some fragments of saint gerados skull skull fragments were more precious but still quite commonplace that wont get you much money in a hurry giaccomo continued to stare at him jaw clamping shut on each word eyes murky dont need it in a hurry just need to put it ttogether i can get you strega herbs and charms also huh the way the big man kept staring at him marco imagined he could see all the way through him he wondered what giaccomo was thinking the mans opaque eyes didnt reveal even a hint of his thoughts well i dont deal magic christian or otherwise oh marcos plan for independenceand the accademiacollapsed im sorry to have bothered you milord i guess it wasnt too good a notion he rose awkwardly and started for the door boy marco turned a thread of fear down his spine giaccomo wasnt anybody to trifle with he wondered if hed passed the invisible bounds beyond which giaccomo allowed no one he dealt with to trespass giaccomo had a way of dealing with trouble or potential trouble it ended in the canal with a rock tied to one ankle splash gone he wondered if he looked as deathly white as he felt dont you go making that offer anywhere else marco gulped he wasnt quite sure what the look on giaccomos face meant but he thought hed better answer with the truth or part of it i wwasnt going to milord he replied you were the only one i got more sense than to deal with anybody but you milord i got to be going please milord you likely wont be seeing me again ever thats a promise he meant that it would be better for everybody at this point if he went back to the swamp and stayed there ties cut clean giaccomo lookedfunny his eyebrows were up near where his hairline used to be the big man looked a little confused and oddly troubled but he let him go with only the town is full of spies boy agents for the council of ten the servants of the trinity and even the grand metropolitan in rome this sort of business will get you burned at the stake for witchcraft or beheaded for grave robbing if youre lucky the brethren who run the real thing he shook his head go you stay out of it boy especially with these magical murders happening everyone from the church to the doge wants to catch someone any scapegoat will do thats how it works chapter thats the fifth murder said the grimfaced brother uriel that we know of this cannot be allowed to go on we must find the guilty party erik dragged his attention from the burned shriveled remains of the body on the floor and stared at the monk of all the company of servants of the holy trinity in venice uriel was the one erik found the most acceptable nobody could claim to actually like brother uriel but you had to respect him he was rigid and intolerant yes but also scrupulous and one of the few servants of the holy trinity who seemed to care little for hierarchy he was certainly not one of abbot sachss favorites it seemed to make no difference to uriel manfred yawned and stretched it was predawn theyas a groupwere only here together because they and the guard were the only ones who had not been asleep when the schiopettieri runner came in erik had been drilling with manfred brother uriel had been having a fasting vigil in the chapel for some obscure saint the schiopettieri had sent a boat for them but they were far far too late uriel began prayers for the soul of the departed erik stepped back and examined the room there was a small still hot furnace many tools small delicate tools what is this place he asked of the woman who had called out the schiopettieri she was still standing wringing her hands its its signor mantellis workshop she pointed weakly at the burned crisp on the stoneflagged floor he he was a goldsmith he lived here asked a tall slim elegant man who though he wore the signs of hasty dressing also wore the air of command the man had just arrived from his appearance erik suspected he was one of the lords of the nightwatchand was not pleased to find knights and a servant of the holy trinity there ahead of him the woman bowed respectfully whoever the man was he commanded both respect and fear from her upstairs lord calenti i i was housekeeper to him a tear began to trickle down her cheek i cant believe it i just cant believe it and i never had a chance to tell him that i was sorry the respectfully addressed lord pounced on this for what signora she wrung her hands it was a silly thing your honor he shouted at me because he said id stolen a cap of his a knitted one it was his favorite i would never steal your honor on my fathers grave i swear it but he was angry and i was angry i said many harsh things he was good man even if he did drink too much the venetian lord patted her shoulder there there signora we all say things we afterward regret i think you should go upstairs and have a glass of your late masters wine he has family here she shook her head no your honor he iswasfrom padua the venetian lord nodded and gently guided her to the door when it had closed firmly behind her he turned to the two schiopettieri standing by the entrance seal this place allow no one in and detain all those who try they will have to be questioned the lord turned to erik pardon me sir knight this has now become a matter for the republic when the good monk has finished his prayers i must ask you to leave to be frank i am not quite sure why you were summoned in the first place because abbot sachs has been spreading bribes among the schiopettieri thought erik sourly but he saw no reason to contest the matter with more than a shrug it seems a bit late for us to do anything anyway as soon as brother uriel has finished his devotions well go but i suspect abbot sachs will want to come and exorcise and bless the place as well as scour it for witchsign lord calenti nodded he may apply to me thats going to go down really well thought erik but he said nothing it was left to manfred to ask the questions starting to trouble erik lord calenti just what was this man doing thats worrying you other than bursting into flames and doing a lot of screaming that is the tall slim venetians eyes narrowed he looked at the two of them very carefully obviously considering things he must have decided that telling them was either innocuous or might carry a message to the people who were involved that he was closing in on them treason he said grimly pointing to the workbench and an open mold he was a coiner at this point brother uriel stood up i am finished the venetian lord nodded his soul is at rest the way he said it sounded as if he regretted the fact brother uriel turned on him his soul is in torment can you not feel the pain something evil evil beyond your comprehension devoured his very life the monk shuddered the last time i felt the uncontained taint of this much evil was when we clashed with the forces of lithuania outside grudziadz there is great evil afoot in your city i will leave you to deal with matters of the spirit said the venetian stiffly the republic must deal with secular affairs please leave now lord calenti looked now as if he regretted telling them anything about the victim and motioned to the schiopettieri to see them out the dawn was just blushing a translucent cloudframed sky when they stepped out obviously the courtesy of a vessel was not going to be offered to them in the distance a bell began sound uriel sighed another mess that the servants of the trinity are illable to deal with i never though it possible but i wish i was back in the marshes and forests facing the evils of the grand duke of lithuanias minionsinstead of being in this misbegotten and supposedly christian city at least there it was clear who our enemies were manfred looked speculatively at the stiff upright monk the man was plainly distressed by what hed encountered just what is going on here brother he asked why are we even involved here in venice brother uriel shook his head you had better ask father sachs that he said heavily i am not privy to the inner councils of my order or yours i only know that the scryers including sister ursula have by means of their holy magics foreseen that we have some role to play here in venice i do not know why my own abbot sent me to join abbot sachss men i only know that great evil is afoot in this city the abbot may claim there is witchcraft everywhere in venice i only know what my eyes have seen and my spirit felt erik scowled i can understand the servants of the holy trinity but why the knights we are the militant order keeping us sitting here is a waste of military power never mind the fact that we dont really have a clear reason to be staying on at all uriel looked grim we have orders to stay until the evil is rooted out as long as need be those orders are not for us to question maybe notbut with people being killed like this the whole town is a powder keg likely to blow up beneath us and we certainly dont seem to have reduced the level of evil here brother uriel took a deep breath of the morning air true look there is a church over there i have need of a few moments in prayer and silence i will return later he walked off with long determined strides manfred stretched well that just leaves you and me how about we walk and take some air and maybe a sop of new bread and a glass of wine this day seems pretty old already erik nodded why must they keep on ringing that bell every morning it rings for at least half an hour the marangona said manfred its supposed to get the workers to the arsenal why do they stop ringing it when they all get there asked erik irritably he was feeling a need to get back to his roots to the clean open air of iceland or vinland this city with all its great buildings seemed cramped and oppressive and what was all that excitement from that venetian lord about manfred shook his head intrigue erik italian intrigue by venetians who are the masters of it there was an open tavern the two went in manfred ordered wine and flaps of the local bread in what was daybyday becoming better italian erik had little doubt where he was learning it from but on the other hand at least francesca was safer than any random streetwomen that manfred might have amused himself with erik found it awkward owing someone he should be protecting manfred from for their lives they walked back outside and stood in the chilly morning the promised sun failed them but the crisp air off the sea was clean i dont understand about the intrigue manfred manfred grinned you wouldnt you understand battle erik this is something else he took a deep pull from the wine goblet this is about what really makes treason happen eric shook his head treason loyalty idealism ambition manfred grinned ignorant icelander money of course erik grimaced its like this manfred explained the venetians know that money and treason go handinhand they also know that you cant spend anything in venice except ducats erik shrugged even trading with the skraelings we use them they like the hole in the middle because they can string them like beads uh huh the mostly widely used coin with the purest gold in europe even the best from the imperial mint at mainz is not as good the same coin you use trading in vinland except here it has no hole in it manfred pulled out a coin see if youre a foreign trader the bankers at the foot of the rialto bridge wont release your coin until your harbor tax is paid the hole punched out any venetian must on the order of the doge exchange holed coins for entire ones on which they pay tax you cant spend foreign coin in venice without it going through the bankers and the capi di contradatheir tax collectors and the doges council keeps track of foreign money coming in they have a good idea of just what is happening by the flow of money thats why a coiner is a problem he can melt pure venetian gold and recast it without the hole erik thought it through you could bring in goods or offer bills of exchange true and you can bet the doges council watches those too i suppose jewelry might offer a gap but money is whats usually wanted hard cash money for weapons money for bribes money to reward adherents erik looked askance at manfred how do you know this manfred grinned francesca we talk sometimes too you know quite a bit actually shes a very clever woman i was thinking of passing this on to charles fredrik come on drink up we can stop at casa louise on the way i want to tell her about all of this chapter the marsh and the wind swallowed up sound and the rushes closed them almost into a small room which was just as well chiano howled with laughter his eyes vanishing in his wrinkles marco prayed at that moment that lightning would hit him and reduce him to cinder it would hurt a lot less than what he was feeling now he tucked his cold wet feet under him huddled under his cotte and wished he was on the moon or dead or something shut up ye old bastardo sophia scolded sharply her face crinkling up in anger as she pushed a stray bit of gray hair under her knitted cap marco had brought her that the last time hed come have some pity on the boy maybe its babylove but it hurts all th sameand a young one aint never been hurt that bad before she turned to marco huddled on one corner of the raft marcolad dont ye let him get to ye i aint saying ye did right t leavebut i aint sayn ye did wrong neither marco made a helpless gesture to these two his protectors and friends he could tell everythingand he had it had lessened some of the burden at least until chiano had started laughing at him isophia after the mess i got him in i cant face caesare and i cant keep on being a burden to him either i thought you was working for the casa ventuccio real work i mean not makework i was that dont sound much like being a burden t me i he hadnt thought of it quite that way sure he and benito had been living on aldantos bounty lately but theyd been keeping watch over him while he was sick and helping to get him out of the tangle that illness had put him in and it had been his savings and marias that had bought part of the medicine that had kept caesare alive hed bankrupted himself for caesares sake and hadnt grudged it hed lost several more weeks salary too staying with caesare to watch him and watch out for him and hadnt grudged that either maybe he had been pulling his own weight and whos agoing take care of them sick canaler kids if yere hiding out here that was one thing he hadnt thought of not likely tonio would take them to some strange stregamarco was risk enough don ye go slamming no doors behind ye sophia admonished him gently now getting out of sight til that aristo girl can forget your face thats no bad notion but staying here no marcolad ye dont belong out here stay just long enough to get your head straightthen ye go back an take yer licks from that caesare fellow ye learned before ye cant run from trouble sophia was right that was exactly what hed been trying to dohed been trying to run from all his troubles and rationalizing the running yes milady marco said humbly feeling lower than a swans tail she shoved his shoulder but not in an unkindly fashion get along with ye milady huh she snickered then turned businesslike where ye going park your raft i figured at the edge of giannis old territory right by the path near that big hummock with the patch of thatchrush growing out of it good enough get on with it well keep an eye out for ye chiano waited until marco was off down the trail and into the reeds out of sight and hearing then he slipped off the raft onto one of the secret paths of firm ground that wound all through the swamp he generally moored both his raft and sophias up against one of these strips of solid earththey werent really visible since most of them were usually covered in water about a handspan deep where ye goin sophia asked sharply going see to our guest chiano replied she shut up at that shut up and just watched him with caution chiano had changed in the past months yes indeed he had or rather begun acting more like the person he really wasever since the news of gino despinis death the more news that trickled out of venice the more he was allowing the cloak of deception to slip from his mind even more than from the minds of others he balanced his way along the narrow watercovered trails so used to following them he did it unconsciously so used to the cold water he never noticed his numb feet yes chiano had been changing for the first time in years he was himselfluciano marina dottore marina strega grand master grimas fool grand master beaten nearly dead fleeing for his life wounded and damaged even his mind confused abused and lost in that conflict he still didnt know who had done it or whywas afraid to know in truth hed ended up in the marshes and hed survived barely perhaps his magical skills had helped perhaps the goddess had held her hand over him despite his pride and foolishness as he wandered amnesiac for months among the other loco in the jesolo that had beenlong ago it had taken time for the strega master to begin to return humbled but alive and when he had then hed cursed the fate that left him so stripped of all position possessions and contacts as to have to stay here hed joined up with sophia some time before marco had come to them how much time he wasnt sure his memory of that period was vague sophiad had the gift of healing that he lacked though he had the knowledge together theyd formed the only source for medicine the swamp folk knew and hed done his best to follow the healing path among the crazed and the impoverished losers who lived here and now well perhaps she who was hecate artemis and ishtar needed him back there was a yearning to go back his position both in the accademia and marciana library had brought prestige and power but most of all he yearned for the books andhe had learned a great deal humility for one but also the need for greater stringency in the service of the goddess the dottore marina he remembered had been too vain yet also not proud enough too peacock soft his mind turned to the boy the boy did not even begin to realize he bore the mark of the winged lion which had been obvious to lucianos stregatrained eye from the moment the boy had stumbled into their lives well the guardian of the lagoons and marshes who had welcomed the gentle saint mark was ever so in its choices they were good vessels he had to admit that he luciano marina was a flawed vessel still the boy had come back here and he carried with him the feeling of danger danger and darkness far greater than could be linked to one life or death but luciano also felt the potential for something else luciano approached the islet cautiously through the mist making no sound in the water hed left harrow trancingout on the mushrooms hed fed to him his caution was needless harrow was deaf and blind to everything around him except lucianos voice and magic harrow was having another vision this one was like the others beginning with a face a womans face she started out young then flickered from girl to woman to crone and back again it was the goddess of course she had come to instruct him again harrow felt both exalted and humbled and excited with the kind of nearsexual excitement hed felt only when hed completed an assignment for duke visconti but he wasnt supposed to be thinking of that he was supposed to be making himself worthy to be the vessel of the goddess harrow said the goddess her hollow echoing voice riveting his attention upon her you have much to atone for are you ready yes replied harrow thinly bowing his head as her eyes became too bright to look upon those eyesthey seemed to see right into the core of him so let it be there was a sound like a great wind and harrow was alone in the dark or was he nono there was someone coming or forming rather out of the dark and the mist another woman for a moment he thought it might be another avatar of the goddess then with a chill of real fear he recognized her lorendana valdostaonce a montagnard agent herself and dead at the hands of the viscontis assassins these five years gone he knew she was dead and for a certainty hed been there when aleri had given the order and bespi himself had slid in the blade while lorendanas new lover aldanto held her silent and immobile she had been the key montagnard informationdrop in venice but she had also been loosetongued and incredibly reckless never less so bespi had realized later than when shed personally insulted duke filippo visconti by spurning his advances that knowledge had been the thing more than any other which had finally crystallized bespis growing disillusionment with the milanese he had uncaringly killed a woman for beingso hed been tolda danger to the cause the knowledge that hed actually killed her for no more reason than the dukes personal disgruntlement when it finally came to him had been unbearable hed realized then that hed been as gullible as the woman hed murdered she didnt look too gullible now bespi a voice said seemingly inside his head i see you he blocked his ears but it did no good the ghostly voice cut right through him the almond eyes did the same she was starknaked her wellformed ivory flesh floating in a cloud of smoke and fog and midnightblack hair obliquely slanted black eyes cold as the graveshe aroused no desire with her weird nudity hed never wanted a woman less bespi you carry my curse do you wish to be free of it a low moan came from his throat my curse shall follow you wherever you go her eyes grew until they filled his entire field of vision black and like looking into hell he felt ghostly hands running down his arms leaving chill trails behind them when you sleep i shall be therewaiting when you wake i shall follow in all your comings in all your goings i shall be one step behind you making you careless making you nervous until one day you will make a mistakethen my fingers will close about your throat wait he yelled panic snatched at him now dread he had never felt in dealing with the living or the soontobedead closed around his heart and squeezed it like an invisible hand reaching through his chestwall he panted whimpered ill do anything you want the eyes receded and again she floated before him in her cloud of smoke and hair and magic then guard my sons that caught him off guard huh he replied stupidly unable to fathom the puzzle my sons live harrow bespi who was guard them guard them well keep them from harm keep the montagnards from their throats only then my curse will leave you i donti mean i dont even know what they look like how how do i find them thereshe pointed and something began forming out of the smoke and the dark beside her the foggy image of an adolescentsixteen seventeen maybe a dead ringer for lorendana that is marco bespiharrow gasped as he recognized the boy the one who had killed gianni the boy with the great reasons harrow could now understand why he had been witness to the sight and there beside the first a boy about two years younger carlo sforza as a kid that is benito guard them harrow your life on it or you will carry my curse forever he had barely sworn to it when she faded away and his grasp on consciousness went with her luciano was well pleased with himself that had been one of the better visionquests hed sent harrow on the former assassin hadnt fought him he had responded beautifully to all the suggestions he hoped the sending of marcos brother was right hed only seen the boy once but somehow it had seemed a good touch these were just small magics true but he did not dare to try greater magic than this not without calling the sort of attention that he didnt want onto himself harrow came around gradually he wasnt a particularly pretty sight with half his head scarred and the rest of him splotchy with burned skin he coughed a good deal too a gift from the smoke and the water hed breathed in but he was functional indeed hed healed better and faster than luciano had thought likely the new vessel of the goddess sat up slowly uncurling from his nest of reeds and rags and old blankets he blinked at the sun and then at luciano his dilated eyes not focusing properly well asked luciano i gota thingi got to do the man said through stiff lips eyes still hazed with the drug the goddess gave you a task huh but i donti donti got to take care of a couple of children his pupils were still dilated but there was a certain despair in his voice luciano kept his satisfaction shuttered behind his own stony expression as he crouched down next to harrow in the reeds so buthow the hell am i going find her children what children whose children valdosta marco and benito valdosta if harrow was confused about why the goddess would be concerned over the welfare of lorendanas two children he wasnt showing it but then harrow had never been strong on logic how the hell am i going to find them luciano spread his arms wide with his hands palmupwards and looked to the sky taking on dignity and power as he deepened his voice this was the part he played the best he knew thanks to another very minor piece of magic that the former montagnard assassin now saw him haloed in a haze of dim white light every time he took that particular pose harrow would see him glowing with the power of the goddess praise be the goddess blessed are the vessels of her will her ways are beyond all mortal understanding he lowered his eyes to meet harrows she has you in her plan harrow shes had you there from the start of the world she weaves the threads of destiny on her loom marco valdosta is right here harrow in the swamp hes hiding out an hes scared he damnwell needs protecting hes a good child and this here is a bad place but hes nervous and hes touchy he wont let nobody near him except them as he knows like me and sophia you want to watch over him fine thats the goddesss will but if you show yourself hell run i can promise that if he even guesses youre there hell run you want to keep him from running further and right into more trouble you stay right out of sight as harrow nodded understanding luciano rose and stepped off the islet into the kneedeep murky water of the swamp harrow followed showing no more discomfort than luciano come on thenill show you where to keep watch on him without him knowing youre there marcos hands ached with the cold as he worked without really thinking about what he was doing he was trying to hold his mind in a kind of numb limbo as numb as the rest of him was getting he was doing his best to avoid thinking to just exist the cold and the damp were making his nose run and the slap of water and the hushing of wind in the reeds and the little sounds he was making were punctuated by his sniffles his raft and hideout had been where hed left themand as hed expectedtheyd been stripped the hidey was still in surprisingly good shape all things considered marco was grateful he hadnt had much other good luck lately even with the water level in the swamp at high water it had been cruel hard work to pole the raft out of his old territory and into giannis gianni had ruled one of the best territories in the marsh there was an unobstructed view of the city across the water and a nice stock of food plants as well as two really good fishing holes and a couple of solid islets marcos arms and back were screaming with pain before he got his home to its new location and if he hadnt been working hed have been threequarters frozen as it was he was soaked to the skin and glad of the change of dry clothes in his pack he had moored the raft up against the islet with the camouflaging hideout over it it would look like an extension of the island the sun was a dim gray disk above the horizon when hed gotten set up properly despite the cold hed been sweating with exertion even his feet were almost warm hed been up since before dawn and by now it seemed as if it should be nearly nightfall not barely morning from the islet he gathered rushes and sedge to weatherproof the hideout against the winter rains and winds then it was nothing but drudgework crouch over the framework and interlace the vegetation into it grass then sedge then reeds then grass again until it was an untidy but relatively windproof mound with only his hands moving evening coming on and the wind chilling him hed lost all the heat hed gained by the time he was ready to thread new tall reeds into the top of the bushy hammock to renew its disguise it was well towards full darkness when hed finished to his satisfaction he was exhausted and cold all the way through still soaked to the skin and more than ready for the sleep hed lost last night but he hadnt forgotten his old lessons he made more trips to the center of the islet for old dry grasses stuffing the cavity beneath the hideout with them he crawled under the basketlike hideout and stripped putting his soggy clothing between the mattress of dry grasses and his bottom blanket to dry while he slept then he curled up into his grassandblanket nest to shiver himself to almostwarmth then sleep the sleep of the utterly exhausted it was a far cry from the cozy bed hed left in aldantos apartment if he hadnt been so cold and tired he might have cried himself to sleep as he returned to his own islet wading through the reeds luciano did not notice the sudden swirl in the nearby deep water as if a large fish had been attacked by a larger and was making a desperate escape nor did he notice the undine a short time later slowly raising her head above water and studying him as he made his way back to the camp he shared with sophia a small streak of blood dripped from the undines sharptoothed mouth the mouth gaped wide expressing satisfaction then the undine slid beneath the surface of the water and was gone chapter when the shamans human form had returned sufficiently to enable him to speak the grand duke leaned forward from his throne and touched the shoulder of the man squatting before him then brought the fingers to his heavy lips and tasted the water which soaked the shamans fur cloak the taste was that of the stinking waters of the jesolo marshes that and some blood well the grand dukes shaman shook his head the gesture was not one of uncertainty it was one of fear the mans lips were trembling it is dangerous lord the strega is not powerful but he knows a great deal even now and so long as he remains in the jesolo he has protectors the shaman winced rubbing his shoulder as always the shapechange had healed the wound but the pain lingered the undines teeth had been sharp and jagged the priest did you find him i need to know where he goes when he leaves his quarters the shaman hesitated tried to control his trembling lips this question was far more dangerous than any undine i sensed him lord yes impossible not to anywhere in venice even in the marshes i could sense him though not strongly his presence is very strong anywhere in the vicinity of the ghetto the shaman paused hoping that answer would satisfy his master he kept his eyes lowered his shoulders hunched under the heavy cloak at all costs he wished to avoid the grand dukes gaze jagiellons eyes were frightening do not annoy me slave or i will send you back into the forests of karelen with your shapechanging powers severely stunted difficult to be a shaman without a hide i will eat your skin the shaman was frozen for a moment the grand dukes threat was not an idle one not in the least the shaman had seen his master eat a retainers skin thrice before the first time the skin had belonged to the shamans predecessor the grand duke had required the shaman to taste the meal first before jagiellon devoured the remainder on the off chance that a fanatic might have poisoned his own skin before displeasing the ruler of lithuania with his incompetence it is dangerous lord whined the shaman for you as much as me the priest is much less knowledgeable than the strega buthe is very strong very strong the shaman rubbed his temples with both hands brackish water soaked through the fingers it hurt my head just being near him a massive hand seized the shamans shaggy hair and jerked his head up look at me despite his terror the shaman dared not disobey for all that he desperately desired to close his eyes he met the grand dukes stare the moment lasted for the shaman knew not how long it seemed endless but eventually the grand duke relinquished his iron grip and allowed the shamans head to sag forward i will tolerate your cowardice for the moment there is some truth to what you say the priest is indeed very strong the grand dukes huge hands tightened on the armrests of his throne he swiveled his massive head and stared at the window facing to the south as was true of all the windows in jagiellons private chambers this one was covered with heavy drapes the drapes dark red against the dark brown wooden walls gave the room an almost funereal atmosphere i have already punished those who did not prevent his mission to venice said the grand duke so softly it almost seemed as if he were speaking to himself intolerable incompetence the man himself asked leave to go to the holy land and the grand metropolitan is a weakling it should have been easy to arrange the shaman relaxed a bit as was always true with jagiellons underlings the news of anothers punishment came as a great relief the grand duke needed punishment in his diet as much as food and he ate both in prodigious quantities still he was not exactly a glutton one or two lithuanian agents in rome deadmost likely by poison or knife possibly by magicmeant less chance of a shamans skin being fried in vilna the shaman even made so bold as to speak for all his strength lord the priest is groping in the dark best to leave him there until it is too late whereas if you strike at him and the thing is mishandled or goes awry ensconced in his heavy robes of office the body of the grand duke filled the chair to overflowing when the body shifted as it did now the sturdy piece of furniture creaked alarmingly with as much alarm if not more the shaman studied that shifting form surreptitiously from under lowered eyelids suggesting that the grand duke might be contemplating error as the shaman was now doing was risky the shaman was relieved to see that the shifting seemed more a matter of a heavy body adjusting its weight than of one gathering itself for the attack the grand dukes obesity as the shaman had many occasions to recall was deceptive beneath the rolls of fat lay slabs of muscle whose power went beyond the human and while jagiellon was now a great sorcerer in his own right the ruler of lithuania was partial to more physical means of expressing his displeasure as a prince before the fat which came upon his body after the change jagiellon had been a famous warrior um jagiellon said no more than that for a few minutes throughout that time the shaman squatted silently unmoving his eyes hidden under the lowered brow and the great mane of shaggy hair trying to make himself as inconspicuous as possible you may be right mused the grand duke eventually it is certainly true that when i let the woden escape the results were unfortunate i had thought the lions slumber to be a heavier thing the shaman dared to speak again that was the strength of the priest at work lord he is dangerous yes again silence impervious to seduction also it seems i had hopes for that tool but she is proving less useful than desired there was a slight edge to the last words from long experience the shaman knew that a death sentence had just been passed he felt a small regret the tool in question was as beautiful as she was evasive thus far unlike the other female in venice she had managed to retain her own soul but the shaman knew it would have been only a matter of time before jagiellon broke her to his will after which as was his way he would allow his chief underlings to enjoy the woman but the regret was small and fleeting there would be other beautiful women being in service to jagiellon was as rewarding as it was perilous still she may be of use yet lord murmured the shaman if she has failed in that task she has succeeded in many others again the great body shifted and again the shaman grew tense but again it was simply an obese rulers discomfort true we will see in the meanwhile i have decided you are correct we will continue the murders but keep the woden on a tight leash and make no attempt for the moment to remove either the mage or the priest time is on my side after all venice grows more ragged by the day so long as the priest remains ignorant and the mage remains too terrified to act good enough the grand duke planted his hands on the arm rests of the chair and heaved his great gross body erect leave now the shaman bobbed his head rose and scuttled from the room he left behind him a trail of foulsmelling water in addition to the pool which had collected before the grand dukes throne where he had squatted but the shaman was not concerned about that jagiellon was not fastidious not in the least when the door closed behind him the shaman finally heaved the great sigh of relief he had been suppressing he was always relieved when he left jagiellons presence of course but never more so than when he could hear the heavy robes slithering to the floor and smell behind him the coming transformation moving as rapidly as he could without actually running he scurried down the corridors of the palace in vilna it would take the shaman some time to reach his room for he had deliberately chosen quarters as far away as possible from those of jagiellon as far away in fact as the immense and sprawling palace permitted the distance was still not enough as far as the shaman was concerned the stench was getting stronger by the moment seeming to follow him like a hound none of the various guards whom he passed noticed it of course they did not possess the shamans other senses chernobog was feeding chapter benito hadnt worried when hed awakened and seen that marcos bed was empty marco had been going to work early the past few weeks working in a frenzy of earnest activity all day and leaving work late old man ventuccio himself had come down out of his office to see the handiwork of his new clerk too bad marco hadnt been there at the time hed been out at lunch and nobody thought to mention it to him when he came back of course the other clerks were probably jealoushalf of them were ventuccio hangerson anyway worthless cousins who werent expected to accomplish much for their salary benito thought he knew why marco had been working so hardhe might be hoping to get an advance on his wages hed spent all the cash hed saved on caesare and in a week the rent was due on their apartment in cannaregio a runner earned about a quarter of what a clerk earned benito couldnt pay it and if marco couldnt raise the ready it was back to the leaky attics for both of them unless aldanto would let them stay on which wasnt really likely maria was getting an impatient and irritated look whenever her eyes happened to fall on them shed been snapping at marco for being underfoot and it was clear to benito that theyd worn out their welcome once aldanto had recovered from the fever he had a fair notion that it was caesare overruling maria that was keeping him and marco in the apartment and that despite benitos being smartmouthed with both of them with marco too which marco hadnt much noticed but he had noticed benitos attitude with aldanto that had gotten a rise out of him more than benito had intended hed backedno slammedbenito into the wall the night before last and his face had been so cold so tortured you listen to me benito you listen to me good youre messing with fire ill tell you once and not again caesares an aristocrat hes quietbut hes killed more people than you have hair and youd better think about that hard before you smart him off another time i dont know why hes putting up with you but i wont not any more ill beat you black and blue next timebecause id rather you were beaten up than dead remember hes a trained assassin remember who trained him and that they murdered mama before you open your mouth to caesare again hed sulked for the rest of that day and most of the next not speaking to marco but he had thought about it and hed come to the reluctant conclusion that marco had been right even if marco was more than a bit touched about some girl so hed started to make friendly noises at his brother again thus allinall he didnt think twice about marco being gone but when marco wasnt at work and didnt show up there by the time benito got sent out with his first message he began to worry just a little he came around the corner of ventuccios on his second run of the day and saw a familiar gondola tied up at the base of the stairs with a lurch of foreboding no mistaking that particular tilt of a weatherbeaten hatthat was marias gondola down there and with maria in it and where maria was man to see you boy was the curt greeting at the door sure enough behind benitos supervisor stood caesare aldanto wearing that impassive mask that said trouble benito caesare barely waited for ned ventuccio to get out of earshot before starting in and benito backed up a pace or two until his back was against the office wall benito have you seen your brother this morning benito decided to play innocent you mean he aint here he replied making his eyes big and round aldanto was not fooledand the flash of annoyance in his eyes told benito that he was not in the mood for this sort of nonsense aw hellmarcos in trouble you know damned well he hasnt been here aldanto hissed grabbing benitos arm before he could dart out of reach your brothers in a messnow i want to know what it is and where he is i dont know mlord caesare honest lord the strength in that hand benito belatedly began to think about what marco had told him when hed given him that lectureabout what caesare wasand what he could do and he began to wonder what if the man had turned his coat a second time if he was planning to use benito to get to marco and sell marco back to the montagnards marco was worth plenty to the right people paranoid that was plain paranoid thered been no hint of any such thing butif the montagnards threatened maria would he buy safety for maria with marcos life he might oh god aldanto might boy i want you back in the apartment aldanto was saying ive made it right with the ventuccios benito had missed what had gone before god this did not sound good there was no threat that benito could read in aldantos face but dare he take the chance that he could read an experienced agent aldanto still had his arm in that iron grip and was pulling him out of the door with him benitos mind was going like a scrap of drift in a strong current he couldnt take the chance no way he had to get away from caesare if he could besides if marco was really in trouble benito could likely help him better than some milanborn foreigner or even a canaler like maria could he knew the town and knew most of the dark ways and there was always valentina and claudia to call on if he had to they were out on the balcony now benito playing docile and aldanto loosed his grip just enough benito whipped around putting all his weight behind a wicked blow with his elbow and hed aimed a bit lower than aldantos midsectionaimed at something more personal hit it too dead on target caesare was wideopen and completely taken by surprise he doubled over with a painful wheeze and loosened his grip on benitos arm benito lit out like a scalded cat heading around the balcony and straight for the bridge aldanto started yellingrecovering faster than benito had figured he would and began running after him but benito had gotten a good twenty feet worth of a head start and that was all he needed he made the bridge supports and jumped for the crossbeams swarming up into the scaffolding like one of venices feral cats from there he made it to the rooftops and as he knew from long experience there was no way an adult was going to be able to follow him up therenot unless the adult was another roofwalking thief like valentina it was cold up there and doubly dangerous with the wind so strong and unexpected patches of wet everywhere and smoke blowing into his face when he least expected it benito didnt stop for breath though not until hed gotten halfway across castello then he slumped in a warm spot between two chimneys for a bit of a rest and a bit of a think marco was in troublethat much was certain either with aldanto or on his own and benito was going to have to see what he could do about itif he could find out what the trouble was the last person marco had talked tothat he knew ofwas rafael de tomaso benito reckoned hed better pay that fellow a little visit so best to lie low for a bit then get across the grand canal to dorsoduro hed been to rafaels room once and benito figured he knew of a way in that wasnt by the door katerina looked out of the high window of one of towers of casa montescue at the gathering dusk it was a slaty gray evening the lagoon was gray too chopped and flecked with white it was going to be bitter out there tonight still she had no choice well she could become a courtesan francesca had managed to make thatoccupationseem even less attractive than kat had thought possible and she hadnt thought it was in the least bit attractive to begin with stillat least shed get to spend miserable evenings indoors and it wasnt as if shed ever met any one man she felt shed like to be tied to but it would kill her grandfather kat montescue was a realist though one day she might just have no choices and at least a courtesan had some choices and more independence than most wives could dream of and unlike many case vecchie she did have one of the essential requirements for being a courtesan and not just a whore she was literate still the idea of multiple lovers many of them old and corpulent was repugnant to say the least francesca could put a bold face on it but the idea still frightened kat when shed been a girl shed always thought that shed marry a young and handsome man the trouble was in venice most of the young and handsome case vecchie were off in various trading colonies of the venetian republic of course some of the older menlike lord calentiwere still attractive at least in their own opinion she pulled a wry face this was all foolishness she might have the education and literacy but that was hardly sufficient she didnt have the lush beauty of someone like francesca not even close so it would be out in the dark on a nasty night again and there was an end to it lodovico came in rubbing his hands and looking worried what did you think of lord calentis visit cara mia kat bit her lip she could hardly tell her grandfather that she thought the man had too high an opinion of himself and that shed always thought there was something vaguely slimy about calenti although she allowed that other than being so obviously vain he had been pleasant enough a surprising visitor but pleasant withal alessandra had been in an absolute fury when shed discovered that one of venices most eligible bachelors had come on a private call on milord montescueand not one involving her i dont understand why he came grandpapa calenti had been perfunctorily polite to kat nothing more so he certainly hadnt come to see about her or had he kat hadnt considered that possibility she suddenly realized casa calenti had plenty of money but they were not really case vecchie for them a dowry would not be as important as the social advancement involved in marrying a girl from what was still despite their current misfortune one of venices handful of most prestigious families lodovico pulled a face i dont know how to tell you this kat waited blood draining to the pit of her stomach lodovico continued he wanted a small parcel of documents transported to constantinople kat her hasty assumptions knocked asunder could only manage to shake her head him lodovico montescue nodded he offered me a great deal of money for it kat sighed i wish you hadnt grandpapa her grandfather hugged her smiling katerina i didnt accept it in fact i rather indignantly refused does the man think me a fool its either spying treason or a trap kats eyes narrowed a trap lodovico chuckled the council of ten will assume we are clean as driven snow he scowled fiercely and i told him not to offer my granddaughter his slipslop compliments either katerina went down to her room to change into her warmest clothes in a far more cheerful frame of mind yes lord calenti would be just the man to set such a trap the cheerfulness lasted until she was out on the dark water battling the wind and the waves deliveries shed shifted to the daytime but collections from captain della tomasso were always at night always before moonrise and always off guidecca della tomasso was definitely a fence definitely a messenger for spies a smuggler and their lifeline he was a careful taciturn man and they owned his ship she hit a wave amidships and it splashed and slopped over the gunwale it was a good idea keeping the relationship between the illegal cargoes that captain della tomasso carried and the casa montescue as far apart as possible the old devil would load a legal cargo of salt beeswax and hides at the montescue warehouse not seventyfive yards from kats bedroom tomorrow morning of course his coaster would be clean as a whistle while the capi di contrada were about at the warehouse of course they couldnt chance passing incriminating parcels toandfro there but kat wished to hellby her halffrozen handsthat she could meet him somewhere closer to the casa chapter old habits woke marco with the first hint of dawnhed been so exhausted otherwise that hed have managed to sleep through to the afternoon hed spent a good part of the night with his teeth chattering hard enough to splinter until exhaustion put him to sleep for another hour or so he stuck his head out from under the hideout still shivering and peered around in the gray light no fog this morning though the sky was going to be overcast he pulled his head back in and checked his clothes where hed put them under his bottom blanket as hed hoped they were reasonably dry water driven out by the heat of his body he beat the worst of the dried mud out of them and pulled them on wrapped a blanket around himself pulled his cotte on over it all and crawled back out into the day he hopped from the edge of his raft onto the edge of the isletwhich was an exposed and weathered ledge of rock and a lot more solid than many a landing back in town he wriggled his way in to the center of the islet having to carefully pull his blanket and clothing loose when branches snagged them lest he leave telltale bits of yarn behind or rip holes in clothing he didnt have the wherewithal to repair he was looking for a place where he would be well hidden by the reeds and rushesat least hidden from the casual observer he finally found a dry spot one well padded by the accumulation of many years of dead reeds and made himself a little hollow to sit in he reckoned it would do well enough he hunched down into the hollow hugged his knees to his chest and settled down to the unpleasant task of confronting everything he wanted to avoid thinking about take it one step at a time all this time hed been casually saying to himself caesare will kill me for this looking at the mess hed made of things in the cold light of dawn and soberly recollecting his own lecture to benitomight he he might marco thought reluctantly and be justified if casa dorma take offense he could hand petro dorma my head and get himself out of it ive made myself into a pretty expensive liability but would he marco looked at it from all the angles he could think of and finally decided that he probably wouldnt aldanto never did get that drastic without having several reasons for doing it to be brutally frank aldanto was too much of a professional to waste anything even the time and effort it would take to dispose of a stupid child and maria would probably get upset if aldanto actually killed marco for all that the girl doted on her lover and had the usual canalers tough outlook on life marco didnt think that she really approved of caesares profession and he thought that underneath the temper she was actually quite fond of him and benito but just to be on the safe side rafael had suggested he hide out here about two weeks then come back into town get hold of benito firstgive him a note for caesare use the old montagnard codes and flat ask him if he thinks im better gotten out of the way permanentlike then make a counteroffer saysay that ill do what he wants me to do come in stay here or leave venice altogether the last wouldnt be easy or desirable from his point of view but hed do it he couldnt go northbut south maybe or maybe hire on as a hand on an outremerbound ship that was a possibility the sailors had seemed pretty rough characters but basically good people when hed met a couple at ventuccios but he had a fairly shrewd notion of what some of the duties of a very junior and passablelooking signon might well include and he wasnt altogether sure he could stomach the job better that though than dead no such thing as a fate worse than death in marcos bookexcept maybe a fate involving a lengthy interrogation at the hands of montagnards the servants of the holy trinity or ricardo brunellior caesare aldanto but benitoif he left venice hed have to leave benito no good could come to a fourteenyearold kid in a strange place like acre or ascalon or moreorless trapped on an eastbound ship that would leave him more alone than hed ever been he swallowed hard and wiped his sleeve across his eyes so be it for benitos sake hed do just about anything including take on that lengthy interrogation but figure caesare wanted him back in in a lot of ways that was the worst case si ill go in i take my licks god knows what hell do probably beat the liver out of me be worse if he didnt in some ways he wont be trusting me with much anyway not after the way ive messed up dont blame him i wouldnt trust me either so be humble be respectful take orders follow em to the letter and earn the respect back even if it takes years thank god hed told the truthat least hed cut the thing with angelina short before it had landed them in more tangles than could be cut loose give up on the notion of the accademiatoo close to the dorma especially with dorma cousins going there hang it up stay content with being ventuccios thirdrank clerk at least that paid the bills stay clear of anyplace angelina might show unless caesare ordered different keep clear of the strega too that meant valentina and claudia and barduccis tavernagain unless caesare ordered differently going back meant more than facing caesareit meant figuring a way to pay the damn bills with no money rent was paid until the end of the monthbut that was only one week away borrow from whom maria didnt have any to spare not caesare marco gnawed his lip and thought and thought himself into a circle no choice has to be caesare or beg an advance from ventuccio have to eat humble pie twice charity hell sometimes it seemed as if it would be a lot easier to find one of the marsh bandits and taunt them into killing him god knew it wouldnt take much but he hadnt fought and fought and fought to stay alive this long just to take the easy way out last possibilitythat caesare would tell him to stay that caesare would trust to the jesolo marshes to kill him rather than killing him outright well wasnt staying what marco had figured on doing in the first place all right if caesare told him to stay in the marsheswell marco would stay at least this time hed arrived equipped to do a little better than just survive not much but a little so long as he could keep clear of the bandits hed manage and he and benito could go back to the old routineat least hed be near enough to keep in touch nowthe montagnardshave i screwed up there too benito waded through mud and freezing water over his ankles mostly sometimes up to his knees his legs were numb his teeth were chattering so hard he couldnt stop them and his nose was running he kept looking over his shoulder feeling like he was being watched but seeing nothing but the waving weeds that stood higher than his head there was a path here of a sort and he was doing his best to follow it if he hadnt been so determined to find his brother hed have turned tail and run for home a long time ago rafael de tomaso had told him the whole messy story and had admitted that he had advised marco to go and hide out for a week or two until the thing could blow over benito had gotten a flash of inspiration right then and hadnt waited to hear morehed lit off over the roofs again it had taken him half an hour to reach the apartment in cannaregio to discover marcos belongings stripped right down to the books the fact that it was only marcos things ruled out thieves stuff gone plus hiding added up to marshes to benito so he put on every shred of shirt and cotte he had and two pairs of pants and made for the roofs again he had to get down to the roadways by the time he reached castello by then he had gotten the notion that it might just be a good idea to let maria and caesare know where marco had gone and to let them know he was headed out after him damn fool rafael hed cursed more than once damn marshes almost killed marco before thishell it could do it now damn fool citydweller thinks living in the jesolo in wintertime in the middle of the aqua alta is like living in the city so hed looked around for a boatman knowing that boatfolk stuck together knowing that what he told one would be halfway across town by midmorning hey hed yelled at the first head that poked out of a small pirogues cabin to peer at him blearyeyed in the dawnlight heyyou know maria garavelli might said the bargee old of dubious gender look you find her you tell her marcos headed out into the jesolo marshes and benitos gone after him then he added shrewdly theres money in it the whole canaler had popped out of the hidey then and the creature was jerking at his tierope as benito continued his run down to the sandbars off the eastern point of castello and the path marco had told him about he hoped he was right about the tide you could only get across there at deadlow marco had talked so casually about walking in among the islands and out into the jesolo benito was finding out now that it was anything but easy for one thing he could hardly tell where he was going what with the reeds being so high for another it was hard to follow this socalled path it was prone to having deep washouts where least expected he was wet to his collar and mired to his waist and it was a good thing that wool clothing stayed warm when wet or hed have been frozen into an icicle by now the swamp was eerily silent the only sounds being the splashing and sucking noises of his own passage and the murmur of a breeze in the reeds it was damned cold and it smelled to high heaven worst of all benito wasnt entirely certain that he wasnt lost marco he called hoping that he was close enough to the area marco had described chiano and sophia living in he hoped that his brother would be the one to hear him one heard horrible stories about the marshfolk marco harrow crouched in the cover of the reeds and rushes on the little muckandreed hummock luciano marina had led him to watching the boy or rather what he could see of the boy which from this angle was only the top of his head so far this business of guarding lorendanas kids had been absurdly easy hed stayed under cover most of yesterday watching the boy work on his hideout until he seemed finished then watching the hideout after the boy crawled into it to sleep then luciano marina had come to bring him some food and told him to get some sleep hed gone back to his hiding place near lucianos raft when dawn arrived so had luciano marina the strega had given him something to chew onkeeps the cold away hed saidand sent him back to his watchingplace so far all that the boy had done was to make a pocketsized fire and boil a pot of water for drinking other than that hed sat on the island for the past hour or more hidden in the reeds not moving harrow chewed the bittertasting woody stuff luciano marina had given him it made his head buzz pleasantly and did indeed keep the cold away he wondered what the kid was up to meditating neither luciano marina nor the vision of lorendana had said anything about the boy being mystical but it was a possibility given the goddesss interest in him well whatever it was certainly proving to be a lot easier than hed thought it was going to be he was too well trained to jump at the sudden sound of a shout echoing across the marsh it was the voice of a boy calling out a name echoing out of the depths of the swamp marco it was so distorted he couldnt really tell what direction it was coming from marco someone was looking for young valdosta he focused his attention on the boy just in time to see him slide off the islet and into the reeds fast as a lizard and nearly as silently harrow saw the weeds shake onceand the boy was gone saints that was benitos voice echoing among the islets if marco could hear him it was damn sure others could for all of his younger brothers savvy about the streets and canals of venice benito had no real understanding of the dangers which lurked in the marshes marco slid off the islet skidding on sharpedged rustling grass slipping on icy mud patches he splashed down onto the path ignoring the knifelike cold of the water and then began moving as quickly and quietly as he could he wove through the reeds hoping hed get to his brother before anyone else did but he must get there without getting ambushed himself marco made scarcely more noise than a snake keeping his feet under the icy water to avoid splashing slipping between the clumps of dry rattling rushes rather than forcing his way through them benitos one hope was that at this time of year most of the really bad locos were deeper into the marsh than this he burst into a tiny clearing unexpectedly knife at the ready practically on top of the kid marco benito flung himself at his brother heedless of the knife marco held looking well and truly frightened he clung to him as they both teetered in icy kneedeep mudclouded water marco returned the embrace relieved almost to the point of tears to find him safe benito he hugged him hard thank godthank god youre all right then marco looked up from the kid clinging to him to see that they had been surrounded on three sides it was the squalos a banditti gang of marsh locos a bad bunch too mostly younger than the general run of the swamp folk late teens to early thirties rumor had it they worked for slavers when supplies of suitable bodies in town ran low bodies tended to start disappearing from the swamp there were ten of them ragged dirty and predatory they had spaced themselves in a rough ovoid standing on high spots at irregular intervals between the reed hummocks at distances from fifteen to twenty feet from the two boys except on the side bordering the deep water feral eyes gazed hungrily at them from within tangles of filthy hair and beard they were in deep trouble marco slipped his spare knife from his belt feeling the hilt like a slip of ice in his hand and passed it wordlessly to benito then he shifted his own knife to his left hand and felt in his pocket for his sling and a stone he got the stone into the pocket of the sling onehanded and without taking his attention off the gang with the sling loose and ready in his right hand he shifted his weight from side to side planting himself a little more firmly in the treacherous icy mud and prayed his numb feet wouldnt fail him hear ye finished off big gianni marco one of the least ragged of the gang members stepped forward marco recognized the leader grimaldi by his shock of wild reddish hair hear yer got pretty good wi that sticker the redhead made a vaguely threatening gesture with his own thinbladed knife marcos hopes rose a littleif he could somehow convince them to go oneonone with him they might have a chance benito would anyway if he could talk the kid into running for it while the gangs attention was on the fight good enough to take you grimaldi he said raising the knife defiantly you want to dance maybe maybe the filthcaked scrawny gang leader replied swaying a little where he stood kneedeep in muddy water wisps of greasy red hair weaving around his face whats the matter grim whats matter you scared marco taunted as the blood drained out of benitos face and his eyes got big and frightened im not a kid anymore that it afraid to take me on now marco benito hissed tugging urgently at his soggy sleeve marco i dont think thats too smart the gang leader hesitatedand his own followers began jeering at him waving their arms around and making obscene gestures under cover of their catcalls marco whispered harshly to his younger brother benitodont argue for once dont i know what im doing dammit when you figure theyre all watching me you light out for deep water you swim no im not leavin you youll damn well do as i say no way shut up grimaldi roared effectively silencing all of them he sloshed forward a pace or two and grinned i aint afraid marco but i aint stupid neither i aint gonna get myself cut up for nothinnot when we can take both o ye an make a little bargain with the dandelo buyers for two nice young eunuchs his knife described a fast nasty low flick he sloshed forward another stephis last marcos right hand blurred and grimaldi toppled sideways into the mud wearing a rather surprised expression a rock imbedded in his temple there was a moment of stunned silence then the rest of the gang surged forward like a feedingfrenzy of weasels harrow lost the boy as soon as he slid into the reeds it took him longer than he liked to get to the place where the boy had vanished if this had been the mountains or a forest or a cityeven a weird city like venicehed have had no trouble tracking the kid here in this foul wilderness he was at something of a loss he floundered around in the mud feeling unnaturally helpless fine vessel of the goddess he washe couldnt even keep track of a dumb kid then he heard the shouting there was enough noise so that he had no trouble pinpointing the source even through the misleading echoes out there it sounded like trouble and where there was trouble he somehow had no doubt hed find the boy but getting there was a painfully slow process he literally had to feel his way step by cold slippery step waterweeds reached out for him snagging him so that he had to fight his way through them the noise echoed ahead of him driving him into a frenzy of anxiety as he floundered on past treacherous washouts and deposits of mud and silty sand that sucked at him until he was suddenly and unexpectedly in the clearing he blinkedthere was the boyno two boys standing at bay side by side on a hummock of flattened reeds they were holding offbarelya gang of mudsmeared tattered marshvermin one boy was marco merda the other was benito harrow saw the pattern of the goddesss weave it was too much to be coincidence first the vision then marco just happening to be holing up out in this godforsaken slimepitand now the other boy also turning up but the boys werent doing well theyd accounted for one of the crazies now floating bloodyheaded within arms reach of harrow but the others were going to overpower them before much longer marco had an ugly slash across his ribs that was bleeding freely and soaking into a long red stain along the front of his mudspotted tan cotte and even as harrow moved to grab a piece of driftwood to use as a weapon one of the crazies started to bring down a boathook aimed at the younger boys head benito harrow saw the horror in marcos eyes as the boy saw it coming and before benito could turn the older boy shoved him out of the way and took the blow himself the deadly hook missed but the boy took the full force of the pole on his unprotected head the pole brokethe boy sank to his knees and harrow waded into the fray from behind roaring in a kind of berserker rage wielding his driftwood club like the sword of an avenging angel the exmontagnard assassin used a blade by preference but he was every bit as expert with a cudgel his first blow landed on a skull with enough force to cave it in thereafter his opponents warned and trying to fend him off he shifted to the short and savage thrusts of an expert brawler and killer one throat crushed a rib cage splintered a diaphragm rupturedtwo more sent sprawling by vicious kicks the rest fled in a panic and faded into the swamp leaving behind four floating bodies and another crawling into the reeds coughing blood as he went there was a sudden absolute silence the younger boy had flung himself at his brother when marco had gone down and was holding him somewhat erect he looked around with wild eyes when the quietude suddenly registered with him his eyes fastened on harrow he paled and put himself as a frail bulwark of protection between the onetime montagnard assassin and his semiconscious brother harrow was struck dumb by a thought that approached a revelation those twotheyd die for each other my own brother might have killed someone for me but he wouldnt have been willing to die for me coming from the mercenary background that he did harrow had never known much affection or loyalty his mother had been a swiss mercenarys whore shed reared the boys as a way of making a living a poor substitute for the kind of living a daughter would have brought her but a living bespi had never experienced that kind of attachment he wouldnt have believed anyone who told him it existed but here it was and unmistakable those two boys would willingly give their lives for each other he held himself absolutely still not wanting to frighten the younger boy further they might have remained that way forever except for marco the boy began struggling to his feet distracting his brother so harrow was able to transfer the crude club he held to his left hand and take a step or two closer at that benito jerked around knife at the ready but the older boy forestalled him putting a restraining hand on his shoulder harrow met the disconcertingly direct eyes of the older boy with what he hoped was an expression of goodwill nno sfine ben the words were slurred but there was sense in the black eyes that met his f he meant us trouble he wouldnt have waded in to help us marco used his younger brothers shoulder to hold himself upright and held out his right hand marco he hesitated a moment valdosta dunno who you are butthanks harrow looked from the outstretched muddy hand to the candid honest face with its expression of simple pure gratitude he stretched out his own hand almost timidly to take the boys finding himself moved to the point of having an unfamiliar lump in his throat this boy wasgood that was the only way harrow could put it honest and good small wonder the goddess wanted this thread for her loom it was a precious golden thread one which would lift the other colors in the weave into brightness harrow had never known anyone he could have called simply good andso harrow had often been toldthe good die young resolve flared in eyes not this one as an assassin one of the most deadly killers the visconti had ever unleashed for the montagnard cause he had felt an almost sexual pleasure when he had fulfilled his missions when hed killed now a similar but richer feeling came displacing the old he was the vessel of the goddess and he was full full to overflowing he was only distantly aware of the impression of a great winged shadow passing over all of them the montagnards brought death to serve their purposes the goddess conserved life purpose and reasons flooded into harrow not this one death will not take him while i watch over him marco swayed in sudden dizziness and harrow sloshed through the churnedup mud to take his other arm and help keep him steady benito tensed then relaxed again when he realized that harrow was going to help not hurt them which way from here the vessel of the goddess croaked finding his voice with difficulty marco fought down dizziness as he grayedout a little heard the battered burntfaced stranger ask which way from here weve got to get him out of hereback to venice back where its warm and they can look after him benito replied hesitantly theres probably people out looking for him by nowand he aint in any shape to stay out here anyway marco gave in to the inevitable too sick and dizzy and in too much pain to argue the pathsthrough those two hummocks he said nodding his head in the right direction and setting off a skullfilling ache by doing so the three of them stumbled off down the rimpath making slow work of itespecially since they had to stop twice to let him throw up what little there was in his stomach he concentrated on getting one foot set in front of the other that was just about all he was up to at this point that and keeping from passing out altogether he was still survivaloriented enough to be aware that now that they were in the clear they were attracting the attention of the marsh dwellers with boatssome of whom were more dangerous than the squalos he tried to warn the other two but his tongue seemed to have swollen up and it was hard to talk but the walls of the arsenal were in sight now crumbling and waterlogged brickandwood looming up over their heads things began to whirl he couldnt possibly see the piazza san marco from here but he would swear he saw the pillar and the lion and the open book he struggled to read the words dont fall over yet marco benitos voice pleading dont die on me brother by an effort of will the whirling world steadied briefly there was a shout from behind just as a small boat came around the castello point an errant beam of sunlight glinted off blond hair in the bow and there was another darker figure waving at them frantically from the stern and there was ominous splashing growing nearer behind them the stranger on marcos left suddenly dropped his arm and marco and benito staggered as marco overbalanced then things got very blurred and very confusing the stranger bellowed behind them and there was the sound of blows and cries of anger and pain benito began hauling him along as fast as they could stumble through the weeds and muck then he was in waistdeep water with the sides of a gondola under his hands and he was simultaneously scrambling and being pulled aboard that was maria garavelli cursing under her breath beside his head and then a gun went off practically in his ear he tumbled onto the bottom slats and lay there frozen and wet and hurting shivering so hard he could hardly think with shouting going on over his head and another shot then they were under a winged leonine shadow as consciousness slipped away when he came to again it was to the sight of maria standing on the stern moving the gondola with steady easy strokes benito wrapped a blanket around him and helped him to sit up it was a good thing benito was supporting him he was shivering so hard now that he couldnt sit on his own he all right there was worry in marias voice that surprised him he need help lordhes bleeding aint he caesare aldanto was down on the slats beside him without marco seeing how he had got there he shut his eyes as much to hide his shame as to fight the waves of dizziness amazingly gentle hands probed his hurts cut along the ribslooks worse than it is but this crack on the skull marco swayed and nearly lost his grip on consciousness and his stomach when those hands touched the place where the boathook pole had broken over his head the pain was incredible it was followed by a combined wave of nausea and disorientation the hands steadied him then tilted his chin up open your eyes he didnt dare to disobey felt himself flush then pale the blue eyes that bored into his werent the dangerous cold eyes hed seen beforebut they were not happy eyes not good id judge so whats that mean maria asked harshly mostly that its his turn to be put to bed and he isnt going to be moving from there for a while you caesare was speaking to him now and marco wanted to die at the gentle tone of his voice have caused us a great deal of trouble young man ii didnt mean toi justi just wanted he felt and fought down a lump of shamed tears no no he would not cry i made such a mess out of things i figured you were better off if i went away somewhere i didnt mean to bring you more trouble i tried to find some way i could get you out of it and get out from under your feet and when that didnt work i just tried to do what was right if i had thought differently aldanto said slowly deliberately youd be out there entertaining the locos right now there are more than a few things i want to have out with you but its nothing that cant wait then he got up and took a second oar to help maria ignoring marcos presence on the bottom slats but that wasnt the end of his humiliationevery few feet along the canals it seemed they were hailed either from other boats or from the canalside si hes okay maria called back cheerfully si we got im apparently everybody in town knew what a fool hed made of himself there were calls of hoooso thats the loverboy eh throw him back maria hes just a piddly one with every passing minute marco felt worse finally he just shut his eyes and huddled in the blanket ignoring the catcalls and concentrating on his aching head because as if that humiliation wasnt enough there were more than a few of those on canalside who didnt shoutshadowy figures whom caesare simply nodded to in a peculiar way and marco recognized one or two as being giaccomos giaccomothat meant money a lot of money out of caesares pocket marco wanted to die the ribald and rude comments were coming thick and fast now as they headed into the grand canal maria was beginning to enjoy herself from the sound of her voice aldanto however remained ominously silent marco opened his eyes once or twice but couldnt bear the sunlightor the sight of that marblestill profile the third time he looked up his eyes met something altogether unexpected aldanto had shifted forward and instead of his benefactor marco found himself staring across the water at another gondola there was a girl in that elderly nondescript vessel rowing it with consummate ease from under the hood curled carrotyred hair she had a generous mouth a tiptilted nosemerry eyes wonderful hazel eyes she wasnt beautiful like angelina dorma but those eyes held a quick intelligence worth more and promising more than mere beauty those eyes met his across the grand canal and the grin on that face softened to a smile of genuine sympathy and then into a look of utter dumbfounded amazement which was maybe not surprising if she felt the shock of recognition that marco was feeling because even if hed never seen her before he knew her knew how the corners of her eyes would crinkle when she laughed knew how shed twist a lock of hair around one finger when she was thinking hard knew how her hand would feel warm and strong and calloused with work in his in that moment he forgot angelina dorma forgot his aching head forgot his humiliation he stretched out his hand without realizing hed done sosaw she was doing the same like an image in a mirror and then his eyes blurred and vision deserted him when his eyes cleared she was gone and there was no sign that shed ever even been there and he was left staring at the crowded canal not even knowing who she could be before he could gather his wits they were pulling up to the tieup in castello he managed to crawl under his own power onto the landing but when he stood up he didnt gray out he blacked out for a minute when he came to he had maria on the one side of him and caesare on the other with benito scrambling up the stairs ahead of them they got him up the stairs lord and saints that was a jobhe was so dizzy he could hardly help them at all aldanto had to all but carry him the last few feet then he vanished while marco leaned against the wall in the hallway and panted with pain maria it was who got him into the kitchen ignoring his feeble attempts to stop her she stripped him down to his pants with complete disregard for his embarrassment she cleaned the ugly slash along his ribs poured raw grappa in it that burned and brought tears to his eyes then she bandaged him up then cleaned the marshmuck off of him as best she could without getting him into water then she handed him a pair of clean breeches and waited with her back turned and her arms crossed for him to strip off the dirty ones and finally bundled him up into bed stopping his protests with a glass of unwatered wine he was so cold so cold all the way through that he couldnt even shiver anymore and his thoughts kept going around like rats in a cage only one stayed any length of time maria he said trying to get her attention more than once maria until finally she gave an exasperated sigh and answered what now maria he groped after words not certain he hadnt hallucinated the whole thing on the grand canalthere was this girl in a boata gondola maria please i got to find out who she is she stared at him then stared and then started a grin that looked fit to break her face in half a girl in a boat she started to laugh like shed never stop a girl in a boat saint zaccharia oh all the saints damn its almost worth the mess youve got us into she leaned on the doorframe tears coming to her eyes she was laughing so hard then she left him without an answer left him to turn over and stare at the wall and hurt inside and out left him to think about how hed lost everything that really meant anythingespecially aldantos respect about how the whole town knew what a fool he was about how hed never live that down and to think about how everything hed meant to turn out right had gone so profoundly wrong how he owed caesare more than ever left him to brood and try to figure a way out of this mire of debt until his head went around in circles he was going into the reaction that follows injury sophia had told him he tried desperately to recapture her words it was all vague he knew about that somewhere deep down but he didnt much care anymore he wouldnt ask for any more help not if he died of it maybe if he died if they found him quiet and cold in a couple of hours maybe theyd all forgive him then he entertained the bleak fantasy of their reaction to his demise for a few minutes before he dropped off to sleep chapter francesca looked out of her window onto the grand canal it will be nice here in spring not as nice as on the ligurian coast but still pretty she spoke calmly conversationallyas if erik had not come bursting in here three minutes back looking for manfred now he was sitting here being as polite as if in any venetian ladys salon and feeling utterly ill at ease erik swallowed francesca always left him not really sure of his ground she was so alien to him different from his expectations especially after that first meeting by the time the second one occurred he was floundering francescas new residence could he supposed be technically referred to as a bordello but it was like no bordello erik had ever seen there was no salon downstairs where halfnaked women lounged for the inspection of the customers in factother than presumably in the privacy of their own very spacious and luxurious apartmentsthe women were always extremely well dressed and not flirtatious in the least in the blatant manner that erik expected from whores erik glanced around trying to keep himself from fidgeting francescas apartment was on the third floor of the casa louise it had a large salon and a balcony and windowsreal glass windowslooking out over the hustle and bustle of the grand canal as always when he arrived to round up manfred she had greeted him like a lady when he came in the doorand as always now she was dressed like one well a lady with a taste in lowcut upthrust bodices erik found it nearly as distracting as her nudity had been while they waited for manfred to get dressed francescaas alwaysengaged erik in genteel conversation he had found her intelligent wellread and with a political background that made him feel naive to his backcountry icelandicvinlander values a whore was a whore a lady was a lady the concept of a courtesan was new to him and he still wasnt sure how to deal with it or how to protect his charge from her or evena very new and heretical thought thiswhether his charge needed to be protected from her you cant really stop him you know how had she known what hed been thinking about well it was no use beating about the bush despite his warnings either manfred had said something to her or her very quick mind had picked it up i must erik said stiffly it is my duty to care for him to keep him under my eye and train and protect him from entanglements too francesca laughed musically poor erik he must be a great trial to you it was all erik could do to keep himself from agreeing manfred was a tearaway there was no getting away from it half the taverns and a fair number of the women in the empire could testify to that i do what i have to do madame she gurgled the title is premature erik but it is correct i shall either be a madame or simply retire with considerable wealth after a career as a courtesan perhaps marry one of my clients at the endsome plump cheerful rich old merchant looking to stay cheerful in his dotage i have no longterm designs on young manfred he is amusing and energetic he is also young his fancy will turn elsewhere and some sweet young thing can be very grateful that i have polished him a little she patted erik on the arm gently he tried very hard not to be distracted by her soft skin he is safer here with me than on the street the owners of this building take great precautions there are mistresses of men from all factions and courtesans who could entertain a man who is montagnard tonight and one who is a petrine legate tomorrow this is one of the safest places in all venice there was some shouting and catcalling down on the canal below ah francesca smiled they must have found him who francesca moved to open the doors onto the balcony someone has been spending a great deal of money looking for a youngster who got himself into trouble with a girl if my informant is to be believed with one of the daughters of the casa dorma no less it is a long and complicated romantic story erik blinked do you know everything francesca dimpled i do my best theyd gone out onto the balcony as the gondola which was drawing the comments drew near ah that must be him the darkhaired one in the bow erik looked and saw a very recognizable handsome blondhaired man also in the gondola do you also know who the blond fellow is francesca looked amused of course caesare aldanto once of milan reputed to have once been a montagnard agent a sellsword under the shadow of the hand of none other than ricardo brunelli hes also the man who is directly responsible for us meeting you francesca said erik dryly she smiled again and turned him back to the warm apartment then i owe him but i dont think ill tell him so he set up that fiasco it would have been different if manfred hadnt deliberately fooled me and been there too i would have probably been deadcertainly injured your sellsword is awfully good with that sword of his so he takes orders from ricardo brunelli who is this brunelli by your tone he is a big cheese here in venice erik hoped his tone did not betray the fact that he intended to see the cheese sliced down to size have you found erik a girl my demoiselle asked manfred who had finally come out of the bedroom giving eric a brief glimpse of a rumpled large brass bed francesca turned to him manfred did you dress entirely by guess come here let me fix your collar your friend has ambitions on killing the head of the house brunelli manfred was obviously better informed than he was probably by francesca ha you dont start low do you erik who is he manfred it appears hes the bastard who set me up to be killed at the house of the red cat francesca smiled as she neatly twitched the neckband of manfreds shirt into shape he is the man who believes he will be the next doge i dont think you can do that erik said manfred seriously i dont think even mythe emperorcould stop the venetians hanging the lot of us besides said francesca aldanto is reputed to be for sale confidentially to the highest bidder it may have had nothing to do with brunelli he sounds like the sort to have influence with these venetian schiopettieri francesca shook her head not really any of the signori di notte could have done it but brunelli is not one of them manfred stretched i know you dont like the idea erik but i still think you need look no further than our dear abbot erik shrugged sachs says he sent pellmann to me with a message that the raid was off pellmann has enough of a grudge against me to not deliver it im not a north german ritter and you didnt beat him so he didnt respect you said manfred with a grin youre a callous brute erik how could you treat the man like that no wonder he ran off francesca laughed and what the two of you do not see is that that does not add up aldanto being the organizer of that ambush and the time at which the schiopettieri arrived adds up to two things money and influence venetian influence how would this pellmann have access to either he was not a venetian was he pomeranian said erik couldnt even make himself understood in the local dialect despised all southerners and venetians most of all francesca sighed i think you will find hes dead manfred snorted well thats no loss to the world unless sharing von tiemans squireorderly is worse erik erik shook his head no hes a nice enough old fellow a bit slow upstairs probably from all those slaps around the head von tieman gives him hes pathetically grateful that i dont but why kill pellmann and if it wasnt him arranging it in a piece of spite who was it it cant be the abbot manfred me being wounded or killed or even captured in a raid by the local constabulary on a brothel would have shamed the knightsand by extension the servants manfred shook his head believe me if they had caught you the abbot would have been the first person to be shocked that you were there it was a setup i tell you i dont believe it said erik stubbornly i have opposed him truein a relatively minor matterbut surely thats not worth the effort and money such a plot would take he could just send me home manfred grinned heh id be sent off on the next boat just think no uncle erik to ride herd on me erik didnt say anything francesca was there but he smiled and shook his head his duty was to protect manfred there were certain steps he would have to take if the abbot tried to send him away a signet ring to be used in dire emergencies well the thought of my running wild has shut erik up hes even forgotten hes come to hale me away for guard duty goodbye my sweet until tomorrow francesca shook her head not until thursday manfred as you well know a look of pouting hurt spread over manfreds face i wish youd give this up i thought you loved me she smiled and patted his cheek and i do but not exclusively he put his bulky arms around her waist and drew her close his face growing sulky francesca gave him a quick easy kiss but her hands were on his chest gently pushing him away please manfred you could not begin to afford keeping me for yourself and you know it as well as i do so enjoy what we have but francesca he pouted thursday build up your strength her next kiss was firm and dismissive on their way back observing manfreds clumping steps from the corner of his eye erik found himself fighting down a smile for oncehaeven the happygolucky imperial prince seemed to have met a woman who confounded him perhaps sensing his companions humor manfred shrugged thick shoulders what can i do he demanded in a tone which was halfamused and halfexasperated next to francesca all the other women in this town are just boring his stillyoung face seemed for just a moment even younger than it was its not fair im being ruined for a normal life of whoremongering blackly you watch before you know it shell be reading to me in bed erik held his tongue but he finally decided francesca was right maybe some young girl out theresome eventual princesswould thank her for the training she was giving manfred he was far too used to getting his own way with women as much as anything else being stymied and befuddled was undoubtedly good for the royal young lout as a guardian and a warriormentor erik still regretted the incident that had led manfred into consorting with francesca because of the debt between them he hadnt been able to deal with it as decisively as he usually would have but yes there was truth in what shed said he simply couldnt watch the young hellion twentyfour hours a day manfred was as safe with francesca as in the imperial embassy from which manfred had found at least three unofficial exits if he could leave then anyone could enter too erik had pointed this out to the abbot to be told that the rite of enclosure precluded it all erik could say was that the rite appearedas testified by manfreds presence in the casa louiseto be ineffectual and he supposed just as he was seeing to some aspects of the education of the future duke of brittany and possible heir to the holy roman emperors throne francesca was also erik blushed a little these were certainly areas he was ignorant of and besides that she was knowledgeable about other things which erik knew little aboutsuch as the political intrigue that seemed to be the heart of the venetian republic the italians seemed to relish it it left him puzzled and with a feeling of distaste but this was what manfred would have to deal with when erik went back to iceland and thence to vinland chapter benito hadnt missed the subtle little signals aldanto was passing to those shadowlurkers canalside benito knew those shadows knew them for giaccomos knew how much they cost was totaling up that cost in his head and coming to a sum that scared the socks off of him all thatfor marco oh hell he began doing some very hard thinking about the time they hit the grand canal hed made up his mind by the time they reached the house in castello aldanto helped to get marco as far as the kitchen then let maria take over he headed for the sitting room and stood looking out of the window in the dim sunlight arms crossed over his chest handsome face brooding and worried benito made himself a silent shadow following him mlord he said quietly as soon as they were alone aldanto startedbarely visibly controlling an automatic reaction of defense benitos quick eyes caught it all and his evaluation of caesare rose considerably damnhes good if he can pull his reaction after all thishes damned good bettern anybody ive ever seen what the man said shortly obviously not in a mood for more nonsense mlord he said soberly as caesare regarded him over one shoulder iim sorry about the he gestured flushing where i hit you youre sorry the exmontagnard was actually speechless mlordlisten a minute please i didnt know what to think thought maybe you might havewellmarco might be worth a bit to the right people thought i might have turned my coat again is that it aldanto looked very odd a little amused and maybe a little understanding mlord i didnt blame youi was thinking maybe somebodys been leaning on you if i was you reckon id swap a kid for maria if i had tohard choice butthats the way id be doing it benito kept his eyes on aldanto and thought he saw a thoughtful gleam there sohey i thought you didnt have marco you might use me to get to marco so i let you have it where it could count so as i could scat im afraid boy caesare said quietly that this once you were wrong benito preferred not to think about what that peculiarly phrased sentence might mean if he examined it too closely look mlord i told youyou got a hard choice to make you make the best one you can happens i was wrong this timebut im sorry hey now benito got down to business i think my brother cost you more than you could afford no ive got eyesand i know what giaccomos rates are aldantos own eyes narrowed speculatively but he said nothing mlord caesare i used to figure there was one person worth spending all i had to keep alive and that was my brother now i figure theres two he felt more than heard maria come in behind him that was all right nothing he was going to say now that he didnt want maria to hear well maybe three except maria back there can take care of herself i reckon but the other ones you we owe you mlord aldanto turned to face him fully i may be able to salvage something from marcos poetry he said dryly i wish hed told me about it earlier he shifted his weight to one foot but what is the point of telling me something i know its this mlordmarco hes good ye know im not goodim trouble i dont know how but the dellestemy grandfatheralways knew that even when i was a kid you take care of marco he told me the good ones need us bad ones to keep them safe aldantos right eyebrow rose markedly im not exactly popular with the duke of ferrara boy how do you think hed feel about the company youre keeping now benito shrugged thats not my problem he just told me i was to take care of marco aldanto looked pensive but he said nothing benito continued nervously but determined mlord i he waved his hands helplessly i guess what i want to say is this you got into this mess because of us it cost you you didnt have to do it well im guessing but i figure you might need help well from now on you say and ill do whatever however for as long as you like and theres some things im not too shabby at the eyebrow stayed up caesare made no pretence that he didnt understand what benito was talking about and if i sayno noise benito remembered a certain window and a certain escapade that no longer seemed so clever and the shadowy men on the canalside walkwaysand shuddered then itll be quiet mlord real quiet babies wouldnt wake up and how long can i expect this sudden fit of virtue to last caesare asked with heavy irony itll last mlord long as you got use for me though i reckon benito grinned suddenly engagingly youll have to crack me over the ear now and again claudia used toabout once a week caesares eyes narrowed a little as he studied benito the boy held steady beneath that merciless gaze neither dropping his own eyes nor shifting so much as an inch finally aldanto nodded in apparent satisfaction youll do as i say exactly as i say no arguments yes mlord no arguments mlord i can spot a professional when i see one mlord happen you could teach me more than a bit no i learn quick even valentina says so one other thing thoughmarco he went an spent all the rent money on your medicine and both of us had to leave work to help out here so theres nothing saved benito was not averse to rubbing that in just to remind aldanto that theyd already bankrupted themselves for him and that debt could work both ways he got a bit of satisfaction when this time he definitely saw caesare wince moneys a bit tight benito shrugged i understand giaccomos boys dont come cheap but were broke so we either got to stay here or hit the attics again happens the attics are no bad notion youve got to get over the roofs to get in themhard for folks to sneak up on you aldanto shook his head closing his eyes for a moment mercy he mumbled what have i let myself in for this time he cast a glance behind benito mariayouve got some stake in this too benito didnt look around but heard maria flop down in a chair behind him i think its no bad idea she said let them stay here lots of comings and goingsmaybe not all by doorsconfuse the hell out of any watchers aldanto looked over at benito again and benito had the peculiar feeling of seeing someone quite near his own age looking at him out of those adult eyes for one brief flash hey the attics aint so bad he gave a token protest i lived there two years you get some heat from the house and if you keep quiet you dont get found out and have to move too often better than the marshes by a long way aldanto shook his head id rather you were where i could see you benito shrugged well if you let us stay we stay but weve got jobs well kick in youd better that was maria behind him caesare shook his head again sighed well then benito valdosta i think we may have a bargain even if my bones tell me it may well be a partnership made in hell benito just grinned hey not for you mlord but for people acting unfriendlylike against a team like the three of us you me and maria mlord caesare they havent a chance harrow had panicked at first when hed seen who was picking the boys uphed broken out of the knot of fighting loco hed tipped into the water and struggled vainly to get to the gondola before it could carry the boys off the treacherous bottom had betrayed him by the time hed hauled himself out of the washout the two boys were aboard the gondola and being sculled away back into the shadowed bowels of the city then recollection came to him and he edged past the brawl back into depths of the swamp comforted by this new evidence of the goddesss intervention aldanto was former montagnard a man with an assassins knowledge a snakes cunning an eels ways a duelists defenses if the montagnards were after the boys what better protection could they have than that of the man who knew most about the ways the visconti operated from firsthand experience but the goddess had charged him with watching over themand aldanto was only one man he couldnt be everywhere at once and he couldnt spend all his time awake so that meant harrow should return to the city luciano was pleased with his converts plans secretly the man responded well to manipulation it was necessary to rant at harrow about the folly of them until he was hoarsebut harrow simply held his peace until luciano ran out of words and then repeated his intentions im going back in he said simply the goddess put it on me the jobs not done till she says so she said to watch the boys so im watching the boys luciano sighed cant argue with her or you he said glumly concealing his triumph but you got any notion where youre going harrow nodded slowly know where aldanto lives know lots of watchin holes around castello you just go to the boys friends if you run into trouble hear me claudiathats th main one singer works out of barduccis tavern lives second floor you told me that already harrow did not add what he was thinkingthat he probably could teach this strega more than a few things about covert work he had little respect for female agents most of them were damned little use out of bed he was itching to get out and get movingluciano had given him some other drug that cleared his mind and fired his feeling of purpose to a nearobsession and every moment spent dallying only made the urge to get into place stronger all right get moving luciano growled i can see youve no more interest nor purpose out here harrow did not wait to hear anything more chapter petro dorma refolded the letter and bestowed it and the bundle of poems in his own desk he ignored his sisters gasp of outrage hed had years of practice you you give that back to me yelled angelina her face red i brought it here so you could deal with the little upstart if you wont ill get someone who will petro took a deep breath angelina you have been carrying on a clandestine correspondence with this lovestarved puppy you know as well as i do that half the case vecchie would send an unmarried virgin off to a nunnery for that your fury seems to be entirely directed at this unfortunate and obviously besotted young marco felluci not because he wrote you some very inaccurate if flattering poems but because you thought the poems came from someone else would you care to tell me who this caesare your young swain refers to is angelina dorma looked sullen give me back my letters no petro looked at his sister almost twenty years younger than he and still a child when their father had died shed been pampered his mother had needed someone to turn to and spoil andwell so had he she could be very taking very sweet even now when shed been younger hed never had the heart to refuse her anything hed seen giving her whatever shed desired as a way of making up for her missing out on having papa hed always felt guilty about that hed been twentyfive already making his own way in the world marked and shaped by ernesto dormas hand shed been six now he was beginning to realize that he and his mother had been the ones whod missed ernesto angelina had hardly known him hed been his fathers shadow angelina of course had not been allowed to go to the dockyards and timberyards angelina that is caesare aldanto isnt it her outthrust lower lip confirmed it hes a bad man angelina petro said gently an adventurer of the worst sort not some kind of hero the signori di notte have suspicions about at least two of those duels hes fought only ricardo brunellis personal intervention has kept him out in the taverns keep away from him little sister she flounced out angrily sighing petro sat back in his chair and looked at the stack of papers on his desk these magical murders were generating more paperwork than answers he still felt they were no closer to knowing just who was behind them problems generated by angelinas wild behavior were something he didnt need on top of it he knew she wasalong with a crowd of the wealthy and spoiled of veniceslipping off to various taverns hed done it himself once upon a time there had always been a couple of case vecchie girls who were no better than they should be among the crowd looking for thrills looking for excitement enjoying being the wild ones able to retreat under the family mantle when real trouble came around it was something of a shock to realize that was what his sister had become hed have to do something about it perhaps her aunt he sighed better to deal with the immediate problems she would be causing he rang a bell a footman came hastily tell bruno and giampaulo i want to see them now the two dorma cousins came in looking wary petro didnt summon people often petro looked them up and down both were dressed with some flamboyance both carried rapiers and to what do we owe this sartorial elegance gentlemen he asked dryly we we were just going out said bruno with attempted nonchalance to see somea friend said giampaulo uneasily ah petro tilted his head inquiringly who oh um just a friend bruno said airily you you wouldnt know him i see said petro affably with swords only or were you planning to take a horsewhip along they looked uneasily at each other said nothing petro shook his head you will both forget about it he insulted our honor said bruno hotly giampaulo was slightly more fulsome we cant tolerate some lowlife bringing shame on our house petro this felluci has made casa dormaand your sister specificallythe laughingstock of venice petros brow lowered may i remind you both that she is my sister and that i am the head of dorma not you ill decide what needs to be doneif anything needs to be done and if either of you think of taking over my authority you can try being a dorma factor in outremer this year or negroponte may have need of hotheads i dont i specifically forbade any dueling and i promise you if i find out youve disobeyed meand i will find out dont think i wontill leave you to rot in the doges dungeons is that clear who else was involved in this giampaulo and bruno glanced at each other their shoulders slumped bonaldo and michael muttered bruno i suggest you waste no time in passing this on to them the less we do the less scandal there will be at the moment only angelina and this boy and you four are involved by the time you were finished half of venice would know all the details and my sister and my house would truly be a laughingstock i wont have it is that clear both of them looked sulky wary nodded dont even think of trying to circumvent me said petro quietly i may just have saved your foolish lives i wonder if angelina mentioned that this felluci is the duelist aldantos messenger petro had the satisfaction of seeing the two cousins go abruptly pale chapter chiano brooded over the little fire while sophia grilled fish hed coaxed into his net for dinner he thought about how harrow had slipped away into the marsh so easily he might have been born here the man made scarcely a rustle in the reeds what hed done to mold the creature that had come into his hands into the man now called harrow had used a smidgeon of magic a great deal of knowledge hed gleaned from sophia about the properties of the plants of the jesolo and all his manipulation face the facts old man you used him to protect marco yes but hed made harrow into a mere tool for that protection he was a tool before you got him he just didnt know it you gave him that much selfknowledge there are those whod give anything for that and there were those who wouldand didgive anything to have the luxury of denial too he hadnt given harrow a choice how many choices did i have none if he was to give marco a protector and marco had to have a protector if he was to grow into the power the lions shadow promised for him he was close now close to accepting the winged mantle chiano had sensed it but marco had to live to grow into that power and and venice is suddenly a world more dangerous than it was before and you old man arent there selfknowledge hed had the luxury not of denial but of absence of that knowledge for a long time courtesy of those who had ambushed him in the very corridors of the accademia coshed him and dropped him into a canal him dottore marina and he hadnt even remembered that much until recently all those experiments with drugs and hallucinationshe knew enough to be able to tell the difference between a real vision and a hallucinationhadnt been to gather the word of the goddess it had been to jar loose his own memories from the confused mist the blow to the head had sent them into at first when he came here all hed known for certain was what old sophia had told himthat the undines had brought him to her that they had told her he was their friend and that they had rescued him when someone had tried to kill him they didnt know who the men had worn steel armor and that had prevented their magic and his own from saving him they knew he was a magician a powerful magician one who was the friend of water creatures in particular but that was all they knew that and his name which meant nothing to him as he was and nothing to an old herbwitch living in the jesolo sophia had decidedand told himthat he must have some powerful enemy in the city to have earned such treatment and he had caught fear from her for the longest time he hadnt wanted to know it seemed safer when he didnt and he particularly didnt want to use magic sophia had told him that magicians could tell where other magicians were using magic and even who it was that was doing itas if there would be any other magician in the jesolo but when nothing happened and no one came seeking him then he dared a little at a time he dared first a little magic a very little magic something that he remembered bits of that sophia knew bits of to call the undines to him and it worked they came out of friendship more than anything else but stayed because he could feed them tidbits of power out of his own stores it was the undines who came often enough for his tidbits and stayed to chase fish into his traps it was the undines also who frightened the locos sufficiently with their clawed hands and sharktooth smiles that he and sophia were left unmolested they could even at need make dangerous locos like the late big gianni feel threatened enough that he could have made big gianni back off from marco if hed been there when it needed doing and finally he tried getting those memories back of who exactly dottore marina was and what he could do here sophia said nudging him better eat he accepted the piece of grilled fish from her and ate it mechanically it was a good thing that it was the memories of danger that came back first and not the ones he had just gotten over the last few days or his enemies would have surely found him someone had paid for very very skilled bravos dressed headtofoot in fine chain mail to ambush him within the accademia itself his defensive magics the ones he could do without thinking had all been of the sort to use against another mage or a creature of magic when striking cold steel they had fizzled and died like a wet firework that was all he remembered the blow to his head that must have followed blanked out everything else for a while at least he had struggled since then trying to put a face on the faceless enemy who could have hired these men obviously someone conversant enough with magic to know exactly how to disable a magister magus a grimas a master of all three of the stregheria traditions he had enemies but none that virulent some were political he washad beenthe spokesperson not only for the strega but also the rest of the nonchristian mages the jews and moslems and that bizarre little fellow allegedly from the qin empire he had managed to get a single voice out of that chaos of conflicting personalities even though for the most part it was like trying to herd cats and just as thankless a task but the strega were little more than an afterthought in the politics of venice he couldnt think of anyone who would consider him a political threat what did that leave a mystery a faceless threat and somehow that unnerved him unmanned him and left him determined to hide out here and depend on no more than the little dribs and drabs of magic it took to just stay alive but then that poor child had shown up running from faceless enemies himself men who had killed his mother and on him guiding himthe lions shadow the sign that chiano had notthenrecognized for what it was because he himself was not aware that he was the wearer of the winged mantle he only knew that marco could be a magician if he chose and through marco he himself could work the magic that would elevate life in the swamp above mere survival until now until now now he knew what he wasthe force through which the protector the soul of venice could work a soul that went right back through the romans and to the first etruscan fishermen who had plied the jesolo the soul that now took the shape of the winged lion of saint mark but who was older than even dottore marina could guess and the shadow he had seen on young marco was not just the shadow of potential power it was the shadow of the lion showing that marcoif he lived if he grew into and accepted his powerwould be the next to wear the winged mantle marco might evenchiano was not sure about this yetbe the first to assume the lions crown as well something which no one had done in centuries now he knew why he had livedbecause the shadow had dispersed his attackers with the brush of its wings that called up terror and called the undines up the canal to rescue him before the assassins could complete their business because the shadow had told the undines to take him to sophia deep into the jesolo where he could live and regain his memories but there was no reason to follow marco into the city to go back was there the boy had harrow to protect him he didnt need chiano nor did anyone else except except for the stories that came drifting into the jesolo like mist like the echoes of bells from the city the stories that spoke of the sinister and cruel acts of the servants of the trinity who would burn you if they could take you chiano and of a monster who prowled the waterways and killed and what business is that of yours the shadow of wings brushed through his mind reminding him thatyes it was his business it threatened the city it was not just politics but evil that had sent him into the canal that night not merely to serve as a warning to those who might think to challenge it but to rid the city of its protector dottore marina would have scoffed and taken up the gauntlet chiano had come too close to death chiano was afraid the truth is the truth was he didnt know enough thats easily remedied some small inner voice told him he sighed yes it wasexcept he was afraid of the remedy no more softness he stood up abruptly and jumped down off the raft it was not quite sunset there was still time for magic sophia paid no attention by now she was used to the way he would just get up and go off somewhere without a word sophia was more than a little loco herself odd behavior meant little or nothing to her there were places even in the jesolo where there was pure water springs bubbled up from beneath the marsh rainwater collectedyou could find it if you knew where to look anyone who was friend to the undines could find it without difficulty at all it had rained last night chiano waded out onto a thread of a path that took him to a place among the hummocks where he had left a bowl to collect water it would be fresh and sweet and pureexactly what he needed for scrying since he would use something other than the stregheria rite which would surely pinpoint him to anyone who was looking for him dottore marina did not need to go through an elaborate ritual to invoke and erect a circle of power and protection anymore he just thought a few key words and it sprang up around him invisible to most eyes and only barely visible to those with the inner sight it ringed him with the inner fires that would screen his probing from those watching for magic holding his hands over the bowl of pure water as he squatted beside it in the dying light of day he breathed another invocation and watched patiently as the last of the sun vanished and the first rays of the moon touched the surface it misted over then cleared showing him the oncefamiliar canals and walkways of his city show me the threat he commanded silently show me the peril to my city he had hoped to see nothing but the water misted and cleared immediately and showed him in rapid successiona voluptuous woman with redgold hair lucrezia brunelli her brother ricardo a sourfaced fanaticeyed man in a cassock with three crosses emblazoned on it an abbot of the servants but who i dont recognize him a woman in the habit of a nun of the servants whose eyes werelifeless then something looked out of them at him and saw him and knew him and last before he could react to that flicker of malevolent recognition the darkened canal with something swimming below the surface he bent nearer closer to the water trying to make out what it was it was coming out it sent one clawed hand then another to fasten into the stones of the canalside then it heaved itself up out of the water faster than a striking adder and it turned and it looked at him he screamed and involuntarily thrashed at the water breaking the spell just in time one moment more and it would have been through the watermirror meant only for scrying and at his throat feeding on his life and his soul reflexively luciano called up all of his defenses until he lay panting within a cocoon of power oh anyone looking would see him nowbut it didnt matter not after that they knew he was out here and it wouldnt take long for them to find him how many undines would die protecting him for a very long time he couldnt think he could only sit and shiver with fear that turned his bowels to water as the moon climbed higher in the sky he sat and shook and even wept unashamedly not to me this cant come to me im too old too tired but on his shoulders rested the winged mantle he felt it though it was invisible there was no one else marco was untrained and unaware and could not take the mantle in any case until chiano was dead the mantle had come to him on the death of his predecessorirony of ironies it had been a little hypatian priestmage out of a bastard branch of one of the four old families and not one of the strega no chiano was the bearer for the good of venice if there had been anyone in all of venice fit to wear it it would have gone to him or her the moment his body hit the water senseless and he would have died extraordinary measures had been taken to ensure that he did not marco no doubt had the mark even then but he hadnt the training had no one to train him and in any case was too young for the weight the weight of the mantle even much less the crown his denial turned to a plea pleasenot now please not to me but the answer was still the same there was no other the night had never seemed so dark then the shadow of a wing brushed him and a quiet filled him he made his mind very still then and waited there is no other my child said a voice as deep as the seas as vast as the night sky but i will be with you your soul will survive his soul not his body perhaps but his soul it was enough enough for him to find a small scrap of courage left to drag together the rags of his sense of self and to find a little more courage a little more heart and finally what was left of his dignity he dismissed his protections with a word and walked back to what had been his home and would not be for much longer sophia looked up as he rejoined her on their combined rafts her eyes widened a little as if he somehow looked different now perhaps he did for a moment he gazed out over the water towards the city towards his fate its time sophia he said at last its time to go back sophia smiled at him shifting the wrinkles and shook her head its time you went back chiano but this is my place now she said with finality chapter after he lowered his pack onto the cot which would henceforth serve him as a bed eneko lopez heaved a sigh of relief thank god he murmured as his eyes made a quick survey of his new living quarters the survey was very brief for the simple reason that there was very little to survey in the first place the room was tiny as small as any cell he had inhabited in his years as a monk except for the cot and a small chest at the foot of it which would serve to store his few belongings the only other item of furniture was a writing table in front of the rooms one small window and a chair other than that the room was bare except for a crucifix hanging on the wall above the cot ill miss the library he murmured but nothing else his two companions smiled diego motioned with his head toward the open window the smell from the canals is bad at times here in the ghetto not half as bad as the stench in casa brunelli growled pierre what did you give as your reason for changing quarters i simply told ricardo brunelli that my work in the ghetto had progressed to the point where i needed to live there which is true enough as far as it goes you should have oh pierredo stop snapped eneko we have enough problems on our hands without offending the brunellis unnecessarily any more than i have already by spurning that infernal lucrezias constant advances pierre as usual was stubborn infernal is right he growled pierre please you admit yourself that youve never been able to detect any sense of a witch about her youre making too much of that retorted pierre my talent has definite limits eneko what i said was that i could not detect any demonic possession in the woman thats what a witch is after all that does not mean she cant be as vile as any of satans minions that the woman is evil i dont doubt for an instant replied eneko shrugging but we have not a shred of evidence to think she is in any way connected to the events in venice which brought us here and given the position of the brunellis i can see no logical reason why she would be you yourself have said evil needs no reason pointed out pierre eneko sighed savoy mule let there be an end to it pierre at least for now we must concentrate on the matter at hand on that interjected diego there is news perhaps i should say at lopezs cocked eyebrow diego elaborated i have discovered the identity of that boy you asked about the local healer who also works for caesare aldanto his nameso it is said at leastis marco felluci and he doesnt simply work for aldanto he lives with him he and another boy named benito along with aldantos woman a canaler by the name of maria garavelli lopezs eyes widened a bit are the two boys related brothers perhaps diego shook his head not according to the information ive been able to collect the others last name is oro and ive seen him once he doesnt resemble marco in the least the only similarity between the two boys is that according to rumor they are both orphans lopez studied him for a moment but you are i suspect wondering the same thing that i am diego nodded it seems odd yes for aldanto to take two boys under his wing and he just spent a large sum rescuing the boy marco from what pierre chuckled from an absurd romantic complication he proceeded to give lopez a quick sketch of what he and diego had learned from local canalers about what had quickly become a rather famous little episode eneko smiled love poems eh slowly he sat down on the chair it is odd why should a mercenary like aldanto go to such lengths to shelter two waifs two orphanspresumably penniless one of whom at least does not seem to have the temperament one would expect from a protege of aldanto healing poor childrenfor no paymentlove poems even leaving aside that angel face and the names added diego eneko nodded yes marco and benito are common names of course still one moment said diego he left the room and returned shortly with a scarf in his hand i obtained this from the little girl whom we saw the boy treat that time she was reluctant to part with it but lopez couldnt refrain from wincing another coin gone from the few they had in their possession but he did not utter any protest like diego he thought the money well spent yes he said forcefully with that scarf we can discover the boys past as much at least as that scarf was a part of it pierre unlike his two companions was not well versed in sacred magic unreliable he murmured possibly even risky diego shook his head not in the least pierre this is not like scrying which another mage could detect and distort nor is it as difficultalmost impossible reallyas foretelling the future the past is done immutable what eneko proposes is simply an aspect of diego who had a bit of the pedant in him began what was clearly going to be a longwinded description of the principles of contagion as applied to sacred magic but eneko cut him short enough he chuckled pierre wants to hear it less than i do to pierre it can be done trust me will you join us in prayer he cast his eyes about their new home since i am going to be living here working here he raised his eyebrow significantly and worshipping here it should be cleansed first and diego you may pretend ignorance but you know very well how to ritually cleanse a dwelling diego groaned ill get a broom a prayer of intention first pierre said with a laugh of his own the ritual cleansing didnt take long to be honest although the room was physically filthy there wasnt much in the way of negativity to chase from it and nothing at all of evil the smells might be dreadful but the spiritual atmosphere was clean there was a practicality to a ritual cleansingfollowing the principle of as above so below you cleaned you cleaned everything floor to ceiling in order to set a barrier of protection permanently in place but you cleaned with intention prayer and the magic to flush away the dirt you couldnt see along with what you could diego was very good at floors one of the reasons eneko had chosen this particular room was because of a peculiarity of alignment the four corners were exactly pointing to the four cardinal directions by nailing a bit of wood into each corner to serve as a shelf for the tiny statues of the archangels michael gabriel raphael and uriel he had brought he recreated in miniature a ritual chapel like hagia sophia on the other side of town like the ritual chapels of hypatians everywhere by the time he and pierre finished blessing it setting up the boundaryspells blessing it again this was sacred ground protected from evil ah eneko said stretching his arms and shaking out his hands when they were done i much prefer this sort of comfort to anything casa brunelli offered i cant say as i blame you pierre replied diego just shrugged and picked up the scarf which they had left lying on the cot if youre going to do this you might as well get it over with he said holding it out to eneko gingerly as if it was a viper eneko just smiled and dug a flat bowl out of his belongings while pierre went out to find a waterseller he returned with a cask of potable water which he set up in the corner beneath the statue of gabriel and tapped strange that in a city on the water you cant drink any of it he remarked no stranger than being on a ship surrounded by water diego countered for that matter would you drink water from the loire in orleans ah no here you are eneko pierre had filled the flat bowl with clean water and put it on the floor where the two of them knelt on either side of it eneko murmured a blessing over it and pierre blessed salt and cast it over the top of the water then holding an end of the scarf each the two mages bent over the bowl while diego peered at it from his perch on the cot while pierre readied the bowl to reflect the images that came to it eneko used a thread of power to talk to the scarf show us where you have been was the gist of his spell and in a moment a mist passed over the face of the water and images appeared there looking exactly like reflections except these reflections were of nothing that was in the room the scarf itself was not very old which was just as well eneko hurried past the silkworm the weavers the dandy prone to getting recklessly drunk in foolish places who had owned it until he came to the moment that benito oro plucked it from the drunks neck ah said diego with interest now they settled down to watch in earnest when the work was finished the magic dispelled and the blessed water scattered around the room eneko chuckled again the marco boy may be an innocent but his young companion benito is certainly not which unfortunately leaves us knowing not much more than we did before since the scarf was stolen only a few days before marco gave it to the child he rose to his feet still there is enough here to warrant further effort diego i need to make a trip it will use up most of what we have until we get another disbursement of funds from the grand metropolitan but well worth it perhaps pierre had risen to his feet also it will do us good to live on alms for a while anyway diego still seated on the cot cast a questioning look upward a trip where and to do what when lopez told him diego sighed and what makes you think the old man will allow you the privilege hes ferocious on that subject by all accounts lopez handed him the scarf i will give him this then tell him how the younger boy acquired it and what the older one did with it if our suspicionsay better surmiseis correct he will allow me to see the portrait if there is one demurred pierre he may have burned whatever existed oh i doubt that said lopez softly it is one thing for a man to disown his daughter and cast her out it is another thing entirely to burn his own memories it appears that marco has come to no permanent harm in his sojourn in the marshes said antimo carefully the money youve been sending aldanto to keep the boys was well spent although for a moment bartelozzis prim mouth pursed with distaste needless to say hes been letting everyone think that it was his money which rescued marco the old fox chuckled wryly you expected caesare aldanto to be truthful and modest antimo shrugged acknowledging the truth in the little jest however there is another aspect of the new situation you need to consider milord a quite unforeseen one it appears the boys have acquired another protector besides aldantoand one who is every bit as skilled and in some ways perhaps even more dangerous delleste put his hands behind his head and rocked back on his chair they seem to have a talent for attracting supporters and defenders that is a valuable trait for the delleste he said cheerfully you might even say a family custom antimo looked at him a steady unblinking basilisk stare the old fox sighed all right antimo who is it fortunato bespi the chair came down with a thump the old fox looked anything but cheerful then he shook his head sharply all right antimo youve succeeded for once you have brought me a piece of information that was so totally unexpected i was at a loss bespi who would have thought it all reports claimed he was dead that he should turn up protecting lorendanas children is bizarre there was a long silence the duke sat quietly after a moment he turned his lined old face away from bartelozzi and stared blindly at a far wall moisture welled in his eyes and eventually slowly a tear found its way down one cheek at length antimo bartelozzi cleared his throat what do you wish done about the matter milord the old fox rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath nothing he said harshly lorendana made her choices it may be that i failed her as a father she was a very beautiful child antimo maybe i indulged her more than i should have but nonetheless she made her own decisions she lived by them and she died by them bespi was a fanatic had he murdered her for money i would have had him assassinated at the time as a message killing a delleste for money guarantees you will not live to spend it but bespi killed to orders because he was a singleminded fanatic i would have done as well to have my revenge on a knife still true he peered at bartelozzi his eyes once again as sharp and dry as usual tell me this however are you certain that bespi guards them the agent nodded yes milord he could have killed both boys in the swamp as easily as he could two chickens you know that as well as i bespi isdeadly and ive watched him myself since he returned to the city a mother hen puts in far less effort caring for its chicks you know my lord how a fanatical foe can turn into the most loyal of defenders if you can change their hearts the old fox looked at the man who had many years ago been sent to kill him i know that antimo he said quietly there was silence for a moment then the duke of ferrara clapped his hands in a quick and decisive gesture enough i trust your judgment now let us turn to the general situation in venice the council of ten what of calenti antimo shook himself back to the present lord calenti remains apparently neutral milord but we have discovered he has been having a very discreet liaison with lucrezia brunelli the old fox raised an eyebrow shes a busy woman she must have to apportion her time carefully shes been linked to several other people whom we have watched well does this lean him toward the metropolitans the agent shook his head based on lucrezias other paramours i would guess that the tendency is not in favor of her brothers party lucrezia is her own woman ricardo brunelli thinks his sister draws her suitors to him but of the ardent suitors and possible lovers we know ofquite a number have montagnard sympathies or contacts count badoero for example a bad egg if there ever was one said the old fox lord calenti will bear watching and what of petro dorma have there been any repercussions from marcos foray into poetry antimo shook his head no milord apparently lord dorma stifled the usual young bravo sentiment within his own house quite decisively i have to say im growing increasingly impressed by the man i think he remains our best bet among the council of ten the old fox reached for his quill so am i well then let us see if we can arrange a little warming of relations between the delleste and dorma i think the blade that is my grandson marco has been tempered it is time to start using it let us see if my enemies dare to move openlywhen the head of a reborn casa valdosta stands forth in venice under his rightful name antimo looked perturbed he may be killed milord the old fox shrugged if he is then we will know he was poorly tempered steel he said quietly when eneko returned from ferrara he said nothing to his companions at first he simply unwrapped the small parcel he brought with him and showed them what it contained diego hissed dear god what a resemblance there is a much larger portrait at delleste in which the resemblance is even more striking but the duke gave me this miniature why asked pierre eneko smiled i asked him that same question myself a most interesting answer he gave me you must remember the mother most of all i dont understand said diego frowning eneko placed the miniature on his little writing desk old fox indeed he murmured i shall keep the portrait here at all times to remind me that both boys had the same mother he turned back to his companions and what was she brothers an evil woman or a good one or simply a mother diego stared at the portrait still confused but pierre nodded indeed so the portrait is a reminder to us a warning perhapsof the danger of pride she was indeed a proud woman by all accounts mused diego eneko shook his head firmly you misunderstand the duke was warning us of the danger of our pride he smiled grimly canny old man that is indeed the downfall of theologians his eyes went back and forth from pierre to diego we will do nothing with this knowledge for the time being that too the old man made me swear the children are safer for the moment with their identity concealed obviously but when the time comesremember brothers there were two sons produced by the same mother god works in mysterious ways said diego solemnly oh nonsense chuckled pierre not in this instance any savoyard can tell you the trick always keep a second string for your bow part iv march ad chapter humiliation marco was learning was a very different thing from shame shame gripped your gut and made you sick humiliation made you wish you were dead shame had made him run humiliation made him hide he hid at his job behind a facade of the drabbest clothing in his wardrobe and a bulwark of work he was fast becoming one of the most putupon clerks in the office because he courted volunteered for the most tedious and boring tasks available and he hid after work anywhere but home once he made his check to see if caesare had a job for him he visited his friend the art student as much as he could without becoming a nuisance which actually wasnt that difficult at the moment when rafael wasnt studying he needed models to draw from and marco had absolutely no objection to stripping down to his smallclothes and holding still until he turned blue so long as no one was teasing him about angelina and when he wasnt visiting rafael he hid in books or increasingly in the tiny church of saint raphaellaand somehow the confluence of names seemed appropriate he didnt seek out the priest brother mascoli and he didnt let the priest catch sight of him he simply sat in the back and thought until it was almost dark and only then did he go home here at least his thoughts werent so much about humiliation as humility itself and not at all about angelina over and over he thought about what the priest had told him and tried to come up with counterarguments he couldnt moreover the more he saw of the militant pauline faction the less he liked them they were arrogant the most of them and pride was arguably the most deadly of the sins since it led to so many of the others and oh they were angryhe scarcely ever saw a sot or a knot without a frown on his faceand that was not only another deadly sin but one that led straight to murder and mayhem you couldnt keep that much anger pent up for long without it boiling over and when it did someone always got hurt perhaps the petrines were soft and perhaps they were inclined to another deadly sin that of sloth but at least no one was ever hurt by a slothful layabout with a deadly weapon the paulines were right about one thing there was such a thing as real evil and oft times the petrines preferred to pretend there wasnt in the hopes that it would get bored and go away but not all petrines not the priest here for instance no that sort of thing was the besetting sin of those whose wealth and power allowed them to insulate themselves from the rest of the world the ones who scoffed at the stories of the canal monster because no one they knew had been attacked by it well except for the financier killed the previous summer but that had been months ago and most of venices elite seemed to have convinced itself that his murder was the work of a simple maniac a disgruntled debtor no doubt only ignorant and superstitious peasants would credit such a thing as magical murder or a mysterious monster in the canals but being honest with himself marco could not be at all certain that paulines sufficiently insulated by wealth and position from their sweating peasants would not have said the same thing had the monster prowled the back alleys of milan instead of the canals of venice so on long afternoons before darkness fell marco sat on a bench in the darkest corner against the wall at the rear of the church and looked at the crude statue of saint raphaella and wondered what he should do he didnt want to ask for a signwho was he that a saint should give him a sign he blushed to think that he had asked one of saint petersaint peterthose months ago in the swamp hed come here again after another day of making triplicate copies of tedious documents knowing that his friend was studying for an examination and caesare was out on some mysterious business or other the church had been darkening steadily for the past several moments and he would have to go soon with a start he realized that brother mascoli was in the churchwas coming towards him was coming at him jesu has the man eyes like a cat marco i need you the priest said as marco started to get up to get away before the man could confront him mascoli grabbed him by the arm before marco could protest or even think of anything to say dont argue with me boy i need you they need you and they asked for you by name who did marco squeaked youll see brother mascoli said and dragged him up to the altar around to his own quarters and out a tiny back door it was as it transpired a waterdoor which let onto a mere thread of a canal handy for poor canalfolk to bring in their sick and injured by night handy too for smuggling in this case handy for something else entirely for something that was the last thing marco would have expected he stared down at the three faces in the water three pale green faces looking up at him and the priest their fishy eyes reflecting the light from a torch set up in a sconce on the wall their emeraldgreen hair like waterweeds streaming and waving in the water around them and it reflected upon a fourth face so pale there was hardly any green to it eyes closed webbed fingers clasped over a hideous wound in itsherstomach marco turned on brother mascoli those are undines he said accusingly and thisif you will noticeis enclosed within the church walls he replied waving at what marco had taken to be a canal it wasnt now that the priest had drawn his attention to it he saw that it was part of the church proper beneath the roof a crucifix mounted on the back with another presencelight beneath it on a shelf that served for an altar a sort of watery chapel apparently technically since i bless this place three times daily this is holy water brother mascoli continued they may not be human but theyve passed the test of faith and they asked for you by name i cant heal her but they think you can me marcos voice went up another octave you said a sibilant voice from below we have seen you with our brother among the reeds you have the light and the power we cannot reach him in timeyou must heal our sister he couldnt help himself he knelt down on the waterstair and looked at the terrible gash that crossed the undines torso from left nipple to the top of her right hip and a spasm of sympathetic pain closed around his throat how could anyone heal that how could the poor thing still be alive the wounded undines eyes opened and he was caught in her gaze she moaned pitifully and held out webbed fingers to him please came the faintest of whispers blessed maria it was more than a spasm of sympathy now he swallowed down actual tears but he directed not a protest but a plea of his own to brother mascoli i dont know how theyre magic creatures marco you probably couldnt heal a human slashed like that but theyre as much spirit as flesh brother mascoli began then shook his head just do what i do he looked down at one of the uninjured undines little sister youre going to have to help i may need you to act as a catalyst the boys never done magic as far as he knows one of the undines separated herself from the injured one leaving the other two to support their sister in the water i am ready she said undulating over to marco and sliding up onto the waterstep beside his feet he couldnt help noticing when she spoke that she had long sharp claws on those graceful green handsand a mouth full of sharklike teeth looking at those teeth marco almost shuddered the our brother the undine had referred to could only be chiano hed always known old chiano had a special relationship with the undines in the jesolo the marsh locos had always been afraid of chiano marco had thought it was only because of some vague fear of chianos magic but nowlooking at those teethhe suspected that at least marsh locos had learned the hard way not to fool around with a friend of the undines brother mascoli turned marco to face the opening of the waterchapel that led to the canal holy angel gabriel he nudged marco who realized suddenly that this was a prayer and he was expected to follow holy angel gabriel he repeated obediently echoed by the undine at his feet jesuits a prayerid better put some feeling into it all it took was a single glance at the poor creature at his feet to do that you who brought the word of godto the blessed virgin marywho guard the watersand those who dwell thereinwe beseech and pray theeto guard our circleand guide our work hed been concentrating on putting his heart into the words and he hadnt really thought about what the prayer might doand it came as a shock when the area of the opening suddenly filled with a flare of green light so bright it made the torch pale it certainly made marco start back with surprise but brother mascoli only grunted with what sounded like satisfaction and turned marco to the right to face the blank wall of the chapel and began another prayer holy angel michaelyou who guard the world with a flaming swordand all the creatures born of firewe beseech and pray thee this time when the flash of red light came marco was more or less ready for it he turned on his own this time beginning to get the idea the angel was raphael this timewho guard the air and those who dwell thereinand the flash was of blue light along the wall with the crucifix mounted on it and last of all they faced the wall behind them and invoked the angel uriel the keeper of the creatures of the earth and were greeted with a flash of pure golden light practically at their noses brother mascoli once again turned marco to face the altar in nomine patri et filius et spiritus sanctus fiat lux he intoned with marco only a fraction of a second behind him and a blinding white light enveloped the entire waterchapel for a moment to die down to a faint curtain of light between them and the outside world and if marco doubted thatthere was the evidence of his own ears there was no sound coming from out therenothing of the echoes of voices and the splash of water of the bumping of boats against the mooring and the slap of feet on the walkways nothing brother mascoli gave another grunt of satisfaction all right marco the rest is simple kneel down beside our little sister there too caught up now to even think of protesting marco knelt on the step beside the undine at his feet she placed her hands in the water just over the injured ones once again clasped desperately over her wound just put your hands over hers the priest directed marco shivered at the ordershivered once again at the touch of the cool flesh under his cooler than a humans could ever be andscaled yes those were scales under his fingers brother mascoli bent over and completed the stack with his own hands now he said in marcos ear just pray pray to saint raphaella and saint hypatia to give you the power to heal this child of god howhe thought but he obeyed closing his eyes and putting every bit of concentration he had into a fervent even desperate plea he barely noticed one of the scaled hands slip from beneath his and come to rest just over his heart instead he concentrated on an image that came to him from nowhere of the dreadful wound being unmade sealing up closing over leaving the flesh sweet and unmarked linking that image to his prayer in a way he felt was right and then he felt something else entirely an upwelling within himself first a trickle of warmth and life and energy then a rivulet then a stream then a gushenergy that was somehow green although he could not have said why that flowed from somewhere into him and down through his chest and into his arms and out his hands which grew warm as it passed through them startled he opened his eyes and saw to his openmouthed astonishment that it wasnt some trick of his imagination his hands were glowing with a green light the color of sunlight passing through early leaves and the light was sinking down and spreading over the wounded undine and the wound was closing exactly as he had imagined it there were twobeingsof light one to his right and one to his left hovering weightlessly over the water they were vaguely humanshaped but too bright and at the same time too diffuse to really make out anything else they each held a hand over his head and he knew somehow that this was the source of that energy that was coursing through him brother mascoli and the other undine were caught fast in some sort of trance their eyes were shut fast this is for your eyes only little brother he sensed somehow that the being to his right was smiling at him that the words came fromhim her both and neither meaningless little brother gods spirits have no gender he didnt know whether to be elatedto have at last that sign he had not dared hope foror to be ashamed that he had doubted and had waited so long to use this thing hed been given he decided he had to be both and neither could the infant tintoretto have painted a fresco some things must wait upon maturity embarrassment the too familiar taste of humiliation at his own stupidity his own failures then suddenly the sweeter taste of something altogether different humility of course sometimes old chiano had said you have to wait until youre ready exactly nowconcentrate little brother we cannot remain much longer he closed his eyes again and focused his attention until the flow of what he now knew was pure simple power began to ebb from a rush to a stream from a stream to a rivulet from a rivulet to a trickle and then it was gone he opened his eyes and pulled back his hands the only light came once again from the torch in the sconce overhead the waterchapel was utterly unchanged but in the water a miracle opened her eyes in wonder the wound was gone exactly as he had imagined it leaving not so much as a scar the newly healed undine clapped her hands with joy and to marcos intense embarrassment leapt out of the water to plant wet and strangely hard lips on his cheek as her sister who had sat at his side did the same on his other cheek well done marco said brother mascoli heartilybut with overtones of weariness a moment later marco had to put out a hand on the step to steady himself for when he tried to stand he was nearly bowled over by the same weariness the undines made a move in the direction of the waterentrance and brother mascoli called out to them while marco was still trying to get to his feet a moment little sisterswho did this to you the one who had been wounded turned back although her three companions shook their heads in warning its all righti havent dispelled the circle mascoli assured them its safe enough to use a true name we do not know the true name elder brother the wounded one said solemnly only that it is a thing of water or land or fire as it chooses to be that it is a thing that is a stranger here and that she hesitated we think that it was once a god marco looked up at brother mascoli to see his reaction and a shiver of fear came over him brother mascoli was as white as foam but within a moment he had gotten hold of himself and made a gesture of cutting in the air with a rapid flurry of thanks the undines plunged under the surface and disappeared presumably out into the canal and from there into cleaner water elsewhere now brother mascoli said putting a hand under marcos elbow to help him up you my young mage are not going elsewhere until you learn the right way to do what we just cobbled together yes sir marco said he knew the look on the priests face he might just as well try to argue with the lion of saint mark brother mascoli drew him in through the waterdoor and sat him down at a little work table then pulled out a dismayingly heavy book first of all you always cast a circle of protection the only reason we got away with not doing so this time is because the church is within a permanent circle that only needs to be invoked and it was going to be a long evening but at least he wouldnt be thinking about angelina for a while or so he thought until he finally returned home the next day it was a shock to see her especially this close and here of all places marco didnt know what to say when he almost bumped into angelina dorma here in caesares apartmentcoming out of caesares bedroom not wearing an awful lot of clothing also by the slight sway anything but sober marco had stammered something incoherent and bolted for the room he and benito shared her somewhat guilty laughter ringing in his ears in the security of the room he tried to work through the confusion of his feelings she wasnt his never had been the truth be told he had no reason to feel torn up like this after all angelina was just another daydream shed been nothing like his dream girl her face lacked the character humor and a certain something of the girl hed seen on the grand canal the day hed been brought back from the jesolo marshes but he had still kept angelina on something of a pedestal which shed climbed off and into caesares bed he needed to be alone to think this lot over then he realized he wasnt even alone now benito was sitting on the far side of the bed looking at him with a quizzical slightly worried expression on his round face for all that benito was younger than he was sometimes he looked older and at least there was no need to explain how long quite a while now benito answered sotto voce started up seeing her while you were still in bed with that knock on the head seems like he took the opening you had made once he realized she was interested they dont meet here hardly at all though so i was hoping youd never find out marco shook his head trying to clear it um so what are you doing here same as you old man ventuccio gave us a half holiday because hes got a grandson to carry on the family name in case you forgot only i didnt come in by the door and i didnt drop in to see a friend at the accademia benito grinned impishly thought id catch up on my sleep cause i got things to do tonight oh marco paused what about maria benito look a little uncomfortable shes gone on a long trip out to murano got some more glassware for that ceremonial galley to fetch you know what marias like they trust her when shes away is a good time for us to stay away brother aldanto entertains visitors marco swallowed more he asked in a small voice benito nodded couple or two or three theres signora selmi her husband is one of the captains in the galley fleet and theres this one i dont know little prismsandprunes mouth with a mole on her left cheek shes wild doesnt come often but when she does we even had old camipini coming over later to complain about the noisewhen maria was home lord and saints i thought the fat was in the fire then marco felt as if he might faint benito had said that caesare played the field with women but do you think i should warn angelina he asked quietly his loyalties torn benito snorted marco big brother grandpapa was right you do need someone to look after you like me now listen good your precious angelina is a wild girl shes trouble marco thats a bad crowd she runs with and i dont think caesare is her first time either you just leave her to caesare he knows how to deal with girls like that you dont marco stood up biting his lip then nodded youre right brother this time anyway i need to go out ill see you benito stood up too stretching ill tag along for company i think we ought to leave quietly by the window we can go and see claudia and valentina unless youd rather go looking for that dream girl of yours marco wanted to be alone but benito obviously had no intention of letting him be at least my dream girl is not like that he said quietly benito muttered something marco didnt quite catch it and didnt want to ask him to repeat it but it could have been in your dreams brother instead he swung out of the window heading for the ornamental casement benito always said was like a ladder a slippery ladder that the citys pigeons used for other purposes in marcos opinion once they were away up on a roof overlooking the canal benito leaned back against the chimney stack right brother what am i looking for again lets hear the lyrical description marco panted stop teasing me benito grinned impishly oh thats right i remember now amazing what even i can remember when ive only heard it three thousand times she has curly redcarroty hair she has a generous mouth a tiptilted nosemerry eyes wonderful hazel eyes and shes your soul mate you knew the minute your eyes met youre a cynic little brother at least im not a fool benito regretted it the moment hed said it he found that look of marcos one of the hardest things to deal with that clear look that seemed to see right into you he squirmed slightly under the gaze marco didnt even seem to be aware that he was doing it after a while as if from a distance marco said its good to be a fool sometimes benito and you will be too one day yeah when hell freezes over marco said benito feeling uncomfortable come on lets go down i got a tip today and my pocketll run to a couple of toresani or maybe some muset and beans marco sighed but stood up do you ever think of anything but food brother do you ever think of anything but girls it was an unfair comment and benito knew it he was starting to think quite a lot about girls himself nowadays and marco thought if anything about too much he cared for the whole world especially sick canalbrats benito well he cared for his brother marco and well maria hed like to earn her respect sometime and caesare he owed them chapter katerina montescue was in a foul mood it was all very well forming an instant rapport with someone across a crowded canal but shed always thought that if she ever married shed have to marry money then shed seen him establishing who he was had proved easy enough at least three people had asked her if shed seen him when theyd been looking for him shed been rather frightened to discover just how many of the canal boatmen knew her so his name was marco felluci a few casual questions began to paint a broader canvas a clerk for ventuccio and something of a healer respected by the bargees and canalerspeople who didnt give respect or liking easily and a boy with friends friends prepared to spend money to find him when he went missing she hadnt needed that information to tell her he was a good man she knew that the moment she saw him so he was only a clerk it hadnt taken her long to realize that being case vecchie was less important to her than being happy so shed be poor then why not she was practiced at it by now wasnt she theyd have a little house and shed wash and clean and cook easier workless dangerous toothan what shed been doing after all and if they needed more money than he could make as a clerk katerina could always take francesca up on her offer to work as a special gondolier for casa louise she must learn more about cooking how to make cheap meals theyd have children and his work would bring him promotion and insane she couldnt do it not that she cared herself about remaining case vecchiewell not much anywaybut if she abandoned her family casa montescue would collapse without her dealing in the gray goods coming in with captain della tomasso the casa would fall apart be bankrupt before the summer her grandfatherwho had borne so much with such montescue pride and fortitudewould die if the casa were sold and it wasnt just him all the servants and family retainers many of whom had spent their lives in service to montescuefor generations some of themwould be cast adrift also katerina montescue had responsibilities as well as longings and desires she couldnt simply toss over the one for the other and besidesshe had no idea how to meet him anyway neither of her two personas either as the spook or as katerina montescue would ever come into contact with a clerk who worked no doubt in a back room at ventuccio a dark back room where his eyes would go what to do what to do francesca yes ill talk to francesca about it the very next time i see her katerinas face went through an odd little play of expressions oh she murmured to herself thats tonight isnt it and that was another problem for a moment katerina almost burst into a pure shriek of frustration at societys quirks are you going to get dressed or arent you snapped alessandra peering around the door guilt and the reason for being so out of sorts returned kat to the real world im coming well hurry up said alessandra irritably we go out so little that you dont have to be late when we do have the chance youll never find a mannot that youve got a chance without a dowrycooped up here kat began to hastily dress her hair ill be there in five minutes youre not wearing that dowdy old green thing to go to la fenice are you alessandra demanded kats sisterinlaw was clad in a venetian lacetrimmed gown of goldenyellow silk katerina shuddered to think where the money had come from alessandra on the other hand looked truly shocked at her sisterinlaws dustygreen taffeta yes now go away and let me finish it was last years style and last years dress and in venice among the case vecchie death was better than being out of fashion it was just too bad katerina had learned this much if nothing else there were many more important things in life than silk we wont wait threatened alessandra i wish thought kat but she held her tongue and simply closed the door took out a string of pearls that wouldnt stand too close an inspection glass and fishscale a poor replacement for what had been her birthright she shook herself it was no use getting upset about any of it she had no idea if shed ever get to meet him or if he was married already but wait that canalbrat benito shed seen him now and then wearing ventuccio livery perhaps he would help her katerina it was an old voice the timbre going but still strong coming grandpapa katerina had that feeling in her stomach which more commonly accompanied a oversufficiency of sugarplums her stomach well she just felt sick she was used to doing dangerous thingsalone at night going to dark and insalubrious places to meet possibly very unpleasant people this was somehow worse kat swallowed looking around at the slow butterfly swirl of the haut monde of venice socializing the public masques were events where the people came as much to be seen as to see the performance she wished desperately shed never agreed to do this it had not seemed unreasonable when she was sitting talking to francesca it was very different here under the glitter of the candelabras introduce me to your grandfather at the interval at the masque at la fenice its something of a public place and i have not yet acquired the cachet for exclusive soirees or recitals at private camerata hes still a man of influence you know and highly respected creme de la creme in venetian society it will do me a great deal of good just to be seen talking to him kat understood the logic in truth all that visibly set the courtesans at such events apart from the matrons and virgin daughters of venice was the lower cut to their dresses and the more wellknown and reputable men that a courtesan could draw around her the more her acceptability grew the problem for kat however was that there was a fine social line respectable women did not cross men openly talked and flirted with the courtesans at these events women didnt so kat needed to make the introduction in as discreet and unnoticed a manner a possible unfortunately this nightwhen she desperately wanted alessandra to do her usual disappearing trickher sisterinlaw seemed to be glued to her kat had tried to shed alessandra and stick to her grandfather which was normally not that difficult but tonight the swirling crowd had peeled off lodovico montescue somewhere along the line while alessandra remained by her side at every moment there was francesca the daring chaperonhat with the peacock feather made her easy to find as usual the courtesan dressed with a flair that separated her from the lesser birds of paradise what to do what to do at last alessandra had caught sight of lucrezia brunelli and hastened away from kat kat tried desperately to spot her grandfather she gritted her teeth now or never shed find him and drag the old man over to the chaperonhat she could see bobbing over there by one of the ornamental pillars and then shed trip over a flounce or something she just hoped that lodovico would not be as scathingly rude as he could be first off she must get rid of this prosy bore im afraid i have no real interest signor she said cuttingly to a wellmeaning if prosy curti who was attempting to explain the work of the new painter robusti excuse me i must go and find my grandfather there is someone i wish him to meet the truth was easy enough when the person you were talking to didnt know just what you were talking about she walked away edging her way through the knots of people quite differently from the way shed seen francesca sashay her cleavage through the crowd unfortunately she hadnt spotted lodovico her grandfather had a commanding presence so it was easy to forget he was not actually very tall she spent the next while in fruitless search well shed go over to francesca and at least show shed tried the play would be starting soon at least francescas hat was easily visible as kat came around the ornamental pillar she heard francescas laughter it was a liquid and musical sound most amusing signor montescue she said and the courtesan rapped lodovicos knuckles gently with her ivory fan and he was only one of the cortege she had gathered her flirtation with lodovico done francesca turned her head and made a quip of some kind to a couple of priests standing next to her the little crowd immediately burst into laughter oh how very well said choked one of the priests managing even in that short phrase to convey a thick savoyard accent kat caught her jaw most of the men gathered about francesca were typical of what showed up from the great merchanthouses of venice at these events they were old middleaged at the very least the youngest of the venetians was petro dorma who was almost fortyand with his short stature and bald head hardly the image of a romantic swain the only exception were the two men in clerical garb who seemed even younger than dorma and quite a bit more slender and physically fit kat was a little puzzled by their presence in the crowd surrounding francesca not because they were clerics there were several highranked members of the church present at the masque and kat knew that at least one of them bishop capuletti was notorious for being a libertine but the clerics who came to these events were generally case vecchie themselveswhereas these two judging from their plain and simple garb seemed to be nothing more than simple priests one of them judging from that heavy savoyard accent no more than a villager in his origins the sight of those mostly potbellied men brought home to katerina that despite the wealth and comparative liberty they enjoyed there were certain disadvantages to being a courtesan she slipped her arm into her grandfathers i have been looking for you everywhere grandpapa kat smiled at francesca who dimpled just slightly in replylowering her lashes a touch wont you introduce me to your fascinating ladyfriend er lodovico montescue not accustomed to being at a loss for words was caught a bit short this time signorina francesca de chevreuse this is my granddaughter katerina kat bowed and extended a hand i am delighted to make your acquaintance she said demurely almost managing to keep a straight face lodovicos discomfiture was relieved by the ringing of the bell to signal that the masque was about to begin it didnt stop him bowing very low to francesca in parting as they walked to their seats lodovico shook his head at his granddaughter minx how could you do that to me making me introduce you kat pinched his arm ha you can talk to her but i cannot ha lodovico sighed our society is a hypocritical one my girl i must protect you from gossipmongers or i would be very tempted to take you to talk with her she is a very intelligent woman cultured understands the vagaries of politics thats a rare coin it attracts men kat smiled up at him and her cleavage has nothing to do with it the encounter with francesca had left lodovico in rare good mood he chuckled this is venice my girl we are an ostentatious people we like to display our endowments kat chuckled she has enough wealth to display in that respect thats certain despite the humor she found herself torn between gratification that francesca had succeeded in charming her grandfatherand an irrational jealousy of sorts he was her grandfather not a man chasing a woman she suppressed the ungracious thought it was nice to see him take an interest in something other than their troubles and his dreams of vengeance on the valdosta she supposed perhaps he read her mind ah my kat i must admit she made me forget my age too they sat and kat noticed that alessandra was looking frozenfaced at the stage alessandra pointedly ignored their arrival kat wonderednot with much interestwhat had got up her sisterinlaws nose well one of the misfortunes of being cloistered in the same house as alessandra was that sooner or later kat would be told quite probably with histrionics after the masque was over lodovico insisted on remaining for a while that was unusual then he took up an offer to join a number of the case vecchie at private soiree at the camerata of lord dselmi as a rule kats grandfather preferred to keep his appearances at these social gatherings to the bare minimum required by the demands of status tonight however he seemed much more energetic than usual kat noted that the invitation to proceed to the casa dselmi had included francesca seeing him join the crowd which gathered around francesca therequite a bit larger now that crowdkat almost choked partly from amusement partly from chagrin bordering on outrage my own grandfather that woman is shameless so is he eventually humor won the engagement kat smiled and turned away from the sight of her grandfather flirting suavely with francesca at least hes not glaring at the walls planning revenge on valdosta she sighed not that lodovico montescue could afford francesca these days any more than he could afford to pay capable spies and assassins the evening wore on the camerata sparkled with silver candlelight and fine venetian glassware katerina wished she could say the same of the intelligence of the boring fat old curti who had backed her up against a wall and was now attempting to talk her to sleep with his selfpraise there was lucrezia brunelli laughing to her own court of gallantswho were no younger and no less corpulent than the ones gathered about francescaher hair gleaming as if it had been spun out of coppery gold katerina didnt envy her for suitors and if rumor were to be believed lovers all she envied lucrezia for was the ability to escape being trapped by a idiot with breath like old anchovies too many chins and his interminable tales of his notreallysoclever little swindles in the levant kat was amused to see thatfor oncethe crowd of men gathered about lucrezia was not the largest in the palace it was not small of course but it was definitely smaller than the little mob surrounding francesca smaller anda lot less noisy lucrezia was slightly more beautiful than francesca kat supposed the beautiful lady of casa brunelli was also famous for her intelligence and witty repartee but kat had overheard that repartee in times past and had always found it fundamentally hardedged nasty in trutha matter of scoring points in a contest whereas judging from the relaxed and boisterous laughter coming from francescas gathering the men there were discovering kats friend to be more convivial company francescas sense of humor was genuinely funny her jests were jests not barbs and as often as not likely to be directed at herself rather than others so as the fat old curti droned on and on kat paid him as little attention as possible she was observing the subtle contest going on between two beautiful women elsewhere and found herself enjoying the fact that francesca was clearly emerging the winnerjudging at least from the frequent and angry little glances lucrezia brunelli sent her way relief came from a strange and unexpected quarter and relief was even less welcome than the old geezers breath had been as happens at such large gatherings the slow swirl of the crowd eventually brought someone new in front of her the minute that kat saw his face she recognized it it was not a face you forgot the aquiline nose the single line of forbidding brow the aura of power and dominance quite out of keeping with the mans height he was dressed with plain severity which was also out of keeping with the venetian nobles and merchants the same garb she recognized as that of the two priests in the crowd around francesca someone had commented on it someone had murmered political influence it worried her he obviously worried the fat old toad too goo good evening senor lopez the foreigner favored the toad with a faint lift of his eyebrow line ah signor della galbo i have been to see you on a number occasions at your home you were either away or indisposed i am glad to find you here when you are neither uh yes of course signor little beads of sweat had started out of manychinned toads florid face but its really getting late and i must be off call upon me at my home excuse me mlady montescue he vanished with a speed that was almost astonishing for one so portly katerina found herself fully in the eagleeyed gaze of senor lopez my apologies signorina i did not mean to interrupt your discussion with signor della galbo he bowed my name is eneko lopez de onez y guipuzcoa i am a stranger and guest here in your midst kat curtseyed and held out her hand in the accepted manner restraining a strong instinctive desire to run like hell she wished she could equally restrain the cold sweat on her hand maybe this lopez expected all women who were introduced to him to have coldfish hands katerina montescue i trust you are enjoying venice he certainly showed no reaction to her clammy hand as he bowed low and kissed it in a practiced courtly manner alas no an almostsmile touched the face i find it damp but that is inevitable in a city with so many canals and one does gods work where god wills now if you will excuse me signorina montescue with pleasure kat fled he recognized hershe was sure he did she found shed escaped one unpleasant thing only to have to deal with another well well well said alessandra archly got a suitor i see signor della galbo is quite a catch but better keep your hands off that fascinating spaniard lucrezia has marked him as hers kat shuddered shes welcome to him and she can have della galbo too with pleasure alessandra hes fiftyfive if hes a day hes old enough be my grandfather never mind my father and he is fat gross and stupid and his breath smells but hes got money darling said alessandra with a little moue pots and pots of it and you i obviously need to remind you havent got any youd be lucky to even get such an attractive offer hed at best want you to be his mistress if you werent case vecchie and him nouveau riche or are you going to run off and marry some commoner you just do your duty and well you can always have a lover on the quiet so long as youre discreet if thats the choice yes ill run off as soon as possible the thought of doing her duty with that made her feel nauseated best change the subject who was the other man that your friend lucrezia has got her hooks into my cousin lucrezia brunelli that was ricardos guest from spain castilian nobility wellbasque actually a rising man in the church with friends in rome an envoy plenipotentiary from the grand metropolitan himself people say kat swallowed the petrine church had its agents too this was probably one of them the petrines were more tolerant than the paulines but in the factional fighting well people were ground between them whole cities were ground if the rumor her grandfather had told her was true ferrara could be next the po river city had played a delicate balance between venice and rome against milan and the north and sometimes the other way around she was relieved to see her grandfather stumping up lets go home the conversations turned to politics and the more i listen to these fools the angrier i get said the old man his grizzled eyebrows lowered in an angry frown except for petro dormaand francesca de chevreuse from the little she saidtheyre all a lot of sheep bah the republic of venice must stand for the republic of venice not for milan or rome anyone else come i want to go home predictably alessandra pouted the nights still young ill come home later i want to meet some of those knights from germany theyre supposed to be here later youll come home now growled the old man he turned his lowered brow on katerina as for you young lady i wont have you associating with the likes of that della galbo hes nothing but a cheap crook even the slavetrading dandelos are not as low i want you home too grandpapa im only too glad to obey you said kat from under lowered lashes i couldnt stand him the thunderous brow lightened youre a minx girl now lets get out and find a gondola to take us home the montescue have been here shown face shown we are still case vecchie the pride in that old voice was as deep as the ocean and as hard as granite chapter lopez followed the montescues out of the palace keeping far enough back not to be noticed as the family began embarking onto their gondola he emerged onto the steps a moment later his two companions joined him a very nice voice she has even with the tremor of fear in it said lopez quietly i recognized it from the counseling session i had with her last year you should be ashamed of yourself eneko chuckled diego frightening girls the way you do lopez shrugged slightly the encounter was quite accidental her small sins cause her to fear the suspicion of great ones of which as it happens i am quite sure she is guiltless she is involved somehow with the evil which is coiling within this city but she is not one of its vessels diego turned his head to peer down the canal where the montescue gondola had vanished i agree if satan were that capable old friend we would long ago have vanished into the maw of the antichrist lopez rubbed his bad leg bad today he muttered come brothers since the grand metropolitan has seen fit to dole out some more funds let us employ a gondola for a change after they climbed into the gondola diego returned to the subject how involved do you think she is eneko and in what manner the gondola was just pulling into the grand canal the basque priest stared thoughtfully at the statue of the winged lion in the piazza san marco quite visible in the moonlight has it struck you yet brothers how many odd coincidences we have stumbled across since we arrived here in venice diego and pierre glanced at each other pierre shrugged what coincidences asked diego one the coincidence that i happened to witness katerina montescue and benito valdostayes it was he im sure of it now that ive had a glimpse of himengaged in mysterious activity on the same evening and in the same locale that the woden casket was brought to venice two the coincidence that those two had met each other in the first place three the coincidence that we happened to find lodgings in a part of the city which would enable us to observe the older brother marco engaged in charitable work four the coincidence that katerina montescue enough enough chuckled diego odd i admit but whats the rhyme and reason to any of it i wish francis were here mused eneko if he werent needed in mainz he shook his head francis is more versed than i am in those aspects of sacred magic which deal with pagan powers and spirits the whole subject remains a bitter bone of contention among theologians you know are pagan demons such as chernobog independent beingsor are they simply so many manifestations of satan if you start talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin i will pitch you overboard growled pierre diego chuckled its not as silly as it seems pierre reproved the castilian lightheartedly the issue is not whether two or twenty angels can dance on the head of a pin its a dispute over the nature of angels in the first place are they immaterial or in some manner corporeal if the former then an infinite number of angels can dance on a pin if the latter then the numberwhatever it is and no one cares about thatis nevertheless finite so you see overboard growled pierre the both of you desist diego chuckled eneko the savoyard grows surly as to the subject we were discussing i have no definite opinion myself but there are too many coincidences something is at work here what asked diego not the lion surely you have said yourself that it can only be summoned by one who knows the ancient ritualspagan rituals mindwhich none of us do eneko shrugged and what exactly is this creature this being he ran fingers through his closecropped hair i dont know diego while i was living at casa brunelli i scoured that magnificent library there wasnt much but there are these occasional references to the shadow of the lion as well as to the lion itself i tend to believe that these ancient pagan spirits have a life of their own are not simply constructs of satan and if so they have their own ancient rules and customs savage ones often enough still i think chernobog is constrained himself by those rules must operate indirectly subtly lest he rouse the lion himself but in so doing i think he gazed out over the grand canal observing the shadows cast by the moonlight too many coincidences he repeated firmly then he shook his head but that is all speculation for the moment we must concentrate on matters we can get a grip on he smiled faintly in a manner of speaking so i think it is now time to have a discussion with that other young lady the one you and pierre spent most of the evening with set it up for me diego if you would be so kind lopezs castilian companion chuckled again you are bound and determined to place me in the way of mortal sin arent you lopez smiled wryly i prefer to think of it as a kindness on my part personally i think forcing you to spend time with the formidable francesca de chevreuse is all to the good it will give you something to do penance over when we finally make our pilgrimage to the holy land very long penance im afraid mourned diego her flesh i can resist easily enough but the womans mind he sighed so tempting why dont you tell me about it in the morning alessandra kat yawned looking pointedly at the door and then at her bed of course alessandra refused the invitation to go and leave madelena to undress katerina how could you katerina weve got our reputation to consider you spoke to that that puttana she spat and how could grandpapa go and join that throng around that cheap woman lucrezia was furious three of her cicebeos left her and went and hung about that that scarlet i doubt very much if francesca de chevreuse is cheap interrupted kat pushing alessandra towards the door and she seems nicewhich frankly is not something you can say about lucrezia brunelli now good night shes a slut and you and lucrezia both seem to be jealous why now go away do i dont care chapter there was thank the lord plenty of light from the windows and walkways above to let marco see where he was going and to show him the footing on the ledge that led to the hole the fact was that he really didnt want to be here at all but for some reason that maybe only god knew that strange scarred man had followed him out of the jesolo after saving both him and benito from the squalos gang and presumably for that same reason he had decided to set himself up as a kind of watchdog or bodyguard for the two of them marco felt a certain guilty responsibility for the mans wellbeing they had abandoned him when aldanto and maria had come to their rescue so here he was clinging to the ledge above the waterline with a bundle and a message to deliver and only the haziest notion if the man was still in there if he hadnt been so nervous he might never have noticed the stranger at all but marco was desperately afraid that his last escapade had drawn unwelcome attention to the entire aldanto menage attention that would have to include the montagnards and if anyone who had ever known lorendana valdosta got a good look at himwell thered be no doubt whose kid he was so hed been watching every shadow and thinking out every footstep ever since hed emerged shakily from his sickbedand hed seen the man ghosting along fifty feet behind as he went to work one morning and no matter how hed changed his course there the man was then hed watch from the dirty window of the ventuccio offices as the man shadowed benito on his first run of the morning he was ready to rush out to attack the man himself out of sheer terror when he moved across a patch of sunlight it was at that point when he got a brief but very good look at the mans scarred face that hed recognized him as the mysterious stranger whod saved them that night hed spotted the man slipping into the foundation hole across the canal and now when he watched carefully he could catch the stranger at his comings and goingsand very rarely at trailing them he thought that after a few days the man would get tired of it and go awayloco folk from the jesolo werent known for long attention spans but he hadnt and marco realized that he was going to have to do something about the fact that he was there and was apparently not going to give up on his selfappointed task firsttell caesare so that aldanto didnt kill the stranger thinking he was a threat that was easiest done in the morning before aldanto was completely awake and thinking marco had planned his approach carefully the previous morning waiting until aldanto had gotten his first glass of watered wine and was starting his second before accosting him caesare he started hesitantly theres something you should know before caesare could do more than look apprehensive marco had plowed onward that man i told you about the one in the marshes the one that helped benito and me aldanto nodded slowly putting the goblet down on the table and absently running a hand through his tangled golden mane hes here in the city marco said shortly hiding out in that rundown building of gasparsis ive seen him aldanto didnt move much but he went from sleepy and a little bored to startled awake wary and alert marco continued before he had a chance to interrupt hes right across the canal holed up in the foundation under gasparsis place marco said words tumbling over each other as he tried to get them all out please caesare i dont think he means any harm i think hes guarding us me and benito hes been following me to work and i saw him following benito on his runs i think maybe hes trying to keep us safe hes saved us once i dont know why he did i dont know why hes watching us onlyplease caesare please dont kill him aldanto regarded marco dubiously for a moment before replying you have strange choices in friends boy he picked up his goblet and studied marco over the rim of it marco hadnt the faintest notion how to reply to that so in keeping with his recent decision to keep his mouth shut when he didnt know what to say hed remained silent how sure are you of thisfriend aldanto asked when even he seemed to find the silence had gone on too long marco had to shake his head im not i told you i dont know why he helped us in the first place i dont know why hes here now i thought maybehes crazy sort of i thought hed get tired and go away but he hasnt i dont know what to tell you caesarebut i just dont think he means us anything but good caesare relaxed back into his chair a thoughtcrease between his brows marco remained patiently standing by the table wishing with all his heart that he hadnt been such a great fool this winter as to destroy any trust aldanto had in him i didnt even know that this watchdog of yours was there caesare said at last cradling his wine goblet in both hands as if taking warmth from it that argues for acertain level of expertise that is a very bad sign if he wanted us he could have killed us a dozen times by now marco whispered humbly he could have just stood back in the marshes and wed have been dead and nobody the wiser true caesare continued to brood over the wine goblet there would be no point in his watching you that i can see if he wanted to take you to use against me he should have made his move by now which makes me think you might be right about him marco heaved a completely internal sigh of relief now i cant for a moment imagine why this man should have decided to attach himself to you and your brother but since he has and since he seems to have some useful skills he paused and raised one golden eyebrow significantly and since he seems to have appointed himself as your bodyguard gratis marco flushed and hung his head he knew aldanto was still desperately short of money and he knew that the reason was because he had spent vast sums of money trying to find marco when aldanto and maria had thought he was in trouble money that hadnt been his to spend brunelli money marco assumed or money from bishop capuletti which amounted to the same thing well im not inclined to look this particular gift horse in the mouth aldanto concluded but i hope he has the sense to realize that i am inclined to strike first and ask questions like friend or foe afterwards and i want you to stay out of his reach after this yes caesare marco backed out of the kitchen hastily thank you caesare but here he was because he felt a responsibility to warn the man and because he felt he owed him something besides a warning he carried a bundle word had gotten out from tonio that well actually it was that bridgeboy of maria garavellis who had doctored their children and if the parents had any doubts the children didnt that appeared to have overcome many an adults doubt ever since his return from the swamp marco had found himself overwhelmed with new patients quite a few of them didnt even come through tonio any more the boatfolk ignoring marcos vehement protests that he did not want to be paid for doctoring their kids had taken to leaving things in marias gondola or with giaccomo things that marco had no earthly use fora woolen cloak five sizes too big laboriously knitted out of the remnants of five different lots and colors of yarn half a blanket candleends a homemade oil stove of the kind used on boats a bunch of fresh chestnuts off an incoming barge a bundle of boccalao and more a lot of it they couldnt use and maria couldnt sell or trade the stuff without going to a world of time and effort that she couldnt spare but if the stranger had come out of the jesolo he was even poorer than the poorest canaler these odds and ends could mean a great deal to him so that was the thing marco meant to dosee that the man was in some sort of comfort it was a small payback for their lives hed gotten a few coppers doing some odd jobs on his day off and those had gone for a bit of food for the man flour and salt and oil and some dried salt fish all bundled in with the rest milord marco called into the darkness of the partially flooded foundations of the building wondering if the man could hear himor if he was even there he turned away for a moment to look out uneasily over the canal behind him im no milord boy came a harsh whisper from right beside him marco jumped and nearly fell backwards in the canal a long arm snaked out of the darkness and steadied him mmmilord i marco stuttered i told you boy the ragged battered stranger said a little less harshly as he emerged from the darkness of the foundation cavern im no milord call me harrow why have you come here icame to thank you also to warn you aldanto says dont cross his path or bring him trouble um and i came to bring you a few things i thought maybe you could use food and some warm stuff its not a lot and its not good but it is something the stranger looked puzzled why then he nodded thank you marco valdosta marco nearly fell backwards out of the entry hole again how he started you look just like your mother now go marco and be careful not to come here again it is not safe and without another word he turned and walked back into the darkness with marcos gift harrow waded back into the blackness knowing his way even in the pitchdark the stale water slimy around his ankles after a short while he felt and heard dry gravel crunching under his feet harrow struck tinder and lit the tiny fire of dry debris by the flickering light he carefully surveyed the place that was now his home hed lived in worse by some freak or other the back end of the ruined bottom story was still above water level and relatively dry a kind of rubblefloored cave you had to get at the dry part by wading through ankledeep stagnant water but it wasnt bad certainly not as bad as the swamp mind you it was no palace either water condensed on the walls and ceilings above the sunken area dripping down constantly so that the air always smelled damp and with stale canal water coming in with every tide it often smelled of more than damp but there were feral cats down here which kept the place free of vermin harrow had always admired cats and he held them almost sacred now for catsblack cats in particularwere the special darlings of the goddess there was a mamacat with a young litter laired up down here that harrow had begun luring in with patience and bits of food he had hopes he could tame the young ones enough for them to stay with him for the rest he had a bed of sorts made up of a couple of blankets and armfuls of dry rushes brought in from the swamp certainly no one ventured down here so anything he managed to acquire was safe it wasnt much he sat down on the bed and opened the bundle what the boy had given him tonight was very welcome the little fire was guttering and so rather than waste his meager fuel supply he lit one of the tallow candleends marco had given to him after pulling the new cloak over his chilled body he examined each little prize with care then he stowed it all away within reach of his pallet so that hed be able to find the stuff if he needed it in the dark he remade his bed to add the new coverings to the top and the rags that the boy had brought as padding underneath then harrow blew out the candlestub and lay back on the pallet staring into the darkness thinking thinking mostly about his past thinking about his life as fortunato bespi it was mostly a life he would rather have forgotten a time when he had been one of the most deadly killers and workers of mayhem that duke visconti had ever recruited into his montagnard agents hed served the montagnard cause for which hed done much that was to the superficial look evil he had done it all with a clear conscience knowing the cause was good nowin the light of hindsighthe could see that the cause was no more than a thin cover for the ambitions of the only one hed ever really served filippo visconti harrow felt his scarred lip curling into a stiff and soundless snarl thinking of the duke of milans treachery and the willingness of his tool francesco aleri to further that treachery but soon enough he pushed the anger aside the goddess had given him other work after all his thoughts turned to young marco the boys considerateness shone through every item in that bundle duke visconti had carelessly handed out goldof which he had plenty this boy had next to nothing thered been nothing careless in that bundle the kid was unlike anyone harrow had ever known before he waskind that was it compassionate in a way that harrow didnt really understand and could only admire from a distance the younger boythat one he understood but the older onenever marcos type was the sort he could appreciate but never emulate but he understood why the goddess might have a purpose for the child of such an unlikely woman as lorendana valdosta well i cant be like that he thought somberly but i can do what the goddess put on me i can help that boy survive to do some good that ought to count for something he settled himself a bit more comfortably and thought about the warning the boy had delivered that was something he hadnt thought of he hadnt considered caesare aldanto except as a fellow guardian better make sure not to ever let him get a look at me he decided thoughtfully even as scarred up as i am he might recognize me and he wont be seeing harrowhell be seeing fortunato bespi a threat and i know damned well how caesare aldanto responds to threats then he grinned in the dark his lips curling like stiff old leather no threats from me caesare aldanto were on the same side as it happens just like old times but francesco you bastard you his grin turned into a feral snarl lets just see you try and get past caesare and me together milord francesco aleri lets just see you get at the boy through me i might leave enough for caesare aldanto to play with after chapter marco had another mission tonight besides that of dealing with the man who called himself harrow hed had a suspicion for some time that there was something not quite right in the ventuccio books today that suspicion had become a certainty and it was something that might well be very valuable to caesare aldanto maybe valuable enough to repay what aldanto had spent for his sake when he locked the front door and listened for signs of life in the apartment beyond he heard footsteps in the kitchen shod footsteps with a certain lightness to them only one of the four living in this apartment wore shoes on a regular basis so caesare was home and puttering about in the kitchen again well enough marco always preferred to accost him back there it was a friendlier placesmall tiled in a cheerful terracotta and always warmthan the sitting room he padded down the hall to the rear of the apartment and stood quiet as you please in the doorway of the kitchen waiting for caesare to notice him hed been trying to imitate the wallpaper ever since the disaster of this winter doing his level best to become invisible whenever he was in the apartment hed evidently gotten quite successful at it for aldanto got halfway through his finocchio soup before he noticed marco standing there twisting his cap nervously in his hands marco i almost didnt see you are you hungry theres enough for you if he looked then looked again and frowned have you got something on your mind itssomething i think you ought to know milord caesare marco replied quietly edging into the cone of light cast by the oil lamp above the table lord boy dont tell me youve been writing poetry again aldanto groaned putting both the bread and the spoon down its been a long day i dont think i could handle another romantic crisis marco blushed but took heart at the ghost of good humor in aldantos eye no caesare itstheres something funny going on at ventuccio aldanto grimaced and shoved his chair back a bit marco id be very much surprised if there wasnt something funny going on there half this damn town smuggles it isnt thati mean they tell us what not to see if you catch my meaning marco bit his lip as he struggled to communicate what he had discovered in a way that aldanto would understand this is something else its different id swear on my life its something that ventuccio doesnt know is going on its something i sort of ran into in the books i dont think anybody else would notice because nobody else remembers these things like i do now caesare looked serious and very much interested he quirked one finger at marco come over here and sit where i can see you marco obeyed pulling out the chair next to aldantos and plopping into it aldanto shoved his food aside and clasped his hands quietly on the table before him marco imitated his pose without really thinking about it aldanto took a deep breath ive got good cause to know about that memory of yours i dont know that ive ever seen it play tricks so what is it that youve uncovered about twice a month marco replied picking his words with care there are three or four fewer tax stamp receipts than there are items on the bill of lading inventory which is when things go into the warehouse but theres exactly the same number as on the warehousing inventory when things go out theres no discrepancy in the bill of lading and whats been paid for and no calls for reimbursement from clients so theres no reason for ventuccio to go backchecking the books so far as they figure theyve been paid in full everythings okay the way things go is thisthe bill of lading gets checked off at the warehouse door when the ship gets unloaded thats the first time they make a count then the doges official in charge of duties inspects the goods stamps each thing when it comes back out again thats the second time that way nobody can swipe stuff from the warehouse with the tax stamp on it an resell it huh aldanto looked very thoughtful sosomebody is bringing something in paying ventuccio for it then losing it before it gets duty paid on it marco nodded or before it gets inspected thats what it looks like to me milord do you know whoor even what marco nodded again spices or so it claims to be about three four little spice casks at a time aldanto chewed his lip not much is it he said after a pause marcos head bobbed enough to make a real difference to somebody id think spices arent cheap and maybe they just dont want those casks looked at caesare brooded for a bit youve been doing your damnedest to act and think like a responsible adult lately he said and marco flushed painfully lowering his eyes to his clasped hands im minded to see if you can take an adult task it just might be worth what you cost me marco looked up at him in a flare of sudden hope caesare smiled sourly youll be fishing in dangerous waters marco i want you to know that this might be something one of the younger ventuccios is running without the knowledge of the familyits maybe something worth enough money that at least one of the parties involved is going to be willing to kill to protect it youre going to have to be very very cautious and very very smart you want me to find out whos involved marco stated and you figure that ive gotten enough sense beat into me to take the risk and come out on top if i keep my head caesare nodded and coughed a little selfconsciously and you know why i sell information and i dont much care who i sell it to or how many times i sell it if you take care you should be all right but this will probably cost you your job no matter what marco shrugged it was you got me the job in the first place he pointed out reckon i can scrounge another one somewhere maybe maria can have a word with milord giaccomo maybe milord giaccomo could use a pencil pusher or knows someone who could oh no boy aldanto got a real unfeigned smile on his face no you wont have to go hunting up another job youre going to have enough to worry about come summer i had a word with milady dorma this afternoon marco blushed very hotly knowing quite well that the word was likely to have been pillow talk and it seems shes talked her formidable older brother into giving you full dorma sponsorship into the accademia think you can handle that assignment milord almostadoctor valdosta marcos jaw dropped and he stared at aldanto like a brainsick fool never never in all his wildest dreams had he thought for a moment that angelina dorma would follow through on her halfpromise once hed revealed how hed deceived her with his poetry poems shed thought came from caesare aldanto now i want you to listen to me marco valdosta aldanto continued staring so hard into marcos eyes that it felt like he was trying to inscribe his words directly onto marcos brain this is good sense good advice im giving you put your dreams and idealism in your pocket for a minute and listen to me just as carefully as you can yes marco said dazed dorma caesare said with force is going to expect you to become their house physician thats the price you will personally be paying for their gift youre going to become fairly welloff youll have to be youll be an associate of the family now i know you want to help out marias friends thats very nice its very admirablebut you arent going to be able to help the poor by being poor yourself be smart take what comes your way and use it once in the family you will be in a position to get that medical help to the canalers dorma seems to have a certain sense of noble responsibility his tone was wry cynical you can play on that if you play their game by their rules and thats the way to get what you want in this world so dont blow the chance youve been given its been my experience that you dont often get more than one marco got his jaw back in place swallowed and nodded youre right caesare i know youre right the worlds like that and youve beenreal good to me and benito better than you had any reason to and i cant say as ive done much to deserve it i just wish he swallowed again i just wish i could do something to give you a shot at what youve always wanted you wouldnt screw it up aldanto turned his eyes on him pulled a wry face and shook his head that strange look lasted only a secondthen aldanto was back to his old self one more thing he continued pulling his interrupted dinner back towards him and toying with the bread youve been granted two ways to prove youve learned your lessons and to pay me back for the trouble you caused oneto find out whats going on at ventuccio twoto become my channel into dorma and the accademia to be my eyes and ears and keep me informed you know what kind of information im likely to find interesting so dont blow it marco completed for him still a little bemused by the turn in his fortunes caesare actually chuckled right he said resuming his meal caesarewould it be all right if i wrote to my grandfather and told him about going to the accademia do you think marco asked hesitantly as he shoved his chair away from the table and prepared to leave aldanto considered the possible ramifications for a moment marco could almost see the thoughts behind the eyes i cant see where it could do any harm he finally replied it might ease his mind about you go ahead marco hesitated at the doorway thank you he said shyly feeling that he was likely to be glowing with gratitude and happiness for what caesare asked weary but amused oh go on marco if youre not hungry go and read or to bed get out of hereyou keep reminding me of how old and corrupt i am marco bobbed his head awkwardly and scooted back to the room he shared with benito the kid wasnt back from his mysterious errand with mariabut marco wasnt overly worried about him this wasnt the first time hed been out on a nightrun with maria it was no doubt dangerousbut less so than roofwalking with his old mentor claudia the singerthief and possibly even less dangerous than what marco was going to attempt so marco undressed and climbed into bedand for the first time in months the dreams he dreamed were bright he thought out a plan of action the next morning on the way to work grateful beyond words for the presence of harrow on his backtrail so that he was able to spare a bit of his mind to make plans the very first thing to do was to try to find out if this was an overall scam or limited to one particular shipwhich was what he thought likeliest given the frequency he waved to tonio on the canal below who waved back the man was much friendlier now that marco was accepting payment for his doctoring there was thank god less of that now that the killing season of cold was over marco hadnt needed his cotte for weeks the only bad part about the weather warming was that the canals were beginning to smell then would come summer plaguetime wellthat was to come now was for bare feet on the walkways and heads bared to the spring breeze and a general feeling of cheer all around that another winter had been lived through and the laxness that came with springborn laziness just might make it possible for marco to find out his information undetected he was early to work scooting in through the peeling wooden doorway literally as soon as niccolo ventuccio unlocked it the early morning sun wasnt yet high enough to penetrate into the lower levels so he had to trot around the dusty cluttered outer office lighting all the clerks lamps that was usually niccolos jobbut the ventuccio cousin didnt look at all displeased at the junior clerks enthusiasm he gave marco an approving nod and left the outer office to take up his position at the runners desk in the next office over marco had reason for being so early he was early enough to make an undisturbed though hasty check through the import lists by ship he soon discovered that only one the caique jaila a regular on the black sea run ever carried the spice shipments that had the discrepancies and only one captain alessandro montello had been at her helm since the discrepancies started this was quickly and quietly done by the time anyone else came in marco was at his desk copying the inventories from the galliot albiona into the appropriate books one or two of his fellow clerks jibed at him for working so hard marco looked up from his copying and grinned slightly what do you expect he countered when a fellow is so ugly no girl will look at him a fellows got to do something to take his mind offwhat he aint getting matteo feruzzi rolled his dark eyes expressively as he settled onto his tall stool behind his slanted desk father and saints marcoif you aint getting nothing its because you aint looking half them canaler girls is makin big eyes at youand the only reason the rest of them aint is because their fathers would beat them black and blue if they did matteo snorted scratching his curly head ugly hell i wisht i was as ugly as you maybe rosa wouldnt be giving me such a hard time marco blushed and ducked his head he knew why the canaler girls were giving him the eyenot because he was desirable because he was notorious the boatfolk had been alerted when hed gone missingand all of them knew the outcome he was just grateful that his fellowworkers didnt they were landers and canalers didnt spill canalgossip to landers and it seemed marco was semiadopted nowbecause the boatfolk hadnt told the landers about what a fool hed been and for all of that he still hadnt seen the girl since that awful day hed lookedoh how hed lookedbut hed not seen her once his only possible aid maria had been unableor unwillingto identify her marco sighed recollecting the peculiar jolting his heart had taken when hed seen hershed shaken angelina dorma clean out of his head and herself in well he couldnt think about her now he had a ticklish job ahead of him matteo chuckled at marcos blush not knowing what had caused it he was about to toss another jibe in his direction when christophoro ventuccio stalked through the outer office on the way to his inner sanctum and all four clerkly heads bent quickly over their assignments for the next bit of information marco had to wait until the appropriate book came into his hands legitimatelythough hed agreed to take on the lengthy albiona inventory with the notion of getting at that book in mind this eastrun round ship had sprung a leak in her hold and had as a consequence sustained a bit of spoilage to chalk off on the loss sheets and that was the book marco wanted in his hands the spoilage refund and salvage bookbecause if he was the captain covering tracks thats where hed have hidden those little spice casks and sure enoughthere they were and no one else ever seemed to have quite as much spoilage in such a specific area as captain alessandro montello of the jaila it looked legitimate all properly logged and with no loss on the ventuccio ledgers the only thing that the captain had forgottenwere the casks themselves the miniature barrels that spices were shipped in were unlike any other such containers in that they were not tarred to make them waterproof tar ruined the delicate flavor of the spices they were very carefully waxed instead caulked with hemp and coated with beeswax inside and out this made them very valuable no matter that they were so small cooks liked them to hold flour and sugar and salt for that mattera good many used the casks with the wax coating burnished into their wood until it glowed as workbaskets and for a dozen other semiornamental purposes so even if the spice inside had somehow spoiled through leakage or rot or insect contamination the cask had a resale value yet none of those casks from the jailas inventory ever appeared on the salvage side of the blotter and no one seemed to be interested in claiming back part of the value from the company that imported the spice for them and that was very odd indeed and it was in the spoilage refund and salvage book that marco found out who had ordered and paid for the spoiled spicesand who had apparently been so careless or generous as to absorb the entire loss casa badoero spice merchants on murano the next day and the next marco kept strictly to legitimate business waiting for an opportunity for him to get at the packets of taxstamps the venetian taxstamps placed on an article that had had its duty paid in full were distributed by a small army of officials capi di contrada who had to report to the doge and the council of ten the stamps themselves were green paper seals signed by the officiating capi and each was waxsealed and stamped twice with a unique number they were intended to be split into two parts each half bearing the same number the first part was sealed with lead and wire to the taxed goods the second part was torn off and returned after counting at the doges palace to the appropriate importer as evidence that he had paid his taxduties to both the republic of venice and the doge the stamps came in from the doges palace in bundles and were kept in the cubbyholes of the tax desk one hole for each day of the month at the end of the month some luckless clerk got to check them against the warehousing inventory and file them away marco was too junior to be entrusted with such a taskbut matteo feruzzi wasnt sure enough at months end matteo got stuck with the job and matteo never had lunch at his desk marco waited until lunchtime when matteo had gone off to lunch with rosa and the office was deserted to make his move he slid over to matteos desk counted the little packets and purloined the one representing the twelfth of the month the day the spice shipments from the jaila had been collected by the badoero representative he thumbed through the little slips as quickly as he could not daring to take the packet out of the office hovering over in a corner next to the filthy glass window where the light was best finally he came to the badoero slips and got the name of the officer in charge puzzled out capi marco tiepolo chapter benito was in as cheerful a mood as hed ever been in his life maria was so pleased with the way hed been handling himself that she had decided to take him further into her confidence well shed been damned desperate but it was a start lately being liked and noticed by maria had mysteriously become important to him shed flagged him down with the little signal theyd worked out that meant she needed to talk to him somewhere where they werent likely to be observed he finished his current run in doubletime then when there didnt seem to be anybody about ducked under the second bridge at the rio de san martino he eased his way along the ledge at water level and there was maria holding her gondola steady against the pull of the canal current kerwhicka benito chirped seeing the flash of her eyes as she looked in his direction he skipped over to the side of the boat keeping his balance on the ledge with careless ease whats it you need maria i got a problem she said in a low strained voice giaccomo sent me to pick up a payment for himonly after id got it something spooked the schiopettieri theyre all over the damned water and theyre stopping gondolas and if they find you with a bag of coin benito didnt have to finish the sentence huh caesared have a helluva time prying you away from the doges torturers pass it over maria i got to go by giaccomos anyhow they wont stop a runner in house livery and even if they do they wont touch ventuccio money if theres one lira missin benito pouted hurt cmon maria ventuccio trusts me with cash i aint as stupid as ventuccio maria replied but with no real force here she pulled a flat packet out of her skirts a packet that chinked and was surprisingly heavy benito raised a surprised eyebrow silver at the leastmaybe gold something had gone amiss if giaccomo had sent maria out to make a pickup of this much coin in broad daylight he slipped the package inside his own shirt keep heading up the canal he suggested if its you theyre looking for an lookin for you to head for giaccomos that ought to throw em off the scent she snorted and pushed off from the bank tell me mown job landsman she replied scornfully just you tend to what i give you si milady benito executed a mocking little bow then danced back along the ledge to the first waterstair up to a walkway behind him he heard maria swear halfheartedly at him and grinned julio destre had been trailing that canaler maria for hoursjust as the dandelos had paid him to do then he saw her duck under the bridgeand a moment later saw that bridgebrat benito do the same he snickered to himself keeping tabs on the brat after he dropped out of the bridgegangs and into respectability had been well worth his while after all jewel destre had graduated from bridgebrat to street bravo in the two years since he and benito had last tangled he sported a cheap rapier that he used like a club and silk scarves and a constant sneer there were dozens like jewel on the walkways of venice and work enough to keep all of them in grappa and scarves if you werent too particular about who you worked for jewel certainly wasnt the casa dandelo might derive its money from slavetrading but their ducats spent like anyone elses no one had ever beaten jewel at anythingno one but bridgebrat benito that is benito had gotten to jewels girl gotten her off the walkways and out of the gang into the purview of his mentor claudia which wasnt what the brat had intended but before you could say surprise lola had gotten installed in an actinggroup and acquired a very wealthy patron and had no further need or desire for jewel and his gang it still rankled jewel had never forgiven benito for the way the little bastard had humiliated him so this looked like a chance to pay benito back and turn a little profit by way of a couple of dandelo bonuses he watched benito moving in the shadows under the bridge he squinted but couldnt make out anything more than a brief exchange with someone in the gondolajust a meeting of a pair of shadows within the shadows then benito squirted out again and scrambled up the waterstairs and on over towards cannaregio so maria had transferred whatever it was shed picked up to the boys handslikely because of the schiopettieri stirring on the water he grinned viciously with absolute satisfaction and headed up the walkway on the brats backtrail in a few more moments hed have whatever it was maria had been carrying and hed have the boy as well to sell to the dandelos without balls he was a good age for a trainee eunuch harrow spotted the swarthy bullyboy trailing benito with almost no effort whatsoever the scarfaced lowlife was so clumsy in his attempts to shadow the boy that harrow snorted in contempt this inept street brawler wouldnt have lasted five minutes as a montagnard agent once harrow saw that the boy was on the calle del arco harrow had a fairly good notion where he was bound giaccomos that boatwoman must have passed something on to him the bravo evidently had a shrewd notion where benito was going as well since he increased his pace a trifle it looked to harrow like he was planning on ambushing the boy down in one of the sotoportego that benito would use as a shortcut on his way to giaccomos harrow gave up trying to be inconspicuousthere wasnt anyone much in this decaying part of town anywayand hastened his own steps he was almost too late he hesitated a moment at the shadows next to the gallina bridge his eyes momentarily unable to adjust to the darkness of the sotoportego after the dazzle of sun in the piazza then he heard benito shout in anger and defianceand a second time in pain he saw a bulkier shadow in the darkness of the overbuilt alley ahead of him and that was all his trained body needed to respond with precision and accuracy a few heartbeats later the bully was unconscious at harrows feet and benito huddled beyond was peering up at the face of his rescuer with shock and stunned recognition harrow gave him no chance to say a word move boy he said gruffly and next time dont go down dark places without checking to see if someones following the boy gulped and scrambled to his feet favoring his right arm yessir he gasped and scrambled down to his destination as if someone had set his tail on fire harrow saw him get into a gondola twenty yards farther on good he was safer on the water harrow considered the body at his feet thoughtfully prodding it with one toe he rubbed his knuckles absently hed almost forgotten to pull that last punch and if he hadnt the bravo wouldnt be breathing he wasnt sure why hed held back now he was mostly inclined to knife the bastard and push him into the canal but that wouldnt keep others of his type from dogging the boys footsteps on the other hand if he made an example of this bravo he might well save benito and himself some future trouble some half hour later jewel dragged himself aching in every bone from the cold foul water of the rio del panada he was lighter by his sword dagger purse and cloakat least the terrible scarred madman had slapped him awake before tossing him in he clung to the ledge that ran around the canal edge clinging to the step of someones waterdoor he clung desperately to the sunwarmed rotting wood not thinking much past the moment he hadnt swallowed any of the canal water but he was bruised all over the crazy man hadnt smashed bones hed shown he was perfectly capable of doing so jewel was just grateful to be alive enough to hurt and shiver never for the rest of his life would jewel forget that masklike face those mad eyes or the carefully enunciated words spoken in a voice like the croak of a marshbird touch that boy again the mysterious attacker had warned and the next time you land in the canal well see how well you swim without knees and elbows katerina katerina looked up from the water wary startled the last thing she wanted was to be recognized it was that scamp benito he had blood running out of his nose and looked pale and frightened common sense said she should paddle away immediately it was bad enough doing runs in daylight without extra trouble she stopped and he scrambled hastily into the boat give me a lift a bit away from here please she sculled steadily as he attempted to staunch the flow of blood from his nose you going to bring trouble on me no trouble just got itself beaten up benito paused butyes youd better let me off schiopettieri are doing checks of all vessels you got anything were inside the cordon she said scornfully dont you know anything now where were you going giaccomos he said gratefully chapter one casual question to two independent sourcesjeppo at giaccomos and barduccis cook katiahad given marco one simple and odd fact the cheapest place in town for spices wasnt badoeros to the contrary their prices were if anything more expensive it was however the place of choice for wealthy women of venice to buy their spices rafael de tomaso had been marcos source on capi tiepolo marco had had plenty of reason to visit his new friendhis good news for one some seaweed you could apparently boil up and make a suspension medium for paints to achieve a marbling effect it was one of those things marco had picked up from one of his boatpeople patients when hed mentioned painting they claimed their father had done it and he was a seaman from the faroff league of armagh that might be true you could find blood of many origins on the waterways of venice but rafael had been wildly excited by the idea and begged him to find out more so here he was with a bunch of dried seaweed and while marco was visiting hed asked rafael if he could find out something about capi marco tiepolos background the tiepolo were after all an aristocratic family though the accademia student had been a little puzzled by the question he agreedespecially after marco told him that if it became any trouble to find out he wasnt to bother as things turned out it was easy for him to resolve with a couple of casual questions to his own patron carefully spaced out over several days it seemed that capi tiepolo was a bastard son of count badoero who held large estates outside of venetian territory in padua padua wooingand being wooedby milan the badoero on murano were cousins of the count which meant they were allied with the montagnardleaning faction in venetian politicsand friendly with the pauline orders like the servants of the holy trinity yet most curiously capi tiepolo himself was apparently one of bishop pietro capulettis proteges which in the tangled weave of venices politics should have made him an adherent of rome and the grand metropolitan as the capuletti positioned themselves with the brunelli family bishop capuletti in fact was the doges representative at the accademia this was all very complicated well that sure as hell explains the badoero connection if nothing else marco thought to himself as he hurried to reach della elmos before the lunchtime crowd did but it surely doesnt explain this theres a connection here im missing and its a family connection or politics maybe its not enough to give caesareyet he scampered in at the back entrance michelo viero one of the barmans helpers had agreed to let marco take his place at noon for the next several days it hadnt been hard to persuade him not when marco had offered to split the tips for the privilege of doing his work for him michelo had no notion who or what marco was marco let him think he was a student with some gambling debts to pay and a short time to pay them in and lord and saints knew that a few of the patrons of the della elmos trattoria were quite good tippers it was close to the san marco and it was fashionable right now marco joined the milling lot of a halfdozen other boys in the shabby back hall claiming michelos apron from its wooden hook and bobbing awkwardly to the burly owner michelo still got th bad ankle the squarefaced man asked gruffly yes milord marco replied scuffing his bare feet in the sawdust on the wooden floor says hes mortal sorry milord but its still swole up the man actually cracked a smile i aint boy you lookin for a job you check by here regular i get an opening you got a place marco contrived to look grateful mmy thanks milord he stammered and slipped past him onto the floor of the tavern proper after that it was nothing but scurry and scramble and keep his head down so that nobody could see his face long enough to recognize him later bringing orders of food and drink to tables clearing away the dishes after bringing more drink when called forand keeping his ears open for elmos trattoria was where the second sons of the families metand where they met there was gossip aplenty and where there was gossip lord it was wearing him down though he leaned around a patrons bulk to snag the empty plates before the man could yell for them to be taken away he was beginning to be very grateful for his sitdown job at ventuccios he was so tired when he got home at night that he was bolting a little dinner going straight to bed and sleeping like a stone aldanto had been worried enough by this anomalous behavior that hed actually asked marco if he was all rightwhich surprised him hed explainedhe thought his mind wasnt too clear on anything after sundown anymore at least aldanto seemed satisfied two days ago hed learned that count badoero was one of lucrezia brunellis more ardent suitors and as such was not popular at elmos he was certainly the target of enough gossip from luciano delmis idle comment yesterday had come the news that accademia must be awash with new gold the way bishop capuletti was spending it and someone had said suspiciously cattishly that they wondered where it was being minted that was the problem with subversion here in venice venice ducats unpunched wingedlionfaced ducats were just not freely available outside the city the gold refined and smelted here was definably noticeably purer than coin from florence or milan the magical blessing of the molds gave the coins a faint but delicate bouquet cinnamony lavender a fake coin was not worth passing any attempt at subversion here in the republic of venice was expensive there were just too many noble families youd have to buy anyone spending that kind of gold was due a visit from the council of tens agents then somebody asked if the casa badoero was still courting the milanese the scarseamed merchant considered the question thoughtfully before replying with the carefully worded bit of information that no it was too late for courting and just as marco was hauling a load of dishes to the back he got the final key piece from mario pellagio marco overheard mention that the signori di notte were looking for some ideas on who had killed veronica mantelli and delmis unknown companion had said they need look no further than whoever was bringing the new supply of black lotos into the city it was just an unrelated comment except the rich and beautiful signorina mantelli had been prominent among lucrezia brunellis set if there was one thing that could get you into real trouble with the doge and the signori di notte and their schiopettieri it was black lotos from turkey when theyd collected the tiny blue lotos in the marshes for sophias concoctions chiano had explained from the magical lotos that had stolen the wits of ulysses men in libya had come the two strains the blue lotos was a rare wild plant in the marshes of the mediterranean coastdoubtless spread by sailors over the years the blue was a mild hallucinogenic and soporific and difficult to harvest in quantity but somewhere within the pontus mountains the plant had been bred and magically altered black lotos twenty times as powerful before refining the magically refined drug had become a plague not twenty years back then it had been freely for sale doge marco gradenigo had utterly banned its import and sale and agents of the council of ten had quietly killed importers so it was back and back in the wealthiest circles people who went aspicebuying on murano people who had ample venice ducats ducats to buy support inside the accademia where the sons of venices nobles were an available target marcos head buzzed and his gut went tight with excitement soaccademia might be involved in this new milanese policy or part of the accademia was marco was no longer so naive as to figure that what one priest wanted the rest did too assuming of coursewhich those at elmos didthat the bishops superiors were aware of his loyalties which might or might not have been the truth in either case it was something caesare aldanto would find fascinating indeed marco hustled the last of the dishes into the kitchen took off his apron and hung it up for the last time he had what he needed time to give michelo his job back now only one thing remained for marco to verify with his own eyes exactly what was going on down at the ventuccio warehouse and how it was being conducted aldanto was beginning to have a feeling of deja vu every time he looked up from dinner to see marco hovering like a shadow around the kitchen door something wrong marco he asked beginning to have that toofamiliar sinking feeling the last time the boy had had that look on his face thatwatcherhad moved in across the canal and the time before the time before was what had gotten them all into this mess caesare the boy hesitated then brought his hands out from behind his back this is for you aldanto took the slim package from the boy a long and narrow heavy thing wrapped in oiled silk he unwrapped it and nearly dropped it in surprise it was a finea very finemain gauche the like of which caesare hadnt seen much less owned since his milan days lightrippling oystershell folded damascus steel perfection from tip to sharkskin handlebalanced so well in his hand that it already felt part of him unmistakably ferrarese workmanship for nearly a century now since duke andrea delleste had had the foresight and cunning to recruit steelworkers from the east and swordsmiths from spain and brought them together ferrara blades had become the standards whereby all other swords were judged he was so surprised that his first thought was that the boy must have stolen it the lord knew it wasnt the kind of thing the boy could afford but marco spoke before he could voice that unworthy thought itits from my grandfather milord he said his face and voice sounding strained he says its by way of thanking you he sent me one for milord dorma tooseems he wrote and told him who my mother was he what aldanto tightened his hand involuntarily on the knife hilt he says marco continued that he thinks casa dorma ought to know and that im safer with them knowing because theyll put me where hurting me would cause a vendetta no one wants hide in plain sight is what he says the man has a point aldanto conceded thinking better of the notion relaxing again he checked the weapon for makers marks and sure enough on the blade near the quillions found the tiny delleste symbol the old man was a shrewd one all righthe hadnt kept his smallish city intact and largely independent while sitting between three powerful forces by being stupid he had a real instinct for which way to jump besides if dorma now knew what station the boy really was the obligations would be turned around dorma would now be in the position to negotiate favorably with the guardians of the po river and the roads to bologna and rome marco was the son of an undutiful younger daughter of the house of delleste but the delleste honor was legendary it ran as deep as the heavens were wide no trading family would want such an enemy marco would no longer be the object of charity and the dorma would actually wind up owing aldanto for bringing the boy to their attention altogether a nice little turn of eventsespecially considering that he was being paid by delleste to watch over the boys he says marco continued looking a little relieved but still plainly under strain its by way of a bribe milord for you to keep benito he says he doesnt think we better let dorma know about benito at all not that hes my brother aldanto thought about young milord lightfingers loose in dorma and shuddered i think hes right besides the boy might just be a main chance marco carefully calculated his day off to coincide with the day that the badoero hirelings picked up their consignment from the ventuccio warehouse by dawn he was down at the warehouse dock ready and willing to run just about any errand for anybody this wasnt the first time hed been herehed played runner before when he wasnt playing waiters helper at elmos he wanted his face to be a familiar one on the dock so that he wouldnt stand out if capi tiepolo became suspicious he even had ventuccio permission to be out here they thought he was strapped for cash and he was supposedly earning the extra odd penny by running on his day off hed run enough of those errands by noon that no one thought or looked at him twice when he settled into a bit of shade and looked to be taking a rest break the sun was hot down here on the dock there wasnt a bit of breeze to be had and marco was sweating freely one friendly fellow offered marco the last of his wine as he went back on shift and marco accepted gratefully he wasnt having to feign nearexhaustion he was exhausted he was mortally glad that the remainder of his selfimposed assignment was going to allow him to sit out here in the shade of a barrel and pretend to get splinters out of his hands while he watched the badoero barge being loaded twenty feet away the barge was a neat little thing newly painted and prosperous looking the boatman who manned her did not however look like the runofthemill canaler in point of fact that carefully dirtied cotte looked far too new the mans complexion was something less than weatheredand those hands pushed pencils far more often than the pole of a skip marco would be willing to bet money on it this was no canaler hired or permanent retainer this was likely one of the younger members of the family this notion was confirmed when capi tiepolo put in his appearance there was something very similar about the cast of the nose and the shape of the ears of both the good father and the boatman even in inbred venice features that similar usually spelled a bloodrelationship it didnt take long to load the tiny casks onto the small barge marco didnt bother to get any closer than he was he wasnt planning on trying to see if the articles were stamped or not he was doing what only he could with his perfect memory even amid the bustle of the dock he was keeping absolute track of exactly how many spice casksand only the spice casks nothing elsewere going into the bottom of that barge three days later when the bundle of tax stamps came in marco had his answer three more casks had gone into the barge than there were stamps for that night he intended to give caesare aldanto his full reportbut that afternoon he got an unexpected surprise a creamy white and carefully calligraphied note from the house of dorma marco finished his report to aldanto given while he was finishing his dinner in the kitchen and caesare was both impressed and surprised the lad had handled himself like a professional like an adult hed thought out what he needed to know hed planned how to get it without blowing his cover and hed executed that plan carefully coolly and patiently aldanto pondered the boys information and concluded that no matter how you looked at it it was going to be worth a great deal to both sides of this messy and treacherous game he played he nodded to himself then looked up to see that the boy was still standing in the doorway looking vaguely distressed aldantos approval did nothing to ease the boys agitation if anything it seemed worse marco is there something wrong caesare the boy looked absolutely desperate igot this today he handed a square of creamy vellum to aldanto feeling a terrible foreboding caesare opened it it proved to be nothing more than a simple invitation for marcoand a friend if he choseto come to dinner at dorma to be introduced to the family aldanto heaved a sigh of relief one may guess he said handing the invitation back to marco that milord petro dorma has received your grandfathers letter the boys expression didnt change so what on earth is wrong itsits me caesare the boy blurted unhappily i was a child the last time i was in a nobles household i dont know how to act what to say what to wear he looked at caesare with a pleading panic he hadnt shown even when hed known his life hung in the balance please caesare he whispered i dont know how to do this caesare restrained his urge to laugh with a control he hadnt suspected he had you want me to help coach you is that it marco nodded so hard caesare thought his head was going to come off he sighed all right young milordlets see if we can create a gentleman out of you he smiled dryly you may wish yourself back in the swamp before this is over inwardly he smiled this might be tedious but it would be valuable chapter i dont believe weve met before father lopez although ive seen you several times at the doges soirees francesca glanced at pierre and diego who were sitting in their own chairs in her salon not far from the basque priest im acquainted with your two companions somewhat from the last such event she pointed at diego and then pierre he has an excellent wit and the other laughs quite nicely but i suspect you didnt come here to engage in humorous repartee nor im quite sure for the other reason gentlemen pay me a visit lopez smiled call me eneko if you would the first thing id like to dispense with is formality good enough call me francesca the name de chevreuse is a false one anywayas im sure you are already aware diego cocked his head why are you sure of that youve gone to considerable trouble to establish the name francesca snorted please father lopeneko rather is a special envoy from the grand metropolitan in rome no one seems quite sure what heand the two of youare doing here in venice although i suspect metropolitan michael knows you seem to spend most of your time in the ghetto which is largely terra incognita to the venetian haut monde charitable work its said that is indeed what we have been mostly doing interjected pierre mostly mused francesca arching an eyebrow that leaves she answered her own question almost at once investigation thats what it leaves most people think youre trying to ferret out strega witchcraft and you dont asked eneko the ideas nonsense replied francesca first why bother the strega have been in venice for centuries with no one any the worse for it second youve been here for many months now ferreting out strega socalled witches in the ghetto wouldnt take more than a few weeks for any but the most incompetent of clerical magicworkers which you aredont deny itand i dont think the grand metropolitan chose to send fumblers eneko nodded accepting the compliment i thank you for that although i must admit ive wondered at our own competence the saints know weve had a difficult time ferreting out what we did come to find francesca sighed which i suppose was not my true identity diego cleared his throat ah no as it happens francescamariefrancoise de guemadeuc to use the name you were born withwe uncovered that little secret within a few weeks of learning of your existence my condolences murmured eneko i cant say i approved of your family but i would not wish such cruelty and destruction on anyone francesca stared at him she was a little shaken you learned that quickly diego began to say something but eneko waved him silent with a little motion of his hand it is time for a full introduction i think francesca let me explain who we really are he nodded toward pierre and diego by we i include more than just the three of us there are some others sworn to our cause most of themwhich is not many a halfdozenstill in toulouse or orleans another francis now resides in mainz all of us at one time were students at the university in orleans that is where we first met and forged our brotherhood which explains of course our intimate knowledge of aquitainian affairs francescas lips twisted into a wry little grimace i wouldnt have thought orleansanywhere in aquitainewould make a good breeding ground for the creation of brotherhoods and the forging of causes except those leading to personal advancement which she gave all three of them a quick inspection does not seem to be the case here pierre chuckled harshly diegos chuckle was a softer and warmer thing eneko simply smiled a bit grimly to the contrary francesca aquitaine explains much it was there that all of us finally realizedand acceptedthe extent of the rot within the church by which i mean the petrine branch for a moment francescas jaws tightened do tell she murmured i believe it took the metropolitan of orleans five seconds to decide to excommunicate my father as much time as it took to fill both his hands with gold coin her ensuing chuckle was even harsher than pierres i must say its refreshing to hear this from a petrine cleric at least i assume you consider yourself such difficult to imagine the grand metropolitan of rome sending a pauline envoy to venice petrine throughandthrough agreed eneko in fact we have a close relationship with the hypatian order hearing that francescas eyes widened in the complex welter of church institutions the hypatian order was consideredcertainly by paulinesthe most extreme of the organized petrine currents although they were generally regarded as ineffective and relatively harmless oh god she croaked dont tell me she sighed again and this time far more deeply i was afraid you werent really all that interested in my personal identity she rose abruptly walked to the doors opening on to the balcony and began to open them she had a sudden need for fresh air dont commanded eneko please francesca we took great pains not to have our visit here noticed by anyone if you open those doorsat night with this room well lit she closed her eyes lowered her head still clutching the door handles please she whispered all of that is behind me dont be stupid said the basque thats simply cowardice speaking you are not a cowardfar from it and you dont even mean it anyway she turned her head staring at him yes i do she insisted in a very soft voice which she realized didnt sound as if she really meant it the basques grin when it came was astonishing in its sheer charisma francesca got her first real glimpse of the personality which had forged this little band of brothers you adore the world of politics francesca continued lopez still grinning all this he made a little circling motion with his finger indicating the plush surroundings is really fraud and fakery you enjoy wealth im sure but is that really why you chose this life i didnt choose of course you did a woman as beautiful and intelligent and charming as yourself could have easilylong sincesettled yourself into a nice comfortable situation in fact the comte du roure added diego asked you to marry himthe night before you fled with your mother to avignon francesca almost spat he was forty years oldand looked seventyand almost as stupid as the hogs on his estates he would have shut me up in that great ugly castle of his until he died which couldnt possibly have been soon enough suddenly she burst into laughter youre a shrewd bastard eneko pardon the expression the saints know ive met few enough priests in my life who can see past the harlotry again she sighed heavily but she found it easy enough to release the door handles and walk back to her chaise yes youre right she admitted my fondest memories as a girl were the times i spent at the dinner table discussing the political affairs of the world with my father and his friends i didnt realize at the time of course how deadly those affairs could become she plumped herself back in the chaise making no effort to maintain her usual languid and seductive manner of sitting god help us all youthats what youre doing here isnt it you intend to organize a new petrine order the equivalent of the servants of the holy trinitysay better a challenge to the sots i prefer to think of it as a challenge to the petrines francesca all traces of humor left enekos face who have grown soft lazyeven corrupt and not just in aquitaine the accusations leveled by the servants of the holy trinity have far too much truth in them as you well know i leave aside their frenzied gibberish about heathens i speak of the rest ill still take the petrines over the paulines growled francesca any day of the month eneko shook his head if things continue as they have you will eventually not have a choice the paulines have been gaining in strength for a century at least soon enoughif nothing is donethey will dominate the entire church seeing the courtesans little frown of protest he pressed on it is inevitable francesca for centuries now the paulines have been the shield of christendom their power and influence ultimately derives from that simple fact so long as the petrine church is willing to loll about in comfort here in the soft and summery south and allow the paulines to wage the battle against the evil one the paulines will continue to wax in strength he shrugged and deserve to in all truth or would except their own theological errors leave them prone to a different kind of corruption one which is in the end far more dangerous than simple avarice and sloth eneko paused for a moment indeed i fear they have already fallen into that pit the servants at leastleading elements within them i should sayif not yet the knights but the knights have become more and more simply the tools of the servants francesca stared at him for a moment her hands making little movements on her thighs like caresses only firmeras if she were drying her hands before lifting a heavy weight what do you want from me she asked abruptly im a whore eneko not a theologian or a paladin i did not use that term he said mildly use it then she snapped if you want something from me speak plainly i will not use the term francesca for the simple reason that if i believed it i would not be here at all neither that term nor the term harlot he smiled thinly i can accept a lady of easy virtue easy virtue is still virtue after all again francesca burst into laughter god id hate to argue theology with you the grand metropolitan must tremble at the sight of you coming eneko winced it is true i suspect that the grand metropolitan well i seem to make him a bit nervous i can imagine which is why he sent me here of course continued eneko you might think of this as something of a test diego cleared his throat probably best not to ask whether the grand metropolitan hopes we succeed or fail im not sure he knows himself francesca smiled i could guess the smile went away and she sat up straight all right eneko but the lady of easy virtue still needs to know what you want from her you must understand the severe limits we are working within francesca there are only three of us here in venice the grand metropolitan has provided us with some funds but nothing extravagant i assure you for a moment his face grew pinched which is why to my regret i was at first forced to accept the hospitality of casa brunelli diego and pierre were not invited so they found lodgings in a poor hostel as i have now not to my regret growled pierre the hostel stinksbut not half as bad as brunelli the evil in that house practically saturates the stones enekos lips were very thin indeed but lets not get sidetracked for the moment in addition to our financial constraints francesca we are alsomore and more every day it seemsbeing watched by spies it has become difficult for us to move about outside of the ghetto without being observed he raised his hand in a little gesture of reassurance we managed well enough tonight i assure you but when the time comeswhich it surely will before too many more months have passedwhen we need to contact certain critical persons we will not be able to do so directly we need you to serve as our conduit certain critical persons husked francesca who petro dorma for one francesca tried to keep from smiling not entirely with success that should not be ah too difficult who else eneko was silent for a moment studying her you know perfectly well who else francesca when the crisis comes the actions of the holy roman emperor will be decisive my own contact with the emperor is circuitous and would take far too long to set into motion when the time arrives and besides i suspect i will be preoccupied with other matters whereas youyou are but one step removed from charles fredrik francesca froze diego coughed into his fist discreetly the hohenstauffen dynasty he murmured has perhaps dipped too often into that well for the subterfuge to work as nicely as it did once and the earl of carnac is a rather distinctive young man and well as it happens i met him once hastily im sure he doesnt remember he was only sixteen at the time visiting orleans with his mother and ah quite drunk sad to say the lad fell into bad companyroistering students the citys plagued with themand ah francesca rolled her eyes i can imagine she muttered she brought her eyes back to meet enekos he doesnt even know that i know who he is im his whore not his confidant the basque priests gaze remained level he said nothing after a moment francesca looked aside i suppose im being a bit disingenuous more than a bit i think the earl trusts you francesca the look which came on francescas face made her seem much younger for an instant i think he does she said almost in a whisper why is that enekos gaze was still level francesca sighed again im a disgrace to the aquitaine she muttered what kind of respectable whore can be trusted still level francesca threw up her hands all right then damn you ill do it she rallied briefly when the time comes not before and how will i know that still level francesca glared at diego and pierre does he ever glance aside the basques two companions grinned welcome to our brotherhood francesca said pierre diego coughed behind his fist in a manner of speaking he added as they were about to leave francesca placed her hand on the door and held it shut this will cost you eneko he smiled not in coin i trust coin im not short of she snorted she glanced at pierre although im a little shorter now than i was your savoyard here is not the only one who can smell the stink coming from casa brunelli i hired a bodyguard a week ago after the doges last soiree i do believe lucrezia brunelli has placed me on her list of enemies and shes got a reputation at least two courtesans have been murdered in venice in the past year both of whom apparently attracted too much attention from her the three priests frowned simultaneously we did not notice any bodyguard coming in said diego francesca smiled hes very good cost me plenty but it was worth it another aquitaine unfortunately so he insisted on coin rather than ah taking part of his payment in trade how long do you intend to keep poking me francesca asked eneko his tone was very mild its quite pointless i have no doubt you will set a record for the longest stay in purgatory when the time comes purgatory is not my concern she made a face no it wouldnt be and how stupid can i be to get involved with a priest who doesnt care about my sins stubbornly itll still cost you and you know the payment i want the basque nodded trust confidence to play a partas you thought you did once as a girlin the great affairs of the world sitting again at your fathers table excited by knowledge excited even more by the feeling that your knowledge mattered she lowered her head and removed her hand from the door squeezing her eyes shut to hold in the sudden tears thank you then in a very small voice forgive me father for my sins eneko placed a hand on her head and kissed her forehead not so many sins as all that child he chuckled into the glamorous hair well many sins i admit or at least the same sin oft repeated but in the end not such a great one as sins go pierre scowled its still sinful and you should give it up the savoyard grumbled but diego smiled hes a witchsmeller you know its quite a rare talent but thats really why he kept insisting on kissing your hand at the doges palace francescas eyes were quite dry now she peered at pierre intently and the savoyard looked away you should still give it up he insisted but theres nothing here in the way of that stench coming from casa brunelli and the imperial embassy enough pierre commanded eneko to francesca i will keep our end of the bargain francesca be sure of it whatever we discover will be passed along to you slyly this will be quite an adventure you know after she closed the door behind them francesca leaned her forehead against the ornately carved wood she could still feel the slight moisture from the priests kiss and was not really surprised when she thought about it that eneko lopez did not have dry lips whatever his vowsand francesca was certain he kept themshe didnt doubt for a moment that the basque was also the most passionate man shed ever met quite an adventure she murmured idiot woman but when she pushed herself away from the door she was smiling and did not even try to deny to herself that she felt as if shed shed years as well as sins the effect translated immediately into action francesca had been trying to decide for days she went directly to her little writing table and penned a note quickly for all the impeccable handwriting then sealed it with wax and went back to the door her bodyguard was standing in front of her not more than an instant after she opened the door francesca had no idea where hed come from nor did she carethat was what he was being paid for after all have this taken to casa montescue louis nobetter yet take it yourself ill be safe enough here tonight and i want to be certain it goes directly to the person addressed let no one else see it understood louis examined the name on the note and nodded easy enough he said and was gone francesca watched him leave wondering if shed hear any sound at all she didnt of course louis marillac had come highly recommended the next evening when she opened the door the man who entered made no attempt to walk quietly not that he clumped even as big as he was the noise his feet made was more in the way of a shuffle as if he were trying to disguise embarrassment mademoiselle de chevreuse he said bowing and kissing her hand i was delighted to receive your invitation to pay you a visit of course didnt feel i could refuse but please come in smoothly francesca closed the door and guided him into a chair and i insist you call me francesca the man cleared his throat francesca then but he fell silent obviously groping for words i must explain you need explain nothing francesca smiled and laid a hand on his shoulder i asked you to come did i not i am well aware of the straightened financial circumstances you are suffering from at the moment i simply wanted the pleasure of your company thats all the man stared up at her his eyes disbelieving at first then slowly the stiffness in his face began to ease its been a long time he murmured too long i think francesca took his hands and lifted him out of the chair come quite some time later as he stared at the ceiling of the bedroom the mans face had lost all of its customary sternness i havent felt this good in years not so old as all that eh she lifted herself on one elbow and smiled down at him running her hand across his wide chest he rolled his head on the pillow and met her gaze what do you want from me francesca i want you to think about the future for a change thats all lodovico your granddaughter is my best friend yourobsessionsare not good neither for her nor for you for a moment the old mans face grew fierce then he chuckled i make no promises but yes ill think about it youll do more than think about it you old vendettist francesca laughed if youve got any coins to spend ill expect you to spend them on me i dare say im a lot more capable at what i do than those incompetent assassins and spies youve been wasting your money on he grimaced true enough and what else she studied him for a moment does there need to be anything else lodovico your company has been quite a pleasure i assure you its not often i meet a man who understandsor careshow a womans body works theres always something else francesca he placed a hand on hers and gave it a little squeeze thats not intended as an insult i sometimes think courtesans are less predatory than anyone but theres always something else as you say true enough she sat up in the bed ive decided i love venice lodovico and when something i love is threatened by enemies i believe in taking steps well said he growled a moment later he was sitting up beside her tell me what you know if theres a threat the growl became a rumble as if an old lion was awakening theres your what else lodovico she whispered placing a hand back on that great wide chest and giving it a caress theres still a lot of muscle there you know chapter it smells like a trap thats for sure erik said to manfred as they strode along the loggia maybe sachs is right manfred felt his broadsword if it is theyll regret it erik looked at the abundant cover of the loggia if they dont shoot us from a distance but why us i mean we never introduced ourselves to that signori di notte that one time we met him when the coiner got burned but that message was specifically for us sealed with what the doorman assured me is the signet of lord calenti manfred shrugged search me he said you might as well ask me why here at least its daytime and there are a lot of people around this accademia place too many with books if you ask me youre a fraud manfred you were so busy reading in that embassy library you didnt even hear me come in manfred grinned my fathers duniwasals say its a sissy accomplishment i dont think they wanted me to read or cipher or tally so they can skive out of paying their hearthloyalties but with francesca being a walking library ive had to do some reading up or look a buffoon its not so bad now that i dont have some damned whiny tutor rabbiting at me about it where do we go now through there i think they walked through into a courtyard and then across to the described door erik loosened his broadsword and checked the hatchet under the small round buckler strapped to his right forearm being lefthanded had its negative points but in combat it did have the advantage of discomfitting his enemies harder for them to deal with it gave him an edge he pushed the door open fast it was a pleasant enough chamber and lord calenti did not appear to be waiting in ambush he was perusing a huge pile of papers instead very much alone unless someone was balancing on the window frame behind these draperies the venetian was very gravelooking however when he looked up to see who had thrust his door open ah come in he stood up gentlemen i owe you an apology i have come to realize that this treason nearly had the knights and myself as unwitting dupes accounts are a more powerful tool than all the spies in the world now about the incident at the house of the red cat he paused i i my god luc his eyes bulged and he screamed the hair on eriks neck stood up it was the same terrible shriek theyd heard on the night that father maggiore had been killed he heard the hiss of manfreds broadsword being drawn he didnt even know how his own came to be in his hand reverse the blade yelled manfred a crucifix erik did it he began to walk forward it was like pushing against the tide the air seemed to be full of carillons of bells all discordant sparks leaped and hissed from the steel the words of the lords prayer came instinctively to his lips to his right erik could see manfred advancing also lord calenti was tearing at his clothes his face was contorted into the same terrible rictus of a smile they had seen on father maggiore the flames and the cruel vicious laughter began together with a maelstrom wind that plucked the papers up in a snowstorm the velvetseated chair skittered across the room the writing table was hurled at them it all stopped just short and still they continued to advance a glance showed that manfreds steel armor was almost purple with the sheen of crackling lightning so was his own erik realized the discordant bells were coming to a cracked and furious crescendo he could scarcely hear his own chanting they dropped to their knees on either side of the naked and burning man and there was silence blessed silence and the flames died as if theyd never been except for the ruin theyd left behind then lord calenti began to scream it was a healthy joyful sound comparatively it was merely the scream of a badly burned human in extreme pain at this point erik realized that they had an enormous audience students were peering in at the window crowding in through the door awestruck and horrified faces gaped at them call a doctor yelled erik at the crowd we need a chirurgeon here fast a man pushed his way forward through the crowd unlike most of the gaping young watchers he was weatherbeaten and wrinkled he joined the knights at the side of the now moaning lord calenti who was curled up in a fetal position on the floor of the ruined salon the crowd was pressing forward threatening to overwhelm them manfred got to his feet back he shouted all of you out of here out his bulllike bellows were accompanied by sharp swats with the flat of his broadsword first on heads and then on behinds so he was obeyed obeyed with alacritythe fact that manfred was able to wield that huge and deadly weapon in such a light and casual manner causing no more damage that a schoolmistress with a switch was even more frightening than the great blade itself and fetch us a priest he bellowed after the retreating students we may need one erik had stayed with the lean wrinklefaced man who was gently examining lord calenti will he live he asked quietly surveying the burned whimpering man the weatherbeaten man shrugged might do might not hell need skilled nursing and lots of fluids hes going to be terribly disfigured even if he does live hell on a man who thought of himself as the ladies delight but i think you saved his soul he should be grateful for that at least even if he dies it was devouring him here help me with these from a battered pouch at his waist he produced two poultices of neatly folded leaves thick with some unguent i was taking these to someone else treatment for healing skin not fresh burns so theyre not ideal but theyll do theyll sooth and keep the infection out of his face they were in the final stages of applying them to lord calentis ruined face when a man in an elegantly tailored cardinals red with beautifully coiffured hair burst into the room despite the horror of the scene the bishops eyes were first drawn to the healer his eyes grew as wide as saucers marina he choked whatwhat are you doing here youve been gone fori thought they said there was a doctor with him the lean weatherbeaten man stood up dislike written loud on his features and i thought theyd gone to fetch a priest bishop capuletti not a scavenger i learned a thing or two about healing on my pilgrimage and i was on hand but ive done what i can get one of the accademias cadavermasters if you prefer im out of here i dont like the smelland i dont mean that of burnt flesh and parchment the bishop merely snorted dismissively as the weatherbeaten man left when hed gone he turned to the knights pilgrimage my foot more likely that luciano marina went to learn the dark arts from the devil himself now one of you had better go and fetch a doctor and the other find someone to send for the other signori di notte and get me someone to tidy this room he looked at the confetti confusion of parchment might as well throw this lot away erik shook his head im sorry monsignor i think we should stay with him whatever attacked him may come back the bishop patted his crucifixhung chain i will deal with it i am in case you cannot see your superior in the church erik shook his head again dealing with this magic requires steel monsignor not just holiness soas he is going to live and we dont need your priestly services why dont you trot off to do the errands said manfred with all the arrogance of an nineteenyearold prince crammed into his voice because of manfreds size and the fact that hed seen a lot erik tended to forget his age sometimes however like now it showed the bishop goggled his eversowhite face suffusing with choler erik thought hed better intervene thats enough manfred go and bellow for someone at the door ill collect these papers lord calenti seemed to ascribe some importance to them perhaps theyll mean something to one of the other signori di notte bishop capuletti sniffed theyre just bills of lading and accounts from the bankers at the rialto bridge he said in voice like iced vinegar he deliberately ground one underfoot erik calmly picked it up and smoothed it it was indeed nothing more than a partly burned bill of lading a spicecargo from acre it seemed to be innocuous enough loading unloading damages signed by the captain and bearing official looking seals the bishop snatched at it erik held it away manfred watched as erik lifted the piece of paper out of the portly bishops reach hed known erik for the better part of eight months now and he knew the danger signals hed better be ready to intervene erik was easygoing and rational a lot of time hard to anger but the icelander had a rigid code of right and wrongand the bishop had overstepped it erik would not let little things like the future stand in his way a man has nearly died for what is contained in these pieces of paper eriks voice was absolutely level utterly expressionless you will treat them with respect eriks grayblue eyes bored into the redclad prelate with an implacable stare that look would have sent a ravening lion creeping off quietly to its lair the bishop about to make some stinging comment looked into those eyes he shut his mouth raised his hands pacifically without even thinking about it seeing bishop capuletti wilt manfred relaxed manfred knew himself to be much quicker to anger but erik when he finally got angry didnt cool easily the famous norse fury of ancient times didnt lurk all that far beneath the civilized and pious surface relief in the shape of a doctor and a worriedlooking schiopettieri arrived ah father belgio squeaked the prelate as you are both an ordained priest and a doctor er i think id better go and confer with the accademia authorities he left hastily without his dignitybut with his head manfred turned his attention to the doctorpriest the schiopettieri had taken one horrified look a second to confirm just who the burned man was and had followed the bishops example of a hasty exit hopefully he was going to call someone more senior the doctor on the other hand had knelt by the fetalball of burned man he looked at the poultices where did these come from a weathered and wrinkled fellow called marina apparently erik answered your bishop didnt like him much do we take them off the doctorpriest shook his head no i wonder if he knows what he is dealing with someone a woman has imbued those with a great healing and soothing power i sense the work of one of the neutrals one of the ancient nature spirits about them they may do more good than i can now this man has been spiritually attacked as well as physically hurt the physical hurt is great but the spiritual hurt is greater his life is like a guttering candle flame this not a consecrated place so we will need circles of exclusion and the evocation of guardians to secure and defend him are either of you skilled in the working of magic both erik and manfred hastily shook their heads the doctorpriest sighed shook his head the gesture seemed one of slight puzzlement your auras never mind take these he dug into his bag and came up with a censer salt and a bottle of water he hesitated a moment water yes he looked carefully at erik water there is much latent force in you he turned on manfred and you can take the salt it is right neither of you must ever take fire or air the enigmatic doctorpriest then placed candlesticks around the venetian lord fiat lux the doctorpriests voice so gentle a few moments before now commanded and there was light the censer in his hand began to smoke let that which cannot abide depart in the name of jesus in the name of the holy spirit he led them praying in the ninefold circle of smoke sprinkled salt and water then when that was done and they were enclosed in a wall of smoke they went to work under the doctorpriests direction first unguent then poultices and then as gently as possible they rolled calenti onto a blanket the doctorpriest had brought as they worked the priest led them through various psalms father belgio called on names of power evoking guardianship and protection on the burned lord then he led them in thanking and dismissing the guardians and the wall of shifting smoke was gone to reveal abbot sachs sister ursula several knights and three people who were obviously venetian nobility all of whom wore expressions of irritation worry and perplexity in varying degrees what in heavens name have you been doing in there demanded sachs gods work brother answered father belgio tranquilly lord calenti can be moved now it is gods will that he should live at least for now and these brave knights saw to it that he was spared but what were you doing demanded sister ursula we tried to reach you to break in but to no avail abbot sachs and i are two of the most skilled practitioners of christian magic in the servants of the holy trinity father belgio smiled tiredly i am a simple healer and one whose gift it is to be sensitive to certain occult forces a minor magician only he looked at erik and manfred i can only think that some of the primitive nature forces lent their aid they are capricious and i am exhausted can some stout fellows be called to carry poor lord calenti to the chapel i think it best that he be nursed there will he live demanded ursula she shuddered burns are dreadful i fear them manfred noticed that the nuns hands were balled into such tight fists that her knuckles were strained white she looked ready to faint it was the first time hed seen the icewoman display as much as a trace of any emotion belgio nodded if it is gods will we will accompany him to the chapel and pray it was surely the hand of the lord and his apostle paul that brought the knights of holy trinity here today said sachs actually it was that letter from lord calenti abbot the one you thought was a trap said erik yawning it is still gods work insisted sachs manfred found himself yawning in sympathy he suddenly felt drained two sturdylooking schiopettieri took up the corners of the blanket and lifted lord calenti he whimpered faintly one of the worried looking venetian noblemen cleared his throat may we talk to you about it manfred looked at erik the icelander showed no signs of following the procession what do you say erik a glass of wine would be nice erik swayed slightly some of that grappa might be even better two of the venetians looked a trifle taken aback the third a shorter balding man who was considerably younger than the others smiled why not lord calenti is in good hands there does not appear to be anything further to do here let us go and sit these good knights down give them a wellearned glass and see what they have to say an alarm bell rang in eriks head nothing more to do here he looked hastily around the salon someone had righted the desk and taken away the smashed chair theyd also taken away the laboriously gathered partially burned bills of lading and accounts from the bankers only two or three badly burned fragments which must have been within the circle still lay on the floor do you know what happened to the bills that were here a whole stack of them in that corner the three shook their heads they will doubtless have been taken somewhere for safekeeping said one as manfred gathered up the three remaining fragments not just thrown away the balding slightly plump man laughed in venice never we are a republic of traders and that means records half the reason we make a profit out of you northerners is poor bookkeeping on your part come there is a tavern just around the corner zianettis i remember it well they walked to the tavern past knots of worried peering students in silence except for the baldheaded nobleman quietly informing erik and manfred that he was petro dorma he did not mention the names of the other two venetian lords inside zianettis dorma secured a room at the back once everyone was seated he poured the strong italian brandy which was already on the table now said oldest of the three tell us what happened erik shrugged the doorman at the imperial embassy received a note from a runner the note was sealed with lord calentis official seal it was addressed to us by name but it was taken to abbot sachs who was meeting with the knightproctors they called us in i expected them to haul us over the coals like we were bad children said manfred with a grin the abbot told me to open the letter and read it to the assembled proctors said erik managing not to smile at manfreds accurate assessment lord calenti asked us and only the two of us to please come to his rooms here before sext he said it was of greatest importance since it was then well past terce we left immediately on the abbots instruction a party of knights followed some ways behind us so as not to frighten anyone who might be attempting an ambush manfred shrugged it looks as if someone tried to kill him before he spoke to the knights all he did manage to say to us was that hed uncovered treason that almost had the knightsand himselfas unwitting dupes and that accounts are a more powerful tool than all the spies in the world then he started to say something about the incident at the house of the red cat but the attack came before he got out more than a few words the three looked startled obviously recognizing the name of the bordello so erik had to recount that episode he edited it cutting francescas part out entirely he could still feel his face glowing despite that well we can find out where those orders came from said the eldest he was plainly familiar with the neardockyard bordello which led erik to suspect that he wasor had beenan officer of the venetian fleet probably an admiral judging from the mans easy assumption of authority the main clientele of the house of the red cat were naval officers common seamen frequented less expensive brothels and ill talk to doge foscari said the second nobleman at least we know the knights are not part of this conspiracy im going to try to track down these accounts announced the baldheaded dorma any idea what theyre about erik shook his head i only saw one a bill of lading a cargo of various spices and the damages and there are these pieces manfred handed over the pitiful scraps of burned parchment i cant make anything of them dorma examined them its a tally of punched ducats being released to merchants in payment for goods probably a copy ill try to track down the original but there are thousands of pages to go through unless i know where to start the second one was a list of punched ducats exchanged for the whole ducats used in the city had been a list at any rate what was left of it contained only the names of two merchant houses with no amounts surviving and a third amountwith the name itself no longer readable the third scrap was simply a capi di contrada seal on a piece of paper the three signori thanked manfred and erik and left them to finish their drinks manfred chugged his and called for a second erik sat sipping well i owe you an apology i heard the bells this time not very musical are they manfred scowled you said it was inside my head after i was flung away onto that flimsy chair you know they complained to me about breaking that chair ha and i could have saved that whiny old servant of the trinity as well only that force seemed much stronger erik smiled there were two of us this time come on drink up time we got back manfred shrugged theyll never notice if we dont erik ive a need to accumulate a few sins to confess erik shook his head hiding a reluctant smile behind his hand get up before i turf you off the bench they were crossing the campo under the eyes of the bunches of students still buzzing with hushed talk when a woman came running up to them people erik had noticedparticularly the venetianstended to avoid the knights that was hardly surprising the likes of von stublau were likely to knock anyone who got in their way into the nearest canal so a young woman running up to them was something of a surprise to judge by manfreds expressioneven if by her dress she was a servingmaidit was a welcome change she was pretty enough she curtseyed hastily nearly dropping the bundle she bore pardon your honors the students says you are the ones who saved mlord calenti manfred bowed we are signorina ooh from demons seventeen feet tall with horns and lots of teeth and dancing naked witches with six breastslike dogs and i heard the whole building was destroyed and legions of cherubim not that i understand why fat baby angels can fight well but father pietro always tells us they do then there were those with trumpets and the whole city shook and the winged lion itself stirred in the piazza and there was a rain of blood her eyes sparkled as she tilted her head quizzical for more juicy details even manfred was gobstopped er no it wasnt quite like that well if they werent going to oblige shed help out and poor lord calenti him so handsome and all he fought like a tiger before he got so burned by the devils they burned the clothes right off his back with their pitchforks and i dont know why they say that because surely it must have got the clothes in the front but that would have got his privates or at least showed his smalls and he has such elegant knitted smalls she giggled coyly not that a girl like me would know anything about that er erik began that was quite enough interruption so when signora elena said she needed someone to take mlord his best nightshirt because he was too sick to move and silvia and maria were both too scared to come for fear of demons and all the boys at the accademia ogling them and i dont know why because marias been walking out with that rough samarro boyand whats a few noble students compared to thati said i would take it only then signora couldnt find it and ive had to bring him his second best and it hasnt got nearly such nice embroidery and now i dont know where to find him and none of these students want to tell me they probably couldnt get a word in edgeways thought erik the chapel he said hastily pointing thank your honors she said curtseying again then peering at manfred youre awfully handsome your honor and so big too squeaking and giggling at her own temerity she scuttled off towards the chapel its not that funny manfred shook his head at erik whose steel armorproof against great dark magicswas in danger of being shaken apart internally erik snorted his shoulders still shaking you fancied her and she fancied you i dont see the problem just the girl for you to take home to your mother manfred raised his eyes to heaven hah funny funny icelander sense of humor cowpat in the face thats vinlanders grinned erik in the aftermath of the terrible encounter and with the grappa burning in his veins he was feeling unusually silly icelanders are more likely to put sheep droppings in your stew huh ill watch out for olives in ragout while youre arou manfred stopped suddenly his face had gone serious erik thats the third victim that we know of that had just lost a piece of clothing remember old maggiore was complaining about his cassock and that coiners housekeeper and his favorite cap and now a nightshirt eriks felt the blood drain from his face ive heard of this mammets with the victims hair and clothing we better tell sachs manfred pulled a wry face if we can persuade him to listen erik shrugged and began to walk on if not we can perhaps get calenti to give us a lead on who could have got hold of one of his nightshirts do you think hes going to live asked manfred those are major burns erik nodded hell live just as long as he is in the care of that priest hes a good healer that man chapter maria stared at the two golden hairs in her workcalloused hand she stared at them not for the first time or the third time or the thirtythird time it couldnt be true both hairs came from caesares pillow and they certainly werent hisor hers they didnt even come from the same head one was much coarser yellower and had a dark root the other finer and more wavy there had to be some other explanation there had to be only it was hard to work out what it was her heart and mind felt as if they were tearing each other apart this wasnt the first time shed been suspicious but this was the first time shed had hard evidence whatcha starin at maria benito had come in unobserved she had thought she had the place to herself the little scamp had probably come in the thirdstory window hed have to give that up one day he had turned fifteen over the winter and he wasnt so little any more hastily she thrust her hand into her skirt pocket before benito could see none of your business she snapped benito looked hurt hey come on maria you can trust me i carried that cargo to giaccomos for you right and i got a bloody nose from jewel as well as my ribs nearly kicked inand i still got it there for you not one lira missing she felt herself floundering he wasnt a bad kid really she had to talk to someone if she talked to one of the cousins theyd try to kill caesare benitoand marco toohad proved themselves both trustworthy and honest but marco was so so good even if he was nearer her own age benito she could at least talk to about this sort of thing he was more worldly than marco marcos interest in girls was real but soinnocent sending them love poems on the other hand shed seen benito doing some experiments in heavy kissing with one of the sarispelli girls those two girls were heading one way she took a deep breath and rushed her fences benito do you think caesare could be seeing some other woman he looked as if shed just smacked him in the face with a wet fish but only for a moment na there aint no one in venice as pretty as you she snorted and took a swing at him shed noticed that hesitation but his reply still gave her a smile you were born to be hung benito i aint pretty now according to that sarispelli girl if only you could kiss as sweet as you talk youd be inside the pants of every girl in town benito felt himself blushing he had thought that he didnt do that anymore still shed spotted that hesitation merda women didnt feel the same way about this as men did well except for marco but caesare just did what a real man did played the field at the same time he also felt for maria she so wanted caesare but there was no way shed keep him except as a parttime lover and the funny thing was that maria garavelli was pretty she was more than just pretty she was maria tough as nails she had to be as a woman alone working small cargos on the canals but there was a gentle side to her too she really was quite something compared to say lisa sarispelli who was only a year younger than maria but good only for kissing and well a bit of fumbling experimentation maria was worth ten of her maria was working so hard with her speech and getting marco to teach her to read now all to try to raise herself up to caesares level to keep him regretfully benito knew that there was just no way she could do it caesare well he and marco owed him but benito could sense that caesare had ambitions that went a long way beyond a canaler wife it would all come apart one day and benito didnt want to be around when it happened best to try to lead off the subject im workin on the kissing benito said with a shrug i mean hows a fellow supposed to get better without getting some experience maria snorted benito noticed she was smiling however just be careful it dont end up with her up the spout or you with the french pox nito she walked off when she was well gone benito exhaled long and slow hed better have a word with caesare about this men had to stick together maria was too preoccupied to be keeping a proper lookout normally this was what she did well nobody could sneak up on her it was a lesson a woman learned quickly out on the water or else especially on a foggy morning like this she knew she wasnt looking out properly but caesares infidelity was preying on her mind should she confront him did she hope it was just a onceoff just pretend it had never happened so many times shed said to herself just enjoy now dont even dream about tomorrow just be grateful for what you have got now he was so beautiful so refined she was just a canal girl something bumped into her boat maria nearly dropped her paddle and jumped overboard to her relief it was only a hooded girl in an even shabbier gondola than her own idiot look where youre going snapped maria the girl held up a hand apologetically sorry this fog i misjudged the distance i just wanted to ask you something maria had placed her now working nightsas she did sometimes for giaccomos cargosshed seen her before also lately in the early mornings she was the one the canalers called the spook someone who sculled a gondola like she was canal born and bred but nobody knew her she was nobodys family looking at that dress under the hooded cloak maria guessed it was because she wasnt anyones family the dress was old but had once been very good too good for canal and word was out on the water that you stayed clear of her word was she had connections that could get you hurt strega maria tensed she really didnt need any more trouble now yeah what she asked warily she cant be more than a year older than me thought maria and ive got bigger shoulders i could tip her into the water and hit her over the head with a paddle in this fog nobodyd be the wiser hear what it was she wanted and if it was trouble in her heart of hearts she wondered if she could do it the girl smiled uneasily well um you go to giaccomos quite a lot here came trouble maria tensed nodded but didnt say anything messing with giaccomos cargos meant trouble and you didnt cross giaccomo the girl continued im looking for a party that goes there sometimes only i dont want to go there myself could you give him a message from me maria relaxed slightly depends who well his name is benito hes a kidabout fifteen maybe sixteen dark curly hair round face hes a runner with ventuccio suspicion leapt into marias mind was this woman somehow tied to whoever had tried to kill marco with the mess their mother had been involved in could be could be it would explain the oddities might know him why even in the fog maria could see that the other girl was blushing just wanted to see him thats all she said airily hes hes a friend of mine ill be around campo san felice between seven and halfpast most nights somehow maria restrained the bubble of laughter that benito shed have to warn him to stay clear of this girl yeah ill tell him who do i say benitos got so many girls chasing him hell need a clue the girl shook her head hes a kid i mean um just tell him kat wants to see him its not about business or anything she said hastily just want to ask him something uh huh kat who benito wasnt that much of a kid the girl looked faintly alarmed and taken aback just kat er kat felluci kat was surprised to see the canalers eyes narrow like that then she remembered it had been all over the canals what a stupid name to choose for herself it had just come from silly daydreams and just not being able to come up with a different name on the spur of the moment she flicked her oar and sent the gondola off into the fog to hide her burning face caesare hadnt been in when maria had rowed her reluctant way to the waterdoor she still hadnt made up her mind what to do about caesare but shed been bracing herself to meet him soof coursehe wasnt there both marco and benito were however it set her offbalance not having caesare there all day shed been making up her mind just what to say to him and then changing it she hadnt even had time to wonder too much about the girls choice of surname it obviously wasnt hers it could be coincidence it wasnt that rare a name or she might know marco met one of your girlfriends today benito benito looked suitably embarrassed aw shes not really that shes just someone to practice kissing on she teased i didnt know about this one shes a big girl too benito looked startled huh who maria gave a wry smile kat or that is what she calls herself kat benito looked puzzled wears a hood said maria taking a glass of wine from marco he was considerate like that and works nights mostly girl from a good family by the way she dresses light dawned on benito oh that kat shes no girlfriend of mine he added hastily marco looked amused i didnt know you were into the petticoatline yet benito benito looked a little shamefaced about growing up thought maria um well kats no girlfriend of mine ive just done some work for her maria shook her head word is out on the water that she aint someone you should mix with benito trouble anyway she said you could find her at campo san felice between seven and halfpast most evenings i know shes to be steered clear of now but well i didnt know then admitted benito with shrug valentina and claudia both warned me off marcos amusement had entirely drained away if they did that i hope you listened to them and have stayed away from her benito looked uncomfortable i figured out she was the kind of girl you dont mess around with but well you know when i had that spot of bother with jewel uh huh well after that marshloco showed up and beat him to a pulp i was running on but kind of sore and a bit spooked and there she was and she owed me a favor maybe so i got her to give me a lift to giaccomos she knew exactly where the schiopettieri were working maria swallowed her wine thats scary in itself and that explains why shes looking for you at giaccomos anyway do you know when caesare will be back she was irritated at herself for allowing that hesitation and hurt to show in her voice when she mentioned his name wont be in tonight said benito maria was proud of her casual tone this time around oh well im pooped im going to catch some shuteye he didnt say where he was going did he benito laughed he never does maria she nodded and headed up the stairs benito did however know where he was meeting caesare he had work to do for him he felt a little uncomfortable about the evasions caesare had said it was best to give her time to get over it and benito supposed he knew but maria trying to keep the misery out of her voice when she said caesares name made him feel uncomfortable even a little miserable himself benito who is this kat asked marco and whats bothering maria kat just a girl i know got the sharpest tongue in venice i ran into her by accident brother and im keeping clear of her ill stay away from giaccomos for the next while and maria benito shrugged his shoulders shes worried about competition marco pinched his lips oh he sighed i dont know what to do about it because we owe him but its not right brother benito shrugged again a mans got to do what a mans got to do marco and its not our affair huh marco sighed again its not right benito felt uncomfortableas he frequently did when marco drew the moral line yeah well nothing we can do about it its kind of your fault marco that was unfair and he knew it caesare had always played the field just that angelina in the last few months had been somewhat inyourface to marco but that too seemed to be tapering off as if the sheer heat of it was burning it out anyway ive got to go out ill see you later he said hastily i dont trust you aldanto he could see the swarthy heavybodied man was ready to leap like a cat whether it was at caesares throat or away benito couldnt be certain by caesares posture benito could tell that he too was keyed up small movements betrayed him benito hiding in the deep shadows on the roof across the alley prided himself that hed learned well from caesare he could even read his mentor but caesares voice was deadsteady the feeling is mutual francesco aleri but its business you are not welcome back caesare snorted im not coming back and if i happen to die some very interesting information will be forwarded to ricardo brunelli it was the heavyset francescos turn to snort youve got nothing weve changed things since your time back on the shadowy rooftop benito squinted trying to absorb the details of his face so the man was a montagnard agent well his official title was milanese trade ambassadoratlarge benito knew that from delivering the initial message to the man at the german hotel next to the rialto there was a flash of teeth from caesare everything he asked slyly even your sleepers aleri gave a short bark of laughter you dont know who those are you were never on that part of the operation ah but on the other handlorendana valdosta was purred caesare now why dont we talk business in there youve got the dandelos in your pocket the two walked into the small shrine and to benitos frustration he could hear no more than the indistinct murmur of their voices no matter how hard he strained his ears it had been something of a shock to hear his mothers name but obviously caesare had gotten something useful out of marcos careful writings well he was glad theyd paid something back minutes later the two emerged and went their separate ways benito waited a good minute before slipping away like a ghost a good minute after that harrow moved marco was at least asleep safe but this younger boy he was old delleste reborn if rumors about the old duke were to be believed harrow found benitos preference for roofs made him hard even for an experienced formeragent to track basically harrow had to try to secondguess him either he was a good guesser or the goddess was doing more than her fair share of intervention hed get lost in the alleyways and then catch sight of benito against all probability harrow had decided that if the goddess wanted the boy followed shed make sure he succeeded marco was easier for this harrow was devoutly grateful but he was also glad hed followed the younger boy tonight first into the hotel and then to this rendezvous obviously the goddess had meant him to witness this obviously also aldanto hadnt meant benito to be here but just from following him harrow knew that benito wasnt good at doing what he was supposed to do this meeting was a worrying one hed been sure that a meeting between aldanto and aleri could only be short sharpand end with aleri dead in his former life as fortunato bespi hed seen both mens swordsmanship aldanto had the edge aldanto was perhaps the best hed ever seen so what was this all about no good hed bet interesting to hear lorendana valdostas name it had nearly startled him into moving that had to be the goddesss hand again she watched montagnards too chapter luciano marina had not expected to just move back to his old life he thought hed manage to scavenge a living around the calle farnese what he hadnt realized was that the death of gino despini had left an empty hole at the center of venices strega community after marinas disappearance despini had done his best to keep the citys strega solid but with despini killed by a still unknown hand the strega in the city were terrifiedwhich luciano was now convinced had been the purpose of the murder and now that the servants of the holy trinity were stirring up talk of burning out the whole of the ghetto being in a visible position of leadership was something all other strega were shying away from he hadnt realized it when he slipped into itzaak ben josephs shop hoping to scrounge a few coins to start a life in the city he had little enough to offer some medicinal herbs a couple of twists of blue lotos a little fly agaric and his patchy memory hed not expected itzaak to peer at him warily when he gave the old greeting and once he recognized the face fall on his neck grimas you have returned to save us in our hour of need dressed in new clothes and walking around in the city which had once been his home hed felt ready to chance his arm appointments to the accademia were in the hands of the council of ten but the marciana library wardenpositions were within the gift of the doge and given lucianos past history with giorgio foscari the doges majordomo had been persuaded to arrange an interview luciano had been shocked to see how much doge foscari had aged still hed bowed low and hoped the doge would remember him he had after all provided working diagrams of several of the clockwork devices foscari loved your grace will perhaps remember the waterclock designs i obtained for you it had indeed rung a bell with the old man where have you been dottore marina asked the old man querulously the idiots in library now never set anything out clearly doge foscari several years ago i undertook a brief journey to fruili on the way i was set upon beaten and left for dead by bandits it took me some months to recover under the care of a traveling monk i could not remember who i was or where i came from id been robbed of everything that gave any indication of my home or my station the monk was on his way to the holy land so not knowing what else to do i went there with him on foot my memory was miraculously restored at the church of the holy sepulcher in jerusalem now i have returned a wiser andi thinkbetter man but i must find employment does your grace need anyone in the marciana the doge pointed a bony finger at him i need you there i need more designs for my collection of mechanical marvels all i ever get these days is reports of yet another ship lost weve even lost galleys do you know when lastexcept at warthe republic lost a galley and now we have lost five to separate storms his voice quavered slightly send me some interesting plans for mechanical devices you must have seen some things on your pilgrimage to inspire you luciano accepted readily it would be a short step from the marciana to occasional lecturing slots at the accademia marina was confident that within six months he would be able to regain his position in the accademia now that he was back back in the heart of the academic and strega worlds the fragmented patches of memory were uniting he nearly had it all back now and his fear was growing steadily strega were dying and there was something very rotten at the accademia moneylots of it in a student community students were always broke but from somewhere a river of coin was pouring in to the worst and most thuggish young noblemen and knowing some of the families it wasnt coming from their parents there were alsounless he misread it totallyat least two cases of black lotos addiction among the students where was that coming from who would dare trade in the cursed stuff and these terrible magical murders naturally many people blamed the strega for the killings but leaving aside the fact that strega themselves had numbered among the victims anyone familiar with the principles of magic would understand that these killings could not possibly be the work of strega everything about the murders shrieked demonism the community was almost paralyzed with fear and his carefully placed scrying spells revealed nothing nothing more than several sources of darkness and some ice and something trying to get to him personally a creature of the water perhaps a monster perhaps a shapechanger it might not appear to be more than an unrestful period with trade being bad disease rife and factional stresses highbut magically venice was under siege still something was stirring on the side of venice also one of the old pagan neutral powers something the strega treated with great respect even if they did not fully understand it the lion of saint mark it was stirring if not fully awake demons were not the only ones who could work indirectly and in mysterious ways luciano had fully accepted that the shadow of the lion was at work when he spotted young rafael de tomaso de tomasos mother had raised her son in the strega tradition luciano in fact had been there at the comingofage ceremony as one of the sponsors even if the young artist hadnt known grand master marina by sight he luciano knew that boy he had expected to see him at the accademia what he hadnt expect to see was marco valdosta walking beside him deep in conversation when he saw marco luciano studied the crowd in the campo long and carefully it had taken him nearly fifteen minutes to spot harrow in the shadows by the loggia circles within circles coincidences that shouldnt happen the lion casting its shadow he was certain of it now the knowledge brought courage with it he was standing looking at the scene his attention absorbed when someone spoke to him snarled at him rather he turned to see yet another familiar face one much less welcome than marcos especially now that he was a bishop recognition was plainly mutual are you deaf demanded pietro capuletti i asked you what youre doing here luciano smiled wryly admiring the campo its a more attractive view than a fat fellow in red capulettis face hardened your tongue will get you into a great deal of trouble with the church we want to know what you are doing back in venice luciano wondered who the we was luciano distrusted pietro capuletti hed been a sneaky boy and luciano marina would bet he was an even more devious man he also wondered if pietro was still puppydogging after lucrezia brunelli he was a fool and always had been there had never been any chance lucrezia would have married him even after he became a bishop no capuletti was ever going to be important enough to marry a brunelli run errands for them yes get fat on the crumbs from their table yes but curti like the brunelli would never settle for lesser curti as ive told you before ive been on a pilgrimage to jerusalem and now that ive returned i intend to reestablish myself here at the accademia he smiled urbanely dont try to threaten me pietro i have many friends in the church more than ever after jerusalem let capuletti sweat that one many pilgrims took vows of anonymity a trip to jerusalem instead of wandering mindless in the jesolo marshes would have certainly given him some church contactsperhaps of great importance ha the bishop left without a further word his anger proclaimed in his flaming cheeks and pursed little mouth chapter the rain was hissing down on the water at a time when all sensible canal peopleanyone with any sense at allwere indoors in front of a fire maybe with a nice hot glass of mulled wine maria was out in the wet but things were rather tense between her and caesare right now and hed asked her to do this especially and she really wanted to show him that she did love him the last two weeks had been horrible left her sick to her stomach with a mixed mess of emotions hed been so hurt when she had accused him that hair might have blown in the window or something didnt she trust him and then hed been loving and attentive once hed gotten over being distant and hurt she was still suspicious but she loved him how could she let him go so here she was getting soaked to the skin she must be the only person on the water right now but no there was another gondola on the canal as it went by without so much as a greeting from the other paddler maria realized that she knew her that wasnt really surprisingshe knew most of the boat people and if anyone would be out in the half dark and rain it would be the spook maria was grateful at least that her destination wasnt all the way out to guidecca to drop letters with captain della tomasso this time tonight her rendezvous was comparatively close too close to the casa dandelo and the reek of its warehouses for comfort you could smell the slaves even in the clean rainwashed air she pulled into the little landing good there was no one around yet she must be early she shivered she moved down off the stern to the duckboards and sat down huddled against the gunwale someone loomed suddenly through the rainy darkness well lets have it grumbled maria im wet and cold and i want to get home and then someone else jumped onto the stern behind her maria stood up hastily reaching for her knife hey figlio bright lights and stars exploded in her skull but not before shed seen that it had been luciano matteoni jumping onto the stern of the boat when she awoke it was to the betraying stench of the casa dandelo but all she wanted to do was to be sick and pray the pain in her head stopped once shed cast up everything that was inside her onto the rotten straw blessed oblivion came again when she gradually awoke again naked cold still sore lying on the filthy straw a scant few inches from her own vomit she was legshackled too it was then that the true horror of situation dawned on her casa dandelo slave traders officially they were not permitted to touch hide nor hair of venetian citizens officially their cargo was checked the poor of venice knew the truth the doge and the case vecchie turned a blind eye the dandelos took what they could and if the slave might complain to the capi di contrada signing the cargo outbound on ship they took out the tongue that might wag or beat the victim senseless either way the dandelos never released any of those who found their way into their clutches they brought a lot of money into venice and venice looked the other way after all it was only the poor and unwanted who ended up in their clutches the dandelos didnt want a fuss as far as the officials of venice were concerned their depredations were nearly the equivalent of human garbage collection so long as it stayed that way the council of ten and the signori di notte left them to it so who would notice if she was gone well caesare would be waiting for his message hed panic a short darkvisaged thickbodied man looked in at her instinct made her cover her nakedness but this man wasnt interested you could see it in his look merchandise she was no more appealing to him than a bale of cotton would be calm now try to talk your way out let me out ive got friends with contacts ricardo brunelli the slaver grave a sardonic snort you wouldnt believe how many cousins of the doge go through here anyway the party wanted to know when you were awake he turned and walked off can i have some water maria called after him if the man says so she was left to her fears the minutes passed slowly the man who now entered walked like a cat he was very like caesare in that way ive got some questions for you about caesare aldanto i will get answers if i get good enough answers youll go free and caesare would die you can burn in hell figlio di una puttana his hand twitched you are lucky there are bars between us woman he snarled any more lip from you and ill see that you end up as a whore in aleppo servicing a hundred freshfromthedesert rancid camel drivers a night you think youre tough you might last a year she spat at him he wiped the spittle away from his face it seems you need to think about it lets see how well you spit after a day of being dry tonios whistle woke marco sick child must be very sick to call marco out of bed marco seemed to be suffering from a lack of sleep these days hed been to see rafael the night before hed been for another private meeting with milord petro dorma last night he liked the balding chubby perpetually worriedlooking petro he also got the feeling that although dorma would be funding his studies at the accademia petro was using him as a window into the world of the tradesmen and canalers again tonio whistled louder eyes bleary marco fumbled about dragging on clothes by the lack of light coming in through the shutter crack it was very early tonio whistled again louder still hed have the whole neighborhood awake in a minute benito thrust open the shutters hes coming he said crossly to the boatman below on the dark water tonio beckoned you too he said the two of them both moreorless dressed legged down the dark stairs who is sick demanded marco his herb bag in hand his eyes were still half focused it was still half dark tonio pointed to the gondola attached to his vessel by a rope couple of the night fishermen picked it up on the tidewash they brought it to us marco recognized the boat now marias a terrible sinking feeling hit his gut maria tonio shrugged maybe she fell overboard get real tonio snapped benito maria wouldnt even know how to fall off a boat any more than you do she was born on one tonio shrugged accidents happen he said grimly sometimes people help them to happen youd better go tell that fancyman sellsword of hers there was disapproval in the canalers voice benito took a deep breath yeah wed better caesare took it with a rigid face allowing not one trace of emotion to show shell be at the bottom of a canal with weights on her feet im afraid i should never have let her go out last night in that rain but she said they were relying on her she said shed overnight at murano if the rain got worse i didnt worry too much he shook his head regretfully leave me alone please i need some time sure caesare said benito quietly can i bring you a glass of wine caesare asked marco caesare smiled wanly no just leave me alone please benito and marco went downstairs again marco found the emptiness and helplessness hard to bear benito snuffled slightly it was a long quiet morning neither of them had it in themselves to go to work caesare had not come down but they felt they should be on hand perhaps the bells had just rung sext when marco decided hed had enough benito im going across to rafael ill tag along if thats all right marco understood the feeling he didnt really like the idea of benito being out and about and maybe in danger either youre sure shes dead asked rafael marco shrugged how can we be sure but what else they found her vessel not her rafael pursed his lips looked at them thoughtfully for a while i do know someone who might be able to tell you if shes alive or dead it is a little magical skill that he has do you have any of her clothing marco shook his head benito fished in his pockets scarf shes been wearing he asked pulling it out that should work come on hes over at the marciana library this morning luciano looked up from the book hed been peering at the ink was old and fading his eyes were tired and there coming toward him was a sight for sore eyes rafael de tomaso and marco and marcos brother well it was time he made formal contact he looked back among the stacks there was harrow the boy was still protected here in between the books he felt safe walking out to see rafael marco had felt naked as if they might be the next victims because he was utterly certain maria hadnt disappeared by accident still hed nearly fallen over his own jaw when rafael brought them facetoface with chiano chiano wearing a fine cloak and now calling himself dottore luciano marinabut still unmistakably chiano hello marco his jesolo guardian said with a smile it was rafaels turn to look dumbfounded you know each other for an answer marco embraced luciano better than you could dream rafael and sophia he asked seeing luciano brought it back to him hed been forgetting a debt he longed to see her especially right now shes still in the marshes boy wont leave says it its where she belongs now i went to see her a few days back misses you you were always better with her medicines and potions than i was sowhat brings you here i am delighted to see you of course but you came looking for me they explained luciano looked grim the town is awash with trouble give me that scarf he stretched both hands out palms up benito laid the scarf across them they waited luciano shuddered briefly took a deep breath she is alive he said slowly hush this is a library sorry were just relieved dont be said luciano grimly all i can tell further is that she is a prisoner and surrounded by water benito took a deep breath himself right well well get a search organized ill get back to caesare and have a word with all the runners marco you could maybe get hold of tonio get the canalers to look for anything rafael smiled your little brothers quite an organizer marco marco took lucianos hands thank you old friend well find her and even if she is in dangerwe have friends turning to rafael he smiled you dont want to try living with benito rafael he organizes himself out of all the bad chores but marias important to him shes important to me too but benito thinks the world of her though he wont admit it anyway i must go thank you both from the bottom of my heart maria knew every detail of her cell by now there wasnt much to learn three cubits by six rusty iron bargate and stone floor and walls on the floor moldy straw on the walls prayers and curses written in what could only be excrement this was just one of some ten cells on this level solitary confinement for troublemakers and specials according to her neighbor he claimed to be a wealthy cargomaster from sicily who had missed his ship and got himself into one bar brawl too many hed been mugged robbed of everything but his breechesand now these porco cane had taken even those there was no water no place or container to relieve herself in and a jailor who threatened to beat the pair of them if she spoke to her neighbor again it wasnt worth it god she was thirsty and eventually she had to use one of the corners of the cell no wonder this place stank how sure can you be of this marco asked caesare i mean as i said to benito these charlatans prey on the fact that its hard to accept that someone you love is dead hes no charlatan said marco quietly hes the man who kept me alive in the marshes i know you dont want to start hoping caesare but hes a real magician if he says shes alive then she is caesare stood up then wed better look for her ill get word out to some of my contacts id better see giaccomo she did a lot of work for him benito could be heard panting up the stairs he was hot tired and enthusiastic i got her cousin luigi and fredrico the arsenalotti will be looking for her too and i stopped by and woke up claudia and valentina once theyd gotten over it they started to look too well have everybody but the schiopettieri out looking for her marco smiled it was best to be able to do something well now that youre back you can go out again stick with caesare benito hes going to get to his contactsbut he might be the reason someone snatched maria im going to see if i can get tonio to take me around to some of my patients i can get the bargees and boatpeople looking too benito stood up from the chair hed flopped into well the other thing you could try is to stop by and see kat shes that spook i told you about she has some contacts in among the strega i think i was going to but ill be with caesare if you get a chance go to campo san felice between seven and half past she always wears a hooded cloak and shes got a shabby gondola anyway just ask if her name is kat and tell her youre my brother stick with tonio if you can brother im nervous about you being alone out there ill probably have my shadow anyway that you will said caesare grimly i dont want anyone on my back trail on this venture you go out first they went their various ways by the late afternoon it seemed as if half of venice was looking for maria maria was sitting in the one place that no one could go looking and she didnt know for sure that anyone was looking for her are you ready to talk yet sweetie asked her persecutor from the night before the light was better now and she could see him clearly she took in the details of his heavyset face and his dress he wore welltodo merchant clothes and unlike the slavewarders disinterest his eyes roamed her naked body with an unpleasant eagerness he turned to the warder take her out of there give her a smock and put her in the interview room well have some wine and some food maria behaved herself when the slavewarder let her out she was quiet and submissive putting on the slavesmock when she was told to she knew that this wasnt the time to try anything she hobbled her shackled way along to a room off the passage the room was bare except for two chairs and a small table sit there was a mug of wine and a plate of pasta on the table she sat he sat down across from her taste your wine the devil will let me have a sip and then take it away from me she thought she took the mug and drained it it was cheap raw strong red wine and there was a lot of it that was stupid but predictable said her interrogator with a horrible smugness that was a lot of wine on an empty stomach which is what i wanted you to have but i thought id have to persuade you now i want answers you might as well give them to me even if i have to take them out of you with pain im going to get them if i get them ill have them let you go the wine burned in her stomach it might have been his intent to get her drunk but it did lend her some courage and heaven knew she needed it right now somehow his calmness was more unnerving than shouted threats how about some more of that wine she said with an assumption of casualness without any warning he hit her hard a stinging openhanded slap that rocked her head back maria tasted blood put her hand to her cheek the speed and sheer violence of it left her huddling back in her seat with a little whimper of pain dont play games with me bitch he hissed youll lose chapter marco loitered around the edge of the campo san felice this was stupid how was he supposed to recognize this kat hed been here ten minutes now and had seen two old men manhandling a barge and a solitary gondola going past without stopping it wasnt much of a description to go on a shabby gondola and a woman wearing a hooded cloak this was a depressing waste of time kat was depressed it had been just over two weeks since shed run into that woman who said shed pass a message on to benito huh imagine thinking benito was her lover shed been at the campo san felice dead on time every night except last wednesday finally two days ago shed ventured into giaccomos he wasnt there and one of giaccomos flunkies had quietly asked her to leave it had been a quiet request but it was backed up with a potential threat clearly enough some people had grown suspicious of the cargoes carried by the spook and giaccomo didnt feel he needed the possible complications of having her on the premises shed tried barduccis also those two singers had simply given her the walleye when shed asked after benito shed left a message with them but she was willing to bet hed never get that message the only option that was left now was to go into ventuccios and ask to speak to marco felluci shed give it a few more days but she was certain that benito wasnt going to be there shed seen that canalerwoman last night her head bent against the rain but in that downpour kat couldnt really have asked if shed seen benito lately not really the right time for a chatnor the right area for it either you seldom found anyone hanging around casa dandelo not that you werent safe enough on the water but still she sculled towards the campo san felice she couldnt see anyone but then last time she hadnt seen benito either the sky held the last translucent skeins of vermilion cloud the sun was gone and that first whisper of the nightbreeze brought the sound of distant laughter with it the zephyr had picked up the scent of the sea from over the barrier lidi for a moment it carried marco away back to the time centuries ago when the first refugees from barbarian invaders had smelled that same breeze and had seen perhaps for the first time the swampy rialto islands not just as refuge but also as a place of beauty venice had been loved was loved as much as a place of bricks mortar and marble facing the city of the winged lion was a great ancient repository of hopes and dreams a place the barbarians had never managed to conquer a city of love and lovers then cutting through the rippled reflected last splendors of the day came a gondola moving silently along the canal between the gothicfronted buildings sliding across the water the dip and sway of the gondolier was as easy and graceful as a dancers movements marco looked across the water into the eyes of his kindred spirit the grace romance and beauty of the moment ended in a splash his dream girl her eyes locked on his hit a mooring pole dropped her oar lost her balance and fellfortunatelydown onto her own duckboards the gondola was close to shore and marco managed the jump without even thinking about it are you all right he asked anxiously fine said kat sitting up her face blazing er see if you can grab my oar he leaned over the side and pulled it inboard kat seized the moment to pull herself together what an absolute idiot he must think her what a complete fool and what a way to meet him shed have wanted to put on some better clothes maybe some belladonna to widen her eyes she must talk to francesca about it one minute ago shed been sculling easily putting minimal effort into it the next shed lost her concentration lost her balance lost her dignity lost her oar what should she say reality was with her now he might turn out to be a lot less likable than her imagination had painted him he pulled the oar onto the gondola then offered her a hand im sorry he said smiling maria says its really bad manners to board a boat without permission but i thought you might be hurt whoever maria is shes going to have to go now that he was up close kat found herself tonguetied for the first time in her life she settled for smiling at him god he was handsome no that was the wrong word he wasnt ruggedly handsome he was beautiful no wonder this maria was chasing him youve hurt your hand he exclaimed there was indeed a thin trickle of blood running down her hand and onto her cuff kat looked at it and looked away she really didnt like blood oh its nothing she said hastily here he held out a tentative hand let me see to it signorina im hoping to be a doctor one day its fine really he smiled i wont hurt you i promise god in heaven he could cut the hand right off if he wanted to well if he wanted her as a practice patient she could have lots of injuries lots if he wanted to lie her down on the duckboards her mind shied away from that line of thought she held out the hand he was gentle and surprisingly professional about it just a scratch i think if you would just come over there to the light i could clean it and bandage it quickly thank you she said wishing he hadnt let go of her hand and i think wed better tie up because were drifting two minutes later the hand was neatly and professionally bandaged the ragged scratch cleaned out there good as new within two days and how do i find the doctor if it needs further attention she did her best to make the question sound casual oh well i spend quite a lot of time over at zianettis near the accademia so all this time hanging around giaccomos and even venturing into barduccis had been vain endeavor well ill find you there if have to invent an injury whats your name marco ah felluci he bit his lip then well id like to ask you to have a glass of wine with me but ive got to wait for someone for benito then weve got to go back to looking for maria that explained it he worked with benito what could be more natural than the scamp would send his friend off to see what she wanted and what a friend to choose but if this maria was a girlfriend then shekat montescuewas going to do her best to make sure she stayed lost and this benito did he tell you who you were to wait for she asked managing to keep a straight face marco shook his head someone called kat hes been avoiding her because shes trouble but with maria gone missing it was kats turn to bite her lip trouble was she well there was some justification to that that description shed partly orchestrated it herself and well she did have dangerous associates the story benito brought back couldnt have enhanced a saints reputation shed bet then the humor of it all got through to her she has the most delicious laughter in the whole world thought marco i could listen to it forever even though i dont see what is so funny finally she stopped laughing sorry im kat and she started laughing again marco found himself drowning both in her laughter and his own embarrassment and yet as bad as that embarrassment was it was all right hed finally got to meet her hed kill benito either benito had known and had been keeping his brother from another entanglementfor which he couldnt really be blamed after the last time no benito must not have worked out that marcos dream girl and benitos trouble were one and the same but at least hed found her now if he could keep from putting his foot in his mouth while he talked to her maybe he could even find out where she lived she was everything angelina was not while hed worshipped the ground angelina walked on and dreamed one day of kissing her hand this girl made him want to fold her in his arms and well better stop these thoughts dead right there im sorry im sure they didnt mean it he said humbly kat smiled broadly im sure they did she said and they were right too but i promise not to you marco had put two and two together um the girl you sent the message to benito with you havent seen her have you were looking for her ah so that was maria yes said kat thinking back to the driving rain of last night after her experience in the church shed given up taking shelter but not today she went missing yesterday said marco caesare is worried sick who is this caesare asked kat carefully he smiled again and it did odd things to her insides oh sorry caesare aldanto her her boyfriend relief was like the sun coming out shes not your girlfriend then he looked surprised maria shes crazy about caesare she wouldnt even look twice at me he looked slightly sheepish um i im not involved with anyone right now well im not either there what an opening although i have had several suitors that seemed important to say too im not surprised he said warmly but about maria when did you last see her we weve had word shes a prisoner somewhere kat cocked her head put a finger to her jaw it was long after vespers but before midnight maybe a hundred yards from the casa dandelo i wanted to ask her about benito but it was raining too hard id better go and tell caesare why did you want to see benito i can give him a message oh i um just wanted him to get hold of a friend of his for me said kat airily its all right now how about i take you to where i saw her you havent got other work to do asked marco i want to talk to you but if youve got work her heart warmed he was an ordinary working man after all and a considerate one she wished the montescue could somehow sponsor him to do what he should be doing medical studies already he was worth six of any case vecchie sciondoctors shed ever met but unless her father came home laden with half the jewels of the indies there was no way casa montescue limped on from day to day as it was extra expenses just couldnt be borne only yesterday her grandfather had said to her that he didnt know how theyd have managed without her no nothing this evening id be happy to help they rowed along and kat found that conversation was as easy as breathing it was obviously his interest so she led him to talk about medicine the more he talked the more kat decided that her first look had led her unerringly he wasntunlike most of the elderly roues at the occasional functions the casa montescue still attendedat all inclined towards overtheline flattery and flirtation instead he talked with passion about medicine about what could be done by the wayhow do you know that this maria is definitely alive she asked as they neared the casa dandelo marco pursed his lips well you wouldnt know him but we went to see luciano mariana but i do know him he was my tutor buthe went away years ago i was afraid he was dead marco pauses um well they say hes just got back from jerusalem i know him well too fromfrom earlier i owe him my life in part anyway hesahgood at divining and he says shes alive a prisoner and surrounded by water weve got half the town looking for her kat pointed to the mess of heavily barred old buildings isolated on their own islet across the rio della crea casa dandelo thats where shell be nobody knows what happens there marco pulled a wry face you dont have any contacts she shook her head emphatically id sooner sell black lotos she said with distaste yes its a disgrace to the republic said marco grimly she got the feeling that if he were the doge for a day the casa dandelo would be among the first festering sores to go come on lets go find benito and this caesare they actually found an irritatedlooking caesare and a stilleager benito within two hundred yards ciao kat i see marcos got you working too said benito cheerfully listen old beppi saw her at the corner of the canale di cannaregio she was definitely heading for this part of town caesare shook his head after which she could have been taken anywhere marco smiled except that kat saw her too right near the casa dandelo thats where we reckon she must be caesare nodded i suppose its possible we cant get in there well ill get the capuletti one of them is capi di contrada for the dandelo shipments relax they wont be able to take her out shes a citizen of the republic now i think we ought to go back maybe stop at giaccomos in case there is a message or a ransom demand lets just go on down to the casa dandelo please pleaded benito see if any of marcos patients are about or you could go backill go on case the joint so little benito did care about someone hed talked about a brother once but obviously this maria was important to him it was odd to realize that shed met this caesare aldanto too hed been at a rather raffish ridotto shed found reason to leave early his partner with whom hed been flirting outrageously was definitely case vecchie a masked blond not his mariawho to judge by their one meetingwas canaler through and through ill give you a lift down quicker than walking and safer too benito laughed not many would want to mix it with caesare kat there was admiration in that voice he needs to be more selective about his role models thought kat but what would a wharfandcanal brat know of such things well enough to choose one good loyal friend at least it seemed marco was all agreement about going back down to the rio della crea outside the casa dandelo however caesare put his foot down firmly you leave the dandelos alone come well go back to the house get some food you two will stay there im going to see the capuletti ill take you offered kat at least that way shed be able to find out where he lived but she still worried about their loyalty to this caesare obviously what he said went your loyalty is misplaced said marias questioner how do you think we knew exactly where to find you he wanted to be rid of you so he made a deal with us hes the pig who betrayed you what do you owe someone like that marias head was spinning a little shed had a lot of strong unwatered wine on an empty stomach the blows hadnt helped either cant tell you what i dont know she said sullenly caesare kept his business private he was lying they werent going to let her go no matter what she told them her questioner sat back its going to be a long night but you are going to tell me everything you do know he leaned forward his hands shot out and he grabbed her by the throat the strength in those hands was terrifying and shed learned by now that resistance only made him worse understa someone started screaming a terrible awful scream even by slavetrader standards at least her tormenter let go of her by the sounds of it pandemonium was breaking loose yelling and panic around the screams the slaver who had brought her in here said ask questions later signor she goes back to the cell theres trouble out there he pulled her to her feet and thrust her stumbling in her hobbling legirons out of the door it was here that the wine came to her rescue she tripped and fell against the wall into a little alcove intended by some long ago builder for a saints shrine maybe the place was still blessed the stampede of panicked prisoners and warders thus missed her but her warder and her questioner were swept off with the mob the screaming had turned to a terrible laughter looking over her shoulder she could see her interrogator glaring back at her he was shouting something but the words couldnt be made out over the general din a moment later the stampeding crowd had taken him out of sight hurriedly maria got to her feet and went the other away moving toward the horrible sound halflaughter halfscreaming the sound made her scalp crawl but that was the only direction in which she might escape fortunately before too long she found an unlocked door and pushed her way in she was apparently inside casa dandelos warehouse area she made sure the door was shut behind her and then plunged into the cluttered cavernous interior maria wasnt moving very fast legirons didnt help neither did being a little drunk and completely lost in a strange building she wanted down but the only staircase she found went up not having any choice she climbed the stairs struggling with the legirons the staircase led to a heavy ironreinforced doorwhich obviously was normally bolted and locked from the outside but now it was ajar maria stepped through and out of one world and into another this place was soft with carpets and rich hangings this was the living quarters of the slavers for a moment she hesitated then hearing voices behind her she stepped into the first room and held the door handle up it was dark in here she heard the bolts being shot sheand the other slaveswere being safely locked in only she was already on this side of the door it had been panic and drunken luck that had gotten her this far but one thing she was determined onshe wasnt going back shed kill anyone who tried to take her she felt about the darkened room for a weapon she decided the shutterbar would do as well as anything else she shuffledso as not to clank her legironsover to the crack of light and lifted the bar the shutters swung open moonlight touched the canal below to young benito the climb down would have been a joke to her with legirons and a bit dizzy with wine hunger and fear it seemed impossible she heard voices and her determination returned she could just jump taking the shutterbar with her whatever else at least shed be outside and with a weapon taking a deep breath she struggled up onto the sill and jumped moments later she realized she should have thought about swimming in legirons first it took all her strength to haul herself out of the canal on the far side and onto the walkway then spotting a nearby alley she crawled toward it too exhausted to walk she could only hope that all their attention was distracted by the riot going on in the building she could only bless whatever had caused the commotion in the first place maria crawled on into the alley and then down it keeping to the shadows if somebody found her now in this part of town shed be dead meat orworsereturned to the casa dandelo at length the alley ended next to a canal she was so tired and turned around this could be canale di cannaregio oh god she was such a long long way from home if only she could spot a boatman she could trust but the barge moving slowly along the water was not familiar then a gondola came into view a bit scruffy it was that kat a moment of indecision mostly due to sheer exhaustion and maria called out by the startled look on her face kat was not used to being greeted or summoned but she peered and as soon as she saw who it was she came in pulled up and hauled the manacled maria into her boat maria was so exhausted she simply tumbled onto the duck boards kat pushed off hastily marco benito and your caesare have been looking for you lets get away from here before someone else finds you maria groaned ow yes the farther from the dandelos the better kat looked down at her i told them thats where youd be youre in a bad way do you know if the dandelos are looking for you maria shook her head dunno probably but they may not have figured out that i got out of the building already kat exhaled i think id better take you to my home we are close get you off the water and out of that slavesmock but you must promise me you wont tell anyone where i live promise said maria tiredly swear to god just keep me away from those dandelo bastardos kat took a deep breath youll be safe enough i swear just pull that canvas over yourself and she bent to the oar i think well try for speed rather than being unobtrusive right now they could take me for you and then wed both be for it she concentrated on her sculling then panting a little glanced over her shoulder there are a few boats in the distance theyre too far off to see us in the moonlight but when we get to the casa you must move as fast as you can please maria tensed her tired body wont they just follow us kat snorted not huh likely they bumped against a tiny landing kat leaped forward and dropped a painter over a pole she turned and helped maria up and they staggered up the stairs kat rapped a hasty pattern on the waterdoor maria heard the bolts slide she and kat halffell and were halfdragged within by a whitehaired old man with family retainer written all over his wrinkles the bolts sliding home were a wonderfully secure sound but as maria slumped against the wall and felt the suspicious angry gaze of the old man wash over her she wondered whether this was security or worse trouble the old man had a wheellock pistol in his belt and looked ready to use it and now signorina katerina whats this he pointed at maria as if she were a longdead alleycat milord wont be pleased trouble his tone would have rimed boiling minestrone with ice kat wasnt pleased either oh giuseppe stop behaving like an old woman as if i didnt learn half my troublemaking from you in the first place see if you can find something to cut this chain with and if you see madelena ask her for some food some wine and some hot water well be in my room please the old man shook his head doubtfully as kat helped maria to her feet ai signorina you are like your father all over again still the master wont be pleased then we wont tell him responded kat quietly but firmly he has enough worries already now get madelena for me giuseppe do please he nodded and turned away his rolling gait as he leftstill mutteringsaid that this family retainer was an old seaman kat led maria down a succession of corridors up a staircase down another corridor and into a bedroom by the time they got there the legirons felt like lead weights chapter maria realized that the bedroom shed swayed into was the finest shed ever seen or must once have been very fine but there were subtle signs of decay everywhere the gilttrimmed mirrors were old and fogged the silken hangings on the carved bedstead were slightly tattered the beautiful cassone had a little chip in it sit here on the bed kat thrust her gently onto it maria sat obedient bewildered but at least no longer terrified benito certainly picked his girlfriends kat went to the dressing table took a branch of candles and lit them at the wall sconce she rummaged in the closet and came out with a gown of some sort before returning to the bed my god your poor knees i crawled from the casa dandelo to where you found me it was better than staying there said maria quietly kat took a deep breath well youre safe now lord i wish marco was here hes so good at doctoring lets get you out of that smock anyway marco marias tired mind took a moment to work this one out as she managed to stand and hold her arms up to allow kat take off the coarse slavesmock marco marco by the worshipful tone benito had lost his case vecchie girlfriend well it was keeping her alive and marco was a good soul too good for comfort at times but he would at least be nice to her even if he was still daydreaming about his girl in a boat the dress kat dropped over her was soft twilled silk from the doorway came a horrified squeak katerina you cant dress some slavegirl in your best taffeta the little brightbeadyeyed old woman with the tray of food and wine looked utterly horrified kat clicked her tongue madelena just leave me to my business and shes not a slave to maria its not a new dress but weve got to get you back to to caesare and they wont be looking for someone dressed in clothes like these put the tray down madelena and get me some hot water do please madelena set the tray down pinching her lips with disapproval then she took a deep breath and with the attitude of a stern taskmistress shook a bony finger at kat you cant do this milady katerina im going to go and talk to the master no matter what old giuseppe says kat hugged the old lady please madelena hes asleep by now and this is the honor of the casa at stake here papa would have told me to do this the old lady sighed i wish he would come home but she turned and went out kat shook her head as she lifted the hem of the newly loaned dress above marias raw and bleeding knees sorry my old nurse and my fathers too she wont accept that hes never going to get back or that im not five years old any more if i set this tray here on the bed do you think you could eat a little and maybe drink a glass of wine youre as pale as a sheet ill try to clean up these knees im not much of a doctor im afraid and it is not much in the way of food either maria looked at the tray bread the crumb finer and whiter than any shed ever eaten slices of prosecco salume taleggio cheese some early melon something wrapped in pastry olives a tiny sweet cake bursting with raisins and almond slivers dusted with sugar huh kats ideas of not much case vecchie ideas maria sighed this was caesares background this was the world he belonged in it was a world that left her feeling like a fish on a mountaintop why are you doing this she asked quietly kat shrugged honor i promised id help to find you both the old man and old woman bustled in arguing hush snapped kat youll wake the house and i do not want alessandra here that shut them both up madelena had brought a crock of warm water cloths soap giuseppe had in hand a small finetoothed saw and a huge pair of pliers he set to work on the chain youll need a blacksmith to break the locks or cut through the shackles but if we cut the chain you can walk properly he said or run if you have to you a local girl missy maria nodded born and bred by his walk he was a seaman all caulkers did a stint with the republics galleys and as often as not other vessels my family are caulkers she was right in her guess that brought a look of frosty approval to the old mans face so what are you doing in slave clothes and slave chains maria shrugged the dandelos dont care much where they get their slaves giuseppe nodded his face growing heavy with anger this time you were right signorina we must talk to milord about this he can take it up with the signori di notte or even the doge this ought to be stopped kat sighed do some more sawing giuseppe i can just hear grandpapa saying well your grace my granddaughter was just out for a little midnight row on her own when she found this runaway slave who happened to be a citizen of the republic now thats not allowed your grace yes my seventeenyearold granddaughter is often out alone at midnight for starters the dandelos and their allies would laugh us out of the council how could we prove maria was a captive of theirs for seconds we dont need any attention we have too much business of our own we dont need examined too closely it still ought to be stopped grumbled giuseppe going on sawing madelena said nothing she just snorted but maria noticed that she was more gentle about the cleaning maria sipped at the wine and tried to work out just how kat was planning to get her home the wine too was fine a vintage red unless she was completely turned around this was one of the old great houses that looked onto the lagoon towards the mainland that was a long way from home if the dandelos were out looking for her and they would be for a certainty they wouldnt want a citizen well known to canalers and arsenalotti to escape their clutches and tell her story that could cause them a lot of trouble getting maria home if the dandelos were combing the canals could be tricky thought kat but from the moment she dropped the dress over marias head kat realized that this was potentially a very beautiful woman true her jaw was very square and firm but it simply enhanced the strength of those dark features the dress suited maria far better than it had her out of her baggy canalers clothing which was all that kat had ever seen maria wearing it was obvious that the canaler girls figure was female decidedly so in fact giuseppe had cut his way through the chains for the second time and left to return the tools maria now had two heavy iron anklets but if need be she could run and she could walk normally madelena we need to dress her hair up do you think you could steal one of those spanish combs from alessandras dressing room the old woman smiled evilly madelena loathed alessandra the feeling was mutual alessandra detested a servant she could not dismiss at least once a week alessandra accused madelena of anything from theft to poisoning perhaps oncelong agothe war between them had sparked out of jealousy of a new wife for an old nurse but especially after the death of alessandras baby it had degenerated into simple warfare ill bring some of her makeup too katerina she got up and went out kat surveyed maria weighing up the possibilities shoes will be a problem but the rest will be easy she grinned at maria let me do that lacing on your bodice no case vecchie is going to be at a party unlaced or at least theyd get someone to lace them again afterwards if you keep your feet tucked under you and dont talk we can do a remarkably fine pair of ladies going home for the night after a party maria took an embarrassed look at her feet theyre too big she said wretchedly she began to cry kat hugged her its all right its all right maria gave a determined sniff i dont cry im a canaler i dont cry i get even she said gruffly then she sobbed but ive got very big feet canaler feet and hes so fine no one could possibly have recognized maria garavelli the canaler and spook the nightcargo runner in the two finely arrayed and madeup venetian case vecchie ladies who made their way through the maze of passages to the front of the house giuseppe bowed the gondola will be here in a few moments signorinas maria felt odd she could hardly recognize the elegant woman in the mirror in the hall her hair was dressed up onto an ornate comb her face heavily made up her cheeks and lips red her eyes widened with belladona in one hand was a fan of lacquered sticks and silk in the other a little reticule in which rested the comforting solid bulk of a pistol it was a small and very finely made wheellock the kind of weapon which only extremely wealthy people could afford kat had one identical to it in her own somewhat larger purse maria hoped that kat knew how to use hers she had only the sketchiest notion herself if you see anyone said kat flirt with the fanlike thisover your mouth and nose it makes it very hard to recognize you maria tried it looking at the stranger with the fan in the mirror youre a natural said kat with a grin maria was quite relieved to see that expression it was the only familiar thing about her rescuer that widemouthed grin kat didnt smile that often but it transformed her face when she did maria saw the smile change to a frown and where are you going demanded the cause of the frown the willowyfigured woman who had come into the hall looked every inch a wealthy case vecchie maria guessed her at mid to late twenties her complexion was as flawless as a master of the paintbrush and rouge pot could make it except that she had a little mole on her cheek just above the rosebud mouth it seemed to accentuate the perfection her hair too was a lustrous black dressed into a perfect frame for her face she looked as sour as vinegar despite her beauty out alessandra kats face had closed down there was now no expression on it at all family business alessandra looked as if shed just swallowed a cup of gall what nonsense she snapped this trollop is no family of ours and why is she wearing your best gown my mothers family and maria spilt wine on her gown its in that bag kat pointed to the bag at their feet it actually contained a hooded cloak alessandra sniffed oh i didnt know we had anything to do with them her expression said she didnt want to know either she let them leave and get into the waiting gondolawhich was not shabbywithout a word only when they were well away down the canal did kat give way to helpless laughter oh she is such a snob if shed noticed the comb in your hair wed have been for it or my feet said maria tucking them under the folds of the dress who is she my dear sisterinlaw answered kat and my mothers family were just merchants not even curti she pretends they dont exist maria sat back tiredly against the squabs who are you kat kat shook her head best if i dont say not that i dont trust you but well what you dont know cant slip out even by accident and remember you promised maria nodded it felt odd with all her hair piled up even wild horses wouldnt drag it out of me but i owe you kat shrugged i promised id help they waited next to albertos barge hes trustworthy kat asked for the third time hes fine maria soothed hes tonios brother and a sort of cousin of mine here out of her place kat was as uneasy as maria has been in kats home they could be watching the building as they know who caesare is im sorry i lost the waterdoor key when they took my clothes because we could row up safely enough but two ladies walking down our calle at this time of night would be in dangereven if the dandelos arent watching sobest if alberto fetches them can your gondolier be trusted to get you back kat nodded they do work for the family and old giuseppe knows who took us pietro would be insane to come back without me besides i have my little friend in here she patted the reticule i can shoot quite well there was the sound of running footsteps they both hastily reached for their reticules maria was still struggling with the fussy little catch when she heard benitos voice maria maria he bounced over the barge and looked down at the two of them and their patient gondolier benito was obviously a little startled to find himself staring into the muzzle of kats handcannon but he didnt let it stop him maria he asked incredulously who else benito said maria tiredly wheres caesare benito swung down onto the deck he grabbed maria and did a fierce little jig then he hugged her benito never even touched her normally not that she had encouraged it but hes seeing the capuletti in case the dandelos had you marco is off with rafael over around accademia looking for you they were going to some marina guy the one who told us you were alive but a prisoner to see if he could tell them anything else they left me alone here to hold the fort i reckon they both knew that way i wouldnt go back to the casa dandelo that kat said to marco they must have you and here you turn up looking like the queen of sheba where have you been weve been worried sick for an answer maria lifted her dress to reveal her bare feet and the iron anklets that kat was right casa dandelo i escaped and kat saved my bacon i owe her so you treat her with respect see oh shes not so bad said benito with a grin got a snappy tongue when shes cross though she brought us back here but rafael was waiting so marco went off with him and she left so whos the friend with the cannon maria realized that kat was hiding behind her fan just a friend little sneaker leave her alone katerinaill get these clothes back to you and thank you thank you a million times you ever need to find me you leave a message with giaccomo ill tell him i owe you go carefully huh kat nodded without taking the fan from her face andwith her other hand still holding the pistolpointed to the bag on the duckboards good idea said maria you take care now see she took out the hooded cloak and pulled it over her borrowed finery the gondolier had pulled the boat next to the walkway and the two of them alighted the gondola pulled away maria waved kat having returned the pistol to the reticule waved back mighty silent friend that said benito curiously maria yawned be a good thing if you buttoned your lip sometimes benito lets get home i cant wait to bathe myself she could hardly believe that he hadnt recognized kat but then looking in a mirror shed hardly recognized herself in these clothes she reminded me of someone said benito but i cant think who i dont know any posh women like that but i hardly even recognized you in those clothes he hesitated then speaking much less brashly than usual almost shyly youre real pretty when you dress up nice maria garavelli real pretty maria swatted his ear gently though she was quite sorry caesare hadnt seen her in kats best gown she was tempted to hang on to it for long enough to model it for him but on reflection that wasnt a good idea for kats safety it would be best if she revealed as little about her part in this as possible chapter when father mascoli saw the three figures entering his little chapel in the cannaregio he sighed come into the back he said i dont want to discuss the matter out here he led them through the door behind the statue of saint raphaella and into his private quarters then seeing them pause he waved his hand further in the back he muttered we need someplace that im certain is safe he opened the waterdoor at the rear of his cell and led them into the small waterchapel beyond there was just enough room for four men to stand there the three other priests examined the chapel with interest their interest was aroused further when the heads of two undines broke the water and gazed at them the undines eyes seemed waryor perhaps simply watchful both of them were female its all right said mascoli these are friends there was just a slight hesitation before the last word the undines studied the three strange priests their eyes spending most of their time examining the shortest one i hope so hissed one of them pointing at the short priest that one could be dangerous very powerful the priest in question pulled a wry face the solid eyebrow line twisted into an sshape first time ive ever been called that even before my leg got mangled shes not speaking of your physical strength father lopez replied mascoli almost snapping as you well know he likes to practice modesty said one of the other priests his savoyard accent very pronounced good thing too hed be insufferable otherwise im pierre by the way the other one is diego despite the tension of the moment mascoli chuckled well said all right then i assume youve come because you heard the news about dottore marina reappearing in veniceout of nowhere it seemsafter all these years lopez nodded we need to speak with him but it would be dangerousvery dangerousto do so openly we thought i can place you in touch with him agreed mascoli but for the moment at least i think you should have no direct contact at all i doubt if marina would agree in any event he is very frightened by the state of things in venice mascoli nodded toward the undines the dottore has a special relationship with them they can serve as the messengers difficult hissed one of the undines the tone of her voice was distinctly unhappy the stupid dottore has gone too far from the water not safe hissed the other diego eyed them curiously from the rumors which have been swirling through the city for months the water is the most dangerous place to be because of the socalled canal monster the undines gaped sharktoothed grins dangerous for most dangerous for us even not dangerous for the dottore one of the undines sank below the surface for a moment then came up gushing water out of her mouth in an undine version of laughter the dottore eat that one easily that makes sense murmured eneko a grimas would be vulnerable to steelclad enemies another great sorcerer the most powerful of demons and not much else mascoli cocked his head in a quizzical gesture as close as he was to the undines he had no doubt at all that the rumors of a canal monster were quite accurate and what makes you think this thing is not a most powerful demon doesnt make sense replied lopez the thingwhatever it isis a servant of chernobog im quite sure of it now chernobog would have lamed it in some manner broken it to his service mascoli ran his hand across his bald pate grimacing ruefully you move in a strange world father lopez that thing is quite too powerful for my taste thank you lopez shrugged i did not say it wasnt dangerous i am simply pointing out that it is in the end nothing more than a tool in the hands of another it is that other that i am truly concerned about he looked down at the undines moving slowly in the waters of the chapel very well would you take this message to dottore marina tell him to concentrate all his efforts on finding the lion we will see to the rest the undines mouth gaped wide and who is we demanded one hes a special envoy from the grand metropolitan of rome explained diego the undines mouth gaped wide again that means precious little to her murmured mascoli the bald priest squatted by the edge of the water just tell him that they are friends of mine and i trust them a moment later in a little swirl one of the undines was gone the other remained swimming slowly through the waterchapel father mascoli stood up i hope sister evangelina is not mistaken he gave eneko a hard look the basque priest smiled and spread his hands i could give you assurances of my own father mascoli but would they really mean very much in the end you must make your own decision i already have doesnt mean i have to like it im just a simple priest father lopez mascoli pointed a finger at the stillswirling surface of the waterchapel these waters here are quite deep enough for me i tend to my flockin whatever form they appear im hypatian he gave the basque another hard look as if saying as you are supposed to be i dont make judgments let god judge thats his business not mine god has given me the gift to make it so that evil cant freely enter here so anything that enters freely deserves my help pierre had opened his mouth when mascoli proclaimed his unwillingness to make judgments as if to protest but closed it after that last sentence looking far more satisfied mascoli led the way out of the waterchapel once in his cell with the waterdoor closed he paused at the entrance to the main chapel there are still other waters too deep for me he added facing lopez the marco boy you asked about valdosta mascoli winced that secret is getting too frayed i fear what secret demanded pierre delleste sent word to casa dorma from there it is spreading like fire not quite that demurred diego but it is spreading i fear petro dorma has spies in his household mascoli looked even more unhappy than ever the boy ishas the potential i should sayto be a powerful user of magic in his own right father lopez especially healing magic i will not be able to train him properly much longer i am reaching the limits of my own talent and knowledge eneko nodded consider the bargain made father mascoli but he hesitated the basque priest seemed to be experiencing one of his few moment of uncertainty in truth i am not well versed in the healing arts myself after another pause grudgingly nor i confess is that a branch of magic in which my own talents are particularly ah pierre snorted diego laughed ask a viking berserk to be a nursemaid mascoliyoud do better lopez glared at him his companion responded with an insouciant smile its the truth eneko you know it as well as i do to mascoli i will be glad to assist you with the boys training and if all goes well in a few months others of our brotherhood should be arriving in venice at least two of themfrancis in particularare superb with healing magic thank you said mascoli softly i have become very fond of marco he studied eneko for a moment does thisah viking berserkmagic of yours extend to protective spells or is it simply a specialty in smiting the ungodly lopezs glare at diego was in full flower now see what youve done he demanded my reputation was bad enough already diego simply smiled after a moment sighing the basque looked at mascoli what do you desire father mascoli groped for words i would likesomethingdont know whatto protect the brothers somehow a shield of some sort i suppose marco is swimming in those same deep waters whether he knows it or not and benito he rolled his eyes he couldnt help it benito dives into every bottomless pool he can find and dives to the bottom of everything else as well pierre grinned at this assessment of the younger brother but sobered as eneko shook his head at this point that would be more dangerous than anything i dont think the enemynot chernobog at leasthas any sense yet of the potential danger to him which rests in those two boys a shield of the sort youre suggesting would just draw his attention attention which for the moment i would much prefer centered on dottore marina he glanced at the crucifix on the wall but i think something else might be of use the boys already have a guardian two of them in fact if my suspicion is correct i can place a finding spell of sorts on themnot a geas something much more delicatewhich would it was his turn to grope for words enable the guardians to find them very easily and know where to bring them in case of trouble think of it as lubricating an axle if you will and perhaps giving the cart a push over the rough spots diego winced at the crude analogy pierre on the other hand beamed from ear to ear well make you a good savoyard yet they heard the sound of the church door opening wait here said father mascoli ill let you know when you can leave without being observed but he was back within a short time behind him came a woman whose face could not be seen because of the cowl over her head but that she was a woman there could be little doubt even under the heavy and utilitarian clothing and now this muttered mascoli what have you gotten me into to lopez the woman swept back the cowl francescas smiling face appeared even without her usual elaborate coiffure and cosmetics the womans beauty seemed quite out of place in father mascolis austere living quarters nice to see you again eneko she said youve heard the news about dottore marina i imagine lopez nodded i assume you have more tidbits to share he added with a wry smile does a chicken have feathers snorted francesca she glanced around the small room is there anywhere a bit more commodious i have quite a few tidbits in fact sighing mascoli opened the waterdoor and led the way back into the waterchapel theres no place to sit im afraid no matter responded francesca cheerily well squat i have very strong legs once in the waterchapel she spotted the undine immediately oh thank heaven another female the priests faces grew stiff you have nothing to fear pierre began to growl nonsense snapped francesca and why would i be afraid of a mortal sin in a hypatian chapel anyway the peril lies elsewhere men dont know how to gossip properly the undines mouth gaped wide truth she swam to the side did you hear chapter it was dark and it was dangerous and benito was so happy he could hardly stand himself if it hadnt been too risky to chance any sound hed have been singing or humming anyway he was upsidedown hanging by his knees from one of the dozens of timbers supporting casa dandelos leaky halfrotten roofthe kind of position hed held so many times in the past that he was almost as comfortable upsidedown as he was on his feet hidden by the darkness three stories beneath him the canalwater lapped quietly against the foundations of casa dandelo but there was not much else in the way of sound there wasnt even so much as a breeze to make the timbers of the building sway and creak which made it all the more imperative that he keep silent he was sawing most of the way through the bolts that held the metal grilles and bars protecting the slavequarters upperstory windows most of the way not all just enough so that someone who was determined on a breakout had only to give a good hard pull to break the grilles freebut from inside or outside to everything but a close inspection all was secure to really hurt the slavers you had to hit them where it counted mostthe pocket that meant slave breakouts for which benito was now cheerfully preparing the way he grinned to himself working the cable saw carefully slowly back and forth on the bolt currently under his fingers valentina had threatened his life if he lost that very expensive sawbut had been quite willing to lend benito the tiny thiefs tool when she heard whose place it was going to be used on little more than a bit of wire with two handles it would cut through damn near any metal and was making short work of casa dandelos soft iron bolts it was as black as the inside of a cat tonight no moon nary a star showing through the clouds of a warm overcast spring night no matter benito hadnt ever needed to see to know what he was about valentina and claudia had taught him to work blind it was best working blind in some ways the darkest nights were a thiefs best friends one case the place till you know it like the inside of your mouth two take it slow three go by feel and know by feel those were claudias rules for nightwork she might have added the one benito was abiding by tonight four have you a lookout and lord and saintswhat a lookout down there somewhere on the canal below him hidden in the darkest shadows and straining eyes and ears against the thick blackness was no less a personage than maria garavelliand a more unlikely banditry pairing than himself and maria was hard to imagine the greater wonder was that maria had come to him to ask for his help runners had lunch after the rest of venice not the least because runners were often sent to fetch lunches and drink for their employers it made for a long morning and a rumbling stomach but benito had gotten used to it besides it meant that the rest of the afternoon until knockoff time was that much shorter and you could pick up some nice stuff at halfprice from vendors anxious to unload what was left now that the noontime crowd was fed so this afternoon benito had been pleasing his palate with several slabs of castagnaccio that were only slightly old he was pleasing his hide with warm spring sunshine and his mind was at ease with the fact that his behind was firmly planted on the upper steps of the casa ventuccio he had a good view of the canal from there and no one hassled a kid in ventucciolivery thereso long as he kept his butt near enough to the edge of the steps that he didnt impede traffic he had been dangling his feet over the edge and had both arms draped over the lower bar of the guard rail watching the traffic pass in the halflight below him he was rather pleased that he knew a good many of those passing by nameeven if those good folk would hardly appreciate the honor he watched feeling his back and shoulders ache in sympathy as gianni and tomaso labored against the current poling what looked to be a nice little cargo of barrels of some kind up the canal he noted one of the younger baldasini boys go by riding in one of the family boats and old man mario in a hireboat going in the opposite direction and he saw a double handful of canalers he recognized besides gianni and rather wished he had his brothers incredible memory there might be valuable information there if he only could remember who he saw going where the one real pity about having his lunch break late was that he and marco couldnt sit together he hadnt had a decent talk with marco since marias return from captivity marco had gotten back from looking for luciano marina even later than caesare had returned from his visit to casa capuletti marco at least had been sober benito sighed marco was walking around with that moonstruck look on his face again doubtless yet another girl benito couldnt understand it girls were interesting but not this walkintowallsanddieforyou stuff and what did he mean by that one persons trouble is another persons delight benito sighed again more trouble for benito and the rest of them no doubt but right now the sun was warm and the chestnutflour castagnaccio was superb he was halfway through his lunch when he saw maria tie up down below so far as he knew she had no business with casa ventuccio today so he wasnt much surprised when she strolled up the steps and planted herself beside him feet dangling like his over the edge the rest of her hugging the bottom railing bite he said offering her a piece of castagnaccio to be sociable it didnt pay to be less than polite to maria at any timebut most especially benito walked softly these days what with her being shortfused and in a muddle over caesare aldanto and them being short of cash and benitos brother more than half the cause of bothand now this dandelo thing no she said shortly i ate he shrugged shed say her say when she was ready he wasnt about to push her he kept watch on her out the corner of his eye all the same after living these months with caesare aldanto benito knew maria garavelli about as well as he knew anybodyand the storm warnings were definitely out the sleeves of her dark blue dress were pushed up over her elbows which only happened when she was nervy her battered hat was pulled down low on her forehead like she was trying to keep her eyes from being read but benito was close enough for a good view and he could see that her square jaw was tensed her dark eyes gone darker with brooding her broad shoulders hunched her fists clenching and unclenchingstormwarnings for sure well she and caesare had celebrated her return from captivity in the casa dandelo two days ago with an almighty fight things definitely hadnt been right between the two of them lately he should talk it through with marco but hed barely seen marco since the night maria had gotten back youve got the sneak thiefs ways benito valdosta she said at last softly so softly her voice hardly carried to benito benito tensed up himself in all of venice only alberto ventuccio maria garavelli and caesare aldanto knew his real name his and marcos only they knew that marco felluci and benito oro were real brothers were marco and benito of the case vecchie the last of the longi family valdosta only those three knew that the boys had fled from assassins who had killed their mother and were still very probably under death sentence from duke visconti for the things their dead mother lorendana might have told them and the names and faces they knew even the ventuccio cousins didnt know for maria garavelli to be using his real namethis was serious i aint no sneak thief he said shortly less caesare wants a job done it dont pay cept to buy a piece of rope at nubbing cheat unless youre real good he thought of valentina of claudia their skills and bravado with raw envy im good i aint that good what if i wanted you to turn sneak thief for a bit for me came the unexpected question huh for you he responded turning to stare at her his jaw slack with surprise she moved her head slowly to meet his astonished gaze casa dandelo she said tersely he nodded understanding her then somebodymontagnards likelyhad kidnapped the redoubtable maria garavelli had kidnapped her and truly truly frightened her something benito had never thought possible she said that nothing else had happened benito believed her but most of the canalers didnt they assumed maria had been molested maybe raped and was lying about it out of shame that assumption was fueling the seething anger which was steadily building among the canalers and the arsenalotti most of venices working poor had no love for the dandelos at the best of times now that the dandelos had crossed the line by messing with a wellknown citizen of the republic a poor one true but a canaler not a vagrant there was going to be an explosion soon benito thought and a lot bigger one than the initial rash of attacks on dandelo retainers who had been unlucky enough to be caught in the open when the news of marias escapeand the identity of her captorshad raced through the city four dandelo hangerson one of them a distant relation of the family had been stabbed or beaten to death in two separate incidents within hours after that all the dandelos and their retainers had hastily retreated to their fortresslike building to wait out the storm the canalers and arsenalotti were now waiting to see what measures if any the authorities would take against the dandelos for their flagrant transgression of the unspoken rules so far however all the signs were that the signori di notte intended to remain carefully blind to what the dandelos had been up to in which case all hell was going to break loose soon enough maria herself it seemed had already waited long enough she intended to start her own vendettanowand shed come to benito first he felt a strange great thrill at that fact si benito replied he owed them too maria gave him hell sometimes but he was fond of her kind of like a sister except sometimes she made him think unsisterly things ever since hed seen her in those case vecchie clothes hed realized she was beautiful not that she was interested in anyone but caesare of course si maria you got me you say how and when the hunched shoulders relaxed a bit she favored him with a ghost of a smile knew you wasnt all bad she said grabbing the railing and pulling herself to her feet benito wasnt all fool either he knew where his primary loyalty laywith the man hed privately chosen as his model and mentor caesare aldanto when benito had arrived at caesares castello apartmentwhich they all called home nowthat afternoon hed first checked to make sure that marco and maria werent home caesare was sitting reading benito felt no qualms about disturbing him with a terse report of marias attempt to recruit him the warm comfortable sitting room seemed to turn cold as aldantos expression chilled aldantos hands tightened a little on the sheaf of papers he was holding his blue eyes went cloudy benito knew him now tooknew by those slight signs that aldanto was not happy with this little piece of news benito clasped his hands in front of him and tried to look older than his fifteen yearsolder and capable capable enough to run with maria maybe even to ride herd a little on maria caesare he offered then before aldanto could speak to forbid him to help you know im not bad at roofwalking youve seen me youve set me jobs yourself you know if i tell her no shes just going to go it alone let me help huh happens i can keep her out of real bad trouble happens if shes got me along she maybe wont go looking for bad trouble so damn hard figuring shes got to keep me out of it a good hit that last maria was likely to feel at least a little bit responsible for benito if only because she was maybe two years older than him that was the line valentina had taken when he was along on one of her jobs and she was one of the least responsible people benito knew aldanto tilted his head to the side and looked thoughtful when benito had finished then put the papers down on the couch to one side of him crossing his arms over his chest and tapping his lips with one long aristocratic finger how about if i tell you to keep her out of trouble he asked finally benito winced that was nothing less than an impossibility as aldanto should very well know ask me to fly ive got a better chance aldanto managed a quirk of the right corner of his mouth im afraid youre probably right i should know better than to ask you to do something no one else can he stared at benito then stared though him thinking and thinking hard all right go ahead and give her a hand see if you cant keep her from being totally suicidal benito grinned and shrugged so far as he could see both he and maria had won hed told caesareand he hadnt been forbidden to help or ordered to hinder what little conscience he had was clear and he was free to indulge in the kind of hellraising he adored with aldantos tacit approval he prepared to turn and scoot down the hall to vanish into the downstairs bedroom he shared with marco when aldanto stopped him with a lifted finger but he said with the tone that told benito that disobedience would cost more than benito would ever want to pay i expect you to keep me informed completely informed chapter and verse on what shes doing and when and how and i want it in advance and well in advance benito stifled a sigh of disappointment si milord he agreed hoping his reluctance didnt show too much because he knew what that meant maybe he wasnt going to have to try to stop mariabut now he was honorbound to keep her from trying to do the kind of things hed like to pull and what that meant mostly was keeping things quiet damn quiet wasnt half the fun hey this one didnt work out too bad benito thought inching along the rough beam to the opposite corner of the grille and ignoring the splinter he got in a palm pain was for later he attacked the next bolt quietand nothing to connect me or maria to the mess when all hell breaks loose caesare was happy enough about that were here earlier than planned but i told him every detail and weve been doing well tonight this is two more windows than id figured likely to cut when we planned this he had gotten this bolt nearly sawed through when a feral cat yowled from the invisible canal below him she did a good catyowl it was somewhere to his right which meant upstream maria had spotted possible trouble benito coiled up the cable saw and stowed it safely away in the buttoned pocket of his breeches making damn sure the button was fastened and the saw in there then he inched still hanging upsidedown back along the support beam until he met the crossbrace he switched to it using both hands and legs taking it slowly and carefully to avoid making the wood creak until he reached the end that met the roof where the gutter was the drainpipes and gutterwork on casa dandelo isle were sound even if most of the rest of the building wasnt dandelo got most of its potable water from rain might ask marco if theres something we could drop into the rooftank give them all the heaves and trots benito grinned again in the darknesshe had a fair notion maria would like that idea real well it was another quiet onewhich would please caesare and it was an idea that would cost the dandelos money real hardcash moneycash for the doctors for clean water when they figured out what the cause was and for somebody to come clean and purge the system that pleased benitoand there was always a chance that the fear of plague or sickness in casa dandelo would flush some of the montagnard agents out of their safehouse and maybe into the hands of the schiopettieri hmmanother thought if they had any human cargo in there they might have to find another place for the captives and that would give the slaves a chance to escape that pleased benito even more he didnt have much in the way of moral scruples but he was flat against slaving he continued to think about this new plan as he grabbed the edge of the gutter and hauled himself up onto the roof with its aid the metal groaned a little and he froze but nothing further untoward happened he continued easing himself up over the edge he crawled from that point along the roofedge feeling his way and moving slowly to avoid any more noise until he found the outside corner of the roof and the place where the gutter met the drainpipe he stopped taking stock with his ears and nodded after a bit the echoes from the water lapping against the building were right for where he thought he was and he thought he could make out the sable pit of the grand canal a blacker blot in the nightshadows ahead of him he should be right on the point of casa dandelo where the building fronted rio della creaand maria should be right below him holding her gondola steady against the pull of the current woo ooo he called softly and was rewarded with a yowl almost directly below he eased himself over the edge of the roof dangling blindly for a little until he got his legs around the pipe then shinnied silently down the drainpipe it went in through the wall to a tank within but in a full stretch he could reach the narrow ledge that ran around the edge of the islet woo ooo he chirped struggling to hold his balance on the cold slippery slimy ledge as he positioned himself with his back to the wall come high tide this would be underwater and it tended to collect unsavory stuff he was having to hold to the drainpipe above him with both hands the ledge was barely two inches wide meeeow came the answer and the soft bump of a boatnose against the ledge beside him black blot against the reflective water benito squirmed about like a real cat grabbed the gondolas nose with both hands and leapfrogged aboard her before maria had a chance to say a word he felt his way down off the nose worked his way past the barrels occupying the slats of the bottom and sat down on the worn boards of foredeck knowing she knew hed gotten aboard safely by the gondolas movement he heard and felt her heave with the oar moving the gondola into the current of the grand canal there was a tense moment as they passed the bulk of the residential side of casa dandelo but it stayed quiet with hardly a light showing anywhere in the building then they were past down into cannaregio where maria had legitimatewell sort ofbusiness a barrel delivery from giaccomo and not all the barrels were empty this wasnt the first night shed had him along on the skip to helpnor would it be the last hoped benito marias company grew on you away from caesare make it look like business as usual and thats what everybody is going to figure was another of valentinas maxims when they finished this delivery theyd head home by way of barduccis benito would pass valentina her little tool under cover of buying her a drink and that would be her signal to spread the word tonight along certain channels that casa dandelo was no longer as impregnable as the dandelos thought benito grinned yet again as he picked the splinter from his climb out of his palm with his teeth figure as many as two of the slaves hit themand theyll fall out with a small pry bar anyone could pry them loose lord and saintsi damn sure wouldnt want to be the fellow responsible for those grilles he thought smugly he heard maria start to whistle through her teeth and guessed she was thinking the same thing well that was a little more off the totboard for what he and marco owed to maria and caesare a good nights work profitable for everybodyexcept casa dandelo chapter message for you maria said jeppo laconically as they unloaded the barrels at giaccomos that spook came here for you the boss dont like her here giaccomos real nervous about that magic crowd she aint a good contact to do business with i owe her said maria shortly pushing her hair back from a sweaty brow aint business but i got stuff to give back to her whats the message said shed be over at zianettis tonight uh huh maria sighed all the way over to accademia tonight jeppo grinned twitched a thumb at benito you better teach the apprentice to row zianettis was never as noisy as barduccis thered been trouble years ago about a tavern in the middle of the accademia area disturbing studentswho were of course the ones who made the disturbance and not the ones who complained so zianettis wasnt a music place the food was good and relatively cheap the drink slightly more expensive than elsewhere this simple recipe kept those intent on serious drinking going elsewhere while making sure there were always customers the big common room had been split up into a succession of smaller rooms so rowdy argumentabout everything from politics to paintswas limited to the crew who could fit in the smaller salons benito found it too quiet for his taste he and maria looked into several rooms before finding kat in one of the smaller back ones with marco oh great one mans trouble is another mans delight it made sense now and by the way marco looked at that snappymouthed smugglergirl this was real trouble what on earth did marco see in her besides someone shrewish enough to give maria words he had to grantnow that he could see her coppery curly hairthat she was prettier than he remembered and sort of aglow her cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkling wonder if shes stuck on marco too he thought thatd be a change normally the girls who want marco dont even get noticed by him and hes all eyes for the ones who dont know hes alive hey ciao kat said maria cheerfully leaning over their table what brings you to a dump like this got no music and the wine is expensive benito flopped down next to them maria was pleased to see kat that was obvious great now he had a brother and maria to get away from trouble caesare didnt know how right hed been in telling benito to be her minder kat dimpled the company is good though listena word of warning theres going to be a schiopettieri sweep through the town tonight benito shivered if they hadnt gone early theyd have been caught up in it maria sat down abruptly scowling bastardos theyre just trying to intimidate anyone from hitting the dandelos she stared at kat the scowl turning into a crease of puzzlement how do you know this stuff kat kats face took on a guarded look business lets just leave it out of this benito got to his feet id better go over to claudia and valentina ive got something to give backuh to deliver to them maria nodded si ill take you quicker look kat ive got a bundle i need to get to you ill be here on thursday she glanced shyly across at marco he nodded like that was it thought benito grimly have to break this up youd better come with us marco hear claudias got some doctor who wants to talk to you marco stood up reluctantly i suppose so he smiled at kat thursday then she drained her wine and stood up i might as well go too time i got home they walked out as they got to the door there was something of a press of older men benito realized he recognized one of them it was the short redhaired man with the single line of dark eyebrow who had seen them that first early morning outside the imperial embassyand then again when theyd recovered kats parcel he was the spaniard who had been staying with ricardo brunelli the redhead looked across the crowd his eagle eyes taking them all in the eyes narrowed and he began to push towards them ive got to get out of here said kat genuine fear in her voice but there was a real crowd at the door a masque must have finished across at la fenice and this was the drinkaftertheshow bunch follow me benito dropped to his knees and began squirming between legs he collected a few slaps on the rump and by the squawks behind him so did a few of the others but they were out in a minute all of them itll take more than a crowd to stop that man said marco sure enough the redhead was outside the inn peering into the night and as luck would have it hed come out closer to the canal benito didnt know this area as well as he did some the richer areas hed cased along the grand canal but knew it well enough we can just nip up that alley if the tide is out enough we can walk along the ledge around to where the gondolas are moored the alley a few yards from the corner of zianettis stank just like what it was often used for they moved down the dark curve of it quietly and then mariawho happened to be in the leadstopped them outlined by lights on the far side of the canal at the mouth of the alley were two people kissing passionately merda whispered maria him benito recognized the man too it was that milanese trade mission fellow hed taken the message to at the german hotel the one hed seen caesare in the alley with afterward the fellow had a very recognizable profile even in bad light there are some stairs back there whispered kat benito thought he was good at managing without light but she was obviously as good as a real cat they went back a few yards and up the little walled staircase there they crouched and waited sure enough someone came past beneath them the person stopped a few yards further on and then turned and walked far more quietly back thats the figlio di una puttana who questioned me in the casa dandelo hissed maria who senor lopez whispered kat the man who saw us at zianettis and chased us you mean it was you he was after no whispered maria im talking about the man kissing the woman ive never seen that lopez fellow in my life before who is he anyway benito heard kat take a deep breath and whisper nervously he pretends hes just a visitor to venice but i think hes a witchfinder from the grand metropolitan in rome hunting strega i thought the petrines believed in tolerance of other religions whispered marco kat snorted quietly did he look tolerant benito had to agree he didnt determined powerful yes tolerant no you dont know the other man the one at the end of the alley or the woman whispered maria before they got bogged down in theology no said kat benito actually bit his tongue to stop himself from saying francesco aleri he must talk to caesare he didnt have a clue who the woman was kat bit her tongue she had no idea who the man was but the silhouette of lucrezia brunellis hairdo was unmistakable and from the foot of the stairs someone rasped all right lorendanas kids aleri and the other guy have gone you can go home kat hadnt realized shed been holding marcos hand she felt him relax whoever this was he wasnt bad thanks harrow said marco the relieving party said nothing just walked away up the alley so they all got up and left too two minutes later she was out on the grand canal why was lopez after her the thought was scary shed better prompt giuseppe to not have her at home to any visiting spaniards and shed take the long way home to avoid the sweep maria worked her oar in silence for a while then she said marco what did your spook say kat shes not mine marco sounded almost wistful about it shes a wonderful girl isnt she and you heard what she said maria clicked her tongue in irritation tch lord and saints marco not kat that burnedface troll that follows you around ugliest guardian angel in the universe oh harrow marco shrugged hes just somebody whoknew our mother and the other name asked maria intently aleri well said marco thoughtfully there was a highup montagnard in mothers time by that name francesco aleri benito wished like hell marcos memory was less good he really had to talk to caesare about this before maria went in like a bull in a china shop aleri would have to die but maria must be kept well clear best to change the subject before marco remembered something else inconvenient so now youre crazy about kat marco what happened to the dream girl in the boat marco laughed happily kat is the dream girl in the boat benito there was a long moment of silence from both maria and benito benito wound his jaw back up bossyboots kat with too big a mouth and a tongue that could scour brass what he croakedin unison with maria late that night there came a knock on enekos door when the priest opened it onto the dimly lit ghetto alley a burly man with a badly scarred and burned face seized the basque by the lapel of his cassock and forced his way inside then kicked the door shut behind him eneko made no attempt to resist the mans strength was enormous why are you following the boys the man rasped im not replied eneko calmly youve been watching them snarled the scarfaced man ive seen youyou and the other two and tonight at zianettis eneko laughed softly i wasnt trying to talk to them i wanted to talk to the girl they were with the one they call kat the man released the cassock and stepped back a pace why he demanded none of your concern said eneko shaking his head but i will tell you that i mean her no harm i simply wanted to pass a message on to another through her unfortunately she left too quickly the man grunted the whore eneko cocked his head thats not a term i use but if were speaking of the same woman i wonder how you know who she is the man took another pace back im charged with protecting the boys i watch everythingeveryonethey come into contact with charged by whom asked eneko mildly the man shook his head none of your concern he turned on his heel and left not bothering to close the door eneko followed standing in the entrance stop he said softly the man now halfway down the alley paused and looked over his shoulder should you ever have need said eneko i will help you with your task those boys are vitally important the mans eyes seemed to widen a bit smart for a priest then he was gone moving more quickly and silently than eneko would have imagined such a scarred lump of a man could possibly do when he turned back into his room and closed the door he found pierre and diego already there the door to the adjoining cells was open pierre held a cudgel in his hand seeing the cudgel eneko clucked we are not a militant order pierre define your terms came the instant retort and remember that im a savoyard peasant not a theologian chapter swords clashed in a highspeed flurrying dance of steel not for the first time manfred wondered how erik could be so damned quick the edges were blunt there were buttons on the points and they wore quilted jackets so why did erik always leave him feeling he had been half skinned and half beaten he put in another determined rush if he was going to feel like that so was erik hold a voice commanded they put up the practice swords you must go to abbot sachss chambers von stublau looked sour enough to curdle milk he has some venetian lord to see you he looked disdainfully at the training rapiers pah too light for a knightly weapon but very fashionable said manfred with a grin knowing this would irritate the surly altmark knight enough manfred said erik before the slowthinking knight had time to respond to manfreds lure we train with broadswords on the pells ritter but these give us more of a chance to learn how to respond to a live opponent come manfred the abbot and this venetian lord wont thank us for keeping him waiting help me out of this jacket we need to get some kind of mask also if were to do this fencing properly manfred pulled the quilted jacket off his mentor and turned so that erik could do the same for him were neglecting the legs too we need a trainer erik a master of this italian bravura style ill ask francesca erik turned hastily to see if the supposedly celibate knightsquire had an audience but fortunately von stublau had left its not a bad idea manfred i dont care what von stublau saysfor marine warfare anyway armor is history i like armor myself grumbled manfred as they made their way up to the abbots rooms but ill admit having a horse to carry it helps the venetian waiting for them with the abbot was the balding one of that group of signori di notte that theyd met after theyd saved lord calenti from being magically murdered abbot sachs was doing his best to be pleasant it sat ill with the cleric ah ritters signor petro dorma has requested specifically to speak to you two you were quite correct in your surmise said dorma each of these vile murdersexcept possibly one where the fire destroyed the entire building it was in and therefore we cant be certainhas been found to have recently involved a missing item of clothing mammet witchcraft barked sachs petro dorma cleared his throat well the expert on magic i have spoken to says there are several other possibilities but i wanted to thank you gentlemen for your efforts on behalf of my fellow signori and also to tell you the sad news about father belgio and lord calenti despite our hopes lord calenti died last night and in a separate type of murder someone killed father belgio as well father belgio was not killed by magic asked erik intent petro dorma shook his head no just straight assassination a misericord pushed in behind the ear while he slept a thoroughly professional killing why manfred demanded he didnt seem the sort of man to attract enemies sachs snorted he was a man of god thats enough for these godless strega petro dormas expression was pained for an instant we have had strega murders from time to time abbot poison not steel is their way were following several lines of inquiry that is only one of them dorma paused for a moment studying erik and manfred i came for another reason as well there was another magical murder last night in the slave quarters of casa dandelo of all places according to my investigator who examined the scene once again the victim had lostor claimed to other prisoners to have lostall of his clothing petro dorma frowned whoever murders these people by whatever demonic means and for whatever reason there is certainly no respect for rank from lord calenti to a slave again dorma paused then but the reason i asked abbot sachs to speak to the two of you is tangential to the murder rumors are flying all over venice that the dandelos abducted a citizen into slavery just before the killing a canaler by the name of maria garavelli she apparently took advantage of the confusion caused by the magical murder to make her escape eriks jaws tightened in the months since he had arrived in venice he had developed a detestation for the type of chattel slavery tolerated in the republicthroughout most of the mediterranean in fact slavery had been legally abolished in the holy roman empire for more than a century and while it was still officially practiced in his own league of armagh celtic and norse thralldom had little of the sheer brutality and degradation of the mediterranean variety of servitude ill bet thats causing a stir snorted manfred dorma pulled a wry face to call it a stir is to understate the matter considerably bad enough that the dandelos tried to enslave a legal citizen to make matters worse the girl is a wellknown canaler from a large family of caulkers at the arsenal manfred whistled softly all hells going to break loose then they abducted a daughter of the arsenalotti are they insane i have no idea what motivated the fools they are trying to deny everything but the facts seem well enough established dorma scowled and at this point i no longer care what their reasons might have been if the authorities do not act decisively he nodded at manfred as you say all hell will break loose by now erik understood dormas purpose and you want usmanfred and meto be part of the ah what shall i call it punitive expedition will do quite nicely said dorma firmly yes exactly there are enough factional tensions in the city if some knights of the holy trinity are involved in the affair no one will be able to claim the raid was done for partisan purposes he glanced at sachs the dandelos are known to have montagnard leanings erik was a bit puzzled by the abbots apparent willingness to go along with dormas plan but sachs cleared up the mystery immediately when the abbot spoke he almost seemed to be choking on the words naturally lord dorma given the recent unpleasantness misapprehensions of the knights motives erik almost laughed you mean the mess youve stirred up with your idiot witchhunts both the servants and knights of the trinity are only too pleased to help serve god and your venice finished the abbot lamely eh ritters erik nodded it would be our pleasure manfred bowed deeply which was a good thing thought erik it helped to hide his grin dorma bowed in return thank you if you would be ready by lauds tomorrow morning i will have some of my schiopettieri come to meet you here ill take my leave now he sighed affairs of state business and at the moment family the last are the worst believe me sachs motioned to the two knights to stay and showed his guest out when he returned his face was sour a silly business asking knights to serve as common policemen but he shrugged irritably you are to make yourselves available for lord dorma whatever he wants you are dismissed erik was not surprised to find petro dorma waiting for them around the corner he had been certain that dorma had said as little as possible in the presence of sachs youd like more than just the two of us i imagine the venetian lord nodded yes please at least half a dozen as heavily armed as possible he smiled grimly i want to overawe the dandelos from the very beginning and for that purpose knights of the holy trinity will serve far better than schiopettieri he hesitated of course i do not expect you to do anything which would jeopardize your good standing with the abbot manfred snorted erik just smiled we were told whatever lord dorma wants that seems clear enough he and manfred exchanged glances von gherens for sure said manfred let him pick the others except id like gerhard bach along eriks smile widened bach eh yes i agree dorma looked back and forth from one to the other his eyes expressing a slight question gerhard bachs our gunnery expert explained manfred cheerfully hes got a new little bombard hes been dying to test under field conditions dorma seemed to choke a little then after a moment grinned himself a bombard you say well why not the main door to casa dandelo may not open quickly enough i can guarantee it wont open quickly enough growled erik no matter how fast they try i must talk to francesca said erik as they walked down the passage after parting company with dorma weve got some time and he glanced at manfred at this time of day she wont be ah occupied manfred looked at him with some amusement so long as its only talk but why erik shrugged because she understands all this intrigue and i do not and it is my task to keep you safe in it the way i see it said manfred going into the breech these strega are not in the clear at all when it comes to father belgios murder they can hire their killing done as well as anyone else francesca smiled at him the way a teacher smiles at a bright pupil who has managed half the answer she ruffled his hair and neatly evaded his arm going to sit instead on the arm of eriks chair true but as you rightly point out so could anyone elseif it was paid for but she held up an elegantly manicured hand it would have to be a rich anyone the church does not take kindly to its clerics being assassinated and beside the chance of excommunication their investigators are ferocious this was professionally done and that doesnt come cheap and there are very few who do it well she paused thinking if it was paid for well the first name that springs to mind is your blond friend caesare aldanto or as a second choice giuliano dellarta although giuliano probably makes more as swordmaster than he does killing people both of them have powerful protectors and are pretty much immune to petro dorma if it was done to further the aims of the factions bruno di netto is romes man the metropolitans chief executioner in venice francisco aleri is in charge of milansand he has the whole montagnard faction at his command they ship men in and out the republics council of ten well they keep their secrets so do the imperials although i suspect count demarien or von stemitz she smiled enough erik there are how many factions said erik weakly she smiled in venice where there are three people together at least five factions are gathered the venetian republic is worse than elsewhere because venice sits a jewel between so many interests it is the key to the mediterranean and the key to the east emeric the king of hungary milan rome the holy roman emperor all want veniceor at least the riches which pour through the city the ilkhan mongols have their own interests also as do the greeks even the grand duke of lithuania just to stir up trouble or to flank the holy roman empire and that is without the interests of the church and its various factions and the strega and the jews i think the latter just want a quiet life but both factions have money for whoever will offer to leave them alone she laughed throatily its a quiet little town i love it even more than i did my native orleans erik sighed i want to go back to iceland at least you only had to worry about someone trying to kill you this is all too complicated for me manfred smiled why dont we get some lessons from this swordmasters salle i dont think us going to visit this caesare aldanto fellow is a good idea erik drew a deep breath i still think a visit is called for francesca laughed what ill came of it erik i thought it was the italians who believed in vendetta manfred laughed compared to icelandic clan feudists not even in the same league francesca and eriks got humiliation to avenge as well as a simple attempt on his life aldantos the man responsible for getting him under your sweet thighs dont forget francesca chucked the unfortunate erik under the chin poor man it must have been so hard for you erik got hastily to his feet amid manfreds guffaws i think its time we talked to von gherens coward grinned manfred you talk to him im going to stay here and take my punishment like a man von gherens was willing so were the four young ritters he spoke to gerhard bach was downright avid fortunately the abbot was sequestered in private discussion with sister ursula when the schiopettieri barge arrived at the embassy in midafternoon erik thought sachs would probably have had a fit if hed seen eight armored knights wrestling a bombard into the venetian vessel even a small one the knightproctor von stublau did pitch a fit but with the official authority of sachs on his sideas attested to vehemently by manfred and erikvon gherens simply ignored von stublaus protestations take it up with the abbot snapped von gherens better make it quick too were leaving fuming angrily the prussian knightproctor stormed back into the embassy von gherens grinning turned to his knights and said lets go just in case von stublau develops the nerve to interrupt sachs and sister ursula hed better knock first muttered manfred not quite under his breath two of the younger knights chuckled softly erik frowned thats in very bad taste he growled not as bad as sister ursula ill bet responded manfred cheerfully the two young knights burst into outright laughter erik sighed once again reproving manfred had proven to be as useful as pouring naphtha on a bonfire the barge carrying erik and manfred met up with the rest of dormas flotilla not far from casa dandelo it was quite an impressive show of force even before the knights and their bombard arrived three barges packed with schiopettieri and another three coming behind the last three to eriks surprise were empty except for skeleton crews he wondered as to their purpose as soon as dormas barge came alongside petro hopped into eriks vessel the easy and nimble way he moved reminded erik how young lord dorma wasnot yet forty hed heardfor a high venetian notable the mans bald head pudgy build and judicious manner normally made him seem older ill ride the rest of the way with you petro announced smiling i believe i should since im officially in charge of thisah i believe were still calling it an investigation and youll be spearheading theah i believe ill call it an entry he eyed the little bombard can you fire that from the bow of the boat gerhard bach looked indignant are you cra he broke off coughing as if hed just remembered he was addressing a highranking venetian official rather than a young knightsquire ah no sir thatd be a very bad idea the recoil would probably hull the barge its not designed to be a gun platform dorma frowned then how ill figure something out replied bach cheerily dorma shrugged i leave the matter in your capable hands then he turned to erik any questions erik looked at him uncertainly yes how in the hell did you ever get the council of ten to agree to thismuch less the doge but he decided that question would be impolitic if rumor was to be believed dorma himself was a member of that secretive body as for the doge petro coughed i might mention that the doge has given me his blessing well in a manner of speaking again he eyed the bombard i told him we needed to test a new mechanism he was quite engrossed in his clocks at the time i took his wave as a gesture of assent it seemed a reasonable interpretation erik nodded solemnly it seemed a reasonable response and less likely to get him in trouble than any words he could think of manfred as usual suffered no such inhibitions foscarill probably have a heart attack when he finds out on the other hand the big young knight swept his arm in a halfcircle i think youre about to become the most popular official in venice erik and dorma turned their heads following manfreds gesture erik was startled to see the size of the crowd that had already formed alongside the canal with more and more people pouring in from little side streets and as the flotilla passed by a small side canal he could see that it was full of gondolas all of them were packed with onlookers for all the world as if they were going on a family promenade as soon as lord dormas flotilla passed the mouth of the canal the much larger flotilla of gondolas came following behind at first erik was surprised that the crowd was so quiet almost completely silent in fact but before long he understood venices canalers and working classes were still not sure about the nature and purpose of dormas flotilla true it looked as if but the venetian authorities had a long history of looking the other way when it came to the transgressions of the dandelos so who could be sure that this would not just turn out to be another empty gesture theyre wondering about us murmured manfred look at em whispering back and forth all through that mob on the one hand the knights are supposed to be nothing but tools for the emperorwhich means the montagnards to them on the other hand he examined his fellow knights standing in the barge and grinned we are a rather fearsome lot to be hauling around just for show erik wasnt sure whether to smile or frown once again francescas influence on manfred was showing not so many weeks ago manfred wouldnt have been able to analyze a foreign crowd so surely and readily for that matternot so many weeks agothe thought of doing so would never even have crossed his mind wine women and song it had beenand very lightly on the song since hed met that one particular woman however he doesnt even drink that much anymore will wonders never cease but he had no time to pursue the thought further the grim and imposing edifice of casa dandelo loomed ahead of them even at a distance it was obvious the dandelos had forted up there was not a person to be seen anywhere in the immediate vicinity except one what in the name of god is that boy doing demanded von gherens crazy kid erik stared at the small figure perched on one of the timbers holding up the roof of casa dandelo perched like a bat not a bird the kid was hanging upside down i guess he wanted the best possible view said manfred he loosened his great sword in its scabbard so lets not disappoint him chapter benitos eyes were riveted on the bombard nestled in the hold of the barge with three of the knights squatting next to it from benitos vantage point high atop casa dandelo he could see the bombard clearly but he knew that from the angle of dandelo observers below the bombard would still be invisible that as much as anything finally convinced benito that dormas expedition was serious like most canalers and lowerclass venetians his first reaction on hearing the news that lord dorma was going to inspect casa dandelo was jeering oh sure dormall trot through the place and come out announcing that all is well but the bombard hidden from sight andthe fact that there were knights in the expedition if benito had lost his childhood enthusiasm for his mothers montagnard cause he still retained a certain romantic image of the knights the champions of christendom defenders of the right bold and brave and true if the image was tarnishedand had been tarnished even more by the general behavior of the knights in venice over the past yearit was still there lurking in the corners of his mind besides not all of the knights were simply lackeys for the servants was there a canaler in venice who hadnt heard the story by now of how some of the knightsone in particularhad defied their abbot when he ordered a girl and some children hauled out of a church and put to the inquisition benito had heard that story several times over the past months in several different places and from several different pairs of lips the stories varied in detail of course as city rumors will except on one point all of them agreed that the knight who had first defied the abbot was a nordic wolfman of some sort a young blond maniac who had been ready to carve his fellow knights into bloody pieces over an issue of law and principle the barge was closer now if they hadnt been wearing helmets benito could have seen individual faces eagerly he scrutinized what little he could see of the knights past their helmets and nose guards which was not much unfortunately then benito noticed that one of the knightsone of the three standing in the bow of the bargewas a very big man and he remembered that according to some of the stories he had heard the blond one had been aided by a supposed giant i wonder if at that moment one of the knights standing next to the very big one unclasped his helmet and removed it then quickly wiped his forehead and brushed back his long hair in the way that a warrior will just before battle to make sure that his hair will not slide forward in the helmet and obscure his view his very long and very blond hair the knight glanced up at benito as he did so then after shaking his head in bemusementcrazy kidreplaced the helmet the whole thing had not taken more than a moment but long enough for benito to see the knights face clearly a face that seemed a thing made entirely of angles and sharp planes for all its obvious youth yes its got to be him im sure of it benitos excitement was cresting suddenly he was certain that this expedition was no thing of show not in the least little bit ive got to see it he made up his mind right then curling quickly back into an upright position he planted his feet firmly on the crossbeam of the roof then looking across the canal to the rooftop across the way where maria was perched watching him gave her a quick and cheerful wave and a thumbsup moving quickly before maria could have time to start yelling orders at him to cease and desist benito took out the little prybar he had brought with himjust in caseand began working at the iron bars of the small window he was squatting beside those were some of the iron bars he had sawn through two nights earlier and it was quick work to pry a couple of them loose benito glanced down to make sure no one would get hit and pitched the bars into the waters of the canal below then he paused better wait until he looked at the barge holding the knights he could see petro dorma also benito recognized him from his many public appearances the lord of the nightwatch was perched in the very tip of the bow preparing to offload the barge had almost reached the casa dandelo a moment later the barge came alongside the wharf lord dorma and the three knights in the bow hopped off and strode to the main door of casa dandelo one of the knightsthe big onebegan pounding on the door lord dorma was shouting something benito couldnt make out the exact words mostly because he was doing his best to close his ears entirely so he could claim later that he hadnt heard mariasnow very loud and profaneshouted orders at him to stop what youre going you crazy little bastard he grinned wryly well he was pretty little and he was certainly a bastard crazy on the other hand i prefer to think of it as bold marias cursing could probably be heard in the jesolo by now get away from that window you blanketyblank stupid little blanketyblank what do you think youre doing benito avoided looking at herhis eyes were fixed on the bombard which several of the knights were wrestling onto the wharfbut he did give her an assuring little wave relax maria i know what im doing a complete lie of course even benito thought what he was about to do was at least half insane voluntarily entering the lair of the dandelos but i have got to see this lord dorma shouted something which sounded very final then he and the three knights at the front stepped back the other knights by now had nestled the bombard against a heavy stone abutment on the wharf one of them took out a smoking slow match they must have already loaded it and the bombard went off with a boom even though benito was expecting it the noise startled him so did the sound of the heavy front door of casa dandelo being turned into splinters not so much from the cannonball which had simply shattered the lock but from the weight and fury of half a dozen armored knights slamming into it marias shrieking orders and curses at benito could be heard in the alps by now he gave her a last little wave and plunged through the window into the darkness of casa dandelo the room he found himself in was some kind of storage area everything was very dark but he could see the dim outlines of a door on the opposite side stumbling over various carelessly stacked crates holding godknowswhat he scrambled to the door then tested it cautiously despite the recklessness of his project he hadnt lost the fine details of burglary work to his relief the door wasnt locked or bolted on the other side he opened it slowly carefully peeking out into the corridor beyond there was no one in the corridor to his left the corridor deadended a few yards away three other doors on that side seemed to be the same type as the door he was openingold decayed apparently little used the kind of doors which led to nothing beyond rooms for storing mostly unwanted items by pure luck he had chosen a perfect entry route into the dandelo building to his right the corridor angled almost immediately to the left he couldnt see what lay beyond that bend but he could hear a furious ruckus coming from somewhere below the excitement he wanted to watch obviously hurriedly not wanting to miss any of it benito almost lunged out of the storage room and scurried to the bend of the corridor the lighting was so badjust one sconce at the very end of the corridorthat he tripped over an unseen obstacle lying on the floor and wound up sprawling around the bend instead of creeping unnoticed fortunately there was no one the bend led immediately to a flight of stone stairs leading downward to a landing and then curving to the left again the noise was louder now so wasthe stench benito almost gagged maria had told him how badly casa dandelo reeked of the effluvia of slave trading but he hadnt quite believed her breathing through his mouth and trying to breathe as little as possible benito pranced down the stairs for all the speed with which he negotiated the steps and the landing he made almost no noise at all there was no one on the landing either but then benito got careless the noise coming up from the fracas below was very loud now men shouting at each other benito was suddenly terrified that he would miss everything so abandoning what little caution he still retained he raced from the landing down the stairs as he neared the bottom of the steeply inclined staircase he could see that it ended in a balcony overlooking a large room he covered the last three steps in a single bound landing on the balcony in a crouch and then eagerly leaning over the stone railing below in the large entrance hall of casa dandelo he could see petro dorma backed by all of the knights almost facetoface with angelo dandelo the head of the house dandelo was backed in turn by more than a dozen of his own retainers all of them armed most with cudgels and knives but at least two with halberds and another two with arquebuses the two men seemed to have finished shouting at each other dorma was turning his head clearly on the verge of issuing orders whichjust as clearly from the tension of the knights and the arquebusarmed schiopettieri standing behind themno spreading to the sides ready to firewas going to cause all hell to break loose benito was ecstatic sure enough he had a grandstand view unfortunately so did the four dandelo retainers who were also perched on the balcony not more than ten feet away from him all of them large angry lookingand armed with cudgels the moment was tense benito stared at the dandelo goons they stared at him what to do what to do two of the dandelos were starting to move toward him fortunately for benito his abrupt arrival had also been noticed by one of the knights standing next to dorma the very large one with a very large voice hold came the bass bellow wideeyed benito stared down at him the very large knight had taken a step toward the balcony pointing a very large and armored finger at the advancing dandelo goons hold right there you men are under arrest the very large and armored finger now pointed imperiously at benito you have your orders knightsquire crazykid the finger swept backas imperiously as everto the dandelo goons on the balcony arrest them dont let them escape one of the dandelo retainers standing not far from the very large knight began to shout some sort of protest the knightmoving way faster than benito would have believed he couldslammed a very large and armored fist into the mans face the dandelo was flattened instantly blood everywhere benito wasnt sure but he thought the blow had broken the mans neck as well as crushed his head knightsquire crazykid arrest them dont let them go fortunately benito was no stranger to brazening his way out of jams he drew his little knife and brandished it like a sword what the hell knightsquire crazykidslurred in that terrible accentdid sound a bit german stop he shouted at the goons on the balcony ill kill any man who tries to escape he took two steps toward them god and the right before he got out the last words an arquebus went off with a roar on the floor below then two more the four dandelos on the balcony took off like antelopes in an instant they had disappeared up another set of stairs benito looked over the balcony both of the dandelos holding arquebuses were down one of them clearly dead his chest a bloody ruin the other groaning and holding his side blood was pouring through his fingers benito hadnt seen it but he was sure that the dandelos had made some threatening move with the firearms and the schiopettieri had cut loose with their own now with the dandelos armed with nothing beyond cudgels and edged weapons against knights of the holy trinity the stampede was already starting when the very large knight whipped out his sword and bellowed dia a coir the stampede turned into a rout dandelo retainers raced out of the entry hall seeking escape anywhere they could find it most of them made it but five were corralled by the knights or schiopettieri angelo dandelo didnt even get two steps he tried to make his escape but the blond knight seized him by the scruff of the neck and drove him to the floor by kicking in the back of his knee none too gently with an armored boot benito practically howled with glee but his pleasure ended abruptly when he noticed that the very large knight was glaring up at him again the imperious finger again the booming basso voice you come down here benito danced back and forth the staircase hed come down from was just behind him after all benito was sure he could outrun that big knight especially since hed have to come all the way from the floor below clanking in heavy armor up a staircase that was at an angle from where benito was standing on the balcony he was sure he could make his escape on the other hand if he didnt benito glanced down at the dandelo whod been struck by the knights fist um yes his neck was broken right now kid meekly benito trotted over to the staircase indicatedeven that damned finger looks like it could break bonesand came down the stairs yes sir im coming when he arrived before the very large knight it seemed as if everyone was glaring at him most of the knights with reproof the schiopettieri with anger petro dorma with the stern face of official venice well everyone except the blond knight and the big one the blond was still holding angelo dandelo down he just glanced at benito and shook his head the way a man will when confronted with the crazy act of a crazy kid the big knights heavy and square face was half hidden behind the nose guard of his helmet but benito saw it very clearly when he winked at him who are you demanded petro dorma and what are you doing here for some reason the large knights wink returned all of benitos usual selfconfidence although he did manage to restrain his usual swagger im benito oro he announced then angrily it was my friend maria the bastards grabbed thats why im here the angry tone faded into something more sullen i just wanted to make sure thats all dorma sighed then exchanged glances with the blond knight benito heard the blond knight mutter something to dorma he wasnt sure but he thought it was from the mouths of babes dormas mouth quirked into a little smile and why not all right young benito since youre here anyway you can be myah lets call it witness for the canalers hows that benito nodded his head eagerly the eagerness faded when he felt a very large hand close on his shoulder the hand squeezed a bit just a bit benito felt like he was caught in a vise ill look after the kid lord dorma rumbled the voice have no fear dormas quirky smile turned into something a lot broader oh i dont he gave benito a genuine official stare i dont believe theres any reason to fear is there boy the very large hand squeezed a bit more benitos headnodding became very eager the next two hours were sheer joy benito accompanied lord dorma and his entourage as they went through every roomevery closetof casa dandelo those locks on slave pens for which angelo had keys in his possession were unlocked those which he didnt were smashed open every slave was inspected then records demanded every slave for whom dandelo had no records was immediately freed and escorted away by schiopettieri then lord dorma made a notation of the fine in every instance he fined casa dandelo the maximum permitted by venetian law every slave for whom dandelo had inadequate records was also freedwith the same maximum fine lord dormas concept of adequate records was strict manfreds was teutonic eriks was viking the ink is smudged here announced dorma cant be read at all snorted manfred i say shes a free woman growled erik dorma hesitated a moment then nodded scribble scribble maximum fine he doesnt quite resemble the description mused dorma to say the least boomed manfred an inch too short sneered erik no resemblance at all hes a free man scribble scribble maximum fine does that hair look black to you ritters queried dorma half a dozen helmeted heads shook back and forth in firm disavowal brown stated manfred firmly practically blond barked erik dorma nodded again hes free then scribble scribble maximum fine angelo dandelo stopped even trying to protest halfway through the process partly because of the split lip he had from his firstand very profaneprotest the blond knight had been no more gentle with his armored backhand than hed been earlier with his boot youll show respect for the lord of the nightwatch damn you next time youll spit teeth the time after that youll spit guts try me you fucking slaver bastard but mostly because dandelo was not a fool protest was pointless the dandelos had misgauged the political situation and misgauged it badly lord dormas place in it most of all and they were now going to pay the heavy price which venices often ruthless politics exacted from losers dorma would leave them just enough slavesthe ones who were incontrovertibly legalto keep them from outright bankruptcy but by the end of day casa dandelo would be almost penniless and politically humbled it was late afternoon before benito emerged from casa dandelo he came out at the very end with lord dorma and the knights the very large ones hand was still on his shoulder but it had long since stopped squeezing by now it seemed that half of venice must have gathered to watch quite a bit more than half probably of the canalers and arsenalotti the roar of the mob was almost deafening no one had any doubts any longernot after seeing the procession of freed slaves who had emerged from casa dandelo for the past hour or so and been escorted by the schiopettieri into the waiting empty barges dorma led the way onto the last barge unsure what to do now benito let the large knight propel him into the barge also better come with us knightsquire crazykid he said you dont want to be left alone on casa dandelos wharf tonight my names benito the very large knight grinned the square blocky teeth were visible even under the helmet benito then it was still a crazy thing to do you should talk manfred chuckled the blond knight standing next to them he removed the helmet and shook his long very pale blond hair in the breeze god i hate helmets then smiling at benito im erik hakkonsen by the way and you are insane but the words were spoken in a very friendly tone and benito found himself meeting the smile with a grin i just couldnt help it thats all and i wouldnt have missed that for anything the very large knightmanfred he was apparently namednow removed his helmet also benito was almost shocked when he saw how young he was hes not much older than me cant be more than eighteen the barge pulled away from the wharf and began heading across the canal the mob on the other side was packed like sardines all of them waving and shouting lord dorma lord dorma and more than a few doge dorma the knight named erik stared apparently taken aback by the crowds frenzied applause oddly the young knight named manfred didnt seem surprised at all just like francesca predicted he mused i do believe venetian politics just went through an earthquake im letting you off here petro dorma said to benito as the barge was almost across the canal at that moment a young woman suddenly pushed her way to the forefront of the mob her eyes seemed a little wild as soon as she caught sight of benito her square jaw tightened like a clamp then thats an incredible command of profanity shes got said manfred cheerily and the way your girlfriends shaking her fist at you doesnt bode well for your future shes not my girlfriend growled benito manfreds already huge grin got bigger could have fooled me he eyed the shrieking young woman in my experienceokay its limited i admitbut still the grin faded a little and the next words came softly young benito i think only a woman in love gets that angry at a man youre crazy snapped benito they were almost at the edge of the canal with as little effort as if he were picking up a toddler manfred hoisted benito by the armpits and began to deposit him off the barge maybe so he whispered but if she isnt youre the one whos crazy not me damn but shes gorgeous benito stared at the furious eyes that manfreds huge hands were depositing him before to meet his punishment the square jaw the red face the thick hair swinging wildlyalmost as wildly as the fistthe broad shoulders damn she is gorgeous the thought vanished as soon as marias hand cracked his face and it stayed away while she shook him by the shouldersslapped him again not as hard but twiceand finished cursing him but it returned in a flood when she seized him and hugged him close sobbing softly in his hair and kissing his cheek god damn you benito dont ever scare me like that again im sorry maria he mumbled but he didnt know how to respond he was too confused damn but youre gorgeous seemed crazy but he couldnt think of anything else to say not a damn thing that didnt seem crazier chapter when antimo brought the news of dormas raid on the dandelos to the duke of ferrara delleste rose from his chair and went to the window there he remained for some time staring toward venice how much money have we received so far from the emperor through baron trolligers private agents well have enough to hire the condottieri we need secretly yes milord since youll be commanding the army yourself ive not had to negotiate with any wellknown great captains just a large number of small companies neither visconti nor sforza will be able to keep track of the numbers involved ferrara will field twice the force the milanese are expecting im quite sure of it careless on their part mused delleste but im not surprised filippo visconti has always been too arrogant and sforza has grown complacent with success he was silent for a moment then gave the windowsill a little tap so everything else is in place we have the army we need and it seems as if venice has finally found a leader worthy of the name there remains onlyvaldosta when he turned back the face of the old fox seemed to have no expression at all but antimo knew his master far too well to be fooled the sword then the duke nodded yes send it the time has come at last the old foxs right hand curled into a loose fist as if an expert swordsman held a blade in his hand still there was no expression in his face but again antimo was not fooled and so as he had done so many other times and in so many other ways he gave help again to his master they murdered your daughter hounded your grandchildren did their best to soil the name of delleste plotted and schemed to destroy ferrara and venice both the dukes lips peeled back into a snarl had he been there to see the sight carlo sforzathe famous wolf of the northwould have finally recognized what he was about to face but sforza was not there nor were his master viscontis spies and the moment was brief in any event soon enough the old fox was back so they did he murmured smiling thinly and in so doing did nothing morein the endthan sharpen my blades his eyes moved to the rack of swords there are no finer blades in the world antimo than those of delleste part v may ad chapter the summons to dorma had come often that spring petro seemed to enjoy talking to him and they would be sending him to the accademia in the summer this friday morning it was different petro dorma was sittingas usualin his inner sanctum the balding mans face usually serious was downright solemn across his desk lay an open box containing a naked sword on a sheet of scarlet silk it had plainly been wrapped in it was an old handandahalfblade made in a style a century out of date now the bluesilver folded damascus steel was as rippling mirror bright as if it had left the maker yesterday only the golden hilt showed the signs of years of careful devoted polishing wordlessly petro dorma held out the letter it didnt take marco long to read it i send into the keeping of house dorma one of the honorblades of delleste in token of the bond now between us young marco will know how it is to be cared for your grandfather says you know how to care for this sword marco nodded not able to speak there was a hidden message there from duke delleste a message milord petro could not possibly read but marco knewand the implications turned his life upside down in the single span of time it had taken petro to free the blade from its silk wrapping petro dorma was no fool of course if he could not read the message still he knew that one was thereand that it must be portentous for his house so he took marcos nod at face value and set the sword back down in its silken nest delleste steeldelleste honor there is no going back now not for grandfather not for the old fox tell me what you need dorma said simply i gather this isnt the sort of thing you just leave in the armory or hang on the wall applace marco stammered i need a place for it somewhere where its safe but where it can be seen byby he flushed by the househead you milord youresupposed to be reminded by it milord petro nodded thoughtfully will that do he asked pointing behind and to marcos right there was an alcove between two windows an alcove currently holding an unimpressive sculpture of the madonna the alcove was approximately a foot wider than the blade was long yes milord marco said immediately yes milordthats perfect a few days later the thing was done and he was summoned into dormas presence again marco held his breath and with all the concentration he could command placed the centuryold handandahalf sword reverently in the cradle of the special rack hed asked milord petro to have made marco stepped back two paces to scan his handiwork with an apprehensive and critical eye hed inspected and cleaned the blade of the sword that morning that being a small ritual in and of itself somewhere in his earlier conversations hed told petro that in venices damp climate hed have to inspect the blade once or twice a week and that he preferred not to have to move it too far from its resting place hed been a little apprehensive about that since this was clearly the head of dormas privateand very specialsanctuary but petro had nodded his acceptance of that gravely and then hed taken the undyed tassel off the hilt keeping it not giving it to a servant to be dealt with this morning hed returned the tassel to marco now the deep and unmistakable midnightblue of dormas house colors that was all marco had needed the ancient sword was now ready to take its place in the heart of dorma he knelt again and reached out to adjust the blade so that the silk tassels hung sidebyside from the hilt neither obscuring the other the valdostascarlet and dormablue tassels hung gracefully shining as only heavy silk could dorma colors delleste colors ferraras steel marco wore all of them now a main gauche and rapier of more modern design on his belt sent by the duke andon his right hand a signet ring a newcut signet with an old design the lions head seal of casa valdosta he would be hidden no longer after all these years the secret life in the marshes and the canals valdosta had returned to take his rightful place in venice it is your grandfathers opinionwhich i sharethat you would now be far safer in the public eye where harming you would be noticed and acted upon you must come to live here in the casa dorma petro dormas gaze weighed and measured marco before he added both of you it took all the eloquence that marco possessed to convince petro that he did not want benitonotentirelyexthief bridgebrat benitoinside casa dorma at least not for now caesare aldantos the only one who can control him milord he pleaded earnestly i cant and you might as well try to tell the tide not to come in for all hell heed you caesare aldanto can keep him safe until he develops a little more sense marco clenched his hands in anguish on the arms of the chair please milordlord and saints know i love him but i know him hes delleste bloodbut wolf sforza blood also hes been on the street since he was a kid bridgebrat taught itd be like trying to tame a wild kitten tell caesare to bring him around to being civilized if anybody can make benito see sense itll be caesare aldanto petro dorma scowled at the mention of aldantos name then nodded againthis time reluctantly i cant say that i like it but you know your brother his mouth firmed that makes it all the more important that we fulfill our obligations toward you marco he surveyed marcos clothing with a critical eye and one of the first things will be an appropriate wardrobe ill have my mother see to that but in the end it had been angelina not rosanna who had outfitted him petros mother rosanna was indisposed and marco had yet to actually see her except at meals she seemed ill and looked as frail as a creature of lace and spun glass he much doubted shed seen him not really hed kept his head down and his eyes fixed on his plate and he never spoke that wasnt because dorma cousins were unfriendly mostly it was because he didnt know what to say the intricacies of polite social conversation were still a mystery to him and what could he talk about anyway how to survive in the marshes the best ways to break into a house so he kept his mouth shut and let the dorma cousins steer him though the maze of dancing religion and etiquette lessons let angelina guide him through what it meant to be a house scion let caesare aldanto try to show him how to keep himself alive with that valdosta steel and let angelina outfit him in leather silk wool and finest linen clothing he hadnt worn since that long ago childhood in ferrara the kind where the cost of one pair of boots would outfit a canaler for years the silk of a sleeve slid caressingly along his arm as he adjusted the positioning of the basse taille enameled swordrest by a fraction of an inch the stand itself was adequatethe best petro could do on short notice the cabinet maker had been given a more exact design and instructions to paint the stand with no fewer than twenty coats of varnish that kind of work took time and marco was content to wait for it the walnut halfmoon table it stood on though was perfect rescued from the dorma attics its neat marquetry could have come from the hand of a master craftsman perhaps it had come from ferrara toorosanna dorma had brought some furnishings with her from their estates outside vicenza iron from vicenza went to the forges of ferrara and the delleste craftsmen marked only their steel marco looked again at the old sword and shivered the second sword of delleste that hed last seen on its own rest just below the first sword it brought with it levels of meaning as intricate and interleaved as the folded and refolded steel that made up the blade the sword of duke delleste is the soul of house delleste the old duke had said with marco kneeling attentively beside him this sword marco had turned wide eyes on his grandfatheris as old as ferrara he could not imagine it the tally of years made him dizzy to contemplate not ferrara and not this sword grandfather had sighed the delleste were swordsmiths back when the etruscans first came across the mountains to the flatlands of the east the first soul of delleste was forged in felsina the second in hiding in motena the third was made in the marshes we reclaimed to make ferraras wealth each time we have made two as strong and with the new skills that the delleste alone can give to the great blades some call it magic the old man had smiled dryly the witchfinders suspect us but if there is magic it is in the blood and bone and steel of the delleste sometimes when the house delleste is threatenedin uncertain timesit is sometimes wise to send a second soul out with an heir to seek a new home so that the delleste line will continue this is the third blade that beside him benito wriggled and yawned audibly father this is boring me to tears lorendana had complained i can hardly imagine the boys exactly grandfather had snapped you can hardly imagine anything exercising your mind is evidently beyond you he rose to his feet his face gone cold with anger and pointed to the door behind her go get out of here and take your impertinence with you that was what grandfather had meant sending the sword that things were deteriorating in ferrara that he feared for the house delleste and was taking steps to ensure its survival but he marco valdosta was merely the child of a daughter of the house things must be dire indeed that he marco was now a recognized heir delleste honor the delleste soulsword he wanted to heal people not cut them down but honor demanded he must do as the house delleste needed petro dorma couldnt know these things but he had evidently understood that the coming of the sword meant far far more than mere courtesy to a new ally a new powerful trade partner or even the family that had assumed guardianship of his grandsons you realizeweve had to change our original plans about you petro spoke reluctantly as if he regretted having to tell this to marco we were going to sponsor you into the accademia in anticipation that you would eventually replace doctor rigannio hes getting old hes been hinting for some time that we should start thinking about finding an assistant but now petro shrugged helplessly im sorry marco but its really out of the question it simply isnt done having a son of one family serving another family even in so honored a position as family physician oh i see no reason why you cant study medicine so go right ahead and well go through with our sponsorship and support but marco nodded i understand milord hed said quietly thats just the way it is delleste honor delleste responsibilities there was no running away from this and he had learned finally the folly of running even caesare didnt run from problemsbecause he had taken on responsibilities so there would be no doctor marco living canalside helping the canalers and the poorest of the canalsiders still doctor rigannio a kindly man had been letting him be something of an assistant in the past month or so that hed been visiting dorma now that he was here he spent more time with him so long as it was within the house and riganniod been listening carefully to what marco had poured out to him about sophias cures that informationslowly carefully and with no clues as to the sourcewas something doctor rigannio had taken to leaking back into the accademia it wasnt heretical and marco had already seen evidence that it was coming back down to canalside as the herbhunters were pointed to new plants and the results coming into the apothecaries so hed done that much good and there was something else hed been watching these aristocrats and from the inside vantage point no one thought any the worse of the casa heads for having hobbiessome of them pretty odd old man renzi cultivated entertainers bruno bruschi studied venetian insect life carlo di zecchilo played the flute angelo ponetti made lace for gods sake as long as it didnt obsess you the way the doges clockwork toys did a hobby was actually considered genteel there was no reason why the head of an old case vecchie family like the valdosta couldnt indulge himself in a hobby of medicine and if he chose to treat the impoverished canalers and canalsiders well the medical establishment would be relieved that he wasnt taking away potentially paying patients and his peers would consider it no more than mildly eccentric he could work it out with the priests by explaining that he was discharging religious obligations as for having the time to do this hed been watching petro and yes he was busy but he did have some leisure time it was possible and the opportunity to so indulge himselfthe training to be able to do sowould have come without any strings attached other than those of duty to his family not strega not dorma there were other ramificationsof potential benefit to both valdosta and aldanto he could earn loyalty and gratitude for valdosta down along canalside that no amount of money could buy he could earn friends for his family and ears for caesare aldanto im kind of lost here he had been saying to his patients or his patients parents they knew by his accent that he wasnt canalside born though what they made of him he couldnt guess i dont know canalside i need friends in the trade friends whod tell me when somebodys setting up to cheat me or hurt me not spies lord and saints no just friendswholl give me a ride now and again give me warning if theres a bullyboy on my tail and tell me the common gossip everybody knows but nobody else would tell me thats help honest help worth more than silver worth more than enough to clear any debt those whod insisted on paying him with goods instead of that askedfor help hed had leave the stuff in front of harrows hole it kept disappearing so he assumed harrow was getting most of it he doubted anyone else was that part of castello had become mysteriously free from crime of late he sighed and got to his feet it was hard trying to think out all the ramifications of something he was so used to living one day at a time not thinking beyond the needs of the season now now it was time for dancing lessons pah dancing lessons hed been here a week and needed to get out and see kat but he wasnt sure what to tell her she was a commoner a smuggler he was now one of the case vecchie how was she going to take that she was the greatest darling in nature but touchy about her home it must be very simple and poor and she didnt seem to want him to know where it was how would he handle that now how would he handle anything he didnt know all he knew was the meaning of the sword there in its rightful place delleste steel delleste honor it had been returned to him he had no choice but to honor it nor he discovered probing his heart did he have any desire not to honor it chapter light flickered up ahead as a door opened and closed a figure entered the corridor who is it snapped an elderly female voice in irritation your pardon milady marco said humbly im afraid i took a wrong turn somewhere he paused in the unfamiliar stuffy darkened corridor marco realized that with his mind preoccupied with the conversation just finished with petro hed gotten lost this area of casa dorma was part of the familys living quartersand apparently an old and poorly maintained one the perfume in the single lamp along this stretch of hallway could not mask the faint odor of mildew nor the olive origin of the oil it burned marcos night sight had always been good he had no difficulty seeing who it was that had accosted him milady rosanna dormapetros motherand she didnt look well her skin was grayish a vein throbbed in her temple and her eyes seemed to be all pupil she was pressing her right hand to her temple and supporting herself against the corridor wall with her left prudence said that he should go back and leave her alone concern and the healing instinct said she was in no shape to be left alone he moved quickly to her side footsteps sounding hollow in the uncarpeted corridor intending to ask if he could be of service to her since hed inadvertently intruded on her privacy but she began trembling the moment he came into view staring at him as if he was a thing out of nightmare she crowded back against the corridor walland when he held out his hand to steady her she shrieked spasmed and fell to the floor prudence dictated that he find help doctor rigannio or petro dorma and by the time i find help she may be dead he was on his knees beside her in an eyeblink then cradling her in his arms to protect her from injuring herself with the convulsions she was suffering he held her head against his shoulder and pinioned her wrists in one long hand she was so frail it took next to nothing to restrain her ernesto she cried shrilly ernesto no not again dear god not again she writhed in his arms trying to free her hands trying to reach for something dilated eyes racing pulse clammy skin sweat beading the brow and hallucinations by that throbbing vein in the temple probably a blinding headache symptoms tumbled together in his mind and formed an answer lotos dreams hed seen it in the jesolo with bluelotos addicts either induced or flashback it didnt matter which and in a patient as obviously weakened as this one was if someone didnt do something nowshe was in very real danger of never coming out again and if he left her alone to get helpshe was in very real danger of hurting or even killing herself there was only one choice try and talk her though it hed done it more than once with luciano if he could just get her attention fixed on him rosanna now was not the time for milady dorma she wouldnt respond to that he slipped her farther down so that she was lying against his upright knee and slapped her cheek lightly rosanna say something tell me you hear me he slapped her other cheek tell me talk to me her eyes wandered seeing things he couldnt tears poured down her ashen cheeks rosanna talk to me he shook her and dredged up her few hysterical words looking for a clue to get into her dream rosanna if you dont talk to me ernesto will get very angry with you her eyes focused on him for a moment llorendana lorendana valdosta she faltered her face twisted her mouth a slash of pain lorendana stop them theyre your friendstheyre killing ernesto god and saintsshe thought he was his mother that must have been what threw her into this in the first place ernestothat must have been ernesto dorma petros father hed wondered about the portrait in the study so like petro but plainly older petro had identified it then said something about his father dying from an accidental fall godscould she have seen something no one else did is that whynever mind whatever it was it couldnt have involved my mother she was murdered months before ernesto dorma died ill get her out of this first then worry about dorma secrets there were only two ways of dealing with lotos dreamsdirect the dream or break it and somehow marco knew if he directed the dream from the nightmare she was in into something pleasant shed never leave it again ernesto is dead rosanna he said savagely hes been dead more than a year you know hes dead and you cant change the past you think you can but the past you create is a lie and ernesto doesnt like lies rosanna her eyes widened and she whimpered in the back of her throat he continued on as stern and unyielding as saint chrysostom his mornings religion lesson giving him another weapon to break her out of her hallucination hes very angry with you rosanna youre muddying his trip through purgatory trying to hold on to him like this he sent me to tell you that if you really loved him youd let him go she cried out in denial freed her hands from his and tried to push him away at the end of the corridor another door opened and closed and there was the sound of a footsteptwo marco didnt dare look uphe had rosannas attention now and if he broke eye contact with her hed lose it no she moaned as a gasp from the direction of the door reached him he heard running footsteps no ernesto would never say that ernesto wouldnt he would and he didyoure hurting him rosanna youre holding him back angelinas voice sharp and shrill what are you doing with my shut up angelina he hissed regaining rosannas wandering attention by shaking her again get the doctor she at least had enough sense not to argue with him running feet retreated and the door slammed against the wall as witness to her hasty passage rosanna beat at his face and chest with hard bony fists her blows were wild but she got him a good one in the nose and just under the left eye marco tried not to wince ghosts feel no pain i dont believe it she was crying i dont believe you ernesto would never believe such ernesto is in purgatory do you want to be responsible for dragging him down the religion lesson having given him the barb to use on her and forced to be cruel by desperation he dug it in do you want to be the one who forces him to stay there longer if you die if you lose yourself in opium dreams rosanna thats what will happen and it will all be your fault no she shoved him away hard enough that he lost his hold on her and he lost his balance as well he hit his head on the wall with a sickening crack and saw stars he struggled against the darkness still not able to see but fighting off the dazzle and more footsteps pounded up the corridor as his eyes cleared he was shoved summarily out of the way by doctor rigannio and a wiry woman he recognized as rosannas maid a hand grabbing his elbow helped him to stand when he turned to render thanks he found himself staring into angelina dormas profoundly unhappy darkcircled eyes he froze unsure of what to say as behind him he could hear her mothers muffled sobs and the comforting murmur of her maid he stood that way for an eternity angelina reached out toward his face as if to touch his swelling nose then stopped herself she seemed at as much of a loss as he was marco he turned grateful for a chance to look away marco whatever you did it was right doctor rigannio said getting painfully to his feet while the maid held rosanna against her shoulder letting her cry herself into calmness you broke her out of her hallucination she thought i was someone she knew marco said carefully not sure how much of his background the house had been told my mother i guess and she knew that my mother is dead i guess she never got a good look at me before this i think i might have thrown her into the hallucination in the first place iim sorry i certainly didnt mean it of course you didnt the doctor said smoothly one eye on rosanna as her maid helped her to rise rosanna turned a tearstreaked face toward the sound of their voices and blinked who are you she asked voice hoarse with strain this is marco valdosta rosanna doctor rigannio interposed smoothly you remember petro told you hes going to the accademia under dorma sponsorship he is a grandson of duke delleste of ferrara the duke has made some trade agreements with us in return she turned away from her maid and looked at him with wondering eyes marco valdostayou must be lorendanas boy she had two i heard he bowed to her yes milady the mention of benito made him nervous its uncanny she said you look just like her so ive been told milady i her eyes clouded for a moment then cleared and she drew herself up taking on a dignity and poise that reminded him sharply of his grandfather and a beauty that had nothing to do with tearswollen eyes blanched cheeks and trembling hands i believe i owe you a debt of gratitude he interrupted her gently milady you owe me nothing you were ill i simply stayed with you until angelina could bring the doctor that is or will be my dutyim studying medicine after all he was amazed at himself he sounded years older and he wondered where the words were coming from they were evidently the right ones she flushed a little and lowered her gaze rosanna you should go rest the doctor prompted yes she replied vaguely yes i should forgive me as the corridor door opened and closed behind them doctor rigannio cursed savagely angelina where is she getting it he stopped then as if only now realizing that there was an outsider not of dorma standing awkwardly at his elbow privy to every word he said marco cleared his throat its none of my business doctor rigannio butthat looked like a lotos flashback to me the doctor pivoted face blank with surprise lotos flashback what in the name of god is that marco flushed and stammered if yyou take enough lotos it changes your head even if you never ttake it again you can get thrown into hallucinations by any strong stimulus he shrugged thats why a lot of jesolomarsh folk are crazy stuck in lotos dreams doctor rigannio closed his eyes and cursed again so thats whythank you marco again i trust we can rely on your discretion marco managed a feeble smile what discretion milord milady rosanna had a dizzy spell and i just stayed with her until you came nothing terrible and she certainly didnt say anything except to thank me good boy the doctor clapped him on the shoulder and he staggered a little ill go see what needs to be done that left him alone in the corridor with angelina now she wouldnt look at him youve heard enough that you might as well know all of it she said bitterly staring at the polished wooden floor twisting the hem of her shawl in white hands when father died she took it badlyshed been in love with him really in love and she couldnt bear to be without him she started taking lotos so she could see him angelina looked up finally and gestured her helplessness where was she getting it marco asked angelinas eyes blazed caesare aldanto she spatand burst into tears once again marco wound up sitting on the floor of the corridor with a lady of dorma in his armsthis one crying into his shoulder all the things she did not dare tell mother or brother about how she still loved aldantoand hated him about how her mothers manservant paulo had been the gobetween about how shed put two and two together when she realized that paulo had known exactly where to take her the first time shed met with caesarewhich could only mean hed been there many times before and that she was pregnant with caesares baby none of thisexcept for the business with rosanna and the lotoswas any surprise to marco it was pretty obvious from her intermittent hysterics that angelina was not herself and adding those frequent visits to caesare gave anybody good cause but that she thought the man was the source of the drug lord and saints he didnt know quite what to say or do so he just let her cry herself outsomething she evidently neededthen helped her to tidy herself and helped her to her feet thank you marco she said shyly a little ashamed i didnt mean thats what friends are for he told her we are friends arent we id hoped sobut after he shrugged i learned things from that whole messand it got me here didnt it he delicately declined to mention how much that fiasco had placed him in aldantos debt then we are friends she offered him her hand with a sweet smile that could still make his heart jump a little even if he wasnt in love with her anymore he took it squeezed itand they parted the dancing lessons were worse than ever even if his mind hadnt been elsewhere marco would have found the intricate precision of the steps hard to remember and follow it was odd in a way given that his memory was normally so perfect why should he have so much difficulty with this when he didnt with herbal remedies and cargo lists in the end listening to the dance masters shrill and humorless criticisms marco decided his memory was being sabotaged by itself he and chiano used to dance little jigs sometimes in the marshes without ever worrying about whether the steps were proper and correct remembering the cheerful and raucous jibes of sophia which accompanied those moments of gaiety he smiled marco shrilled the dancemaster youre not supposed to smile during this dance this dance is a very solemn marco sighed there are ways in which my old life was a lot easier chapter when marco was summoned to petro dormas office at sunset he assumed it was due to the neardisaster with rosanna in the private corridor the day before this time marco followed the servant to the top of his house with only a little trepidation he had he thought handled the whole mess fairly well the east windows framed a sky that was indigo blue spangled with tiny crystal starbeads the west held the sun dying a bloody death petro was a dark silhouette against the red marco cleared his throat you sent for me milord dorma petro did not turn around it seems he said dryly that you have fallen into the muckpit of dorma secrets doctor rigannio told me a bitgelina told me more he sighed it seems to me the older and more honorable the house the deeper and darker its closet almost as if our honor were a reaction to this he seemed to be waiting for a response every house has secrets marco replied carefully you know morenmore than a few things that neither the valdosta nor the delleste could be proud of you can trust me petro now petro turned though he was still nothing more than a sable shape to marco well i will admit i have been toying with this notion for a while buti didnt quite know how to phrase this delicately yet i also did not want you to have any deceptions about what i was going to offer angelina told you she says that shes expecting marco supplied and who the father is petro coughed we are in something of a dilemma it just isnt done for a case vecchie daughter to have anunacknowledged child yet we can hardly look to caesare aldanto as a husband it would seem best for angelina to make a marriage but frankly there wasnt anyone she wanted to confide inreally no one she truly didnt find repugnant even for a titular husband he paused significantly until today marco was considerably less of a fool than he had been half a year ago but this was still a shock you mean he gulped you mean me it would be of great benefit to dorma petro admitted frankly a marriage with valdosta would get us out of an awkward situationand not incidentally give us a chance to negotiate for a better access to ferraras steel trade his voice was wry i do have to think first of dorma as a whole before i think of angelinabut if i can benefit both marco fought for solid ground was this angelinas idea not yours petro tapped his chest i suggested it after she told me about this afternoon she seemed to welcome the idea she does like you marcoand so do i id be quite pleased to have you further tied to my house marco was floundering he could have angelina dorma the girl hed once dreamed ofand if he kept his mouth shut shed continue to blame caesare for her mothers addiction that would eventually break the hold caesare had on her heart which would please maria and maybe caesare too it would save the casa dorma from a potentially damning scandal marco could read between petros careful words finding a husband for angelina that wouldnt drag the family down was going to be hard to say nothing of expensive and he marco valdosta owed the dorma for protection as much as advancement he owed caesare he owed maria too but what about kat his heart felt like it would break delleste honor hed followed the dictates of his heart before the result had been disaster delleste honor demanded payback and he might be in love with kat yet he still had no idea if she was in love with him more than anything at that moment marco wanted to talk to kat desperately but he had no idea how to reach her before their appointment on thursday he didnt know where she livedeven her last name everything hurt he was almost gasping like a fish out of water now his mind reeling tried to find a point of solidity somewhere the only one which came was honor family honor marco had a feeling that if he saw kat again family honor might just crumble but honor demanded that he did see her didnt it milordthree things he said carefully choosing his words and somehow managing not to stammer the first isi need to think about this theres someonenever mind id like to get out of the house for a while his mind slipped into a medical track seeking comfort in the familiar for your mother ill suggest a few things that i know of to doctor rigannio but while hes trying them it might be a good idea anyway if milady rosanna wouldnt be in a position to see me petro nodded certainly i didnt expect an immediate answer but please keep in mind marriage cant wait too long marco angelinas three months pregnant already closer to four months i suspect as for the other a place away from my mother could be arrangedbut not back with aldanto did you have anything in mind wellmy friend rafael de tomaso was talking about there being a suite of rooms at a boarding house not far from zianettis he was kind of wishing he knew somebody he could trust to split it with him i think he was hinting at me hes father bellinis protege in art petro nodded again a good choice i think we can arrange that what else this was daring but caesare aldanto isnt where milady got her drugs there isnt much he hasnt done but thats not one of them he coughed a little shamed but offered the confession to balance the secrets hed stumbled on a while back i think i found out where the introit of lotos shipments was this was about two months ago this problem with your mother has been going on for some time longer than that hasnt it and caesare aldanto didnt know about the lotos sales then so i cant prove it not yet butit wasnt him so petros voice was neutral before i say anything to milady angelina i want to be able to prove to her that it wasnt caesare i want everything clean between us delleste honor he sighed i want her making her choices without any lies i messed her up with lies before i dont want to do it again if she knows the truthshe might make different choices and thats her right petro folded his arms across his chest the sky behind him deepened to blue and the first stars sprinkled across it i can respect that he said a certain warmth coming into his voice i can respect that and i can understand that of course as the head of family i can tell you that aldanto will never be acceptable to dorma and you know that i serve as one of the signori di notte since lord calentis death we know the damned lotos trade has started up again even if it was not my mother id want to know because it is i want to know badly very wellyou seek your proofs and ill see about getting you moved out of dorma so that you can have your time to think but please the wedding has to be soon thank you milord marco replied quietly and turned to go marco he stopped and turned back he could just see petros smile in the blue dusk you are part of our secrets therefore you are part of us whatever decision you make regarding a marriage to my sisterwelcome to casa dorma marco marco was in a daze after he left casa dorma now that he was no longer in the presence of petro dorma the head of the house matters of family responsibility and honor seemed less overwhelming his personal hopes and desires loomed far larger i have to talk to someone but who he considered benito but ruled him out almost immediately his younger brothers advice on this matter would be useless or even worse rafael perhaps marco needed to speak to him anyway on the subject of the lodgings but as he made his way through the narrow streets dark now that evening had fallen rafaels advice on the matter seemed less and less attractive marco couldnt help but remember that the last time hed taken rafaels advice on a matter of the heart the results had been mixed to say the least for all of rafaels selfconfidence and ease the truth was that he was still too young himself to really understand what would be the right course thoughts of rafael however triggered thoughts of chiano or dottore luciano marina as he was now chiano will have good advice marco didnt know where chiano lived but he was sure that rafael did the student would be reluctant to tell him since marco was not another strega but that he would marco had no doubt he would just have to be persuasive at the moment marco was certain he could persuade a stone to talk compared to everything else persuasion seemed the easiest task in the world chapter this has all been too easy luciano marina had worked his way back into his old life so smoothly that he was worried granted he had not attempted to reach most of his former adherents among the strega granted also he had not practiced any magic without so many protections that the air was thick with them literally still he had made some contacts carefully and a very few claudia and valentina a pair of strega entertainers whose eyes and ears were always open and who had in their turn contacts everywhere itzaak ben joseph a kabbalistic mage and goldsmith whose clients ranged from the casa vecchie to a very recent arrival at casa louise whoas luciano alone knew thanks to itzaakhad up to that moment been a popular entertainer at the house of the red cat sister evangelina and father mascoli of the order of saint hypatia who had always been friendly to the strega father palladio who taught anatomy to the students of medicine at the accademia he would very much have liked to have more trusted contacts among his fellow strega sadly though they were well intentioned they were often lamentably loose tongued that was probably why poor despini had been found floating he had said old rumor been alerted to something very evil coming to venice he had certainly made the attempt to fill in the gap in strega leadership that lucianos own disappearance had left but the first rumorthat despini had learned of something very evil with its eye on the pearl that was venice very evil as evil as that which marina had seen in his vision if so that evil had a name and it was a thing that luciano was not prepared to confront not yet the lion was stirring true and no longer in slumber but neither was it awake yetand waking it was a major and very dangerous ceremony which also required the presence of certain persons without the lion luciano could do very little against the black evil that threatened venice he shivered he hated even to think the name of that evil for fear of attracting its attention he had not moved back into his former set of rooms in the complex of buildings that loosely comprised the accademia for one thing they were already occupied by someone else for another moving back into them would be like issuing a challenge instead luciano marinausing his true name since he saw no reason not to being as he was assumed to be deadhad taken this little furnished room comfortable enough with the advantage of having a back door even the landlord didnt know about a door that had been paneled over until luciano divined its presence and surreptitiously restored it it let out into a private courtyard but if luciano had to escape some night he wasnt going to be too particular about whose sensibilities he offended at the time this sort of arrangement of doors and windows being paneled over happened all the time when men of wealth fell on hard times and had to sell or lease their former manors which then were carved up into individual dwellings it had even happened to casa vecchie families even casa longi poor little katerina the fortunes of the montescues had not prospered in the time hed been gone although there was a part of that which could be laid at the old mans door wasting endless amounts of money on that stupid attempt to destroy casa valdosta root and branch old fool but luciano now huddled over his brazier as the evening mists crept in and the air grew cold and damp did not have a great deal of time or pity to waste on his former pupil and her family he was collecting information and he needed as much of it as he could gather as fast as he could bring it in he had questions but there was one thing that he had no doubt of the hand of true evil was stretched towards venice and it had at least one finger firmly planted within the city finger call it a claw a talon who for a start who was the nun with the dead eyes if there was a vessel for that talon it was surely her but who was she to what order did she belong the servants of the trinity if that was so then how could such a creature have gotten into the ranks of those most fully dedicated to fighting it at all costs how could they possibly miss the signs of such evil what what was the monster he had seen in the scryingmirror the thing that was surely a servant of the great evil if not another vessel for itthe monster that was killing in such a horrible manner the monster that could seemingly reach anyone anywhere why what was the ultimate plan here luciano was quite certain by now that the great evil lurking behind these machinations took the form of the grand duke of lithuania but why was the duke so interested in venice at a glance there seemed no logic to it and a very very urgent questionwhen there would be an attack on the city of that luciano was now also certain sowhen who would be the major players his vision had shown him some of those players lucrezia brunelli and her brother ricardo the nun another churchman who was certainly wearing the cassock of the servants of the trinity another question just how many plots were there building to a climax and how many of them were interwoven what he had seen washe thoughtthe sources of danger to venice which since these things were of necessity biased towards the attitude of the seeker meant venice as he knew it now lucrezia and ricardo could together or separately have plans for venice involving alliances outside the borders of the citystate that would certainly destroy the fabric of the city as he knew it but did that mean they were allied to the great evil and if they were did they know it the sots well the sots and presumably the knots fanatical paulines as they were would be only too happy to purge the city with fire and the sword of anything that was not of their own rigidly defined christian path that would certainly destroy venice but that did not mean they were allied with the great evil ah but one did not need to be allied with or a part of something to serve it what could he do well he could at the least move to protect a few people who had no protections of their own little kat for instance he had once held that hypatian medal of hers in his own two hands and that once was enough for him to invest it with far more power than the mere wardings it contained now that he knew the reality of it in his city he could do something specific but first his protections he moved his bits of furniture against the wall picked up the ruga sadly worn import from persiaand flipped it over no one but another mage would ever have guessed what hed had bonded onto the back of this old rug a pentagram within a protective circle formed of bitumen mixed with blessed saltcourtesy of sister evangelinaand the pulverized dust of pearls and gemstones frankincense myrrhgum ambergris copal resin and cinnabar a coating of artists varnish sealed it and allowed it to be painted over with the appropriate symbols then sealed again before he went to work luciano went over the entire diagram with his nose mere inches from the painted cloth looking for cracks and flaws today there were none had there been any he would have immediately repaired them never mind that the energies were supposed to be able to flow across any such defects in these circumstances he dared not take any chances once he was done he blew out all the lanterns in his room but one set up his tiny altar in the middle of the pentacle then blew out that final lamp before feeling his way to the altar he lit a single candle on the altar with a spark of magic he cast his circle three times three with each elementsalt for earth incense for air a candleflame for fire and water then he traced it again three times three with his ritual white dagger made not of human bone as the paulines claimed but the leg bone of a fine buckdeer and again three times three with the black dagger carved of obsidianglass from the heart of a volcano when he was done a faintly glowing border followed the outermost line of his circle he took up the bowl of water and whispered a blessing over it then held it up to the east guardian of the spirits of the water guardian of the creatures of the water i summon thee from thy dwelling place in the uttermost east to stand as watchtower to witness my rites and guard my work as he flicked a single drop of water towards the east a pillar of blue light sprang up out of nowhere reaching from floor to ceiling as if it was some arcane support pillar he turned to his right to the west and took up the candle guardian of the spirits of fire guardian of the creatures of fire i summon thee when his invocations were complete four tall pillars of lightblue red green and yellowstood within his glowing circle which was now a glowing floortoceiling wall stretching in a curve along the curve of the painted circle on the rug but his protections were not yet complete for now he would do what no christian mage ever dared he would invoke his deity the goddess not the godhe had a sense that the monster he had seen might once have been linked in to some northern deityodin perhaps or thor it might be impolitic to invoke the lord at the moment let him decide whether or not to act on his own there was no point in trying to force his hand he faced the altar with the triplemoon sculpture of hammered bronze and the ancient cretan axe that was also her symbol lady of the night lady of the moon you who have been isis astarte tiamet diana artemis aphrodite rhiannon inana i call and invoke thee to witness my work and guard my rituals he didnt necessarily expect a response you could invoke all you wanted but whether or not she chose to bless you with her presence was up to her but this time this time with no warning at all the inside of his circle was flooded with powerful silvery light the lady of the moon not only approved but she was minded to take a hand thank you he whispered feeling much humbled and bent over his scrying bowl he had to find kat then he had to fence her in with a subtle web of power that would cut any thricedamned odincreature to ribbons before it even knew the protections were there and thenwell he would see what occurred to him he was startled by a knock on the door he wasnt expecting any visitors at all but since the knock had consisted of the special signal hed told his few confidants to usetwo short two long three short one longhe went to the door and opened it immediately he was more than startled to see marco standing there how rafael told me said marco the boys face seemed full of suppressed anguish please chianoi have to talk to you after luciano heard what marco had to say he rubbed his face wearily is happiness so much to ask for he murmured but he did not dwell on the matter he had asked the goddess that question many times in his life he would ask it no longer no more softness marco he said quietly venice is in the gravest danger at such a time you must think of your responsibilities you dont even know this canalergirls surname you know nothing about her familyor even to be honest she herself marcos face was set in a stubborn cast luciano sighed speak to the girl if you must before you make your final decision but i will tell you this boy i can think of nothing you could do which would strengthen venice more than to weld valdosta rebornand dellesteto the house of dorma except a marriage between valdosta and montescue came the whimsical thought but marina dismissed the notion as a ridiculous fancy lodovico montescue would disrupt any such wedding by having the groom assassinated as he walked to the altar the valdosta name which is still a powerful thing would give weight to petro dormas position and as im sure youve come to realize yourself hes the best of the lot potentially the leadership which venice will needdoes need already marco hung his head he was listening at least marina started to add more but decided not to do so anything more at this point would be counterproductive marco valdosta had a fierce sense of honor give the boy time and he would make the right decision ive got to talk to kat he whispered when he lifted his head his eyes were blurred with tears the sight was heartbreaking talk to her then said luciano but please marcoremember your responsibilities it was time to change the subject so when are you being officially presented to the city marco smiled wanly tomorrow night at the doges levee splendid i think id rather go anywhere else muttered marco even the jesolo chapter kat was whistling a terrible ungenteel habit as alessandra told her frequently right now the thought of that made her want to whistle louder she wanted to practice being ungenteel and besides happiness was bubbling up in her her joy seemed to be affecting everything the last cargo had come through perfectly the montescues tiny share as part of a colleganza of a wood shipment to alexandria had paid off handsomely the merchant having come up with a return cargo of ivory which had caught the current fashion for marquetry just in the upswing it had made them a tidy profit not enough to tow the casa montescue out of the river tick but enough to make it seem as if there mighteventuallybe a light on the horizon and shed be seeing marco again on thursday she hugged herself two days she should have made it sooner but well she didnt want it to appear too much as if she was chasing him even the thought of tonights levee at the doges palace could not upset her if senor lopez was there and wanted to talk to her well he had no real evidence mind you even the thought of that eagle gaze was enough to put a damper on her mood he wasnt the sort who needed evidence she shook off the thought and took her mind back to marco felluci it wasnt hard and the thoughts were pleasant as she waited for madelena to come down and help her dress for the levee a levee at the doges palace marco was so nervous he could hardly think straight all the haut monde of venice would be there case vecchie rising merchant houses distinguished foreign visitors ambassadors and nobility all the power and glitter of venice marco had looked across the piazza past the winged lion of saint mark at the colonnaded gothic palace often but to be inside the inside was a place of confusion light and above all people musiciansno mean performers eitherplayed in a side salon nobody kept quiet for them however people simply continued their light inconsequential chatter and laughter if anyone had dared treat valentina and claudias music thus marco was introduced to yet another case vecchie family head he bowed politely for the hed lost count no wonder the case vecchie went slumming at barduccis valdosta eh said the florid count antonelli thats one of the old names we havent heard for a while where have you been boy with his grandfather duke delleste interposed petro dorma smoothly the count nodded so boywhich way is ferrara leaning venice milan or rome yes these were worrying times ferrara had for the better part of century stood by venice but keeping its independence then the venetians had demanded the salt pans and ferrara had balked and called on romeand even for a time threatened alliance with milan who for its part had sent no less of a condottiere than carlo sforza to pay a friendly visit to ferrara a visit to which marco suspected he ultimately owed his brother it had all blown over eventually but by the presence of that sword in the casa dorma the storm was brewing again marco was not prepared for the direct question for the simplest reason he had no idea what the old duke was planning to do my grandfather keeps his own council milord yes but i see the majordomo is beckoning to us count antonelli interrupted petro pardon us i must find my sister and take my new ward to be presented to the doge petro steered marco away across the salon to where angelina was talking to a tall beautifully made up woman with a neat little mole above her rosebud mouth standing in the circle that surrounded lucrezia brunelli they were laughing the woman gave marco a very considering look as petro snagged his sister and led them off to meet doge foscari kat was preparing herself for the sheer delight of giving signor sergio della galbo the finest putdown of his obnoxious life the fat curti had cornered her again but knowing how her grandfather felt and having met her soulmate katerina montescue was going to tell this disgusting old roue where to get off in training for a life as katerina felluci she was going to use some choice canaler terms shed picked up from maria and then her grandfather came storming up towing alessandra his lined face was as pale as his snowy linen his eyes bulged alessandra was looking terrified and wasnt even protesting come was all the old man said very quietly della galbo protested get lost worm snapped kat pushing past him to her grandfather she slid an arm around the old man what is wrong grandpapa she asked worried the last time she seen him like this was when theyd brought the news of alessandras babys death normally if he was angry the whole countryside knew about it valdosta he spat the name out as if it were a curse theyre not all dead girl i told you some of the vermin still survived but i never thought id see them here bold as brass under the protection of casa dorma he pointed she was glad she had her arm around the solid if elderly stanchion of her grandfather walking head bent forward in the listening pose she knew so well had studied so lovingly was marco felluci he was listening to petro dorma and that horrible spoiled brat angelina dorma marco was not wearing ventuccio livery or old canaler clothes he was dressed in a silk shirt and fine hose with a cloak that could have bought marias gondola there was gold on his finger whowho is that she asked in a small wooden voice feeling stupid stunned her world in chaos her grandfather hissed like a leaky kettle calls himself marco valdosta they claim hes been in ferrara with the delleste thats another valdosta lie im quite sure hes the same one i tried to have assassinated here in venice last yearand failed im sorry to say for a moment kat thought she might faint now come growled lodovico were going home kat sat on her bed she had neither the will nor it seemed the ability to do more than stare at the wall madelena had fussed her charge into a nightgown gently and quietly this once seeing katerina behaving like some porcelain doll obedient but mechanical and silent even alessandra coming in to her room didnt excite any reaction madelena crossed herself alessandra was big with excitement well what a scene i thought the old fool was going to drop dead on us that valdostas not bad looking is he although i prefer more rugged men myself still that angelina dorma seems pleased enough with her catch what alessandra prattled on they say shes getting married to the valdosta boy lucrezia said it has to be pretty soon because shes already carrying his baby the roaring in katerinas ears refused to be stilled even alessandra noticed whats wrong nothing lead was lighter i feel sick are you pregnant said alessandra eager for more fuel this was enough to penetrate kats armor of confusion and misery no she snapped but if i left it to you half the town would say i was and ill bet all this gossip is just as true as my pregnancy alessandra shrugged and turned her shoulder she sniffed and i suppose grandfather isnt talking about finding a decent assassin to get rid of the brat be real alessandra said katerina a terrible sinking feeling in her gut he could he hated the valdosta name bitterly like we need to open warfare with dorma or even duke delleste alessandra shrugged an elegant shoulder i suggested he hire aldanto he could do it quietly caesare ha he knows mar valdosta too well a curious mix of fear and misery betrayed kat into speaking before she thought alessandra pounced on her and how do you know caesare aldanto you keep away from him katerina she laughed a humorless bitter sound hes too strong a meat for you alessandra turned and walked out with a parting snort it took kat a few minutes of mulling to suddenly wonder how did her sisterinlawmarried at seventeen from a cloistered background into a sheltered and restrictive case vecchie familyknow someone like caesare aldanto at all sleep was not going to come tonight she got up and put on a dressing gown and went up to her grandfathers study he was sitting there staring at his tallies he wasnt looking just staring he didnt even see her come in she had to put an arm around his shoulder before he noticed her he sighed ah katerina cara mia i had begun to see some small hope from the casa montescue a future for you a dowry he sighed again now valdosta she hugged the hunched shoulders grandpapa i know they are our enemy but ive never asked why he snorted never wanted to make me angry by even mentioning the name is what you mean he rubbed his face wearily the two houses were once allieseven friends we go back far into the history of the venice lucianothat was luciano valdostahe used to joke that it was a valdosta and montescue that witnessed the meeting between saint mark and the winged lion he said the montescue was busy stealing saint marks fish and the valdosta not to be outdone was stealing the whole boat luciano and me we were like that the old man twisted his fingers over each other people used to say luci and lodohere comes trouble lodovico montescue sighed it wasnt really like that i used to get us into trouble and luciano would get us out he was a good man deep down not like his son fabio the old face was contorted into a scowl luciano would have married my sister your greataunt fiorenza but he got involved with the montagnards from milan he and i had a fight the first time ever its a long story but then he married viviana and there was bad blood between us and the two houses didnt speak but i missed him truth to tell there wasnt a day when i didnt think id been stupid i even sent a message over once it came back torn up then when luciano was killed in a freak accident over at the boatyard i went to the funeral to pay my respects to a man i loved and that little pig fabio screamed at me and denounced me for killing his father right there in the church he swore revenge i was angry true butout of respect for the church and for lucianoi didnt throttle him right there i should have he paid us back with black magic you can put the death of your mother your aunt rosa your brother and even my grandson down to him even a baby at his door he fled to ferrara with that silly foreignborn wife of his before i could take action the signori di notte and the doge claimed it was plague but i didnt believe it for a moment then fabio got himself killed in a fight with some mercenary but that wife of his continued the vendetta when she came back here im sure of it very low she was then thinking she could get away with her montagnard activities by pretending to be a mere shopkeeper she and her montagnard friends organized against our house im sure theyre responsible for your fathers disappearance even as angry as kat was at anything remotely valdosta her grandfathers theories seemed well insane he sighed ruffled her hair i suppose it all sounds insane and perhaps it is at least thats whatah a good friend of mine tells me she may well be right but if ive given up the vendettanot that we could afford one against delleste as well as valdosta anywayi havent given up my sentiments now be off to bed minx kat went but not to sleep before dawn she dressed in her canalgoing clothes and hooded cloak and went out i missed you at the levee tonight yawned francesca tying up her robe as she led kat into the salon the courtesan glanced at the window still covered with curtains the sun was just beginning to rise and its light filtered through the expensive cloth bathed the room in a soft velvety glow or last night i suppose i should say i just got home myself and was about to go to bed the courtesan examined kats clothing and grinned sleepily congratulations by the way how in the world did you manage to talk your way into casa louise dressed like that abashed now that she was actually inside francescas apartment kat glanced uneasily at the door to francescas bedroom the door was open francescas grin widened and became less sleepy relax i dont usually entertain my clients here any longer except manfred of course since i refuse to smuggle myself past that gaggle of knights at the embassy and one other who wants to keep our liaison a secret from his closest relative kat tried to find the right words then when she couldnt find any words at all burst into tears francescas grin vanished come come little one she crooned folding kat into an embrace the way a mother or a big sister might it cant be that bad yes it can wailed kat and proceeded in the ensuing time of babbled words to prove her point or try to at least by the time she was done francesca was standing at the window looking at the canal below through a curtain she had drawn partly aside with a finger you could probably nip it in the bud you know the courtesan mused this budding marriage between casa dorma and casa valdosta i mean she removed her finger allowing the curtain to sway back into place and cocked her head toward kat i heard the rumors myself last night a marriage of convenience driven partly by politics and partly by the crude fact that angelina dorma is pregnant nothing more than that nothing more choked kat its still a marriage francesca and she choked again then in a whisper pregnant by marco francesca shrugged that seems to be the assumption myself i wouldnt that bastard shrilled kat that katerina the sharpness in francescas tone jolted her yes the courtesan was frowning before you get too carried away with your own selfrighteousness a question did you ever tell this young man exactly who you were kats face closed down no why not after a moment between tight lips because francesca chuckled dryly ah right because oh you venetian case vecchie how quick you are to condemn others for your own sins kat couldnt meet that sarcastic gaze my grandfather she whispered trying to summon up a protest your grandfather mimicked francesca and you think marco valdosta isnt also thinking of a grandfather a grandfather in a desperate position of his own you know which an alliance with casa dorma in venice would go a long way toward improving but kat was in no mood to be calm and objective much less charitable its because shes pregnant she hissed that bastard telling mewhile he waswith her go home kat said francesca wearily im tired and you are obviously not willing to think if you were you might realize im not listening to any more snapped kat jumping to her feet i hate him she rushed for the entrance dont slam the door on your kat slammed the door on the way out ugo boldonis poor little church was thinly attended for lauds it was not hard for him to spot an extra person in a hooded cloak who waited until his early morning parishioners had left he went back into the church where katerina was waiting and now katerina he asked the whitefaced young woman who was standing chewing her lip looking at the ground katerina halfmumbled the next words ugo youre the only priest that ive known since we were both children i need to find something out i need to find out if someone is getting married father boldoni shrugged the banns will be read kat shook her head i need to know now i need to know is marco valdosta marrying angelina dorma not in my parish oh kat took another deep breath well can you find out for me please i need to know now please ugo took pity on her as it happens i was at the palace of the metropolitan only yesterday having a meeting about witchcraftwith senor eneko lopez as it happens that basque priest who seems to terrify everyone he chuckled dryly ill admit he somehow manages to be simultaneously one of the most frightening and inspiring men ive ever met in the course of it lord petro dorma did come in to make some enquiries about the marriage of his sister soon to whom and and theyre getting married in a hurry wwhy she faltered ugo shrugged again i am the priest of a poor parish they didnt confide in me but i imagine for the usual reasons katerina is she a friend of yours then the thought struck him oris he i thought the valdosta name was bad word with the casa montescue i hate both of them said kat between clenched teeth and stormed out not even genuflecting to the altar as she left before kat went back to her bed there was one last job to do she stopped at giaccomos and left a brief note before going home her chin was held high chapter marco sat patiently well impatiently kat had always been on time unlike angelina hed only been a couple of weeks in casa dorma and her attitude to time was already grating him almost everything was held up slightly for angelina shed be late for her own funeral kathe got the feelingwouldnt ever be late without reason so marco sat and sipped his wine making it last and kat just never showed he waited he had to talk to her petro was doing his best not to be impatient but well the days of angelinas pregnancy were ticking past you could claim a sixmonth child but not less than that it was quarter to twelve and marco was about to abandon hope when maria came in marco had dressed down for the occasion but still his appearance caused maria to snorthalf derision half admiration mighty smart mighty fine she said dryly wheres the young girl sitting on your knee marco valdosta marco blushed i was waiting for kat but not to sit down on my knee i i have to talk to her maria smiled well she sent you a note which is why im here instead of in my bed see themthosereading lessons are paying off i can manage your name at least i just picked it up at giaccomos figured youd be here tonight of course hed known he could rely on kat and to send him a note to explain was just like her a world apart from angelina angelina only seemed good at thinking of herself no worries about that with kat maria could see worries were weighing on the boy but he lightened up with that scroll kat was good for him and they were both case vecchie now funny it did far more than a years living with caesare had done to convince maria that nobles were just human too because if she had it right marcos blood ought to be blue shed seen it it was definitely just ordinary red maria watched as marco cracked the wafer unrolled the scroll and she watched his face change marco had a very open face first surprise then hurt and then his face closed down he rolled the scroll up again and stood up im probably getting married in the next few days he said abruptly maria felt as if her eyes would pop out what to kat to angelina dorma his voice was expressionless maria floundered but but those dorma bastards wanted to lock him in well she owed kat thats far too soon marco she said firmly her mind raced shed have to get benito in on this the damn scamp didnt approve of kat for some stupid reason but anythinganythingwas better than angelina even if she had to tell benito that kat was also case vecchie hed been pestering her to reveal the identity of her posh friend i cant shes nearly four months pregnant said marco woodenly maria caught her jaw ah whos the father she croaked marco paused looked her straight in the eye i am he said in a dead level voice and he turned and walked out petro dorma looked grim im sorry marco only the signori di notte knew until an hour before that means somehow someone must have bought one of them but the badoero were gone marco felt flattened caesares ploy hadnt worked caesare had been sure if petro could arrest the badoero theyd confess quickly enough to tell just whom the real gobetween was he had ascribed angelinas accusation to spite of course paulo knew the way here he was ernesto dormas confidential runner i did some business with ernesto commercial information valuable if not glamorous and for heavens sake yes marry angelina dorma hed said his words were fresh in marcos mind petro sighed well were no closer marco we still dont know how my mother got the stuffeven if we know where she used to you dont feel you could just marry angelina now said marco quietly yes petro breathed a sigh of relief well thank you marco i cant deny i am pleased she always was fathers favorite we lost my other sister in the plague and gelina got rather spoiled by mother too after that shes used to getting her own way but well shell be handsomely dowered and well be happy to have you as part of the family he smiled dorma is not as old as valdosta but were prosperous and well i predict that the republic is going to have a rough time in the next few years the doge is old the succession is not as clear cut as ricardo brunelli imagines it is he patted marco on the shoulder i trust you marco i trust that delleste honor i trust the name valdosta too it was a proud one in my fathers time id rather have it with dorma than against us and many of the longi case vecchie will rally to it marco had never thought of his name as a political point never rich though he said quietly oh not lately but the family used to work with another casathe montescuein my grandfathers time organizing colleganzas i can still remember my grandfather cursing them and saying it seemed like they could do nothing wrong like the shadow of the lion was on them anyway to practical details ive spoken to the metropolitan he has agreed to let pass with just one reading of the banns the wedding itself will be something of a political affair marco i want it clear in a lot of minds that the valdosta are under the protection of the casa dorma so the guest list will not be friends in fact some of them may have had a hand in your mothers death he paused took a turn around the table took a deep breath your sudden reappearance has started just a little buzz about witchcraft i need to squash that would you be prepared to take a test of faith from father sachs of the servants of the holy trinity before the service marco nodded he was after all no heretic and knew no reason to fear except knowing that sophia and luciano used strega magic in their healing and that some of the herbs hed dealt in were blessed even the frightening pauline monks could find no real stain on his soul surely like this wedding it was nothing to be afraid of dorma studied him for a moment the sooner we can do this wedding the better marco ive already quietly cleared the way if you are certain marco shrugged he could hear a little voice somewhere inside shrieking at himtoo fast too fast you havent even talked to katbut he ignored it resolutely kats letter had been harsh and angry yes im certain his voice sounded hollow do it tomorrow if you wish again dorma heaved a sigh of relief then shook his head and smiled thatd be a bit rushed marco how about the day after tomorrow when marco nodded his head even his head felt hollow you seen kat benito knew marias work patterns well enough to know shed deliberately waited around to speak to him this morning he shook his head not in a while since that night at zianettis she keeps herself to herself does that kat maria sighed i need to talk to her even if caesare says to leave her alone curiosity and protective instinct rose in benito hed promised caesare what about nothing to do with you maria snapped she paused looking uncomfortable well i guess he is your brother benito had it now marcos getting married has nothing to do with kat maria its its case vecchie stuff they dont marry for love its all for politics and money caesare explained kats shes trouble a canal girl marco cant he doesnt have that choice and oh hell dont cry maria maria sniffed determinedly you dont know everything benito valdosta more like you know very little benito handed over an embroidered handkerchief that had belonged to a case vecchie lady only yesterday you had to keep your hand in even if you werent going to make a regular thing of the snatch he offered a cautious pat and was rewarded by a roundhouse swing she was feeling better si i dont like it much either maria but dorma will look after marco and i dont know where to look for kat maria shook her head ive been to her house twice the first time i left a note under the waterdoor benito cleared his throat unsure what to say hed been helping her with her reading and writing now that marco had moved out maria wasnt stupid but like most womenexcept courtesansshe was illiterate she could tally like anything but her writing was still limited to her name and a few words i kept it simple she snapped but she didnt come so i went around the old man said she wasnt there i was kind of hoping youd seen her or might know where else to look ive got to talk to her before marco goes offidiotand gets married benito shook his head ill keep an eye out for her but its too late maria its as good as done i wondered if i should have gone but marco said stay away hes having the test of faith before the wedding tomorrowan he didnt want me around besides he said it wasnt like it was going to be a real marriage or anything maria looked stormy you should have stopped him benito you could have stopped him benito felt uncomfortable that had been his first irrational reaction but hed talked it over with caesare you dont understand maria lifted her square chin i do understand benito valdosta maybe you will one day she turned and left slamming the door behind her caesare when he came down a few minutes later was in a far better mood i had word last night that the job you pulled for me getting that door open over at the accademia has paid off handsomely first time ive ever been paid by two separate parties for the same job youll need to do a spot of running for me this evening i cant really go to either place but therell be a bit of coin in it for you benito benito grinned that was a piece of cake cloister doorlocks arent much caesare shook his head forget you were ever there dont make a noise about how you got that coin when you spend it benito nodded actually im not going to spend it im going to invest it this brought a snort of amusement from caesare spoken like a true veneze and what great venture are you becoming an investor in secondhand scarf business nah said benito a couple of us over at ventuccio we wanted to get in with a colleganza for the galley convoy weve got an insider hot tip silver is right up in outremer right now we can make a killing you want in milord caesare laughed a killing no boy i dont think ill put money on that convoy its a greatgalley convoy safe as houses come on caesare youve got real money we unsll get a tiny share that hooded look came over caesare no uncomfortable now benito decided to change the subject ive been thinking he said looking at the stack of three bright ducats on the table his reward for the two collection runs well done i should put two o these into the housekeeping maria managed the finances of the house and benito had heard her swearing about them enough lately caesare shook his head and pushed the ducats toward him put them in your pocket you just keep your mouth shut about this windfall benito you dont even tell maria ill sort out housekeeping benito nodded still it was enough to get him thinking about his two shadowy pickups both in the same part of town and both unless one of caesares male clients had an odd taste in scent female one had been using a nuns habit for disguise he totally failed to see the other but hed smelt her chapter im terrified of weddings erik said manfred grumpily you catch deadly diseases at them and with sachs there i wont be able to do the good part you know get drunk afterwards erik snorted he had to wear full armor for the occasion again that worried him more than a mere wedding ceremony what deadly disease matrimony you can die of boredom ive been told erik snorted again i am going to save that up and tell your wife and then you are going to be in trouble deep trouble manfred he asked for us specifically it is that venetian grandee dorma whom we helped with the dandelos his sister is getting married its a compliment sachs is delighted manfred traced the outline of the caryatid on eriks bedpost so were going erik i sent a private message off to my uncle yesterday i asked von stemitz to take it with him on his trip to mainz whatever sachs and the knightbishops are doing keeping the knights of the trinity in venice it isnt in the emperors interest the last thing charles fredrik wants is to be involved in a civil war down here in italy no matter what these montagnardpauline fanatics think about one holy roman emperor over all the christian world we have the aquitaines on our western flank the damned grand duke of lithuania on our northeastern flank and the king of hungary on the southeasternwith both of them creeping down into the black sea we need trouble to the south in italy like we need a hole in the head he should know about the situation here erik nodded hiding a grin francescas influence was considerable she plainly enjoyed this game of politics and manfred too lazy and too obstinate to do it when driven was letting his private parts lead him into this perhaps charles fredrik should hire her as an instructor of heirs yes the knights are supposed to be independent soldiers of christ defenders of christendom but theyre perceived by manymost probablyto be the arm militant of the empire not the church and i get the feeling that the reality is the other way around theyre trying to use the empire as the political arm of their faction of the church some of the leaders of the knights anywayalong with the servants i dont doubt manfred nodded in turn power games charles fredrik needs to rein them in erik could almost see him taking it down in his mind hed bet hed repeat it to francesca within the next few days erik sighed quietly it was all very well eriks father telling him to stay out of politics your loyalty is to the godar hohenstauffen boy let them enjoy their wrangles if manfred was going to survive he had to understand these wrangles as much as he had to understand swordplay so erik poked him in the ribs what are you lolling around for we have to be at the church for the test of faith before this wedding weve got barely an hour before abbot sachs is going to be squalling for his escort manfred stood up easy on those ribs between you and the hammering they take from giuliano at the salle darmes of his im too tender for francesca to appreciate me erik began hauling out the quilted underclothes for their armor well suited to armor ill suited to venetian summer and were no closer to finding out whether he had anything to do with killing father belgio yet he grumbled more brightly but my rapierwork is coming on yes giuliano said you were better than a blind drunken cow with a rapier handle up its butt but only just manfred retreated grinning out of the door bellowing for eriks squireorderly as he went he left erik to his preparations and reflections giuliano insulted them both copiously but he had rapidly moved them under his own personal tuition very few attained that and while manfreds weapons of choice would always be dictated by his strength they were both picking up techniques techniques that could kill armored broadswordwielding knights lessons that should be part of their armory of skills it was high time the knights of the holy trinity stopped playing religious politics and moved into the real world politics and religion marco looked at the assembled people in the chapel they were a cross section of the powers of venice not weddingguests in the normal sense of the term everyone who was anyone was there the doge had graced the occasion with his elderly presence ricardo brunelli and his legendarily beautiful sister lucrezia were there too the head of the ventucciowho looked at marco as if hed never seen him before other case vecchie hed really never seen before making their appearance coming to examine the valdosta and plenty of nonvenetian folk too the peacocky condottiere aldo frescata the head of the milanese trade delegation francesco aleri marco looked him over very very carefully yes he was the man theyd seen at the mouth of the alleyway the man maria said had taken her prisoner who was in cahoots with the casa dandelo who was probably the director of the montagnard spies and assassins maybe even the man whod had mama killed they greeted each other with urbane politeness and every appearance of disinterest it left him feeling a bit sick and unconsciously putting his hand onto the hilt of his rapier petro dorma was making sure that the whole of the power of veniceof the entire regionsaw marco knew that he had the doges blessing and also that he had passed this test of faith the servants of the holy trinity too were glorying in this display of power a nun and several grayclad monks were doing the slow rounds sprinkling holy water chanting psalms the air was heavy with holy incense bishop capuletti resplendent in his robes there to conduct the wedding ceremony later looked faintly putout then the bells began their solemn tolling and the chapel was hushed in the front of the chapel the abbot had the chalice the bread sword and bible arrayed obedient to the nudge from petro marco walked forward the monks began their chanting plainsong both fear and misery suddenly knotted his stomach by the poisonous look that the abbot had given him he clearly thought marco ought to fail and even if he didnt he was going to be married to angelina he should make best of it oh kat if he even began to know where to find her hed spent the morning in futile wandering asking around being treated with case vecchie respect hed spotted harrow in the distance but even attempting to reach him to ask him had failed too late now he bit his lip and walked up and knelt before the altar petro dorma breathed a sigh of relief he was fond of angelina but he was no fool she was trouble the last thing hed ever expected was for her to catch someone who would be of value to dorma a nobleman short of money perhaps almost certainly someone who would be a liability to dormalike caesare aldanto marco valdosta was an innocent and in some ways petro felt almost guilty about catching him this way but he had to look after angelina the boy had no idea just how much the name valdosta counted for among the older case vecchie and among the populace perhaps even more so the valdosta family was old true marcos father had been a wild young man who married an outoftown ferrarese woman too involved in politics for her own good but luciano the paternal grandfather had been enormously popular and the delleste connection the old fox might be in trouble right now with venice rome and milan all wanting his steel works but he was a cunning old man ferrara might just hold its own the republics council of ten as petro had reason to know were warming again towards their onetime ally alliances changed and the old fox knew that dormas shipyards needed good steel and the delleste could use an accommodation with the republic to ship to the east again if ferrara survived the gathering condottieri and internal factions well then marco would be rich and powerful even if the boy were not old case vecchie dorma would have welcomed the alliance petro just hoped angelina wouldnt drive marco mad with indiscreet expensivetohush affairs petro sighed again his duty as her brother would be to help out he settled back in the pew and watched the ceremony unlike marco he had no qualms about the test of faith the boys goodness was patently obvious hed bet the lad had not a hint of a stain on his soul unlike himself when it was over he got up and went to collect angelina to his relief and amazement she was ready marco knew his normally excellent memory was having trouble he was married standing accepting congratulations from the powersthatbe from lucrezia brunelli herself my but angelina caught herself a handsome one cooed the legendary beauty taking his hands in hers she tickled his palm with one of her fingers you look almost familiar have i met you before marco swallowed not all the lessons in etiquette had taught him how to deal with this yeah i met you on the back stairs of casa brunelli with you in a fury because youd failed to seduce senor lopez was not the right thing to say no mlady she laughed come now marco were going to be friends arent we call me lucrezia then she continuedin an entirely different tone well i wish you a happy married life you and dear angelina bishop capuletti who had just approached them looked like he might consider making that a very short life if he had the opportunity part vi june ad chapter it was about a month after the wedding before maria finally got a chance to see kat the arsenal was working flat out it was always like that anyway this time of year the convoy for the golden horn would leave in a week and the lastminute outfitting was still going on now with a war looming there was additional work getting the navys galleys ready a couple of cousins waved to maria as she rowed in with the load of brass nails from seinos maria we need a piece of trompe loiel work for the admirals cabin fetched from the botega giorgione said the foreman when shed offloaded he pulled a sour face the admiral sent it back because of the cherubs so theyve held it back to the last minute theyre not punishing admiral niccolo theyre punishing us but do you think they can see that great that meant into town again well shed see if she could fit a trip to giaccomos into her rounds they said trade was tight in venice lately because of the political situation and you could see signs of it but not right now she felt she was being run off her feet or more like rowed off her shoulders consider it done paulo he patted her shoulder we trust you garavelli yeah they trusted her the boatyard work was reliable but for real money she still relied on giaccomo and the trouble with the squeeze on trade on the po the vinland trade and genoa trying to muscle venice everyone was poorer and everything was more expensive which didnt worry those who had a lot coming in the trouble wassince shed been living with caesare shed gotten used to those little luxuries like sleeping warm and dry but they seemed so short of money especially with marco not putting in anymore caesare seemed really tight she was in a brown study about it as she sculled along to giaccomos it took her a good moment to realize the psst from the gondola resting against the poles was addressed at her it was kat she looked drawn and miserable been lookin for you for days said maria i went to the mainland kat replied dully we still own a small farm there its mortgaged to the hilt so we cant sell it and then giuseppe didnt give me your note until madelena decided it might stop me crying into your breakfast finished maria kat didnt look like shed eaten or slept much in the last ten days kat nodded maria snorted she must have been pretty desperate kat shrugged she always told me men were like that i didnt believe her there was a time for sympathy there was also a time for no mercy this decided maria was the latter like what false spat kat cheating lying and false making up to becoming engaged to someone when they say theyre not even involved with anyone not even seeing anyone maria shook her head i dont know what maggot youve got in your head the only other woman young marco has seen in the last three months is me unless you are talking about women he passed in the street and he hasnt made up to me thats for damned sure so how come he suddenly married angelina dorma demanded kat savagely just suddenly huh maria shrugged because shes more than three months pregnant kat stood there gawping like a carp abruptly out of water eventually she managed a small oh yes oh marco is so good it almost shines out of him hes done this because he felt it was the right thing to do i wanted you to help me to talk him out of it thats why i tried so hard to get hold of you he doesnt love her and never did he had a shes a gorgeous case vecchie girl crush on her she didnt even know he was case vecchie shes a tramp but well its too late now are you sure about it all about the baby maria nodded hes a terrible liar he might lie to save someone else pain but not himself and he told me straight out im sorry kat now it was time for comforting maria hitched the gondola and climbed over and held kat for some time the chiming of bells suddenly started maria back into a realization of her duties hell ive got to move im supposed to have that picture back there for them as soon as possible look you must go and see benito talk to him confirm what i said you can find him outside ventuccios just after lunch ive got to go lunchtime for runners saw benito draped in his usual spot over the lower railing of the ventuccio stairs absorbing lunch and sunlight at the same time he was blind and deaf to the traffic into ventuccio behind him intent as he was on his study of the canal below until an elegantlybooted foot nudged his leg hey kid drawled a smooth voice rich with amusement hows the trade benito looked up sharply from his afternoon perusal of the traffic and stared his mouth full of bread he knew that voice wiry and thin dark hair falling in a mass of curls to below his shoulders mercutio laivetti leaned elegantly on the walkway rail beside him grinning looking very like a younger darker shorter version of caesare aldanto benito took in the slightly exotic cut of his clothing the wellworn hilt of his rapier the sundarkened state of his complexion at a glance before bursting out with his reply mercutio he exclaimed scrabbling to his feet and throwing his arms around the older boyboy still for mercutio was only a year or two older than his brother marco whereve you been i was thinkin the dandelos got you mercutio laughed and ruffled benitos hair but did not attempt to extract himself from the younger boys embrace had to make a trip to the east kidfor my health benito let him go and backed up a step looking up at him in perplexity mercutio tapped benitos nose with a playful fingertip not to make a story out of it laddie but my dear father turned me in to the schiopettieri hopped a ship one step ahead of em and worked my way to turkey and back didnt have much time for goodbyes benito grinned in delight truth mercutio turned his expression to one of unwonted seriousness and placed his hand solemnly on his satincovered chest in the general vicinity of his heart truth then he dropped the pose put his arm around benitos shoulders and returned the boys embrace so what you been up to kid still roofwalking benito grinned some mostly been running do an odd job for claudia and valentina fornother fellow outoftowner landsman but a good fellow some for a canaler too but thats been a special he broke off not wanting to talk about maria to mercutio for some odd reason he finished a bit lamely ive been helping like mostly running for ventuccio these days ventuccio mercutio pursed his lips in surprise the sun struck red lights from his hair green sparks from his hazel eyes come up in the world have we benito flushed with pleasure hey aint no big thing and its mostly on account of that fellow the one i do a bit of odd work for he got me the job i been staying with him mercutio grew silent a silence punctuated by the distant clamor of voices on the canal below the splashing of poles the regular spat of wavelets on ventuccio foundations benito mercutios expression darkened and his grip on benitos shoulders tightened benito this fellerhe isnt messing with you is he benitos openmouthed shock seemed to reassure the older boy even before he spluttered out his reply him hell no not in a million years he likes girls got him one too member maria garavelli mercutios eyebrows rose and his tense expression relaxed milady hellcat herself an outoftown landsman lord and saints i dont know whether to congratulate the man or pity him who is this paragon name of aldanto benito replied caesare aldanto thats not a name i know the questions in mercutios eyes gave benito momentary qualms and he belatedly began to pick his words with care aristo capuletti bastard half german benito said sticking to the official story they pay him to keep himself quiet and do a job or two for em to not make an embarrassment of himself and to do what milord capuletti doesnt want to dirty his fingers with hmm mercutio mused i can see where a smart kid like you could be useful to him is he treating you all right benito nodded vigorously as good as you cept he tries to keep me outa trouble mercutio laughed then ive got no quarrel with him and how are my old pair of nemeses miladies valentina and claudia benito hid another grin claudia did not approve of mercutio laivetti and valentina approved of him even less she considered him far too reckless far too careless which to benito seemed rather a case of pot calling kettle she hadnt liked it when benito had taken to hanging around with the older boyshed liked it even less when mercutio had included him in on some of his escapades but mercutio was something speciala kind of substitute brother while benitos brother was out of reach in the jesolo hed given benito someone to tag after look up to try to imitate hed initiated benito into the nolongerquitesomysterious ways of girlsor rather womenjust prior to his disappearance and hed been something of a protector when there was trouble and claudia wasnt around truth to be told mercutio was a great deal that marco was not he took risks marco would not even have thought of and took them laughingly marco was so seriousand benito grew tired of seriousness now and again it was mercutios easy careless good humor that attracted benito the most mercutio could always find something to laugh at even when the job went wrong mostly though nothing went wrong in mercutios hands and he did everything with a flair and style that benito could only envy claudias okaybut yell never guess who valentinas playin footsie with benito replied smirking ricardo brunelli mercutio laughed less likelyn that less likelythe only man less likely would be a schiopettieri he stopped dead at benitos widening grin you cant be serious dead serious dip me in batter and call me fried fish if valentinas abedding with a schiopettieri can judgment day be far behind mercutios eyes were wide and gleeful i can see ive been missing far more than i dreamed he let benito go and regarded him with a lifted eyebrow and a grin that practically sparkled i can see that getting caught up is going to cost me at least the price of a dinner so tell me my young wage earnerwhen do your employers release you for the day chapter the girl approaching the bench of ventuccio runners was an enigma she was definitely money her hair and clothes said that if she hadnt been here in the working part of the ventuccio warehouse benito would have said she was case vecchie there was something vaguely familiar about her benito chewed his thumbnail and wondered what brought her to ventuccio she walked up to ambrosino ventuccios desk like she owned him the desk and all of ventuccio and didnt need to flaunt the fact the saturnine ventuccio cousin sat up sharp when he saw her and put what he was doing aside she spoke quietly to him for a moment too quietly for benito to hear what she was saying although he strained his ears unashamedly but then she turned away from ambrosino towards the bench and crooked her finger beckoning beckoning benito he jumped up and bounced over to her ambrosino ventuccio looked him up and down speculation in his nocolor eyes then cleared his throat milady montescue needs a runnerfor something special he said slowly she wants somebody as knows where marco felluci went i told her that hes not here any more that he got proper leave to go so hes not in any trouble with us then she wanted to speak to you about him yes milady benito said quickly milady i he gulped he recognized the hairdo now this was the woman who had brought maria home she smiled at him his mouth must have fallen open in response only one person had that wide a smile and standing as she was only he could see her put a finger to her lips digesting this one was going to take more than a few seconds he wasnt quite sure what to say about marco and looked at ambrosino for some clue it was no secretat least hed not been told it wasthat marco valdosta was now openly under dorma protection and sponsorship but it wasnt something that too many people knew yet either outside the case vecchie circles ambrosino knew but that didnt mean he wanted the other runners to know why dont you and the milady take a walk kid ambrosino said make this the last run of the day the montescue are still a great house lord and saintsthat montescue the ones that owned the huge palace and shipyard down on the landward side of cannaregio it wasnt in the best of repair maybe but still they were case vecchie case vecchie longi and it cant hurt to tell her what she wants to know yes milord benito replied faintly milady she led him out into the lateafternoon bustle and clamor on the shadowed walkway maintaining a strained and complete silence they moved with the flow of the crowd all the way down to the bridge without her saying a word finally she stopped in the little alcove where the bridge met the walkway a nook built in the side of the building so that people with long burdens to maneuver off the bridge onto the walkway could do so she finally faced him there and cleared her throat awkwardly maria said i must talk to you benito shook his head still unbelieving kat montescue she grimaced katerina montescue when im wearing these clothes kat the spook when im like you know me benito swallowed but why how she shrugged some things family have to do and the montescue are few there is nobody else and i grew up playing around the boatyard playing in the boats my mama wasnt case vecchie the negri arent even curti theyre new money grandpapa negri still rowed his own boat i think mama encouraged me to be a tomboy because because it upset the montescue cousins she pulled a rueful face back when there were some that left an awkward silence um seeing as old ambrosino said i could take off now shall we go and have a glass of wine er i gotta explain to you marco felluci is really marco valdosta said katerina sadly come on youre right i could use a whole bottle of grappa never mind a glass of wine she pulled a wry face except i dont like it somewhere quiet benito im sticking the montescue name out into public view enough just doing this maria said it was important so important she posted a note under our waterdoor her writings not great that produced an almostsmile it took giuseppe until this morning to give it to me he thought he was protecting me madelena had a fight with him about it and made him come and deliver it benito didnt know who these people were but he knew a private place close enough he nodded follow me he led off to a little winecellar a hundred yards off inside it was dark and smoky and still further privacy was offered by little cubicles the sound was oddly damped within traders use this place for negotiations the partitions are double walled and filled with wool kat and he sat down and the padrone wordlessly brought them a carafe of wine and a bowl of anchovystuffed olives supposed to make you thirsty said benito cheerfully taking three now if you already know that marco is marco valdosta what else can i tell you kat chewed her lip i sent him a very angry letter when i found out he was getting married to angelina dorma i thought i i well he i mean er benito had to help out there was some fun in seeing kat tonguetied but he felt sorry for her anyway and it was too late now even if she was katerina montescue and not kat trouble the spook was twotiming you yes she said her voice hardly audible mariai saw her early this morningsaid it absolutely wasnt like that she said i had to talk to you even if it was too late now its taken me all day to screw up the courage to walk into ventuccio and ask for you benito took a deep breath he didnt really know how to handle this but honesty to his brother seemed only fair especially as maria had already muddied the waters women they made things complicated marco wasnt seeing angelina when he was seeing you he well never mind but i promise word of honor swear to god he never even saw her face in the last three months not until he moved into dorma i know said kat dully and hes married now anyway it would never have worked hes valdosta im montescue our families are enemies to the death and i suppose it was the honorable thing for him to do even if they had split up he had to marry her she was carrying his baby benito choked on his wine he spluttered what kat looked around anxiously no one appeared to be staring at a redfaced katerina montescue and a touslehaired teenager who was still gawping like a fish out of water marco marco had always been rather protective of benito kat couldnt see why because shed bet his coworker knew all about where babies came from when he was still in his own cradle still it was par for the course very like marco shed bet that dorma bitch had seduced him her hands crooked into claws benito finally got control of his larynx who told you that maria marco told her benito shook his head marco is the ultimate prize idiot he needs a minder accidents happen said kat stiffly benito snorted not unless marco is the male equivalent of the virgin mary and ive known him all my life hes only half a saint the other half is pure idiot i promise he seemed so absolutely certain so who is the father then kat demanded benito looked at her then away then shook his head lets just say marco is paying his debts she had to know benito im not joking if i have to spend the whole of the casa montescues strongbox on a truthspell ill get that answer there isnt much in the strong boxbut we can borrow and some things are more important than money benito shrugged its too late kat i know marco it is a question of honor hes made his decision hell live by it kat sighed she should have trusted her heart and gone and talked him out of it he made it after he got that stupid letter from me well marriages could be annulled it wasnt easy but once she had the real father i need to know who the father is benito ill find out every strega scryer in this town relies on us so you might as well tell me benito shook his head who did marco tell that he was the father theres your answer and it is no help to you kat marco told maria caesare she asked weakly benito nodded after marcos silly love poems made caesare know the case vecchie girl had the hots for him he made a move shed even seen them together she now realized at that ridottotrue angelina had been masked but the hair was recognizable maria she asked already knowing the answer doesnt know i mean she was after caesare about him having another woman but she doesnt know who or even for sure heyyou leave her out of this kat look there is no way the dorma would have taken aldanto hes an exmontagnard forget about marco all you can do is wreck his life and wreck marias i know my brother he wont back out im sorry kats head was whirling she put it in her hands have some wine said benito gently pushing the glass to her she took the wine the harsh ruby liquid slopped a little youre his brother there was a small sameness about the mouth and in mannerisms benito nodded i dont think we have the same father he said wryly but yes im marcos brother and believe me kat best thing you can do is leave him to get on with life with angelina dorma your name is valdosta benito nodded benito valdosta but i dont advertise it after mama was killed we went into hiding marco took off into the jesolo i lived in an attic and was a sneak thief then someone tried to kill marco about a year ago assassin professional so i took him to caesare someone tried to kill him yes marco kind of assumed it was someone from the council of ten but later we decided maybe it was the montagnards kat closed her eyes dear god that was grandpapa he didnt even get hurt said benito reassuringly but she wasnt listening anymore she stared into nothing for a moment then she stood up dont ever tell anyone your name she said harshly never not anyone or go to dorma for protection and whatever you do dont tell aldanto and she walked away giaccomo was watching them out the corner of his eye so benito was doing his damnedest to act virtuous i cant believe it mercutio said leaning back in his chair against the wall and sipping at his brandy his eyes alight with laughter jeppo cleared away their plates with an odd look at benito but didnt say anything benito concentrated on being very well behaved this was giaccomos after all and if he did anything maria would hear about it he wasnt even drinking brandy though mercutio had offered it he was sticking to wine watered wine hed have a halo at this rate outside giaccomos open door there were canalers lounging on his porch mugs and glasses in hand enjoying the balmy evening he and mercutio had the taproom pretty much to themselves i just cant believe it mercutio repeated chuckling i leave this town and the very next day all hell breaks loose and me not here to help it along he shook his head mockingly i can see ive got a lot of lost time to make up suddenly he leaned forward and his tone grew conspiratorial thats where you come in kid if you want in because i need a lookout and a housebreaker for a little piece of work benito brightened course i want in he replied softly whatd you take me for whats the action mercutios eyes flamed with glee whos the richest dumbest man in this city benito snorted no contest the doge and what does he love above power wealth womeneverything his clockwork toys benito supplied nowwhat would he do do you think if hed gone and built a wonderful toy just to send to rome as a kind of present for the grand metropolitanand hed sent it to the jeweler to get all gilded and prettied up and get sparklies put on itand somebodyborrowed it and told him hed get it back only if he left a great deal of money in a particular placeand didnt tell anyone about it and told him if he did bring in the schiopettieri hed get his beautiful clockwork toy back in a million pieces mercutio settled back in his chair with a smile of smug satisfaction hes just dumb enough to do it benito acknowledged answering mercutios smile with one of his own when and where tonight if youre game jeweler just opposite the bridge schiopettieri benito asked got a distractor gave jewel destre a turkishmade coat like thisn when he drooled over it he thought i was groveling mercutio chuckled then this afternoon i sent a couple messages to him and giancarlo polo concerning the coat and jewels manhood send one more and ill guarantee theyll play knifetalk on the bridge tonight benito chuckled evilly an if anybody sees anythin all theyll notice is the coat so if anybody comes lookin for a thiefthey go for jewel si what is this thing of the doges anyway a timepiece mercutio snickered i heard its a clockwork whale he put together for his bath benito snickered at the notion of a grown man playing with bath toys lets do it he said chapter there were more ways in to any building than by the door and benito knew most of them he and mercutio began their operation with him going over the roof and down an airshaft the airshaft was very narrow a year ago benito would have slid down it easily todayeven though benito didnt have an ounce of fat on him he was already showing the stocky and muscular physique of his presumed father carlo sforza it was a tight fit but the airshaft gave access to a window that was never locked the window gave on a storeroom holding cleaning supplies and the storeroom was shared by both the jeweler in question and his neighbor a perfumer benito opened the outer door to mercutio just as all hell broke loose on the bridge mercutio flitted in benito out crouched in the shadows by the door he kept eyes and ears peeled for the approach of anyone innocents could make as much trouble as schiopettieri if they noticed the boy in the shadows or that the door was cracked open across the canal on the bridge torches were flaring waving wildly there was clamor of young male voices shouting cursing a girls scream cut across the babble like a knife through cheesea scream of outrage and anger not panic and the hoarse croak of a young male in pain followed it and benito saw weaving through the walkways and heading up the stairs to a bridge a string of bobbing lights moving at the speed of a man doing a fast trot schiopettieri mercutio he whispered a slim shadow flitted out the door shutting it with agonizing care to avoid the clicking of the latch a sound that would carry even with the riot going on across the water a bundle under mercutios arm told benito everything he needed to know he grinned as mercutio took off at a trot heading away from the rialto bridge benito lagged a bit his job to guard mercutios backtrail delay any schiopettieri perfect he thought with exultation worked this un timed as perfect as any of the doges contraptions and that was when everything fell apart people were looking out of windows coming out of compartments with walkway entrances moving toward the bridge attracted to the ruckus like rats attracted to food he and mercutio had counted on that tooit would cover their trail an old man looking angry popped out of a shop door in his nightshirt halfway between mercutio and the bridge he was holding something down by his side benito didnt even think about what it might be just noted his presence and his anger and planned to avoid him he looked like hed been disturbed and wasnt happy about ithe probably had a cudgel and hed take out his pique on anyone jostling him a lantern carried by someone hurrying toward the fight flared up and caught the gaudy patchwork of the turkish coat mercutio wore and the man let out an angry yell you punk bastard he screamed raising his hand break my windows will you ill give you protection too late benito saw what the man held was a matchlock arquebus too late he yelled at mercutio to duck too late as the arquebus went off with a roar right in mercutios astonished face his head exploded blood fountaining as he fell benito screamed his cry lost in the screams coming from the bridge the screams of those around the madman and his victim mercutio he shrieked and tried to push his way toward his friend past people running away from the carnage but something seized on him from behind and when he struggled hit him once scientifically behind the right ear sending him into darkness he woke with an awful headache and looked up into the eyes of the eagle when his head stopped whirling quite so much he realized that it was the man with the solid line of eyebrow who had seen him and kat hide from the schiopettieri and return to retrieve that package who had chased them down the alley outside zianettis senor lopez he was wearing a simple monks habit benito pulled away in fear lie still snapped the man there was such command in the voice that benito did lopezs hands explored his scalp gently well your skull appears intact now lie still you were noticed the schiopettieri are casting around for you your burnedface rescuer couldnt stick about he pulled a blanket over benito moments later the voice of the law could be heard a boy rumor has it he lives somewhere in this area of the city dark curly hair then the voice of lopez there are thousands of boys in venice with dark curly hair doubtless i have this one hidden under a blanket in my cubicle this was said in an absolutely level voice respect in the voice just wondered if youd seen him father lopez i did when i see him again i will tell him you are looking for him said lopez benito lay still trapped between the terror of the schiopettieri and horror about mercutios death a minute later lopez returned schiopettieri are looking for you now explain to me what happened your burnedfaced friend simply deposited you at my door and left benito sat up frightened i dont know what youre talking about mercutio my friend with the turkish waistcoat the schiopettieri say he is dead killed in the fracas lopez took a deep breath i am here to save a city not to look after little sneak thieves you are a piece in this puzzle benito valdosta you and your brother marco and katerina montescue benito started in fear how did you know he shrank back a little it was always said that the montagnards had killed their mother had hunted marco benito had always believed that himself but what if it had been the metropolitans even possibly this man or agents of the council of ten those shadowy agents no one knew and mercutio was dead his mind just kept coming back to it dead what was it that valentina had said hell end up dead and in two days venice will have forgotten even his name mercutio was dead dead the whole of his face blown off dead lopez shook him benito swung a fist at the spaniard hes dead mercutio is dead lopez sighed go on get out of here you have that young fools death on your mind perhaps we can talk when you are no longer a boy as he staggered out onto the street benito was vaguely aware that there was something very wrong about that scary priest ricardo brunellis guest at one time now living in the ghetto a legate of the grand metropolitan being attired as a monk and manning a confession booth in dorsoduro waiting for some great happening but his mind was too full of the death of mercutio he charged down the cobbles to aldantos wiping hot angry eyes with his fists he only slowed when he got to their house because he had to talk to the gateguard and he wouldnt be crying in front of anyone not if he died for it so he composed himselfholding his sorrow and his rage under tightest of masks opened the door with his key started to the door opened at the first rattle of key in lock and he found himself looking at aldanto himself he just stared frozen youre late aldanto had said grabbing his arm and hauling him inside you should have been back let me go benito snarled voice crackling again pulling his arm away so fast his shirt sleeve nearly tore aldanto gave him a startled look then a measured one he let go of benitos arm and turned back to the door careful to throw all the locksand only then turned back to benito what happened he asked quietly neutrally hed told himself over and over that he was not going to tell aldanto what had happened but caesare was a skillful interrogator benito couldnt resist the steady barrage of quiet questions not when aldanto was between him and the door syllable by tortured syllable the handsome blond dragged the nights escapade out of him as benito stared at the floor smoldering sullenly determined not to break down a second time he got to know every crack and cranny of the entryway floor before it was over silence then im sorry aldanto said quietly im sorry about your friend benito looked up aldantos face was unreadable but his eyes were murky with thought memory something he looked past benito for a moment but you know very well he said noncommittally that was a damned fool stunt benito snarled and made a dash for the stairs aldanto made no move to stop him he tore up the stairs stubbing his toes twice getting up and resuming his rungot to caesares bedroom and through it not caring if maria was in the bedto the rooftrap and out slamming it behind him and out onto the roof into the dark the night the sheltering night where he huddled beside the chimney and cried and cried and cried dawn brought the return of sense the return of thought valentina was right he thought bleakly she told me and told me must have been a million times she told me mercutio was a fool she told me he wouldnt see twenty she was right him and his ideasgonna be rich and famous so whats he come to blown away cause some ol fool thinks hes jewel and aint nobody going to remember him but me he crouched on his haunches both arms wrapped around his knees rocking back and forth and shivering a little aint nobody going to remember him but me could have been me could have been been coasting on my luck just like mercutio only one day the luck runs out he stared off across the roofs to the steeples and turrets of the accademia marco maybe got it right he sniffed and rubbed his cold tender nose on his sleeve what have i done what the hell good am i doing for him or even for caesare the delleste has gone and made an heir to the house and marco poor fish doesnt even begin to know how to be sneaky just honestand honest could wind up with him just as dead as mama theres gotta be somethin i can do theres got to be his thoughts went around and around like that for some time until he heard voices below and saw maria shutting the door beneath his perch saw her hop into her gondola and row it away into a shiny patch of sun and past into the shadows on the canal he knew aldanto would be up he unwound himself and crept on hands and knees to the trapdoor lifted it and let himself down into the apartment i wondered if youd gone said a voice behind him as he dropped he turned aldanto sat on the edge of the rumpled bed eyes halfclosed but not at all sleepy fishysmelling breeze coming in the open window and ruffling his hair no caesare benito replied uncertainly ivebeen thinking he could feel aldanto considering him from under those halfclosed lids weighing him youve been thinking im a fool lucky butmercutio was lucky for a while and you saw what riding luck got him si and what do you propose to do about this revelation benito couldnt stand looking at that expressionless face he dropped his eyes to his own feet bare callused dirty and covered with little scratches dont know caesare he muttered justyou need help mbrother needs helpand i dont howwhat to do i justwant do it smart thats all i want to be able t do things an if somebody decides to put a hole in me he looked up again his chin firming stubbornly a kind of smoldering anger in the bottom of his stomach if somebody decides to put a hole in me i dont want it to be for no damn reason aldanto licked his lips a trifle his eyes no longer hooded youre asking my advice si benito said im asking and ill take it i aint going to be a fool any more dorma aldanto replied benito wrinkled his nose doubtfully milord whats dorma got to do petro dorma has been made aware of the fact that there are two valdosta boys in venice it is only because of my effort and marcos that he hasnt had his people out to bring you in regardless of your wishes in the matter was that a hint of smile if so it was gone before benito had a chance to identify the expression we persuaded him that until you wanted the shelter of dormas patronage it would bea less than successful venture he continues to inquire about you he has a very strong sense of obligation it was a hint of a smile has milord dorma hes a powerful influential man keeps quiet but has a following i wouldnt mind knowing what happens at dorma you have eyes that see things that your brother doesnt butmarco he wants to be a doctor benito felt moved to protest i aint smart not that smartwhat am i supposed to do what did your grandfather tell you to do i know he sent you a note not long ago benito remembered as clearly as if he had marcos perfect memory the words of his granthers note it is your duty to take care of marco he has no talent for lying no ability to deceive this is not altogether bad as there should be one in every generation who understands and believes in delleste honor but those who believe in the honor need those who understand the price of honor to care for them he told me to take care of marco why you said aldanto quietly because im not goodand the good ones need bad ones to watch out for em that may not have been what the duke had said but it was what he meant ferrara is being squeezed the delleste have not a sure ally in the world the old duke is a canny old fox but marco could become the head of the delleste in exile aldanto spoke intently his blue eyes boring into benitos what then benito thought about the duke the clever canny duke who understood expediencyand marco who did notand shivered aldanto leaned back on his pillows a little so you see benito nodded slowly then young milord i advise you to go to petro dorma and i advise you to ask him to train you in the ways of business and i further advise you to learn benito valdosta apply yourself as devotedly as you did to learning to pick a lock si benito said in a small humble voice he turned and started to gothen turned back for a moment caesare aldanto simply raised one golden eyebrow were still in your debt you call it in any timei pay it roofwalking too ill hold you to that said caesare bleakly benito nodded and he picked his way carefully down the staircase and out the door into the dawn sunshine he sat on the doorstep of dorma for a very long time before the doorkeeper opened the outer protective grate for the day the doorkeeper was a withered old man who stared at him with a pride far more in keeping with a house head than that of a doorkeeper away with you boy he grated looking down his nose as benito scrambled to his feet and clasped his hands behind him we dont need idlers or beggars if youre looking for work present yourself at the kitchen pardon sir benito interrupted looking out of the corner of his eye at the huge pile that was dorma and feeling more than a little apprehensive at what he was getting himself into your pardonbutive got a message for milord dorma well the ancient drew himself up and sniffed disdainfully but his disdain was shortlived caesare aldanto sent me sir if its convenient im supposed to speak to milord petro im he gulped and watched the surprise flood the old mans face im benito valdosta marcos brother i think milord petro wants to see me chapter who in the name of god is this francesca demanded the holy roman emperor he held up the second of the two letters count von stemitz had brought with him from venice the letter was quite a bit longer than the first which consisted of a single page the count cleared his throat then cleared it again ah well as it happens your majesty your nephew has taken up with a venetian courtesan for quite some time now hes kept the liaison more or less secret from abbot sachs and his coterie but erik hakkonsen quietly informed me of the situation early on hakkonsen allowed this to continue demanded the emperor his heavy brows so low that his dark blue eyes seemed a deep purple well yes your majesty again von stemitz cleared his throat actually in an odd sort of way i get the feeling hakkonsen rather approves of the arrangement the emperors brows lifted ill be damned he grunted i didnt think the young icelander was that smart his fathergod rot his soulwould have beaten me black and blue it was a simpler world in those days your majesty if youll permit me the liberty of saying so indeed it was sighed charles fredrik jagiellons father was a brute and the uncle he usurped the throne from was even worse but they werent as ambitious he fanned his face with the sheaf of papers held in his left hand not to mention that accursed emeric of hungary either he or jagiellon would be bad enough to have both of them coming to power within a year of each other he sighed again and picked up the single sheet of paper which contained manfreds letter to him then hefted it a bit as if he were weighing the one letter against the other they say essentially the same thing but this francescas socalled addendum is ten times longer twenty times more sophisticated and lays out in fine detail all of the nuances manfred missed i thought manfreds letter was quite thoughtful said the count rallying for the moment to the young princes behalf the emperor snorted for an eighteenyearold boy whos never given any evidence in the past of thinking past the next tavern or whorehouse the letters a bloody miracle he squinted at francescas letter stilltheres nothing in manfreds letter we didnt know a year ago whereas this one she claims to be from the aquitaine i tend to believe the claim even though im certain the name she uses is fraudulent oh i dont doubt shes from the aquitaine mused the emperor nobody else in the worldnot even italianshas that subtle and convoluted way of looking at things his eyes left the letter and drifted toward the narrow window an arrowslit that window had been once probably half the arrows fired from it over the centuries had been aimed at aquitainian besiegers id be a lot happier if i knew exactly who she was the third man in the room coughed discreetly the emperor and von stemitz moved their eyes to gaze on him her real name is mariefrancoise de guemadeuc said the priest you can be certain of it we investigated quite thoroughly the count grimaced a bad business that was even by the standards of the aquitaine the emperors expression was a study in contradictionas if he were both relieved and disturbed at the same time you are certain francis he demanded yes your majesty the priest nodded at the letter in the emperors hands my brothers in venice have even more at stake in this matter than you their lives in the end true enough admitted charles fredrik his brows lowered again which is perhaps the part about this that bothers me the most you had given me no indication prior to this moment that your brotherhood was involved at all with my nephew father francis spread his hands and we are not your majesty not directly at least but you may recall i did tell youseveral times in factthat we had established a line of communication with you which was less circuitous than the letters i receive from father lopez through our brothers in the aquitaine less circuitous barked the emperor he jiggled the letter in his hand thats a delicate way of putting it father francis did not seem abashed well yes it is we have taken solemn vows after all after a moments worth of imperial glowering charles fredriks heavy chest began to heave with soft laughter ill give you this much francis you have a better wit than the damned sots the amusement passed lets hope that extended to your wits also he laid the letter back on the table planted his thick hands on the armrests of the chair and levered himself to his feet then almost marching went to the window and gazed out there was not much to see beyond the lights of the sleeping city i agree with this francescas assessment of the situation the emperor announced abruptly the troubles in venice have been carefully orchestrated to leave the city helpless and at odds with itselfwhile jagiellon has moved to precipitate a war in northern italy a war whose sole purpose is the destruction of venice itself von stemitz had not actually read francescas letter she had given it to him already sealed that seems a bit farfetched your majesty if youll forgive me saying so why would anyone want to destroy venice the city is the key to the wealth of the east before charles fredrik could answer the count made a little waving motion with his hand forestalling objections oh to be sureduke visconti wishes venice all the ill in the world but he wants to control the city not ruin it and how could he do it anyway venice is an island and its fleet is far more powerful than anything milan and its allies could muster he broke off suddenly unless emeric of hungary comes onto the scene finished the emperor which he surely would if it appeared that venice was falling into ruin but von stemitz was clearly groping his face tight with confusion think commanded the emperor he spread his arms wide but think on the largest scale because thats howim certain of it nowjagiellon is thinking he turned away from the window entirely at first glance of course jagiellon would seem to be the least likely source of trouble in the adriatic the grand duchy of lithuania and poland is very far from venice and has no common border with it no apparent source for mutual conflict he shrugged heavily not even the commercial rivalry which periodically agitates the hungarians and the genoese and the greeks in constantinople exactly so why in the world who is the great rival of lithuania interrupted the emperor von stemitz frowned we are of course the holy roman empire precisely and what will happen if venice is destroyed who will fill the sudden power vacuum in northern italy and the adriatic not milan von stemitz stared at him then slowly the counts face began to clear and seemed as well to grow slightly pale precisely grunted charles fredrik grand duke jagiellons reputation for insensate brutality is well earned count but i think thats as much of a maneuver as anything else he does dont be fooled by it he is also a consummate manipulator a schemer quite unlike his father a manwell call him that for the momentwho would prefer to let others bleed themselves to death if at all possible while he marshals his forces elsewhere von stemitz spoke in a whisper if venice is destroyed the holy roman empire will have no choice if you dont intervenewith direct military forcethe hungarians surely will andand and with lithuania and the borderlands to deal with already i cannot also afford to see a more powerful kingdom of hungaryespecially not one which has a toehold in italy especially not with a man on the throne like emeric who doesnt quite have jagiellons reputationoutside of hungary that isbut comes in a very close second thered be war between the empire and hungary charles fredrik nodded for a certainty withfor a certaintymilan and rome sucked into the vortex as well all of north italy genoa also be sure of itsoon enough the greeks as well he turned his head staring out of the arrow slit again within a year he mused within a year half of my army would be mired in north italy leaving jagiellon free to strike elsewhere where do you think asked father francis the emperor swiveled his head back and fixed his eyes on eneko lopezs companion i dont know he said youll find out for me father franciss head jerked a little then slowly a small smile came to his face and he lowered his head the gesture was almostnot quitea bow thank you your majesty he said softly the emperor chuckled not just yet francis we still have to spike this plot of jagiellons in venice and you still have to get the agreement of the grand metropolitan in rome before you can form a new order what are you going to call it by the way francis hesitated we havent really decided your majesty most of us lean toward the society of hypatia eneko lopez also no actuallyhe doesnt seem to like the name he smart man barked the emperor within a year your enemies will be calling you the shits what does he favor the society of chrysostom the emperor stroked his thick beard better better still theyll shorten it to something like the socks then within a week to the smelly socks be certain of it he paused then call yourselves the society of the word he stated firmly even imperiously francis seemed to bridle the emperor barked a little laugh dont be stupid francis allow me the luxury of command in small things if you wouldsince you do need my permission to operate in imperial territory my cooperation in fact even if it is kept at a certain official distance francis stiff shoulders eased true your majesty a little crease appeared between his eyebrows but i dont see how calling ourselves the crease disappeared into a much deeper one your majesty the swords we are not a militant order the most powerful man in europe simply stared at him and after a moment the priest looked away when antimo finished his report the duke of ferrara rose from his chair and moved over to the bladerack along the wall there for a moment his eyes ranged admiringly over the blades before he selected one and took it down from its rack benito has made his decision has he mused the old fox he hefted the dagger in his hand holding it with an expert grip the main gauche antimo not so glorious as the sword of course a plebeian sort of weapon his left hand glided through a quick motion but in the end its often the blade sinister which spills the enemys guts on the field delleste replaced the dagger and turned back to bartelozzi show in baron trolliger now if you would i assume hes brought the rest of the money with him antimo nodded enough to hire all the condottieri well need smiling grimly ferrara will seem like a veritable military giant when the war erupts the old fox shook his head dont fool yourself antimo the great swords will remain in the hands of the emperor and the grand duke and the king of hungary but for the needs of the moment here in northern italy again his left hand made that swift expert motion ferrara will be charles fredriks main gauche part vii august ad chapter when manfred strode into eriks chamber the icelander was struggling with a letter erik had met up with an icelander pilgrim and the chance to send a letter home was a rare one now he just had to choose his words with some care there was always a chance the letter might not get home there were things going on that he didnt want to tell the world about besides there was manfreds identity to be kept secret he was tempted to write in runic but that would convince any curious person this was full of secrets worth readingor destroying if they could not read it we need some air erik said manfred loudly something about that tone stopped erik from saying he had a letter to finish first he put the letter carefully aside the quill balanced across the inkpot they walked out full summer was coming and the smell rising off the canals was as unpleasant as the shimmering water was beautiful manfred picked a spot where they could lean against a wall in the shade count von stemitz just came back from his visit to the emperor who is now in innsbruck by the way manfred snorted yesinnsbruck he never leaves mainz if he can help it which means manfred glowered at nothing in particularor the world in general von stemitz brought a reply for me from charles fredrik manfred took a deep breath and he sent me this also it was a plain heavy gold ring set with a polished bloodstone erik raised an eyebrow plainly there was more to the ring than mere jewelry charles fredrik is like the doge said manfred he likes mechanical gadgets he pressed the ring on the inside under the stone with a knife point the bezels opened and manfred took the bloodstone out he handed it to erik upside down it was an imperial seal he trusts you erik said mildly the seal could be cut by any competent forger but wouldnt be the curse the church magicians had laid on misuse was as much threat as the weight of the emperors anger neither was something even kings would take lightly manfred slammed his meaty fist into his palm damn it i dont want this erik i was enjoying venice look what francesca has got me into here erik handed over the seal carefully youd better put it back into the ring i suppose he was impressed by your newfound grasp of venetian intrigue hes made me his privy emissary plenipotentiary to deal with the venetian situation as it unfolds the breton prince ground his teeth he says that other rumblings have also reached him hes having a tourney in innsbruck and will find reason to remain there with considerable force for some months manfred sighed theres more he continued my uncle has also discovered that there are a further one thousand two hundred knights of the holy trinity apparently on their way to trieste he wants to know why and says if need be i must remind them that they hold the charter for their monasteries on imperial sufferance erik reviewed a map in his mind having the emperor champing on the other side of the brenner pass is going to be of no use if the knights are in trieste they can get here a lot faster than he can but manfred whatever is going oninvasion of this place is insanity theyre water people even ten thousand knights would just be drowned manfred shook his head theres more to it than just straight invasion but right now well their second fleet left a few weeks ago and the town is pretty thin of people erik and now i have to find out what is going on damn francesca damn charles fredrik erik was amused he noticed that manfred was complaining but showing no signs of evading the orders he was changing as he grew and erik had to admit quite a lot of that was due to the time he spent with francesca why dont you ask francesca subtly of course im going to said manfred if anything good has come out of this its that my uncle has sent me a pouch of jewels that can be spent unobtrusively which ducats cant i was running low on money im going to damn well spend some of his on wine and a specific woman oh he sent instruction for you too take any heads you feel necessary ill sign bits of paper for them later you want to start with that idiot sachs although that would give charles fredrik more trouble with the church than he wants erik smiled dryly i dont think the venetians would like it much either charles fredrik is forgetting his writ doesnt run here a bell began to toll furiously over at the piazza sounds like a fire or something wed better get back this was venice word racing like wildfire along the canals and alleys beat them back to the embassy the doorman greeted them with milan and verona have embargoed venetian barges coming up the po and the adige manfred took a deep breath its starting he said to erik when erik got back up to his room he found the quill pen had been moved slightlybut enough for him to notice he hoped theyd enjoyed his letter regarding his wishes of best health for his sisters francesca pulled a wry face men always think there is a profit to be made from war she looked at the emerald manfred had given her there is but for very few for most even the whores in an armys tail war is a drain she sighed now it seems you want me to become one of those who make a profit out of it manfred showed hed learned a great dealabout tact at least in this particular case you can bet that the holy roman emperor does not want war francesca looked speculatively at him and how would you know manfred manfred chuckled ive met charles fredrik a couple of times hes an old woman who likes to stay in mainz and fiddle with his map collection he hates changing borders erik had to admit it was masterfully done he didnt know if it would fool someone like francesca but as theyd learned from giuliano the venetian fencingmaster bravura was sometimes enough this time it looked like giuliano was right but there was also the double feint francesca nodded true the emperor has small running wars on the northern and eastern borders but he has a reputation for not bestirring himself and ill bet the empire is richer for it there is a time for war said erik mildly francesca looked sharply at him those who dont know you erik are fooled by that tone of yours yes there is a time for war there are enemies who will use a desire for peace to weaken and devour you and if i have to put my finger on what is happening here these are the moves being enacted now have you noticed any shipping coming in manfred shrugged i dont really pay any attention erik was far more geared to noticing vessels lateenrigged coasters i havent seen any bigger round ships for a week or so francesca dimpled at him trade has been down for the last while you can bet the spleto pirates are at work by now i think there is a blockade and how convenient all of this is just after the spring convoys leave the better part of eight thousand men at arms are out of the city the cream of venices fighting boatmen the arsenalotti are still here of course but my next prediction of trouble would be in the next biggest concentration of young disaffected men in the city the accademia and the various scuolo theyll build up pressure trying to get venice to start fighting from within she looked thoughtfully at the two someoneor possibly several someonesis trying to orchestrate all this the magical murders are part of the plot im sure of it you can tell your uncle charles fredrik that hes too early the whole thing wont come to the boil until late summer her reference to the emperor as manfreds uncle brought an instant silence to the room erik and manfred were as rigid as boards how the hell did you know demanded manfred i didnt tell her eriki swear francesca shrugged youre a breton nobleman important enough to keep your identity and the fact you have a bodyguard secret you have contacts with the imperial courthigh enough to know fine details of the emperors movements you have kept your own first name i know a great deal about the royal houses of europe a bretonwith the same name as the duke of brittanys son familiar with the court at mainz there are other possibilities but none that have erik ready to kill me startled manfred looked over and saw that erik had his heavybladed shetland dagger in hand he moved to block the way between the icelander and the courtesan you cant erik you cant i may have to said erik quietly not without killing me first francesca stepped past manfred im not a fool erik i needed to do this to establish trust if i intended to betray manfred and sell this information i would have kept quiet erik digested this for a few seconds then he put the knife into the sheath in his boot ill have to pass on who you are and what you look like to charles fredrik and to my kin you realize that if harm comes to manfred through this nowhere on earth will be safe for you not even the court of the grand duke of lithuania you might still get away from the emperors assassins but the hohenstaffen godar are ours linn gu linn we avenge them we always do francesca patted him on the arm nowhere is safe anyway be practical erik if i sold manfreds secret id be well paid but id also probably be killed before nightfall those who would use it dont want to advertise who they are and the answer could be obtained from me by torture now instead of giving me half the information and forcing me to guess the rest why dont you tell me as much as you can she smiled sweetly at manfred itll cost you another emerald my dear but im sure i can put together a few more pieces once we know just who is moving with what intent you can tell your uncle how to counter it they sat and replayed incidents and pieces of the venetian puzzle when they came to the coiner incident francescawho had simply listened up to this pointstopped them a mold for forging coins coins are stamped not molded the blanks are molded presumably without holes they are then stamped with iron dies those dies are heavily guarded counted daily your lord calenti spotted that not the molds well i presume the coiner was one of the conspiratorswith access to the venetian mint so we can assume whatever is murdering these men magically is opposed to this conspiracy francesca shrugged conspirators fall out particularly about money and different conspiracies fight one another too erik groaned i wish i was back in iceland the clan feuds were murderous true but at least they werent subtle your greatgrandfather raped my greatgrandmother chop your third cousin twice removed stole a pig from my aunts husbands fathers second wifes francesca patted him sympathetically i conclude several things and the first is that iceland is more complicated than you claim the second is that the knights of the trinity are tied up in this so probably is that wodencasket youve been here for more than a year on what was originally supposed to have been a mere visit and i cannot see the reason for it said erik gloomily francesca continued the next point is that attack at the brothel was intended to get rid of you erik either dead or maimed or disgraced and sent homeor any combination thereof this means someone already knows who manfred is and has known for a long time i just thought i might point this out before you decide to kill me for it i would guess they want manfred dead at the hands of a venetian venetian case vecchie and with your uncle playing right into their hands looking for vengeance on venice manfred chuckled and after that they just gave up francesca ruffled his hair either they decided that both of you would be better killed at once or they found out that eriks departure would cause the emperor to act immediately or even simpler after getting a taste of eriks mayhem they decided it was just too risky erik sighed youre lucky abbot sachs isnt listening to you francesca hed have you burned for witchcraft speaking of which were supposed to be involved in a witchhunt tonightover at the accademia chapter the footsteps outside the door to his room were familiar ones so marco didnt startor reach for his knifewhen a voice hailed him hey marco marco valdosta stretched out his leg and pulled the closed door open with his foot rafael i thought you were in class he raised an inquiring eyebrow at his tall skinny roommate suitemate actually lord and saints still hard to believe that im actually in the accademia that im rooming with rafael easier than believing im married and that my wife has gone to stay at a family estate in fruili rather than spend time with me and the worst of it is that it suits me ive tried but the more i see of angelina i must have been crazy rafael shrugged his shoulders barely rippling the grayblack material of his cotte and put his parchments behind the bookcase beside him the model got sick so they threw us out not surprising if she had to look at you for too long rafael grimaced at him thanks a lot i like you too you coming across to zianettis for a glass of wine and a bite it was marcos turn to grimace no thanks i i dont like to go there much rafael shrugged again i said to luciano id try to bring you along hes got some of those herbs from someonesophiafor you marco got to his feet i wish hed picked some other tavern youll get over her said rafael awkwardly marco sighed i used to think that rafael patted him on the shoulder you will just give it time these things blur eventually marco shook his head then pulled on his cloak its been months since i saw her last time just seems to bring kat into closer focus they walked in silence down the alley and across the campo to zianettis they took up residence in one of the smaller back rooms and soon brought conversation around to happier topics before they were joined by luciano marina he looked tired and grim we must meet in private in the future things are getting too risky even the jesolo marshes are less dangerous these days marcos blank look made luciano smile even for you young lord for us more ordinary strega it is dangerous enough marco swallowed and looked at rafael who nodded slightly i didnt realize wed like to keep it that way said luciano persecution is stepping up why a trade blockade should be our fault i do not know rafael shrugged the magical murders are easy enough to blame on the strega except several of the victims have been among us luciano pulled out a cloth bundle from underneath his cloak anyway here are some of the herbs that you wanted from sophia she misses you sends her love he stood up ive got things to do dont get caught up with the church while carrying these herbs itll challenge even petro dorma to explain some of them a moment later he was gone marco and rafael finished their wine in silence before following after as they headed across the torchlit campo rafael coughed apologetically if you think it better to find other digs well ill understand its not that safe these days to associate with the old faith safer than running into filippo recchia marco replied bitterly by comparison the church inquisition is dull and gentle and they arent after me all the time rafael frowned sympathetically siyou managing to avoid the bully is there anything i can do marco shook his head when rafael looked like he was going to say more dont worry about it theres nothing either of us can do about him ive dealt with worse the problem with filippo recchia rafael shrugged the recchia are a rising house before you arrived on the scene marco recchia had been the pack leader but this new kid on the block its the old story the valdosta family is where the recchia wish they wereand filippos young enough and stupid enough to let the resentment show my disadvantage is filippos obvious physical prowesswhich he shows off every chance he gets every other case vecchie boy learned to fence i know how to fightid kill filippo in a real street brawlbut not how to fence and filippos pushing it for all its worth still im not worried about it as i said ive dealt with worse before and the relative quiet of the night was torn by the explosive boom of an arquebus the sharper crack of wheellock pistols followed a yell of a rescue students a rescue that was lucianos voice exclaimed rafael they ran toward the noise which was now an outandout riot involving an influx of students pouring out of the taverns and lodging houses half of the accademia were going to be there before them half of the people in this accademia must be involved by now thought erik what a godforsaken mess they were supposed to have moved in quietly and seized the entire group alive for questioning to that end abbot sachs had insisted on cudgels instead of swords well as they burst the door open hed had half a seconds worth of seeing the group busy with some sort of ritual when the candles had blown out and all hell had broken loose von linksdorf had obviously triggered some kind of trap not only had the candles gone out abruptly but a rigged arquebus had proved that steel armor might be effective against pagan magic but it was damned useless against black powder von linksdorf had been hammered flat by the heavy bullet in the charge and chaos that followed the knights had learned two more things first there was another exitwhich they hadnt known about second the pagans were not intent on being arrested without a struggle and they were not only armed but at least two of them were apparently wealthy enough to possess pistols the melee had burst onto the narrow mostly dark street and some clever pagan had called for a rescue in a place where attacks and brawls were not uncommon and students were the frequent victims of attacks knights on horseback in open fields dealing with lesser armed and lessarmored foes were a deadly force here in the narrow confines armor was perhaps good for stopping knife thrusts and cudgel blows otherwise it simply slowed them down and hampered movement god and saint paul shouted sachs slaughter the pagans slaughter them all god will know his own a branch of candles appeared on a balcony hold the voice was elderly but full of power stand put up your weapons erik looked up and recognized michael the metropolitan of venice bishop capuletti was standing beside him staring down on them in the distance he could hear the rattles of the schiopettieri erik sighed and lowered his cudgel what a mess sachs has gotten us into again what a mess petro dorma here in his role of lord of the nightwatch was not smiling on anyone neither was the metropolitan i have fortythree of the scions of wealth nobility and gentryincluding my own brotherinlawarrested for affray i have twelve monks servants of the holy trinity involved in the same incident i have nineteen belted knights and squires of the holy trinity in custody i have three dead bodies to explain as well as a number of injuries two of the dead are students of good family there can be very little doubt that this will come before the doge in the morning he is going to ask me hard questions i want answers gentlemen how dare you arrest us demanded abbot sachs we are the church metropolitan michael looked as if he might just have apoplexy on the spot and add to the deathtoll you are the church in my see the old cleric rose to his feet trembling with fury and speaking between clenched teeth lock this idiot away signor di notte lock him away and throw away the key the church is no mans it is gods bishop capuletti bleated but metropolitan they do but root out witchcraft sachs was not so mild petrine son of silence bellowed petro dorma let us not allow our tempers to betray us i will remind you once abbotonce not twicethat this is venice herein this cityi am the authority not you and tonight it is my duty to uphold the law without fear or favor he leaned back in his chair bracing himself with both hands clenching the arm rests you will be released abbot under your own cognizance as soon as i have ascertained the facts and i imagine most of the other knights and servants but three people are deadand one of them is andrea ghiazza the son of the count of lissa dead with his head half severed one of your knights has a bloody sword at the very least i must hold him in custody until he can face the judges erik standing with manfred toward the rear of the crowd cast a glance at the knight in question hans dussel that was the young saxon was a hothead erik hadnt seen it happen but he was quite sure dussel had seized von linksdorfs sword after the prussian fell mortally wounded by the arquebus the prussian officer had been the only knight sachs had allowed to carry a sword abbot sachs drew himself up he was a pagan manwitch and would have died in the fire he was engaged in black magic ritual one of the students yelled rubbish he was in the taproom at zianettis with us we came to see what was going on dorma lifted a hand my men or myself will take statements from each of you weapons will be confiscated and returned if they do not show evidence of being used in this civil disturbance you will all doubtless be appearing before the justices at the doges palace tomorrow they were taken one at a time to speak to petro or to one of his officers not surprisingly marco found himself taken in to see petro his brotherinlaw shook his head at least someone i can rely on tell me what actually happened so marco did omitting the fact that he knew who had called out so when we got there there was this knight bleeding from a pistol shot in the arm i stopped the bleeding then rafael and i went on to try and help andrea we were too late the truth is it would have been too late at any time his neck was cut half through petro took his head in hands what a mess half the case vecchie families in venice caught up in this mess these damned german fanatics ive been trying to be evenhanded but the city would be better off if we could get rid of them even witches are less destructive and divisive it was the first time that marco had heard petro express any factional sentiment so marco said cautiously who does dormathat is westand behind petro gave him the first smile hed seen on dormas face that evening nobody we stand for venice if that means we must put up with fanatics we do but venice is not anyones lapdog not romes not milans not the holy roman empires either and i feel they too must be dabbling in this lot the winged lion stands alone he sighed anyway ill see you tomorrow in your case it will be a token appearance angelinas due in town overnight come to dorma for the night at least im worried about gelina she seems very moody these daysworse than usual marco held out his hands palm up to petro shes unhappy pregnancy can cause moodiness but i amalwaysher friend petro sighed given that youre married to angelina i cant say im unhappy to hear you say these things but shes always been unsettled moody the pregnancy has just made it worse but right now i think she needs a friend more than anything else in the world petro massaged his temple as if his head hurt itll be better once the babys here he told petro earnestly and then felt a lurch in his stomach himself lord and saints me and angelina married even if its only in name when i wantnow what he wanted would not satisfy anything or anyone but himself what he wanted was timeto turn time back time for himself and kat benito had told him hed seen her marco knew now that shed written that letter believing that well he could understand how she must have felt lord kat if id had any choice but he hadnt had a choice and now it was too late he couldnt back out of this not now not ever he still wanted to see her talk to her but benito had said that while she understood she didnt want to see him not now not ever a clean break was best he could understand and respect that chains of family and honor i cant say i blame you for staying roommates with that friend of yours over at the accademia petro continued looking up with a wry twist to his mouth there are times lately when i wish i could move out of venice entirely by the way those herbs you brought do seem to be helping mother it was an oblique sort of thank you but neither of them particularly wanted to openly allude to rosannas addiction to black lotosand that the only thing that could help the addiction was the substitution of the less potent blue lotos hopefully the addict could slowly be weaned off that im glad doctor rigannio was willing to trust me marco replied petro smiled faintly he was rather dubious at first but youve convinced him that you know what youre talking about in fact hes invented an old herbdoctor to account for the things you brought him and hes been leaking the information over to the accademia since the remedy seems effective im glad to hear it thatstuffits still a problem marco said soberly nothing seems to keep people away from it once they start youd think peopled have learned by now he shrugged petro shook his head people never seem to learn by his face unguarded for a moment marco could read the unspoken words not even mother petro dorma sighed but weve still got to try to help them he stood up and went to a nearby window looking out over the bacino san marco instead of the usual forest of masts it stood nearempty marco knew a dismissal when he saw one he stood likewise edged past petro to the door made the right noises and took his leave the justices thanked him for rendering medical assistance to the injured and dismissed him it still left marco shaking inside did they realize that he was the child of lorendana valdosta who had planned to give their venice to milan the world changed with ones perspectives hed spent years dreading that court those justices and now it was thank you signor valdosta dormas influence was not small and the valdosta name itself seemed to be a good and popular one well except with filippo recchia and that woman at the soiree at gian cecchis palazzo signora katerina montescue who had turned away rather than be introduced snooty even the brunellis were more friendly lucrezia to the extent that he avoided her what did the most courted and supposedly most beautiful woman in venice find attractive about him or did she pursue all men like this maybe the stories werent exaggerated he and rafael walked back to their rooms in companionable silence two bedrooms and a sitting room and even if it isnt dorma its a world away from anything ive ever had before yeah and im earning my way so tonight i will be nice to angelina still benito and i keep paying the rent for that little pit over in cannaregio we need some place nobody knows about and these days with the allowance we get we can afford it he felt guilty about the money benito had paid last month what spare he had hed actually spent on food that hed given to tonio for some of the children the trade was thin and canalpeople were getting thinner the kids were the first to suffer chapter trade was thin maria felt her ribs so was she nothing coming downriver a trickle of expensive food coming in from fruili nothing but some local fish coming in from the sea there was just no work available she rowed along slowly other boatmen were sitting idle too she might as well go home at least it would be cool she pondered over relationships in general and hers in particular lately all she and caesare seemed to do was fight it had been different back when they had first gotten together even once hed established a relationship with his protector ricardo brunelli he been gentle caring for a while yes in those early days hed been quite different back when theyd been arranging the smuggling chambers hed been a darling she sighed theyd yet to see a profit from that her cousins had painstakingly cut the chambers in the keels had put up the secret colleganza that paid for the cargo and not one of those galleys had come back the garavelli clan were the poorer for it and well nobody actually said it was her fault she sighed again most of their conflict came down to money really wellexcept their quarrels about kat caesare seemed to have a real animus against kat hed told maria to stay away from her that she was a case vecchie bitch how had he known she was case vecchie she hadnt mentioned it hows trade tonio had come up alongside while she was in her brown study slow tonio she said we need to take some kind of action but the doge is just sitting on things he can afford to we cant i got some more sick kids for young marco fancy him turning out to be a valdosta a good casa that in his grandpas day hes still seeing kids why am i telling you this you know tonio shrugged si ill go there this evening but likely enough hell say they need more food and thats what i want to talk about maria garavelli hes the only case vecchie we know to talk to you know him specialwell hes tied in with dorma theyre a good house look after their peopleand petro dorma was the only one who stood up to the dandelos dormas got influence now lots of it you tell him the popli minuta want the doge to stop playing with his toys and sitting on his ass boats are only going as far as ferrara maria snorted youre behind the times tonio ferrara is being attacked by condottieri from bologna and milan nothings going up the po at all merda tonio spat into the canal why dont we at least go to the help of the old fox the duke delleste was a good friend to venice back before we argued about the salt pans whats a few salt pans we need trade maria laughed wryly we need you on the council of ten tonio the lean tonio acknowledged a hit yeah well you tell marco huh his grandfather he should listen maria pushed off you tell him tonio youll see him before me tonio looked uncomfortable si but hes got respect for you see you and that fancy man of yours tell him maria sighed ill tell him tonio but i dont think there is much he can do she rowed on up the canal heading home shed tell marco when she next saw him shed promised and a canalers word was always good but shed also tell benito he came to see her more often she smiled for a moment thinking of benito he was quite a boy although she wouldnt tell him that effective not like marco who might be a saint but would still be seeing good in people while they slit his throat the canal by the waterdoor was limpid with not even a ripple around the floating bits of garbage she tied up quietly maybe caesare would be home and they could spend the afternoon in lovemaking like they used to do the idea was attractive distracting she went in quietly and it rapidly became apparent that an afternoons lovemaking had been on someone elses mind too the panting and begging said theyd been at it for a while her mind in a furious turmoil maria went up the stairs three at a time threw the door open shed timed her entry well caesare was so preoccupied in thrusting up into his kneeling mount that he didnt even realize maria was there for a moment maria took in the white body slightly pendulous breasts the long elegant neck and perfect face complete with tiny mole above her mouth the face was flushed and prim mouth wide it was a double shock the last time maria had seen her she maria had had one of the womans spanish combs in her hair seeing kats sisterinlaw here mariahaving got this farsuddenly realized she didnt know quite what to do next she picked up the ewer and flung it at them as one might at a pair of dogs the water had the same effect my hair shrieked alessandra caesare abruptly parted from her grabbed for his rapier maria what the hell are you doing here i live here remember or maybe you forget like your promise that you were faithful to me that you loved me the woman now with a sheet around herself snapped get out you little dockside puttana hes my lover hes been mine for years long before he met you get out maria we can deal with this later caesares voice was dangerously even marias reply was not for you and me there is no later caesare aldanto were finished finished you hear me finished caesare advanced on her stark naked except for his sword get out get out now or what or youre going to kill me she snarled back right now she didnt care shed forgotten how fast and strong he was he grabbed her arm and spun her round and pulled it up behind her back his sword arm around her throat he hauled her painfully half off her feet down the stairs ignoring her struggles and screams shut up you bitch or ill give you something to scream about he took two fingers off the sword hilt and put them around the chain around her neck with a sharp fleshtearing jerk he snapped it tinkling the keys to the apartment onto the steps he pushed her past the steps thrusting her into the barred gate he picked up the waterdoor key youre going to get out of that door now and stay out he said grimly love you a canal girl i never did but you were very useful now youre not get out stay out and keep quiet im warning you i never do that twice maria felt something break inside her a tiny voice that seemed to belong to someone else said unlock the door then and as she stepped out into the summer brightness of venice she heard alessandras mocking laughter echoing down the stairs that used to be hers chapter benito was sick of it his transfer to the case vecchie world was going to drive him mad it was all very well for marco learning things he was interested in so far he hadnt even seen a dorma cousin he was interested in getting into the pants of let alone spend time in endless social chitchat with dorma was treating him like a child for crying out loud he was fifteen now a mere year and a half younger than marcowho was already married on the canals or even on the ships at sixteen you did a mans work only among the soft case vecchie did they give you another five years to grow up yeah sure the house was at sixesandsevens with angelina showing signs of being ready to pop he would take off again tonight seeing maria always cheered him up in the months since he moved in here hed been back to visit more frequently than marco had so he would be absent without leave again tonight from the soiree they couldnt sing anyway compared to valentina and claudia hed slip off to barduccis instead kat listened to the singing coming out of barduccis the place was less crowded than usual times were hard in venice although right now the casa montescue were having a run of unprecedented luck the coaster they used for transfers of gray merchandise coming in from the east hadnt had any cargos of stuff out of ascalon for a while but its everysecondday run to trieste was turning in a real profit for the first time ever and the little caique was one of the few ships they still owned outright covertly it was true and captain della tomasso was as crooked as a dogs hind leg and ran various dubious operations but right now his legal cargoes which belonged to the montescue and were just supposed to break even were making a small fortune for the first time in nearly two months the caique margerita had met a galliot that had made it through the blockade kat had a parcel from ascalon to collect delivery to run she had it easier than the galliot captain however he would turn in a fat profit truebut he was also having to face an interview with the council of ten tonight and the address to the grand council tomorrow all venice wanted to know what was happening it was a hard summer for trade for most people captain della tomasso had news that he couldnt pass on to most folk and for once he was dying to talk the dalmatian pirates a fleet from ancona and genoan fleet are in the gulf no sign of the galleys from the golden horn or the western fleet three years ago papa had parted with the western fleet at bruges even hearing it mentioned brought a pang to kat the citys not safe at night keep your crew aboard if you can there was another magical murder yesterday and the factions are blaming each other therell be knifefights tonight della tomasso was a bad man who ran a smelly evilcrewed little ship kat met him on dark nights off guidecca he never showed the slightest concern for anything except money she realized he was tense too with the first inquiry hed ever madein two years of collections you going to be all right kat yeah ill be fine she said ill stay on the lagoon not go through town and deliver in the early morning when do you sail im running some messages as soon as they arrive he snorted for the churchmen would you believe it kat chuckled doubtless the metropolitan came to you personally nah this german bunch theres a lot more of them sitting in trieste della tomasso looked vaguely alarmed i never said that who am i going to tell captain asked kat dryly anyway the winds getting up id better go della tomasso nodded stiff land breeze coming maybe a storm later the row up the guidecca canal against the wind was a stiff one after a while kat decided that even the risks of rowing quietly through town were worth it it would cut her distance in half and avoid rowing against the wind there was definitely a storm coming benito walked out of barduccis the place had been thin on company and full of uneasy knots of people even the music that valentina and claudia chose tonight had been careful things were just too explosive in town rumors were circulating that a small galliot had arrived from downgulf bringing news of the blockading fleets rumor had everyone from the king of sicily to the ilkhan intervening we should side with milan we must call on rome a pact with emeric of hungary ha according to what benito had been able to pick up at casa dorma the case vecchie were in the same confused state and the doge wasnt doing a coherent job of leading benito shimmied up an ornamental pillar grabbed a cornice and headed for the rooftops the streets werent safe tonight and why take a gondola when he was short of exercise and liked the view from up here anyway mind you it wouldnt be pleasant up here for too long the wind was starting to blow he came down to canal level to cross a bridge over the rio di muti when he noticed a familiar gondola tied up there a lousy mooringa rotten old pole half under the bridge shadows maria what was she doing here this was way off her usual routes there was something in the bottom of the boat very cautiously benito pulled the mooring the something in the bottom of the boat sat up a bright sliver of steel in her hand maria garavelli said benito incredulously what are you doing here nito are are you looking for me there was a curious pitiful hopefulness in her voice no i was just going past benito took a liberty he climbed into marias boat you didnt do that without permission benito knew then that something was seriously wrong she didnt react whats up what are you doing here maria scudding clouds cleared the mooncrescent shining down on marias face those were tear tracks benito ignored the knife still in her hand moved uneasily down the rocking boat and hugged her she clung to him this wasnt like maria hed never seen her like this she was always so tough even when shed gotten away from the dandelos what are you doing out here maria he asked for the third time gently i she sniffed ive got nowhere else to go benito benito had a sinking feeling in his gut he knew the answer before he even asked caesare the apartment she swallowed he threw me out i came home this afternoon he was making love to another woman benito didnt know what to say so he just held her it was the right thing to do he said he never loved me he used me benito he used me and i loved him i wanted him so badly am i so ugly lord and saints no youre really well when i saw you in that outfit of kats i thought you were one of the most beautiful women in town youre a smooth talker benito valdosta but she didnt let go of him no its truth a dash of the old benito audacity returned you feel pretty good too this didnt get him the slap it wouldve normally earned him she leaned against him instead it made the gondola rock dangerously im too thin and my feet are too big benito clicked his tongue now what man is going to look at your feet so what do you look at benito benito realized he was in dangerous and unfamiliar waters um i like your eyes he was aware of curves pressed against him and what do you like about my eyes uh the way they spit fire when i look any lower down um not too low he hoped turning it into a joke would at least ease things she pushed him away the moon was out again and a small sad smile trembled at her lips she tugged at the cords of her bodicelacing his eyes almost popped out of his head as she spilled her breasts out of her bodice the white curves were hypnotic the nipples stood out sharply in the moonlight you mean these uh y yes stammered benito marias voice was still sad questioning doubtful benito i need someone to make love to me to kiss my breasts to tell me theyre beautiful to tell me he wants me benito valdosta found himself suddenly very dry in the mouth theyre really really beautiful theyre theyre his biblical lessons with the dorma pastor came to his rescue theyre like twin does its its from the song of solomon he said thickly she smiled a little come and kiss them now benito she lay back on the duckboards and pulled him down with her benito found himself exploring a nipple gently with his tongue her belly with a fumbling hand he was both more excited and more awkward feeling than he could ever remember this was no young boys eagerness even benito understood that for the first time in his life he was seized by a mans passion not for any girl but for a particular woman maria he was almost desperate in his desire to please her gently he told himself but maria was having none of it she was caught up in her own passionand a more furious one even than his her hands were tugging at his breeches cord the boat rocked wildly as he attempted to help youll have us over you fool that sounded so like the old maria that benito paused we shouldnt be doing this his body was betraying his mouth i asked you to benito she said a hand guiding i need aaha and after that there was no more talking for some time nothing coherent at any rate i think theres more water in the boat than in the canal maria said laughing softly ooh i am going to have bruises duckboard stripes on my behind the arms that held him tight didnt seem perturbed benito felt the trickle of water down his neck i think some of it is because its raining oh hell these are my only clothes benito stretched feeling her underneath him muscled yet soft um well ive got some ideas about that you cant sleep out here i havent got anywhere else benito said maria im not going back to the garavellis the cousins were very unhappy about my moving in with with caesare anyway ill sleep under bridges take me a few days to find my feet get together money for a place to stay what i was going to say is the next words came out in a rush there is ourmarcos and my old placein cannaregio its got no windows and its pretty noisy but well its a roof got some spare stuff there too she was silent for a few moments i dont want to be beholden there was a shutdown in that voice pure canaler pride benito shifted position slightly shivering the wind and drifts of rain had taken the heat out of what had been a sultry summer evening maria he said quietly gently you dont owe me anything marco and i we put a lot into paying back the debt we owed to caesare strikes me we probably owed you just as big a debt we kind of thought we were paying both of you back but it wasnt really like that was it we are beholden to you our place aint much but until you get sorted out its yours youre already wet its going to get colder marco would never forgive me if i left you out here he kissed her cheek then awkwardly theres no conditions attached or anything like that its yours she sighed benito valdosta you can be just like your brother sometimes benito snorted yeah but i lie down and it goes away marcos my conscience im just benitothe practical one and trouble come on im getting cold and you must be too ive got a warm heavy blanket on top but my back is tired of being wet lets see if we can sit up without having this thing over they managed maria saw to her lacing benito she said im sorry i used you i needed someone and i used you benito shrugged smiling widely i didnt exactly mind actually his smile changed into something very shy it was wonderful we men dont feel the way women do about it maria snorted she sounded almost her old self ive noticed so was it better than with that sarispelli girl uh now benito was embarrassed it wasvery different and yes much better he suspected his face was bright red the truth is maria he said very softly i think well theres nobody like you not for me anyway maria stared at him for a moment then she snorted again benito sometimes you say exactly the right thing whereabouts in cannaregio is your place kat cursed the rain if there was one thing about her nighttrips she hated more than anything else it was getting wet but shed decided to never shelter in a church again under san trovaso bridge was safer than san trovaso itself when the rain slacked off she headed on down the canal she decided shed been right to come through town it was safe enough there were few people about and they were hurrying to their destinations before they got caught by the rain again the torchbearers were scattered and lights from unshuttered windows were few she was not prepared for the shout from a torchbearer hes dead quickly come quickly bring lights the bishop is dead shutters flew open lights spilled onto the rainwet fondamenta and the canal kat put her head down and sculled and as she did so she saw a man slip from the shadows into the sotoportego but in the momentary glance she saw him clearly she started and their eyes met then she hunched her face down and sculled when she next looked he was gone and she was into the comparative safety of the grand canal there was no doubt about one thing shed seen eneko lopez and hed seen her and neither of them not her nor the creepy spaniard had wanted to be caught on the scene its not much of a place said benito anxiously surveying the tiny room by the candlelight it looked even smaller and dingier than he remembered maria smiled at him her hair was wetly plastered about her head somehow this and the candlelight made her definite features stand out the firm chin the straight nose and broad cheekbones it looks like heaven compared to the boat in this weather going to have some baling to do in the morning she shivered so how about you help me light this fire sure he knelt in front of the prepared kindling and took a candle to light it theres some dry gear here he pointed to the cupboard boys clothes im afraid but theyre dry you should fit into them and weve got blankets and theres some wine some grappa some almond biscotti but thats all the food im afraid he blew on the fire it caught sending small tongues of smoky flame to nibble at the bigger twigs he turned around to see her still standing there dripping those were tears adding to the wetness he went across to hug her whats wrong nothing well everything i was going to say youre a good kid benito valdosta she sighed only youre not a kid any more and im not as strong as i thought i was can can you stay a while sure said benito letting go of her and going to the cupboard he unstoppered the bottle of grappa with his teeth then poured a generous dollop into a cracked mug and took it to her here get yourself outside this let me get you out of those wet clothes her teeth chattered against the edge of the mug she drank i can deal with it myself benito went on loosening the laces i saw it all earlier maria do it yourself if you like but i want you out of that wet stuff wrapped in a blanket eating biscotti in front of the fire in two minutes or ill do it for you this drew a smile help me then you can be really bossy benito valdosta uhhuh and who do you think i learned it from she laughed well youd also better get out of that wet stuff before i help you benito took a deep breath he wasnt naive enough not to see certain inevitable consequences coming and he was quite shocked when he understood how much he wanted them to this cant be happening cried out some little corner of himself you idiot youll turn into a fool like your brother the rest of him however as his hands drifted across marias shoulders and backso feminine for all the musclehad a different opinion shut up boy the next hours seemed almost like a dream to benito in a bed well lit by candlelight maria was not the fierce and dimly seen rutter she had been in the bottom of a gondola lit by nothing more than a crescent moon there was nothing of the hard canaler left in her now she was soft rounded smoothmore velvety and gorgeous than anything benito had ever imagined the muscle was still there the strong arms and legs coiled around him in passion gave proof of that often enough but benito barely noticed his entire existence seemed nothing but a world of warmth wetness softness all aglow with candlelight and his own dreams finally boiling to the surface the first time he told her he loved her maria didnt even scowl at him indeed she smiled you dont have to say that benito she murmured softly i wanted to he insisted feeling a bit of the old street savvy wailing somewhere in his heartyou idiotbut not much hardly any in truth maria shook her head pleasedont the word is cheap caesare showered me with it like false coins i dont want to hear it any more so he subsided for a time distracted easily enough by marias next wave of passion she might not want to hear the word with her ears but every other part of her body seemed eager to listen besides it was hard to stay poetic with maria she made him laugh too much when she wasnt criticizing him that is usually both at the same time what did that silly sarispelli teach you anyway she grumbled at one point im not a wooden plank being nailed on a ship you know and that thing of yours is way too big for a nail in the first place by now benito was relaxed enough to give an honest answer hey shes nice i dont think she really knew any more than i did guess not agreed maria benito was even relaxed enough to be smart instead of streetsavvy stupid show me then please good boy gurgled maria happily and proceeded to do so some time later as she cried out with pleasuremuch louder than she had beforebenito whispered the words again moaned them rather since he was awash in his own ecstasy maria slapped the back of his head sure enough but that done the same hand which slapped began to caress and clutch and stroked him softly and steadily as they lay in each others arms afterward pooled in their own moisture that stinking bastard aldanto was good for something maria whispered i give it to you as a gift i love you he whispered back she didnt slap him this time but her hand came up and closed his mouth dont benito please tonight is too special for both of us just let it be what it is thats all he never spoke the words again that night even though it lasted almost until dawn before he finally fell asleep not long after maria he raised himself on one elbow and gazed down upon her nude body lying next to him he had never seen anything so beautiful in his life and knew that he never would fifteen years old be damned some things are certain still he didnt say the words even though she was no longer awake to rebuke him in some obscure way he couldnt he puzzled at the problem for a bit just as he drifted into slumber it came to him he could never steal anything from maria he realized not even words of love chapter we have the dagger its a ferrarasteel blade with scarlet and blue tassels said retired admiral dourso one of petros fellow signori di notte we have the witnessesone who saw him lurking in the alley and two who heard him utter angry threats at the bishop you were there it was the night he was arrested in that affray with the knights and servants of the trinity petro dorma took a deep breath bishop capuletti was killed at about midnight the admiral nodded the body was still warm when it was found just before midnight the clothes were barely wet im sorry petro i must take marco valdosta into custody petro shook his head at his older colleague admiral i havent had much sleep i must tell you that some hours after midnight i became an uncle it took the saltandpepperhaired admiral a few moments to work this out valdostas child petro thought the little girl looked very like its father but that was another matter for later my sister angelina has had a daughter yes the child is rather premature congratulations petro but the birth was attended by the doctor rigannio a midwife my mother countess marangoniand marco valdosta he assisted as he is learning to be a doctor angelina went into labor just before midnight at the soiree at the casa antorini which as you know is near the oratio del cruciferi petro walked over to the sideboard and poured each of them a glass of vin santo he handed the admiral one of the venetianware glasses so unless you wish to accuse my ward of witchcraft and having a doppelganger i suggest you look elsewhere for a murderer the time and distances traveled make it unlikely the witnesses who actually saw him help with angelina make it impossible when the admiral had left petro sat with his head in his hands someone had set out to deliberately incriminate marco it was pure luck that he had a castiron alibi this was plainly an attack on dorma somehow the deliberations of council of ten must have leaked this lot was bad enough without that angelina had spent half her labor demanding that caesare aldanto be brought to her and already this morning had summoned him to her bedside to demand the same an hour later the admiral was back not marco valdosta his brother benito was struggling to wake up having his room at dormawhich hed been back in for less than two hoursinvaded by petro another signor di notte and two schiopettieri was something of a shock it was even more of a shock when they wanted to know where the hell hed been last night they didnt find his refusal to answer at all satisfactory benito valdosta i must ask you to dress and come with us said the saltandpepperhaired exadmiral turned signor di notte you will be charged with the murder of bishop pietro capuletti ha kats grandfather came into the breakfast salon where kat was picking at a bowl of frumenty i told you girl blood will out theyve arrested that damned valdosta boy for murder kats chair went flying the fragile bowl was dropped shattering on the fine intarsia floor as she leapt to her feet she felt blood drain from her face what the old man rubbed his hands in glee ignoring the destruction that valdostapig i went to see dourso this morning just checking things out for you girl and he was just on his way to arrest marco valdosta for the murder of bishop pietro capuletti ha did you do this she demanded furiously did you engineer this grandpapa lodovico montescue shook his leonine old head i wish it were my doing but theyll have his head anyway he said with great satisfaction kat stared at him he wasnt even born when you had your stupid fight you crazy old man he doesnt even know who you are she stormed out katerina where are you going he hurried after her as fast as his old legs could manage over her shoulder kat snapped to hand myself over to the justices at the doges palazzo for murdering bishop capuletti stop katerina you cant do tha his voice was cut off by the great front door closing a passing gondolier answered her hail and kat in a turmoil of emotion set off to rescue marco marco valdosta stared incredulously at his brotherinlaw you just let them take him away petro threw up his hands helplessly he has witnesses a ferraramade knife with house tassels ill swear its not benitos but it looks bad and then your brother refuses to say where he was last night marco steepled his long slim fingers ten to one hell have been doing something for caesare aldanto probably with maria dorma leaned forward who is this maria there was no sense in pulling punches shes a canalgirlthe one who was abducted by the dandelos she lives with caesare aldanto hes worth asking about this if anyone will help benito its him ill have some of my people go out and fetch him he stopped marcos reply you will stay right here marco under my eye youll accompany me to hear the galliot captain address the senate at midday you will be seen this is intended as an attack on dorma i wish i knew by whom marco shook his head the knife is too obvious petro why would he leave it behind exactly said petro but theyll claim it was wrestled from his grasp by the dying man marco took a deep breath who are these witnesses petro and tell me about this knife by the description the knife is one with the main gauche you and benito carry as for the witnesses its a filippo recchia and vittorio toromelli boys from respectable rising families petro dorma was one of the most phlegmatic of the case vecchie he was totally unprepared for marcos harsh laughter he positively gaped marco stood up petro i think we can deal with this and find out for you exactly who is trying to get at you can we arrange to see the justices before the senate address it should be possible yes said petro why marco smiled like a shark they came here looking for me first right recchia and his buddy toromelli know me im willing to bet they dont know benito they know i have a younger brother but he doesnt show up at the accademia and he hasnt been to any major functions with you were trying to polish out the rough spots said petro with a smile hes been to three private soirees he should have been at last nights one that would have been the first time you were on show together they claimed they saw me then when you provided an alibi for me they changed it hastily to benito were going to trap them they dont know that we dont even look alike dorma realized that marco was right they dont look alike not in the least if i hadnt knownif duke delleste had not warned mei never would have guessed they were brothers even halfbrothers petro sat back in his chair and rubbed his hands thats not all he said they claim to have heard you swearing revenge on the night of that abortive raid by the knots on that supposed strega circle except for the time when you were in with mealone without anyone to claim to have listenedyou were with the injured including a knight of the holy trinity he rose and began pacing slowly about i wonder if the injured have been called as witnesses ill ask the abbot to send that knight to the justices sachs should agreehe wants back into my good books after that fiasco at the accademia dorma rang a bell and then he wrote a hasty note the runner came up and was dispatched well i think we shall go across to the doges palace good said marco grimly because i have another string to this bow if that blade is like this one if we can get it to ferrara then my grandfather can tell us exactly who it was sold to i want them petro looked at the intent pacing marco ive never seen you like this before my boy they threaten my family petro filippo recchia has let his little grudge against me put benito in prison for murder i wont allow that if necessary i will kill him and his friend myself because i can if i have to or i will pay aldanto to do it petro stared at his young brotherinlaw he had never seen marco in such a state and was just realizing that the years in the marshes had left an imprint a rather savage one i glad were family valdosta he said wryly the piazza san marco was already crowded all ten of the justices were in their chambers most of the senators were also there in the palace it was not hard for someone of petro dormas standing to ask the chief justice with two of his colleagues to have a preliminary hearing on the holding in captivity of the suspected murderer benito valdosta with a couple of eminent senators for witnesses this affair is political explained petro we are likely to take political actions this afternoon so this may have a bearing two schiopettieri were sent off to find masters filippo recchia and vittorio toromelli marco was able to direct them to a couple of likely taverns another three were sent to round up another five boys of between marco and benitos age they waited on them and the arrival of the knights of the holy trinity abbot sachs looked thin on patience he didnt get up when erik entered but remained at his piled scriptorium i have all this correspondence from our courier out of trieste and now this note from dorma it seems betternatured than our last encounter and we could still use the mans good graces he wants von gherens and any other of the knights or servants of the holy trinity who were with the injured in that raid of ours at the accademia go ritter take von gherens he is up on his feet again brother uriel helped attend him too along with that student take uriel along go he shooed erik was only too glad to go the embassy had been full of things going on for the last while that he wasnt on top ofand whose consequences for manfred worried him he wanted out for both of them he didnt ask permission to take manfred he could always claim that hed needed manfred to support von gherens so what if manfred had been safe at the embassyactually with francescathat night the palace was crowded but a couple of schiopettieri were waiting for them at the doors and escorted them to petro dorma who was sitting with a couple of the venetian justices and a stripling erik recognized it was dormas ward yes he had been there at the raid von gherens probably owed his leg to the boy and one of the students probably his life erik hadnt put two and two together at the time there had been other things on his mind petro dorma greeted them so abbot sachs was not able to come personally a pity but never mind we need you as witnesses to the truth or falsehood of a particularly unpleasant accusation we are questioning statements allegedly made by this young man do any of you recognize him he pointed at his ward uriel von gherens and erik all nodded dorma smiled right if you dont mind could you wait in the antechamber you will be called one at a time ive sent for some wine manfred brightened visibly ill stay here and look after the wine he said cheerfully i wasnt there dorma smiled humorlessly i suspect the accusers might well not have been there either this way gentlemen filippo recchia the handsome and wealthy champion fencer looked sulky angry and just a little overawed his sycophant vittorio just looked terrified they were led one at a time to bear witness dorma insisted they each testify separately recchia spoke first his face stiff but seemingly calm he was angry he said to that friend of his rafael de tomaso i wish wed killed all of these german monks and knights i wish we could get rid of bishop capuletti i would do it myself if i had half the chance one of the justices pointed at marco and it was definitely this man who said that both filippo and then vittorio confirmed the statement yes they knew him well would recognize him with certainty but it was not him you saw lurking in the alley next to the fondamenta pruili the justice asked recchia i thought so your honor but i realized i must be mistaken and it must be his brother ah but you saw him well enough to recognize him recchia crossed himself my oath on it thank you stand down signor recchia marco watched as the first of the knights was called what if he were part of this conspiracy fear of the knots and their reputation rose in his throat as the young blond knight with the chiseled features took the stand unnecessarily it seemed no he was with us all the time from when the schiopettieri arrived until we were summoned individually and did he at any stage say anything about killing anyone the knight erik hakkonsen frowned no definitely not he said very little his attention was on the wounded a good young fellow an innocent bystander who came to provide assistance thats all the knights of the holy trinity are in his debt and do you remember these two the blond knight pointed at vittorio him he was very drunk kept singing some of your schiopettieri would remember him the justices then called the next witness von gherens who seconded hakkonsens statements and echoed his praise of marco then brother uriel came along as usual he didnt mince his words they swore they heard what he demanded when told again he snorted derisively absolute lies theyve broken their oath sworn on the holy bible get your metropolitan to excommunicate them vittorio went pale but filippo laughed who do you believe good venetiansor foreigners and halfbloods like this valdosta hes mongrel ferrarese not venetian and ferrara will be history soon the chief justice just shook his head signor recchia come through to the next room and point out the younger valdosta you did see him clearly did you not it wasnt daylight but i saw him clearly enough to think it was marco valdosta at first recchia spoke with supreme confidence the confidence disappeared when he saw the six young men all wearing dormablue hes not here indeed he is countered the chief justice sternly point him out put your hand on his shoulder eventually recchia chose the tallest a young man with straight dark hair him hes valdosta the young man accused got a very alarmed look on his face i am not he protested im enrico battista everyone will tell you so im just a pastry cook benito curlyhaired stocky benito who had been through very little sleep arrested for murder thrust in jail hauled out and made to dress in dorma livery by two schiopettieri and wait while this figlio di una puttana lied about him started laughing and then before anyone could intervene he hopped forward and grabbed filippo recchia by the silk shirtfront marco watched as benito kneed straightnosed handsome filippo championofthefencingsallerecchia in the testiclesand then punched his face once twice as he bent forward marco noticed that the huge solid young knight who had wandered in put his glass down and clapped once twice before the schiopettieri dragged benito off recchia the chief justice managed to keep an absolute straight face he was possibly the only one in the chamber to do so perjury and the bearing of false witness especially in such a serious case as this is a serious offense with which you will be charged filippo recchia and vittorio toromelli your false testimony also places you under extreme suspicion of being party to the murder i was in zianettis choked recchia still clutching his groin i can prove it i was nowhere near the scene i just heard about the dagger and enough the chief justice silenced him benito valdosta brawling in public places carries certain penalties you are hereby fined one ducat considering the extreme provocation when that is paid you are free to go then he paused wait there is still the matter of the dagger and your whereabouts last night ahem petro cleared his throat the dagger was a transparent attempt to put blame on valdosta anyone could buy one and color the tassels only a fool would use such a weaponand leave it on the scene eh your honor in my opinion its a base political thrust at dorma as the valdosta boys are my wards and my kin again he cleared his throat as for the refusal to say where he was your honor a gentlemans obligations you understand a young lady by the name of mariano last names pleasesurely no one will insist marco watched his younger brother blush absolutely puce how the hell did you know benito demanded not even the chief justice could keep a straight face any more the door to the chamber burst open marco saw an extremely distraught sobbing case vecchie woman standing there it took him a few moments of incredulous staring to realize that it was kat i she swallowed ive come to confess i murdered bishop capuletti on the fondamenta pruililast night just before midnight the chief justice looked at her ah the mysterious maria she looked at him in puzzlement no katerina montescue a look of wary understanding dawned across the chief justices face he was after all a man of about sixty who knew a great deal about the wrangles of the various families of the case vecchie he looked at benito valdosta then at kat and you would be lodovico montescues granddaughter his voice held both understanding and trepidation kat nodded the chief justice shook his head no wonder he sighed i suppose i can expect old lodovico here any minute with real murder in mind the campanile bell chimed when it was still the chief justice continued but right now i am going to listen to the captain of that galliot out all of you except recchia and toromelli they can remain with the schiopettieri until i return he looked at benito you might have been safer in jail boy chapter the passage outside was full of people anyone with the least excuse was hurrying to the great council chamber marco as the oldest valdosta was supposed to be there so was petro dorma marco was instead engaged in hugging kat petro took a deep breath i suppose as angelinas brother and head of casa dorma i should ask for an explanation or at least a formal introduction he sounded resigned flushing a little marco broke from kat petro this is kat this is the woman i i would have married if i hadnt married your sister oh petro had the grace to look a little embarrassed dont worry said kat there is nothing between us she sounded slightly wistful um yes i suppose id better go and listen to the captain and hear what the doge has to say said petro uncomfortably katerina smiled were under blockade by the genoese the dalmatian pirates out of the narenta and a fleet up from anconapresumably supplied by rome there is no sign of either the eastern or western fleets the captain came island hopping from ascalon and sneaked up the coast at night having heard about the blockade in corfu which is more than he will tell you it was petro dormas turn to smile and as i helped to draft the doges response i dont need to listen to that either on the other hand kat added no longer smiling i can tell you who killed bishop capuletti she never pantdid it dorma it was lodovico montescue red faced with rivulets of sweat on his choleric face he looked ready to keel over grandpapa away from him girl the old man went off into a paroxysm of coughing benito quicker on the uptake than most grabbed a chair from against the wall and sat the old man down on it thank you youre a good lad listen dorma my granddaughter knows nothing about this killing i do kat said firmly lodovico shook his head shes got a maggot in her head about this marco valdosta here but leave my granddaughter out of this ive forsworn my vengeance against casa valdosta anyway marco stepped forward kat isnt implicated and i wont let her be not while im alive lodovico looked at him in some surprise what who made you free of my granddaughters name but thats well said for a valdosta he granted grudgingly petro laughed theyre none of them guilty montescue it was an attempt to falsely implicate them and through them me we dont know who killed the bishop i told you interrupted kat i do i saw him just after the killing it was that spaniard senor eneko lopez petro dorma put his hand over his eyes you saw him actually do it well no admitted kat i saw him running away from the scene petro looked at her with absolutely no expression if i asked what you were doing there just before midnight would i regret it marco beat lodovico to the punch yes just leave it please petro well follow it up through that dagger if we need to well take action forget the court we can even call aldanto in if need be lodovico looked at him very speculatively but he nodded approvingly started to speak but his words were lost in the thunderous applause from the piazza when the cheering had died down kat asked whats happening lodovico smiled crookedly i think katerina that venice just went to war if they have any sense theyll pick off our enemies one by one dorma nodded approvingly correct the scaligers in verona first we need fruili secure the other vultures will try to attack the republic on other fronts when were engaged dorma nodded again thats why im supposed to organize the formation of a militia angelinas been at me to engage caesare aldanto to head it marco what do you think marco found himself in a quandary he owed caesare lord knew hed owed caesare but venice stood in danger he has been a soldier he served with sforza dormas eyes narrowed i read caution in what you say ill employ him with caution youre very honest marco good said lodovico montescue his snowy brows drawing together because i need to ask some honest questions which need honest answers dorma sighed ill leave you to ask them signor montescue just remember my arm is very long this was said completely pleasantly and urbanely yet the feeling of power and potential threat went with it but now my duty to the republic calls i shall see you boys at the casa dorma tonight lodovico montescue watched him go francesca said he was the rising man and i should throw him my support i can believe her now he turned to face the youngsters but ill throw him my support soon enough for the momentmarco valdosta answer me honestly what are your intentions as regards my granddaughter looking at him marco knew that if he said the wrong thing no threat of dorma or even the doge would stop this fierce old man none im married i have a baby daughter but he paused if that were not the caseand kat would have meid have married her even if you or hell stood in my way i was a fool not to have asked her the moment i saw her kat leaned over him and if you lay just one finger on him ill ill montescue patted her arm smiled his crooked smile hes very like his grandfather luciano one of the good valdostas gentle and soft but good steel underneath i tried to have you killed once boy my best chance came nearly two years ago now my agents searched ferrara milan even rome then i got word one had found you here in venice he never came back for the bounty i killed the assassin said marco quietly it was an accident and i was lucky lodovico snorted luck i doubt that any more than it was luck that enabled you to evade my spies thereafter he coughed who were i admit not the most competent at their trade his granddaughter was glaring so fiercely at him that the family resemblance not usually that noticeable was now obvious old montescue winced i gave it up entirely anyway kat a few months ago stopped even looking for the lads after francesca he coughed again well i had a dream also about my boyhood friend luciano i woke up thinking i had ordered the death of a boy like luciano it was chilling he made a bit of a rally presenting a stiff face to marco so i called off my dogs boy but i still think your father had my children killed i wont bring his sins on your head my vendetta is over and i have given my word but there can be no friendship between you and katerina with this between us not even an honorable one you have your life and your wife go and live that life with your wife and i respect your decision responded marco just as stiffly but i must know one thing did you have my mother killed the whitehaired head of the casa montescue shook his head no her defenses were too good i wasnt really hunting her anyway i wanted the valdosta sons you in particular word of a montescue i didnt have anything to do with her death she was involved with montagnards you know the only ones who could have easily penetrated her defenses are her own people marco nodded thats what chiano and my brother both said i chose not to believe them for years the old man struggled to his feet both marco and benito stepped forward to help he waved marco off ill take this other dorma lads arm valdosta im not ready to take yours marco nodded ill meet you at the foot of the winged lion of saint mark benito goodbye kat kat found herself unable to speak her eyes burned but she managed a tremulous wave they set off leaving marco behind in the rapidly emptying piazza benito provided support for the old man who leaned on his shoulder sorry boy that was too much for me i ran im too old he sighed sir um ive got a suggestion your granddaughter katerina going out on these night trips on her own its not safe sir benito ignored the poisonous look kat gave him the old man sighed again youre right boy but im too old these days and who else do we trust as it happens i have someone you can trust absolutely good with a knife too and knows how to keep a still tongue old lodovico shook his head montescue cant afford any bravos boy certainly not good ones and im not having kat going on these night trips with a man benito smiled maria is no bravo sir nor a man and i reckon kat can trust her she owes kat and she doesnt forget a debt kat stared at him maria but what about caesare he threw her out tell her to come to me said kat decisively her grandfather actually managed a chuckle that was a good sign minx we cant afford any more people we can afford a roof and food and maybe a bit for risks the old man shrugged find a roof that doesnt leak at montescue these days but youve made up your mind kat i know im wasting my time you wont regret it sir said benito earnestly ill get word to her kat she needs a womanfriend right now might take her a day or two to make up her mind huh shes really stiffcanaler proud but ill talk to her well can i call you a gondola thank you youre a good lad dorma benito smiled my name is not dorma sir its valdosta the good one is my brother they were silent for a good part of the voyage finally lodovico sighed so i was wrong about them but kat the montescue will not pursue the vendetta my promise but he is married katerina i want your promise you will leave him alone kat sighed it wouldnt make any difference you dont know him he wont do anything no matter what sometimes grandpapa i think we could choke on our own honor and marco is like that dorma tricked him into marrying that sister he had to do that child lodovico said stiffly you shouldnt know about that sort of thing but honor demands ill bet that child has a good chance at a blond head of hair grandpapa snapped kat angrily and not dyed blond like its mama either a short time after still angry kat was back to glaring at her grandfather and whats this mention you made earlier of a francesca telling you this and that surely lodovicos face was as stiff as a board my own grandfather kat wailed i cant believe it im not so old as all that he muttered my own grandfather ill kill her lodovico smiled wryly thats the spirit girl start a vendetta of your own kat choked on the next threat her grandfather shrugged she got me to stop hunting him you know your precious marco i mean kat swallowed well swallowed again well all right then maybe ill just break her leg lodovico shook his head firmly better to go for an arm good advice from an old vendettist her legs are awfully strong my own grandfather manfred poured some more wine into his glass hed paid very little attention to the justices order of eviction from the chamber and the two schiopettieri with the two false witnesses seemed very unwilling to give force to the justices words steel cladding and a reputation for mayhem had some advantages i think we should get back ritter said brother uriel sternly and not sit about idling with a glass of wine ritter von gherens needs a glass to build up his strength said manfred solemnly von gherens looked briefly startled but he caught on quickly thats exactly what brother samson the hospitaler said im feeling very weak after the walk brother uriel snorted and shook his head they might as well have their glass of wine said erik pacifically we wont get a vessel while the half of the town is here to listen to the report from this sea captain and von gherens is in no state to walk all the way home yet uriel accepted this and relaxed slightly true but i do not hold with too much wine drinking and i want to tell father sachs about the death of the bishop he was of course a soft venetian but open to pauline persuasion manfred put a booted foot up on the bench heh but the holy saint paul himself said take a bit of wine for the good of your stomach uriel brightened ecclesiastical argument and knowledge of biblical quotations was his weakness true but he made no objection to them pouring him a glass which he drank as he talked at length and he didnt even notice them finishing the rest of the bottle before they left finding him and von gherens a gondola was by this stage possible and manfred kindly volunteered erik and himself to walk its august manfred august in italy i sweat standing still when weve finished going to visit francesca which is what you intendi can tellwe take a boat in fact we wait five minutes and we take a boat to francesca just exactly what i was going to suggest said manfred chapter marco pulled himself back into the middle of his bed sitting on the handsome wool blanket crosslegged and pondering the silkwrapped sealed package that petro dorma had sent over by messenger there was more than enough light from his tiny slitwindow to read the inscription on the package by what means the dagger had been taken from the signori di notte and whisked to ferrara heaven only knew heaven and petro dorma marco opened the outer canvas then the box wrapped in it tipping out the package inside two handspans long narrow and heavy a main gauche in the new toulouse style marco knew that before he even opened the box hed hefted too many blades in his time not to know the weight and balance of a knife even with it well wrapped and in a wooden box he could tell silk cords twisted about the final wrapping inside the box in complicated knots red silk cords in patterns marco knew patterns difficult to duplicate the final knot had been sealed with a wax stamp imprinted with the delleste crest hazard those knots said and be wary you only tied a package coming out of ferrara with those knots when you thought there might be a possibility the package would be opened by unfriendly hands somewhere along the way all of which meant that this was the very blade that had gone upriver to ferrara and duke delleste the towns ironspined ruler the knife that had slain bishop pietro capuletti the ferrara blade a signed blade with the intaglio crest etched proudly on the pommel nut for all to see pointing straight to valdostaand another clan a venetian clan house dorma a new power and rising which made their situation more precarious than if they had been established moversandshakers guilt by association implicated casa dorma and most especially petro dorma who had taken in two longlost valdosta boys and had tied silken cords of tighter binding to marco and so to the steel of ferrara someone had used a ferrara main gauche to sever more than pietro capulettis life someone had gone to expensive lengths to bring a signed valdosta knife downriver to assassinate the propauline prelate marco rested his elbows on his knees and stared wearily at the thing bright on the dark wool blanket of dalmatian weave i didnt expect an answer so quickly maybe i ought to put off untying those knots my lifes complicated enough as it is but the knots and the message in them did not permit any such evasions particularly not now not when petro dorma needed any scrap of information however hazardous to counter the attack on their houses slowly reluctantly marco reached for the packet slowly broke the seal and gave the cords the proper twist that freed them the silk fell open falling on the open oiled canvas that had contained the box marco pulled the silk away and the knife slipped free of it the knife and a tube of closely written paper but it was the knife that held the eye shining beautiful in its way like a sleeping snake there was more in the way of an answer than marco had expected hed thought to get a simple note insteadinstead there were several pages all in the dukes precise hand marco picked up the letters and began to read petro dormas private study was bright as only the best room in a wealthy mans house could be walled on two sides with clear sparklingclean windows and high enough to catch all the sunlight available a beautiful cassone linenfold scrollwork on the polished wooden panels on the walls soft turkish rugs on the flooran expensive retreat fitting the head of one of the rising stars of venice both in commerce and government it struck marco that despite being balding petro was an incongruously young man for such an important post in a republic which traditionally favored septuagenarians and octogenarians for its leaders although not always especially in times of crisis purchased seven months ago by marchioness rosa aleri petro read his words dropping into the silence like pebbles into a quiet backwater cousin to francesco aleri he looked over the top of the letter at marco who was seated stiffly on the other side of the desk how certain can your grandfather be of this marco how can he tell one knife from another marco still had the blade in his hands and chose to show him rather than tell him he unscrewed the pommelnut and slid the hilt off the tang laying bare the steel beneath he tilted the thing in his hands so that it caught the light from petros windows and touched a hesitant finger first to the tiny number etched into the metal just beneath the threads for the nut then to the makers mark that was cut into the steel below the quillions where it would be visible this is a signed blade petro he said softly signed means special and special means numbered valdosta has always kept track of what special blades went where of course he added truthfully unless we get a blade back into our hands for sharpening or cleaning we cant know who gets it after the original buyer how many people know about this petro dormas eyes were speculative darkly brooding that we keep track marco considered his answer carefully not many outside the swordsmithy not many inside the swordsmithy for that matter except the ones making the signed blades i dont think mother ever knew or if she did shed forgotten it i doubt benito was ever told about it he wasnt really old enough when we left the duke me cousin pauli and whoever is working in the special forges maybe a dozen people altogether that much im sure of im pretty sure my grandfather was counting on me remembering the right corner of petros mouth lifted a little that remarkable memory of yours at work again hmm marco nodded grandfather showed me once how the signed blades were registered when he took me through the forges hell remember that i know he will so hell be pretty well certain i do and probably figured that was why i sent the knife to him so we have at the very least a tenuous link right back into the milanese camp and as far from senor lopez as possible he works for the grand metropolitan of rome of that much i am sure i am not sure just what hes doing here he and the two priests who came with him spend most of their time doing charitable work in the poorest quarters of the city but im quite sure thats not his ultimate purpose and i dont think ricardo brunelli really knows what lopez is doing any more than i do yet if your friend katerina is correct it was the petrine who was actually there interesting after a long silence marco dared well petronow what i need more aleri seems to have disappearedsince the day before milan began their embargo in fact yes i was having him watched it was as close as marco had seen petro dorma come to admitting that he was one of the shadowy council of ten that watched over the republics safety but he evaded us he is very good i believe he is still here in venice petro looked down at his desk i believe he may be sitting tight in the casa dandelo we are watching it but like news of condottiere frescatas success against the scaligers of verona there is nothing coming out not that we know of marco thought a while but the capi di contrada go in once a week to make sure there are no venetian prisoners and they happen to be capuletti supposedly loyalists of ricardo brunelli petro sighed leave me to it marco off you go so marco went but he didnt go very far just down two floors and over a few corridors to another officeone not nearly so opulent as petros but possibly more important to dorma prosperity francesco aleris cousin marco concluded he sat back on the hard wooden chair then continued with his own speculation not enough to convict anyone but maybe enough evidence to be embarrassing could be caesare aldanto leaned back in his own plain wooden chair and interlaced his fingers behind his blond head looking deceptively lazy and indolent marco knew that pose he also knew what it meant aldanto was thinking hard so why bring this news to me marco because i still owe you marco said bluntly because you may be playing milord petros game but that doesnt mean his coatll cover you if things get real sticky because i dont know if milord petro will bother to tell you or not he didnt tell me not to tell you and my debt to you comes first aldanto smiled very slightly and pointed a long index finger at him youre learning im trying caesare marco replied earnestly tisnt like the jesolo and it is there are still snakes only they dont look like snakes there are still gangs only they dont act like gangs how are you doing there seemed to be real warmth in aldantos murky blue eyes real concern of course that could just be concern over the inquisition taking up one of caesare aldantos best informers and one of the few folk who knew who and what he really wasbut marco didnt think so as much as aldanto couldand more than was safe or politiche cared for marcos welfare all right i think marco gave him the same answer hed given petro dorma aldanto laughed at that a deepthroated chuckle the past few months had been good to aldanto and he and angelina were if not on friendly terms less at odds thanks to marcos work she no longer blamed him for her mothers perilous addiction to black lotos there was still tension in the air whenever they met but marco wasnt certain what the cause was could be just because its really caesare she wishes she had married that might be what kept setting her off into hysteria seeing as she and caesare could meet easily since aldanto had moved into quarters on dorma at petros urging this just brought the confusing issue of maria and benito to mind marco had tried four times so far in the last two days to corner his little brother on this one the last time benito had straight out told marco to keep off caesare had not mentioned maria marco wasnt sure how aldanto and she were doing the fact that she hadnt moved with him to dorma he must go back to the apartment and visit her but at least to marcos eyes the suite of rooms that the new head of the dormaordered militia occupied looked more secure than caesares old apartment marco could only hope that it was what aldanto made of the situation he couldnt tell he could read the man a little better these days butwell aldanto was aldanto and when he chose not to be read there was no catching him out part viii september ad chapter the first trickle of refugees came long before the official news from fruili then a flood of folk with their scanty belongings and terror in their eyes venices condottiere aldo frescata had sold the north to the scaligers of verona venice was cut off besieged only a few coasting vessels were going in and out and the only friendly port was trieste passage on those ships was only for the wealthy marco looked out on the piazza from an upper window in the doges palace the piazza was packed but the people were quiet and waiting he turned to petro dorma so what happens now petro sighed a good question we still hold the polestine forts and jesolo and chioggia and the lagoon but even my estates in istria might as well be on the moon and our enemies are flooding us with refugees so what are the grand council and the senators going to ask the doge to do petro snorted why dont we go and find out some of them will panic of course andneedless to sayothers will suggest inviting various parties in to protect us and you petro shrugged let them come to our lagoon the arsenal has been readying our answer we have better boatmen than the lot of them between the marshes and the water let them try the lion of the marshes has eaten armies before and they know that what about food asked marco already that was starting to affect the children of the poor believe it or not we started preparing for that nearly two months ago said petro quietly the warehouses at the arsenal will start to issue a ration its not much but we can hold out for a good while in the meantime were building up a fleet to go out to deal with the gulf pirates and ancona the genoans cant stay out there all winter our problem lies now with enemies from within marco found petros predictions startlingly accurate entirely so as he saw when the doge came out onto the balcony to speak to the masses thronging in the piazza marco along with the other three hundred and seventy case vecchie house heads looked out from the first floor loggia above them doge foscaris old cracked voice began to address the silent multitude the news that we have stockpiled food will reassure the people said petro quietly but the doge never got that far people of the commune of the great republic of venice we stand bloodied but unbroken by the treachery of the condottiere aldo frescata but the republic is a place of free people proud and secure in our lagoon a warbond will be raised to hire more men the militia will take over the guardianship of the city as the schiopettieri and militia units will be prepared for the attack volunteers are called for oarsmen and gunners for the new fleet the warehou there was silence then a great wave of muttering spread through the crowd petro grabbed marco we need to get up there fast the two of them were halfway up the stairs while the rest of the heads of the case vecchie were still looking at each other trying to figure out what was going on from the crowded piazza standing next to maria benito tried to work out what was going on hed come along to the piazza with her and half of venice to hear what was going to happen now one minute the doge had been addressing them the next the doges head slumped forward guards suddenly appeared in a wall around him and he disappeared from view what the hell happened whispered maria along with several thousand other people benito had gone to see her again early this morning in the hope that he could persuade her to go to kats house she was being damned silly about it and he couldnt work out why she also hadnt showed any signs of wanting a repeat of their one night togethera nights memory which for benito at least had become deeply important over the past month when hed finally gotten up the courage to suggest ityesterdayshed just said no and with maria no meant no she treated him like a friend like the maria of old but as if hed grown up a year or two well it was true he felt much older is it murder demanded ricardo brunelli marco looked up from where he knelt next to the doge hes still alive his pulse is faint and fast but erratic it may just be his heart or marco looked at petro could be poison ricardo brunelli looked at petro dorma and vettor benero the three of them the only senior collegio whom the guards had permitted onto the balcony what now petro gestured at the crowded piazza already the noise was alarming from down there tell them the doge has been taken sick and finish his speech we all know what he was going to say ricardo brunelli gave signor vettor benero a look designed to silence a matehunting tomcatnever mind the head of the propeacewithmilan faction ricardo cleared his throat then took one of the doges gawping trumpeters by the ear and said you sound that thing i want the people to listen to me the shrill of the trumpet and the sight of someone standing up to address them silenced the surging crowd marco was too busy applying his limited knowledge to examining the doge to pay much attention but it soundedby the cheeringas if the one thing that ricardo certainly did really well was give a speech and as marco examined him the doge did slowly begin to recover and so my fellow veneze to the ships ricardo boomed the doge opened his eyes i was going to say that quick said petro get him to his feet your excellency can you wave to the people foscari nodded of course he tried to get up but his frail octogenarian body was no match for marcos restraining arm its not wise marco said gently petro pushed him aside a lot more lives than his hang in the balance marco the doge is the servant of venice first take one side so doge foscari was able to wave to the crowd and reassurance rippled through it they would have been less reassured if theyd felt his body go limp in their arms and seen his eyes roll back as his head lolled turn snapped petro dorma and they took the doge away hopefully before the crowd noticed down in the crowd benito looked up to see his brother supporting the doge thats marco who said a neighbor marco valdosta supplied maria the new valdosta added another woman id heard he was a healer said the first with satisfaction the best said maria giving benitos arm a squeeze id trust him with my life never mind the doges heard he treats canalkids said someone else what dyou believe in unicorns too chuckled a welltodo merchant you watch your mouth mister said a brawny bargee valdosta eh good name in my fathers time you know he treated my little leonora as the crowd began to disperse benito had the satisfaction of realizing that at least among the common people of venice his brother was already well known and well liked unlike mercutio venice would not forget marco valdosta overnight he took a deep breath the capi are taking lists of volunteers over at the foot of the columns of st theodoro and st mark maria im going to volunteer for the galleys that are going to the polestine forts they havent said so but i think theyll make an alliance with my grandfather maria looked startled whats dorma going to say whats cae he going to say she still wouldnt say caesares name benito shrugged ive made up my mind marco would keep the name alive and he could get away from this situation of divided loyalties the more he thought about mariaand part of his mind wanted to think of very little elsethe more things he kept thinking of about caesare that bothered him bothered him a lot marco and petro walked slowly from the doges chambers where the old man lay under the care of doctors who really were the best venice had to offer the doge had regained consciousness again when he was ensconced in his great pilastered bed a tiny old man propped on mountains of snowy white pillows hed talked perfectly lucidly and with no sign of any impairment of his faculties for near on five minutes and then shuddered and lapsed into unconsciousness again im going to volunteer for the fruili force said marco abruptly petro stopped dead marco you cant do that venice needs you here marco shook his head i dont think more than two people in venice would even notice if i vanished in a puff of smoke petro angelinas daughter has a father benito can take over as the valdosta casa head and thatll please grandfather benito and he are like one another on the other hand those refugees from fruili are just the first im going to be needed there besides if i go with the galleys to the polestine forts ill possibly have to fight my grandfathers troops alliances in war are not always kind petro put his hands on marcos shoulders you dont understand marco casa dorma itself is on quicksand ricardo brunelli heads the prorome faction he regards himself as a certain candidate for the dogeship vettor benero holds the next largest slice of support he favors inviting duke visconti to share the doges throne he sighed the third weakest faction is mine we stand for the republic remaining independent as doge foscari does he sighed again i tricked ricardo brunelli this morning i knew by making him speak off the cuff like thatwhile he was shockedthat he would have no time to turn the doges speech to his own purposes that he would say what the council had agreed to ricardo doesnt think fast on his feet but he isnt stupid he is going to work it out and he is going to add it to his list of reasons to make dorma an enemy of the state and as for benero ive been trying for months to find out just how he is getting gold from the montagnards he wants my head marco dorma has only a few real assets the militia which caesare commands for me and you dormas wealth is tied to our shipyards which is tied to timber which comes from dalmatia its not going to take the wolves long to realize that if we have lost dalmatia dorma has lost its wealth then i only have valdosta and delleste marco shook his head grandfathers condottieri have lost reggio nell emilia to the milanese modena is under attack by the bolognese este is under siege by scaligers the delleste well everyone thinks theyre finished even my grandfather must think sothats why he sent the sword here as for the valdosta name well there is my brother and i dont think it is worth much valdosta you dont know your own worth said petro quietly and i will tell you privately we have signed a treaty with duke delleste the galleys going to the polestine forts are actually going to help him hes not called the old fox for nothing you know petro i know im angelinas husband and that as head of the house it is your duty to keep me safe but i am going to join the militia and go to fruili if the doge dies and they elect ricardo or vettor benero the treaty with grandfather will be broken ive heard both of them on the subject of the ferrarese petro rubbed his forehead well yes but while doge foscari hovers like this between almost dead and fully competentit is going to paralyze us every energy will go into factional fighting if he would get better we have a doge if he would lose his wits the senate would impeach him if he died theyd elect a new doge but like this venice is at her weakest i wonder if thats just not exactly what someone intends whispered marco i didnt say this before petro but that is like no disease i have ever heard of the way he is completely and immediately in possession of his faculties and then once again near death i wonder if this isnt magic petro took a deep breath i think well get that german abbot in to try a spot of witchsmelling and exorcism petro was looking at marcos face as he said this yes yes i dont like or trust him either hes a damned fanatic but hes a christian fanatic i wonder if we wouldnt be better off with a pagan muttered marco petro looked sharply at him dont say that to anyone else marco venice was the most tolerant republic in the world these magical murders have built up feelings to the point where just the smallest thing could spark the burning of the campo ghetto benito certainly didnt have marcos neat handwriting thought kat wryly i will be leaving with the fleet for the polestine forts tomorrow maria will be all on her own please kat can you go and see maria shes in our old apartment she wont talk about stuff with me she wont go to you ive tried benito there followed a postscript with directions to the apartment kat took a deep breath then went up to see her grandfather grandpapa remember that girl that that benito valdosta talked to you about im going to go and fetch her the old man smiled ruefully at her ive been thinking about that and about that boy the older one he reminded me of luciano tell me about him tell me about this girl i know too little of what you do out there she looked warily at him he smiled i wont be angry word of montescue youre the last of my blood girl and im beginning to realize ive been something of a stubborn old fool put the casa montescue before your safety and happiness without you there is no casa kat smiled back i am montescue too grandpapa except for getting wet i enjoyed doing it she sat down and told him how shed met benito how shed met maria how shed met marcoand how maria had escaped from the casa dandelo old guiseppe he was all for calling you to take action against the dandelo i pointed out he was right go fetch this woman cara mia i want her here old dourso needs to hear this too so kat left to go and fetch maria with lodovico montescues blessing it was heading towards sunset so with luck maria would be in the apartment by the time shed found her way down the narrow alley and up the dirty narrow stairs reeking of cabbagewater kat was glad shed got there before nightfall she was also glad of the weight of the pistol in her reticule maria opened the door cautiously kat she said incredulously how did you find this place benito told me can i come in yeah of course maria ushered her into the dark room you got trouble kat not more than usual listen i talked to my grandfather about you he wants to talk to you and i want you to come stay with me at casa montescue at least while the war is on maria put her head in her hands and shook her head fiercely that benito he doesnt know how to take no for an answer i cant do that kat why not youve got a formal invitation from my grandfather someone thumped on the heavy door who is it asked maria walking over to the door message from benito valdosta maria opened the door a crack to have it flung wide worked like a charm said the first bruiser grabbing maria and pushing his way inside another man followed him closing the heavy door behind him oh look luce said the bigger one there are two of them were gonna have us some fun first we thought wed have to take turns now we got one each an ones a dainty lil case vecchie matteoni filth spat maria dont hurt me oh please dont hurt me whimpered kat shrinking into a corner ive got money lots of money in my purse she reached into her reticule the one called luce ambled toward her chuckling evilly were gonna be paid twice stephano for somn id do for pleasure the endless practice that giuseppe had put her through paid off kat gave a moments thanks that shed followed giuseppes instructions to the letter and cranked the clumsy wheellock mechanism before leaving her house she didnt even try to take it out of the reticule she simply shot straight through it the pistol boomed and echoed in the confined space the noise and the smokenot to mention having the reticule blown out of her handconfused kat for a moment she just hoped maria would do whatever needed doing next maria knew what was coming just as soon as kat reached into her reticule in theory at least but she wasnt really that familiar with gunsknives were a canalers weaponand the noise and the smoke took her a little by surprise she was also unprepared for the way the heavy bullet catching him square in the belly slammed luciano matteoni back against the wall but unprepared or not maria was no stranger to violence the other matteonistephano that washis eyes wide and horrified was still distracted by the shocking sight of luce sagging against the wall maria snatched up the lampbowl and threw it at him the bowl hit stephano on the side of the head sending him staggering then caromed into the wall and broke the room was plunged into darkness the man might be bigger and faster than mariaand probably better with a knifebut she knew this place in the pitch darkness she had the small knife from the slit in her skirt out in an instant and began moving on silent bare feet toward the counter that held the water bowl she had no illusions that she could win a straightup knife fight with a professional matteoni thug but there was a cleaver next to the water bowl one good swipe with that heavy blade and if she could get the door open she and kat could run the darkness was full of kats screaming and stephanos snarls of rage maria shifted the knife into her left hand and lunged for the water bowl on the way she tripped over a bodyluce must have slumped from the walland cried out as she nearly brained herself on the far wall but then she had the cleaver in her right hand a huge meaty hand flailing about closed on her shoulder gotcha stephanos shout of triumph turned into a scream as marias small knife slashed at his face then there was a sickening thud accompanied by the sound of splintering wood the hand that held her in a grip of iron turned to porridge through the swirling mist of confusionfury and terror and darknessmaria realized that kats screams had been screams of rage as much as fear kat must have picked up one of the stools and brained the thug stand back kat she shrieked then pushing herself away from the matteoni goon by the simple expedient of stabbing him with the little knife againin the belly this timemaria swung a ferocious blow of the cleaver she felt the blade hack into stephanos skull frenzied she wrenched it loose and hacked again again again the last blow hit something softer than a skull and got wedged the mans shoulder apparently since a moment later she felt his heavy body slumping against her legs enough the door was behind her she pulled at it and it swung open showing twilit venice beyond kat lets go the two halffalling careened down the stairs and ran up the calle soon enough kat spotted a passing gondola and yelled for it as soon as the boatman drew alongside they bundled in if the boatman thought that they were an illassorted pairleaving aside the blood spattered all over mariahe did not let on where to signorinas casa montescue said kat firmly kat knew that she had to be firm she wanted to be sick she wanted to give in to the helpless shivers even in this light she could see that maria was as pale as a sheet cant whispered maria just for now said kat they were hunting you maria they knew exactly where to find youand how to get you to open the door how caesare told them it had to have been him why marias voice was small hurt by the betrayal maybe you know too much maria stared at her horror in her eyes i wouldnt kat shrugged a woman scorned might there was a long silence i always thought hed come back to me i i never wanted to admit it but i always hoped he would hes not going to maria thats why i want you in the casa montescue youre safer there for now he wont know maria laughed wildly oh yes he will do you know why i wouldnt come to the casa montescue because its where his new mistress lives or his old mistress i should maybe say the bitch said shes known him for yearsfrom before i met him that means during his days with the montagnards alessandra asked kat faintly my sisterinlaw maria nodded i didnt mean to tell you i thought it was angelina dorma maria snorted shes just had marcos baby its not marcos said kat fiercely maria gaped at kat as she worked it out then snorted just as fiercely sisteri think well kill him your marco is an idiot finally at that point reaction set in all the adrenaline possiblyalmost certainlykilling two men running away the emotionally shocking revelations the two girls clung to each other sobbing their hearts out while a stoical if puzzled gondolier took them on to the casa montescue he did shrug once the city was going to war after all many strange things would happen tonight it was kat who stopped crying first she swallowed maria when was caesare in venice first maria sniffed three years back when there was that plague outbreak my brother was still alive then it cant be true i mean i believe you about her being there with him now because because she said things about caesare and she got jealous as a cat when she thought i might be seeing caesare aldanto i wondered how she knew him but she couldnt have been false to my brother was he ever away from home asked maria dryly naturally he went to istria and the dalmatian islands we had property in spleto before emeric conquered it and he was off to the mainland a few times he always used to bring me things kat felt the longing for those carefree days in her voice kat heard the snap of teeth from maria kat i feel like that woman scorned you spoke about lets see how far jealousy will take that bitchy sisterinlaw of yours you pretend to be one of his lovers too and well add angelina if she just pushes us once why not said kat viciously i suppose that like us she might just be another woman whose life has been ruined by a rotten figlio di una puttanabut shes made my life a misery to say nothing of old madelenas madelena would kill alessandra if she knew my brother was the apple of madelenas eye let her take one step out of line and well go for her when they arrived at the casa montescue their plan was ready a whispered question to madelena as she opened the door established that alessandra was in one of the small salons upstairs go get grandfather madelena kat ordered softly bring him to the corridor just outside the salon but keep him outside the room until the right moment madelenas brow creased in puzzlement youll know when it comes hissed kat just do as i say when they entered the salon alessandra was inspecting her fingernails she didnt even look up just stared at marias bare feet grandpapa said youd gone out to fetch a new servant its about time we had some younger maids i was going to say i need a new one but i want someone who doesnt have dirty bare feet shes not a servant alessandra snapped kat shes a companion for my night expeditions alessandra snorted its a bit late for a duenna isnt it your reputations in tatters anyway not as much as yours you slut hissed maria alessandra finally looked up straight into marias angry brown eyes you she screamed leaping to her feet and retreating behind the chair youre supposed to be dead caesare she broke off gasping kat watched as maria tensed that strong jaw oh aldanto promises that about once a week maria said dismissively doesnt he kat kat chuckled as if caught by a memory which was halffond halfexasperated the sort of sound a woman might make thinking of a lover he is a liar not that he doesnt make up for it in bed alessandras face went from absolute white to blossoming little spots of red fury on her cheeks you lied to me katerina you little thieving bitch kat shrugged and paid off the scores of the last six years you lied to me too you should have heard him laugh about you this afternoon you lie you lie screamed alessandra i was with him this morning then he had to go to work this afternoongod i hate you thieving slut glancing to the side kat could see that her grandfather and madelena were standing in the corridor just outside the salon and had been there long enough apparently to have overheard the exchange just as she and maria had planned but the shocked pale look on his face made her nervous she suddenly remembered a bit guiltily that lodovico montescue was an old man with an old mans heart enough she thought id better not let this go any further calm down alessandra i lied but alessandras mouth had a mind of its own it seemed yesss she hissed you lie all the time caesare is mine mine always has beenfor years and years she glared at maria and he does what he promises for me too so you arent long for this world you bitch lodovico finally entered the room moving shakily i cannot believe what im hearing he whispered but madelena did the tiny little woman stalked forward pushing past her master youputtana you have betrayed the memory of your husband alfredo alessandra was in full virago fury by now knowing that shed already said too much and betrayed herself but she seemed still determined to cow them to shock them into submission oh it wasnt just his memory i betrayed alfredo thought he was such a lover but i needed a real man she gestured crudely lodovico straightened imposingly he was a big man with big shoulders despite his age you will get out of my house he said between gritted teeth alessandra sniffed disdainfully ha as if the montescue are going to throw me out as if you are going to tell the world caesare aldanto cuckolded your precious grandson if that is what i have to do to get this viper out my houses bosom then i will said lodovico montescue with a leaden voice you will go and you will go now can i throw her out for you offered maria advancing on her purposefully you keep away from me bitch shrilled alessandra this is all your fault and she swung wildly at maria with an open hand maria did not swing wildly and she swung with a fist kats sisterinlaw was slammed against the wall next to the window stunned she put her hand to her cheek a heavy bruise was already distinct against her fair skin you hit me you hit me you are going to die for this caesare will kill you then she turned on lodovico still standing by the doorway except for the cheek where marias blow had landed her face seemed as pale as a sheet but not from fear kat realized her sisterinlaw was consumed with an almost insane rage just as he killed your precious grandson alessandra shrieked and you thought it was valdosta or the plague ha everyone stood as if they had been frozen lodovicos next words came in a growl i must know did he also kill your child my pride and joy little lodo did he alessandra started no even if he cried all the time there was guilt in that voice so what did you give him to keep him quiet asked maria caustically grappa henbane alessandra stared at her then looked away almost furtively i never dosed him never she used to give him some stuff in a blue bottle said madelena suspiciously when she went out with him to her relatives kat gaped at alessandra laudanum you gave your baby opium in alcohol the bottle is still in her cupboard said madelena she told me it was for the wind madelena stared at alessandra is it bad for babies she whispered kat nodded marco says it is dangerous even for adults there was a long silence then lodovico said i have changed my mind i was going to throw you out to go and be the harlot you were born to be now you will stay and answer to the signori di notte alessandra smiled pure malice at him i dont think so old man ill go to my dear caesare hes a rising man not like the hasbeen casa montescue is and he owes me for all the information about your business ive given him over the years kat screamed no madelena no chapter darkness was falling like a soft shawl across a busy venice out on the lagoon the bargees were busy pulling out the last of the stakes that marked the safe channels only an invader who knew his way could come across the lagoon the arsenal would not sleep tonight queues of citizens waited for the issuing of weapons in campos across the city citizens of the new militia were drilling under schiopettieri instructors venice was preparing to fight for her life and also to strike back harrow was wrestling with a decision the boys had both signed up benito would be going off to the polestine forts marco was headed for fruili an ugly face and a bit of hard leaning had let him see both lists he was sure of it his inclination said go with marco but he was sworn to guard both boys he couldnt be in both places at once and the polestine galleys would be leaving first at last he decided to go and see luciano marina the man made him uncomfortable always appearing to have the light behind him but suddenly it felt very urgent very very urgent he walked into a noisy barduccis hed forgotten what taverns were like this was if anything noisier than usual with people who might be going to die having that last drink at their favorite wateringhole it fell quiet around him as he walked across to claudia need to talk to you need to see someone it was playing hell with his cover but right now he felt cover was less important than decisive action he felt the buildup of great and terrible things claudia recognized him what the hell do you mean by coming in here you fool she hissed need luciano he croaked cant find him claudia looked at him her eyes narrowed she put the mandola down and got up come she led him out of barduccis and at a jogtrot down towards the calle farnese into cannaregio up to a largish salon next to the rio san marcoula boatyard luciano was at drill practice too with the stregas tiny but grimfaced armmilitant to harrows surprise he realized that the eleven peoplea mixture of men and womenwere very good of course theyd be at a disadvantage with brassbound wooden staves against swords or axes come about marco croaked harrow luciano looked alarmed weve been watching over him our best people have met to scry his movements his danger the scryings show nothing hes signed up to go to fruili with the volunteer militia and benito is going to the polestine i dont know what to do luciano turned on claudia and you brought him here now about this claudia lifted her hands defensively he came into barduccis he said he needed you you said well i thought it must be urgent harrow felt as he were blundering about in a thick cottony fog it is urgent well it feels it must come to you must a wary look came over lucianos face chalk there is none here said one of the blackclad men make a pentacle of those staves then snapped luciano not two minutes later the wardcandles hastily contrived from oil lamps burned inside the circle invocation was begun harrow watched as a nimbus of light began to dance around one slight woman harrows scalp crawled treachery she said in a hollow voice the inner council is betrayed it is fogged from within go luciano the lions cub is in need lucianos faced grew pale betrayed he whispered no wonder the scrying circles have failed he rubbed his face looking now like a very old man i have been a fool he dropped his hand how could i have been so complacent of course the enemy would fight us magically as well i should have foreseen it who could do this demanded claudia who knows enough she broke off suddenly her eyes widening lucrezia brunelli who else replied dottore marina wearily she advanced far enough to learn most of our secrets before we cast her out he turned his head staring to the northeast she is working for grand duke jagiellon now be sure of it a second string to his bow which i missed completely in the end the demonnun ursula and her cohorts in the servants of the holy trinity are not quite a diversion but almost a clear and obvious danger to the stregato all of venicewhich disguises the more subtle one the naked dagger distracting our eyes from the cup of poison he shook his head vigorously the way a man does to clear his mind no time to waste the basque priest was right i finally understand the evil ones plan and it is more horrid than id ever imagined he began striding off gesturing for the others to follow and he was right about having a second string for our own bow he murmured too softly to be heard by anyone lucianos strega moved more cautiously than their leader if as fast as possible because they did not want to encounter either schiopettieri or the new militia the staves were relatively innocuouslooking true but they didnt need delays just because someone decided they looked threatening as a group so theyd split into twos and threes walking perhaps thirty seconds apart any troublesome schiopettieri would soon find himself outnumbered if there were too many schiopettieri the others would melt back and go another way lodovico looked at the roughly bandaged alessandra the woman moaned weakly we need a doctor who can hold his tongue he said grimly marco said maria immediately kat looked at her sisterinlaw and took a deep breath hell be at dorma its no use sending a messenger even if we could find one tonight dorma wont let him come out not to something that could be a trap lodovico nodded go bring the valdosta boy here bring both of them if you can it will give me a chance to make the apology i owe to both of them and if she dies i want her sunk in a canal far away from hereand the younger boy has the practicality to do that if she lives shell testify to the senate about this caesare aldanto the devil take the shame to the house i want him to meet the headsmans axe both of you go but take pistols loaded and cocked ill stay with the hellbitch if she should regain consciousness i want to hear what else she has to reveal about her treachery to my casa guiseppe went to get lorenzo he who had been their gondolier the night that kat had smuggled maria home maria found herself once again being hastily dressed from kats wardrobe ladies were much less likely to be interfered with and tonight there were certain to be a fair number of drunken roisterers about the floorlength dress bulked with petticoats wasnt going to show her feet ten minutes later they were headed for marco at casa dorma marco was packing up his books and medical gear rather more slowly than was strictly necessary it seemed to him that rafael was lingering similarly over his brushes and paints both of them were destined to join their volunteer units in the morning both were headed for fruili and would face some weeks of drilling and training before being flung into combat marco wanted to get back to see benito before the boy went off with the galleys headed for polestine on the other hand he didnt want to leave this apartment it represented fulfillment of one of his dreams he sighed hed have left it on the instant to see kat but the head of casa montescue had made it absolutely clear never again petro dorma had said the same if less directly petro dorma was facing katerina montescue at that moment he had in fact been about to step out when he had overheard the doorman saying no milady montescue milord marco valdosta is not at home neither is milord benito well see petro dorma then said a young woman decisively milord petro is not available signorinas better to deal with it he decided montescue was only one vote but once that casa had been a real bastion against the montagnards the daughter of the house was plainly still besotted with marco the old man could become an enemy if this was handled wrongly and even one vote in the grand council could be of huge value he stepped out ill see them paolo escort them to the blue salon we just need to find marco said the other woman nervously in far from refined tones she sounded like a canaler petro turned his back ill speak to you in the blue salon kat thought it was a terrible shade of blue she wanted desperately to see marco again even if she couldnt have him she was also afraid that she might see angelina dorma her hands crooked into claws at the thought she might not be able to restrain herself but only petro was there you must understand he said gently that i cannot allow you to see marco your grandfather would not permit it kat handed him the letter that lodovico had written its addressed to marco but my grandfather said we could show it to you if need be petro took the letter doubtfully it carried the montescue seal he cracked it open and read the brief polite letter lodovico had scrawled well he bit his lip this puts something of a different complexion on the matter but im not going to run off with him snapped kat even though i would like to my grandfather has discovered that he was entirely mistaken about the valdosta involvement in our houses loss he wants to apologize to the casa valdosta her voice quavered slightly he is an old man and he and they may not live through this war and we have someone who is injured we would like marco to see thats all word of a montescue petro nodded hes over at his apartment near the accademia packing up he should be back soon if youd care to wait the other woman stood up giving petro a glimpse of her bare feet the unexpected sightthe dress was very finestartled him well get him there she said come kat i know where it is youdormatell benito that maria says hes to come to the casa montescue and dont you tell that stinking caesare aldanto petro was plainly unused to being addressed like this but hed picked up on the name maria maria nodded defiantly yep thats me come kat wed better move or that womanll likely die on us i should have thought to stop at the accademia on the way over marco took a last look around time for leaving he started to pick up his bags there were more of them than could be easily carried dorma could send someone over for the bulk of them in the morning he decided rafael nodded ill walk with you as far as the traghetto laden with the things that he felt he couldnt leave behindhis books and instrumentsmarco walked in awkward silence down the stairs and out into the narrow calle the first inkling he had of trouble was the boom of an arquebus followed immediately by what felt like a bull hammering into his chest the sheer force of it winded him knocking him down it sprayed the precious books it had struck into the street finish him yelled someone make sure hes dead a group of darkclad figures stood up from the cover where theyd been lurking in wait help yelled rafael a rescue and to marcos amazement a rescue came running down the darkened street a mercurio lux ferre that was lucianos voice the entire street danced with witchfire showing the mottled scarred face of harrow and several others with him the weird light gleaming on brassbound staves the five waiting assassins were trapped in the culdesac swords and knives were drawn to meet the challenge one of them ignored the fight and came on at marco who was strugglingwith rafaels helpto get to his feet it was francesco aleri rapier in hand marco stared at his death aleri yelled someone ive come to get you somehow that voice halted marcos nemesis bespi he asked incredulously yeah aleri me harrow had thrust his way through the melee ive come to kill you marco had never seen the big milanese trade ambassadoratlarge look anything less than utterly confident a few moments ago even when the ambush had turned into a fight in which his side was outnumbered aleris face had still worn that look now he just looked frightened youre dead harrow moved forward a knife in either hand no thanks to you that im not ill have revenge now aleri youre a dead man he feinted aleri had a rapier he was you could tell by the way he held it skilled in its use harrow only had two knives yet aleri was backing offand plainly badly scared it was an accident he protested this isnt going to be harrow snarled staring at the milanese with mad unblinking eyes aleri made a frantic grab for marco while holding harrow off with a sword it was a mistake harrow was far too good a bladesman even with knives against a sword for aleri not to concentrate on him completely the montagnard assassin managed to stab harrow through the belly with the rapier then harrows knives worked like a machine blood spouted everywhere coating both men the two sprawled to the ground aleri still barely alive stared at the sky harrow groaned once tried to pull out the sword and then lapsed into unconsciousness maria and kat were nearly knocked flying first by a blackclad man and then by a man and woman with brassbound staves they stepped into the little calle where marcos lodgings were pistols at the ready the shutters were open and light was flooding into the street marco was kneeling beside the burntfaced man working on him feverishly even from here kat thought his efforts were probably pointless the swordhilt was flush against his body she and maria rushed forward as they kneeled next to marco the man halftrapped under the burned man groaned and blinked at kat youll have to kill him yourself lucrezia my love kat winced at his wounds the mans body was soaked in blood trying to avoid the horrible sight of his woundsshe could see intestines bulging out through one of themshe concentrated on his face she knew him she suddenly realized this was alerithe man shed seen kissing lucrezia brunelli at the mouth of the alley plainly his blurred eyes in this lamplight saw her redgold hair as being that of lucrezia and lucrezia brunelli had plainly told him to kill marco she shook his shoulder hard a moment later as she demanded why she realized that her hand was covered in a warm wetness aleris face was untouched but harrows blades seemed to have cut him everywhere else she was only dimly aware that others were listening too and that one of them was petro dorma tell me aleri she shouted but you told me to lucrezia he muttered slurring the words his voice sounded puzzled you said before sforza gets here valdosta boy mus die kat shook him again more what about marco lion it was a breathy whisper followed by a gout of bloody foam then silence marco pushed her aside gently and felt aleris throat for a pulse hes dead he said after a few moments then he went back to harrow i wish to hell hed stayed alive just five minutes longer said petro grimly that was the best decision of my life to follow after you two women a lean luciano his left arm bloody stepped forward out of the shadows petro dorma petro nodded marina youre the one who disappeared and then came back claiming hed been on a pilgrimage to jerusalem luciano smiled slightly you would know signor di notte petros eyes narrowed i would also know that you are under suspicion of being a strega mage accused by bishop capuletti he was quite right for once said luciano calmly and given certain guarantees from you i will give you your five minutes to question aleri you admit this petro looked at luciano with a mixture of suspicion and curiosity most of the strega who used to have booths down on the calle farnese have proved to be fakes luciano shrugged yes i am a real mage a master in fact it is notyeta crime not to be a christian here in venice you know we practice secrecy because the threat of persecution here is very real not because we have any evil to hide petro nodded true it is not a crime here in venice yet but practicing black magic is and at least part of the church defines all magic which is not their own as that luciano took a deep breath yes but rome to its credit takes a more liberal attitude than the pauline fanatics from the north do and i would not be admitting this to you if i was guilty of any black magic or venices need was not both desperate and dire if given your word to keep this secretand you have a reputation for keeping that wordi will attempt some of what the church would call black magic necromancy if you choose the term i will call back this dead mans spirit and let you question him petro looked carefully at luciano what other conditions do you set luciano opened his palms none our scrying shows that there can be no survival for the strega unless venice survives i risk the future of our faith and my own life by doing this it is very dangerous for the mage petro bit his lip looked down at aleri very well what do you need and how soon must it be done i need to send certain messages about the information we already have the sooner the better said luciano before the soul slips too far but i can give you ten minutes while i prepare and one of your schiopettieri have arrived use them we can take the body up to marcos old room marco interrupted use my room for that if you wish but i need to get harrow somewhere else one of the hospitals he rose coming to stand next to kat and stared down at his protector ive done as much as i can for him here sighing hell probably die from disease anywaydamned belly woundsbut he might not too god knows if anyones tough enough to survive itll be him get me some paper said petro as the wideeyed schiopettieri stepped forward he pointed to harrow and have some of your men take him to the nearest hospital as the schiopettieri hurried to obey petro faced the others we can have a message to duke delleste within hours our galleys must sail with what force we can muster in the next few hours and no ship leaves venice not for the mainland or for the open sea that could carry a message to trieste i dont know exactly what aleri was talking about but a fleet from there can only be more bad news kat knew that it was a good twenty leagues to ferrara this could only imply that the doge and the council of ten themselves had magical links to the duke she squeezed marcos hand she was unaware that she had been holding it both their hands were bloody chapter manfred lay in the position that francesca called the twin camellias now that it was over he reflected that this could very well give a man a permanent back injury at the time it had seemed irresistible and exotic now as he tried to disentangle his foot from a footstool he wondered if the oldfashioned ways he had used before encountering francesca didnt have something going for them for one thing they were faster francesca nibbled his earlobe i must eventually teach you to cultivate patience stallion ha who needs a race horse im cultivating this damned footstool instead answered manfred ive got my leg stuck in the arch she laughed like politics it is going to take you a while to learn these things manfred now tell me what news from across the border manfred grunted two bits my dear my uncles emissaries have succeeded in persuading the aquitaines to release the venetian ships their western fleet is on its way home thats forty days sailing they wont be back in time to make any difference even if the fleet from the black seato which i imagine constantinople is refusing passagesuddenly got out you forget how long it takes for news to travel charles fredrik sent his men off to bordeaux just as soon as he had that first letter from me and forty days is the sailing time from flanders theyre a week closer than that at least they could be as little as a week off if you consider the time it takes to carry the news here she sighed well i hope this situation holds for a further few weeks but it smells of trouble manfred with the situation in fruili manfred kissed an elbow it was all he could reach ah thats my next bit of news emeric is poised on the border ready to join the freeforall orgy of destruction the scaligers mercenaries have loosed on the countryside the scaligers want to flood venice with refugees about the only good thing that has happened for venice is that cunning old duke delleste served the bolognese attacking modena such a trick theyre out of it he isnt called the old fox for nothing she chuckled and how did he do this trick manfred grinned my uncle says delleste is one of the most dangerous strategists in christendom and uncle has a mind to send me to study there next he hasnt met you yet my love but whatever you do dont get him into this position hes an old man and i think aunt clothilde only knew one good german position flat on her back and thinking of the imperial heir let me out of this do the footstool and these cushions are killing my back not to mention the voluptuous weight of you she tickled him if you had not said the last i would have let you up but now you must first tell me what the duke delleste did to confound the bolognese leave off with the tickling then its uh distracting he continued while the condottiere from ferrara was engaging the troops from milan and bolognaoutside modenadelleste himself led a band of partisans disguised as wagoneers with loot from villas in ferrarese territory to within two leagues of bologna there is a big stand of pine trees thereor i should say there used to be a big stand of pines there those wagons had barrels of naphtha and oil in them they set the pines into the biggest smokiest blaze imaginable then one of dellestes lieutenants riding an exhausted horse and with bolognese colors rode up screaming treachery into the bolognese rear the cities are only eight leagues apart you know so they could see the smoke clearly he said the milanese had sneaked an attack on bologna while the bolognese were distracted into attacking modena theres no love lost anyway between the bolognese condottieri and the ones from milan next thing there was an allout fight between the mercenaries with all the bolognese levies riding home hellforleather its a good story ill let you up conceded francesca im amazed sforza fell for it he didnt it was ambroso and i dont think i need to get up any more part of me is up already but her next statement brought him down and struggling to his feet then you can bet sforza is on his way here already they simply want to distract the ferrarese venice is the real prize the attacks on the ferrarese positions were designed to get delleste out into the countryside they must be coming down the po what about those venetian forts the polestine forts theyll knock the hell out of a fleet of rivercraft with their cannons francesca bit her lip i would expect treachery manfred reached for his clothes i reckon its time i had a talk with someone in authority here in venice if i suggest brunelli erik will have a fitalthough he seems the right man now that their doge is hovering between lucidity and death who else is in their inner councils francesca petro dorma but he has no love for the holy roman empire manfred shrugged his surcoat on i know him hes a good enough seeming fellow doesnt let his feelings show even if he does dislike us he doesnt reveal too much at all im certain that hes one of the council of ten he is also a signor di notte since lord calenti died he has been acting as the one in charge of them he also heads the new militia he has them under the command of your old friend caesare aldanto oh well these are for you by the way he handed her a bundle of parchment heavy with seals what are they manfred smiled grimly eriks idea signed and sealed warrants for the execution of bishop sachs and the knightproctors erik calls it insurance and this one is from me its a safe conduct to an audience with charles fredrik francesca was silent then she said in a rather small voice i have recently become fully aware of just what deep water i have waded into you know i did consider betraying you for a while not very seriously i admit but and my prowess as a lover convinced you otherwise said manfred hopefully she kissed him no well not much two other reasons the first of course being erik i am quite unwilling to bring the wrath of that clan down on my head im sure he has cousins and brothers as ferocious as himself manfred nodded my cousin had his older brother for a mentor he says olaf is half troll and i think he was only half joking he cocked his head and the other reason whatever qualms francesca might have been feeling seemed to disappear instantly the grin she gave manfred was not coquettish in the leastjust very cheerful i find that i rather enjoy deep waters chapter it was his last night in town benito headed towards the old apartment in cannaregio maybeif she hadnt gone to katif he played his cards rightmaria might take the fact that he was going off to war as a reason to repeat their night together he found himself desperately hoping she would andalmost as desperatelytelling himself he was solely motivated by a manly search for pleasure he was unusually deep in thought walking down the narrow calle his previous life had been a humble place but a happy one the world had been pretty straightforward then now for all that it was much more wealthy and luxurious life was much more complicated take this business with caesare he was starting to put things into place that he really didnt like and didnt want to believe about his hero he was at the foot of the narrow stairway when he looked up and saw that the door to the apartment was open moonlight made it look like a black pit benito raced up the stairs his mind full of fear and as he stepped into the darkness someone grabbed him someone with big meaty hands knew youd come back bitch you killed my cousins benito stamped down hardas caesare had taught him toand struck back with an elbow with all the strength of his roofclimbing honed muscles straight into the pit of the stomach by the gasp and release benito had realized a while back that he was never going to be as tall as his brother but lately hed been getting broader and the one thing about roofclimbing was that his grip was as strong as one of those barbary apes which was a good thing he thought as he caught his attackers descending arm whoever this was he was as strong as one of those apes bigger cousins benito snatched at his main gauche crossdrawing it with his free hand he drew it in a short vicious arc the heavy pommel hit something hard the arm he was trying to hold went limp he hit the sagging head twice more with all the force at his disposal as the body slumped against him he caught his attacker by the hair and pounded the base of his skull as hard as he could with the pommel then he stepped back and drew his rapier slipping the main gauche into its sheath and felt for the oil lamp it wasnt there but he knew this place like the back of his hand there were candles and a striker in the cupboard a minute later he was looking at the carnage that had once been their apartment his heart leapt like a fountain when he did not see what he had expected to see marias body then he realized what he was seeing two dead matteoni brothers with a third onethe one who had attacked him whom he suspected had come on the scene laterslumped against the wall staring at him with fogged eyes and a swaying head since the matteoni still alive clearly wasnt going to be moving soonthat was giovanni one of the matteoni brothers cousinsbenito took the time to examine the two dead ones luce and stephano he thought luce had half his chest blown away that was the work of a pistol at close range and the only person benito could think of who might have been at the apartment with a pistol was kat whose body wasnt here either his heart soared still further the other body probably stephanos couldnt really be recognized at all he looked more like a slab of meat in a butcher shop than a man his shirt was bloodsoaked from a stab wound and his head benito averted his eyes almost gagging the mans features were completely obscured by drying blood brains were sagging out of the horrible head wounds someoneand he was pretty sure he knew just exactly what spitfire woman could have done it especially after he recognized the cleaver still jammed in the corpses shoulderhad hacked his skull into shreds matteoni caesares errand boys as he finally accepted the truth about his idol benito felt a wave of sheer fury wash over him the rage of a man who has been betrayed as well as wronged he stalked towards the halfrecumbent terror of the dockyards where is she he spoke in a voice that he scarcely recognized as his own it was very very cold a voice which announced as certainly as the tides i will kill you very slowly if i dont get answers the man looked up at benito with halfglazed eyes what he apparently saw was not just a fifteenyearold boy maybe the ferrarasteel rapier had something to do with it the matteoni cowered back against the bloodspattered wall they got away shetheykilled luce and stephano ii wasnt here i was watching for schiopettieri over on the next street but when i saw her running away with that case vecchie bitch i thought shed come back sooner or later case vecchie who but kat who sent you benito demanded he already knew the answer but he had to hear it in his heart of hearts somewhere he still hoped to hear it was someone else but it was a faint hope almost nonexistent how else could they have known where to find maria hed told caesare himself becausehed thought it honorable and best aldanto caesare aldanto said to make it look like a rape it was said in a whisper but it was loud enough to rock the foundations of benitos whole world three minutes later with the surviving matteoni lashed to the bedand looking very surprised to find himself still alive at allthe place stripped of any weapon and the solid door firmly locked benito was jogtrotting in search of a gondola marias was still moored at the canalside that was ominous the gondola was her life again benito felt despair seeping back in and again that sudden wave of sheer rage he had to restrain himself from stalking back into the apartment and cutting giovannis throat but he wasnt quite up to coldblooded murder and there was nothing else to do with the man hed considered taking the matteoni to the schiopettieri and militia back on the campo but caesare had too much influence there if benito lived through this mess then hed take giovanni matteoni to petro dorma personally but first he was going to the casa montescue to check that maria was all right and kat of course then he was going to have to deal with caesare he hadnt made up his mind how he was going to do it but it had to be done it had him in something of a turmoil but that wasnt going to stop him soon enough benito found a gondolier to take him to casa montescue he spent the entire trip locked away in the black thoughts in his mind he was still trying to decide on the best course when the gondolier cleared his throat suggesting that now hed brought the young signor here payment and alighting would be much appreciated how much asked benito feeling for his purse the gondolier told him benito laughed savagely vafunculo what do you think i am one of these poncy case vecchie idiots the gondolier nodded too dumbfounded to speak benito had to acknowledge the justice of the mans assumption here thats the right sort of fare and this he held out a larger coin far more than the fellow had asked for is for reminding me he alighted and went to knock at the front door of the casa montescue an old man worry written into his wrinkles greeted him si benito valdosta here to see milord montescue he must see me about his daughter the old man ushered him inand led him to a bedroom pacing the floor was lodovico montescue his face lit up when he saw benito ah young valdosta i didnt think they would find you so quickly she seems to me to be getting worse he pointed to the bed benito was relieved the woman in the bed wasnt maria he recognized the head on the pillow despite the bandage hed seen her before not infrequently visiting caesare when maria had been away there was no mistaking that raven hair the tiny mole above her mouth hed taken some observational sex lessons by peeking in at the window something hed never have considered doing with maria and caesare his mouth fell open what is she doing here lodovico sighed heavily for my sins she is my granddaughterinlaw she has been sleeping with your mentor caesare aldanto benito stuttered he was trying to say how did you knowbut all he got out was hhhhow she told us said the old man the arrogant creature she also told me i was a fool who had nurtured a viper in his bosom choosing to believe my oncebest friends son a murderer rather than to see the rot right here in my own house he took a deep breath boy i must tell you i have been very wrong i have blamed the casa valdosta for our losses for our problems i apologize fully what small things i can do to put the past right i will do benito saw that there were tears in lodovicos eyes he got the feeling that tears normally didnt come easily to this fierce old man its all right milord honestly katyour granddaughtershes paid us back in spades saved my life maybe and saved marias for sure thats worth more than anything to me is is maria all right and kat of course it was the old mans turn to look dumbfounded yes butdid they not send you here benito shook his head no i i thought theyd be here at least i hoped worry must have colored his voice lodovico took him by the shoulder gently they are fine boy theyve gone to look for you at dorma your brother as well to attend to her he pointed at the shallowbubblybreathing woman in the bed theyve gone with a stout boatman and a pistol apiece benito nodded caesare was out organizing the new militia maria should be fine going to dorma my brother went across to collect his things from the accademia theyll be sent on to there ill go and see if i can find them the old man nodded yes but before you go there is something i must say to you it makes it harder for me that you have not seen them but i must tell you that your mentor caesare aldanto im going to kill him interrupted benito without heat but with a grim certitude or send him to face the headsmans axe for the first time since benito had come in lodovico montescue smiled it was a grim sight grimmer than his worried frown spoken like a true valdosta boybenito i should say for you are clearly a boy no longerbetween us we will crush him like an adder beneath a stout boot heel the old man seemed almost gay at the thought montescue and valdosta together again ha in the old days nothing caused greater fear he broke off coughing a little the cough seemed a compound of suppressed pride and rueful regret but when he continued his voice was calm and even i suppose that as we were the heart of the opposition to the montagnardsand wed given them good cause to fear our bladesit was inevitable that they should have sent their womanizing charmer to target my houses weakest point i could forgive that and the insult to my grandsonbut not the deaths that she caused in my house he sighed and i suppose given my pride that it was inevitable that i would suspect everyone else i just hope she doesnt die before she gives her evidence whats wrong with her milord asked benito lodovico pulled a wry face an old family servanton hearing alessandras confessionwent for her with a fruit knife i wouldnt have thought you could stab someone with a fruit knife but old madelena managed she was like a dervish alessandra managed to flee to the stairs but she was already stabbed in the chest and the shoulder she fell down the stairs she hasnt regained consciousness since are you a doctor like your brother perhaps you should have a look benito laughed no marco is the only one the healer me im nothing much but trouble at last a genuine smile came to lodovicos troubled wrinkled countenance yes you sound like me when i was your age then lucianoyour valdosta grandfatherused to come and get me out of it well i seem to spend my time getting marco out of scrapes said benito ruefully and sometimes i mess that up too id better get along milord call me lodovico id like to stand in for the valdosta grandfather you never had and i think we will leave alessandra to live or die weve done what we can for her im coming with you to the accademia the more i think about it the more determined i am not just to wait here he must have seen benitos doubtful look he smiled we can take a boat cant we its faster than running young valdosta marco looked at lucianos transformation of his small lounge it didnt look pleasant it didnt feel pleasant either in fact it made his scalp crawl he wasnt the only one rafael also looked uneasy he shouldnt be doing this the artist muttered hes taking far too much risk this is dangerous marco really dangerous and its graymagic even with the best of intentions maria too looked as if she was ready to run hastily for the nearest chapel if not engage in a bit of impromptu witchburning she had all the ingrained superstition about the strega that was part of the christianity of the commons most of the ordinary priests tended to regard the strega as direct competition for their flock no matter what the metropolitan said about tolerance and allowing heathens to come to god rather than dragging them to him kicking and screaming and as for the canalerswell when things were going fine the strega were the people you went to for lovecharms and lucktalismans but when they werent the strega just might be the people causing the problems kat on the other hand was just pressed against marco a dreamy look in her eyes as if she could not bear not to touch himand it didnt even matter if luciano enacted a black mass so long as she didnt stop holding his hand if petro dorma had noticed he hadnt commented luciano had the corpse hedged about with diagrams the man was inside a pentacle which was inside a pentagon which was inside a circle inside a circle inside a circle all drawn with blessed salt and water and traced with a dagger made of black glass they all glowed could anyone but marco and luciano see that rafael probablyif kat did it didnt matter to herand from petro dormas slightly puzzled slightly skeptical expression he saw nothing this wasnt the pure white light that marco was used to in working with brother mascoli this was a creepy sort of purple butoddly enoughbefore luciano had stepped out of the pentagram and pentagon and had invoked whatever spirits hed called that made the lines spring into life hed placed a crucifix very firmly around what was left of aleris neck marco the powers hes calling up rafael was still murmuring in marcos ear youve got to be careful with them you know theyre not just called on for good things marcos skin shivered and it felt as if a cold dead finger was running down his spine oh he knew luciano was just muttering his incantations butcharun vanth carminaoh he knew all right these were the dread lords and ladies of the night of the dead and not the sort of powers you called on for a blessing or a healing the corpse began to glow lucianos face looked as gray as the corpses in the strange lightand was the purple witchlight growing stronger or the room light weaker the latter as marco glanced surreptitiously out of the corner of his eye he watched the candle flame nearest him sinking it wasnt guttering it was sinking diminishing exactly as if someone had upturned a jar over it it didnt go out but in a few moments it was giving off no more light than a mere coal no one commented not dorma not rafael not kat certainly not luciano who wasweaving some sort of complicated knot in the air above the corpse with the point of his knife which left a trail of sullen red light where it passed and there was no doubt that aleri hadnt said anything about it either although to marcos horror the pentacleenclosed mancorpsewas stirring he shouldnt be even if harrow hadnt killed him marco was a good enough physician already to know that the herbs that luciano had stuffed down aleris throat should cause death all over again the hair stood up on marcos head this should not be happening hed expected a ghost or something not that the dead body should sit up and start to move this was wrong aleris voice was a weak and hollow thing but the words were clear even though the jaw hung loose on the face on what was left of the face who has called me back why am i called back the pain the agony oh lucrezia luciano straightened and became something altogether terrible his face corpsegray and marblestill took on the qualities of a deathmask i grimas luciano marina servant of triune diana have summoned you she is the mistress of the earth the dead and of rebirth in her name i command you in her name i compel you the corpse made abortive moves jerky and uncoordinated it brushed against the purple lines of the pentagram and moaned i am not hers let me go you are hers as all things are luciano said sternly i abjure and command you stay you will until she or i permit you to depart speak the truth and the truth only you are bound here until you answer the questions set to you the lips of the dead man moved i obey he whispered sobbed marco felt nauseated how horrible could this be for aleris soul trapped in a body already dead and surely knowing that he faced at absolute best the worst that purgatory could offer when luciano released him from which direction is the main attack on venice coming demanded marina and when aleris lips moved again the words were very faint since they had no real breath behind them word came through the barges are at bondeno got to be past the polestine forts by tomorrow morning got to beat th galleys our people in ferrarall start the fires there tnight pass in the confusion tell em to stop th trieste fleet petro dorma croaked ask him what the milanese are planning to do to break through the polestine forts marco took a quick look at himthe corpselight made everyone look awful but the hithertounflappable dorma of the council of ten was definitelyflapped his eyes were big as saucers and he was sweating in spite of the funereal chill of the room the dead body shivered the casket the black nun the servant and voice of chernobog she will deal with the forts i warned lucrezia danger danger danger it hears me speak its name the black nun petro fumbled for the sense of this luciano spat sister ursula that nun who travels with the knots ask your next question dorma licked his lips and didnt look as if he relished the taste how does sforza plan to overcome venices defenses aleris corpse answered fires many fires dorma had more stomach for this than marco did how gunpowder laid charges lucifers in amulets in some of them spellcasters in the casa dandelo will begin to trigger them when the fog comes agents will light the others how do we stop it what order must be given a good question milord how the hell can we be everywhere at once cant be stopped now we made sure petro sighed then tightened his jaw deciding evidently to focus on what he could do where are the firebombs and aleri began listing place after place scattered across the rialto islands petro frantically tried to write ill never get them all i will said marco finally feeling that here was something he could do petro nodded that was the genius of the man to know who and what he could trust and not worry about what he had handed off to others he turned back to aleri and who can venice not trust who are your hirelings your agents once again aleri began listing marco found he recognized many of the names of mamas sleepers that hed written down so carefully for caesare and count badoero and the tiepolosthe black lotos smugglers with their partisans who would be coming across from the mainland they were locals they knew the lagoon and the city and then and then caesa aaaahhhhhh the scream was a horrible one the more so since it came from the throat only and it was echoed by luciano the lamps went out and so did the light from the ritual circle the silence and the darkness were worse than the corpselight kats fingers tightened on his arm and she whimpered a little deep in her throat in the darkness marco heard luciano say in a trembling voice the black one silenced him as soon as he tried to say that name chernobog has claimed his own somebody kindled a light a candle flame only but it was still a beautiful sight in rafaels hand that hand shook and marco couldnt blame him in the least there were some things no one should have to witness then with the light came the stench marco backed up gagging dragged from what was left of the circle by kat dorma staggered to the wall rafael covered his mouth with his hand and turned convulsively away something had made sure that no one was going to reanimate aleris corpse again there wasnt going to be enough of it left it seethed with maggots the stench of decay was enough to send them all fleeing gagging out the door that rafael opened for them rafael had to help luciano as the man was barely able to stagger he slammed the door on the horror in what had been his rooms and they all leaned against the wall luciano included with shaking legs that would not carry them further at least for the moment first to recover petro turned to marco i need you now to come and write down those lists he took a deep breath and then were going to have to decide how to deal with caesare marco nodded his laced fingers released themselves from kats hand yes but luciano looks like death warmed over kat giggled faintlybut in a tone that said in a moment she might go from giggling to screaming ah er that luciano somehow managed to wheeze was a poor choice of words marco patted kats shoulder comfortingly look anywaywe ought to take him over to zianettis its just across the campo ill see you there in maybe twenty minutes petro nodded if you see any schiopettieri send them here id say we should all go there but i left word for benito i would be here and in that message that i sent to the council i asked that schiopettieri be sent here luciano nodded marco wondered where the old man found the strength spiritual and physical id like to get away from this place but i must speak to you again dorma the others of the strega arm militant should be watching around here i need to send them off to prepare defensesand to eliminate two traitors lucrezia brunelli was once a neophyte who wanted to learn the strega way she was rejected at the rite of purification but it seems that shed found out enough to corrupt some of our people grand dorma said grimly well ill leave that in your hands mine are overfull as it is reluctantly kat parted with marco as they walked out of the lodging one of lucianos group emerged from the shadows a hasty whispered conversation followed and the nine watchers left at a run slowly luciano rafael maria and kat proceeded down the curving calle between shuttered houses they turned the corner two candles burned in a wallsconce shrine to the virgin lighting the narrow alley they nearly walked smack into them and there was certainly no avoiding senor lopez and his two companions the basque grabbed her shoulder this time you will not evade me girl his dark line of eyebrow lowered heavily kat reached into her reticule and produced the pistol which she pressed against his stomach i have you lopez you turn up like a bad penny every time there is evil about you were there when that monk was murdered magically you were there when bishop capuletti was killed youre here now when luciano has had this encounter with chernobog name not that evil snapped lopez and lower your weapon girl his companions moved forward stop cried maria ill shoot at least one of you others the canaler was holding her own pistol two handed she stood feet apart weapon raised looking like nemesis the basque priest seemed to be almost grinding his teeth madness he hissed chapter thank god youve gotten back snapped erik weve been summoned to assemble in the courtyard every one of us in full armor something is happening manfred nodded we need to talk to petro dorma i think its time to shed pretenses its time to dress in full armor said erik grimly i have a feeling weve left talking too late but when this assembly is over well go and find count von stemitz and get him to authenticate you and go and see dorma i tried to get out to fetch you earlier this place is sealed tighter than waterdamageable deckcargo they must have let you in but sachss trusties are not letting anyone out no one now move it fifteen minutes later they stood to attention in squads in the courtyard the knightproctors inspected them reported back to the abbot returned to their squads the abbot stood in front of serried rows of steelclad men he held up a wad of parchment these are a final and complete list of the jews strega mussulmen and other ungodly ones in this pesthole he announced in a triumphant voice i have addresses and maps we will be arresting the ringleaders tonight ritters just as soon as the tocsin bell in saint marks square is rung tomorrow a full contingent of our knights will be arriving from trieste to help restore order in what will be the new southern frontier of the holy roman empire erik heard manfred standing next to him draw a deep breath he waited for the bulllike bellow it didnt come sachs had paused as if he too had been waiting for something then he continued knightproctors step forward and collect your orders squads are to remain together at their assigned posts until the tocsin bell rings then you will move out with your assigned group of servants of the holy trinity to protect you from whatever magic these ungodly ones may attempt to unleash at you fear not god and the holy saint paul are with us erik and manfred found themselves assembled in a front salon along with some twenty knights under the command of knightproctors von welf and von stublau many of the other knights had been kept back in the courtyard he and manfred walked up to the two knightproctors who said you could break ranks snapped von welf manfred took a deep breath we need to take you to see count von stemitz von welf there is something hes got to tell you von welf smiled a particularly unpleasant smile well be seeing him soon enough as soon as the bell in saint marks square begins to ring continuously his name is on the top of our list there was a moments silence erik heard footsteps shuffling behind him quietly as if heavily armored men were trying to move stealthily across a tile floor two or three of the knights in the salon were coming up behind him and manfred he was quite certain of their purpose and had to fight down a savage smile in the distance a bell began to ring thats early said von stublau quietly almost conversationally but its the signal such a pity that petro dorma ordered you killed the evidence and report are on their way to the brenner pass right now but erik was moving before the prussian had finished the last sentence he knocked manfred aside with a thrust of his right arm and spun to the left dropping to one knee as he did so the poignard in the hand of the knight assigned to stab him in the back passed overhead harmlessly an instant later the algonquian hatchet sheared through the knee joint in the knights armor the knight screamed and toppled forward erik rose up beneath him and added his own thrust to the topple sending the armored man crashing into the two prussian knightproctors erik glanced at manfred the prince had been expecting treachery also of course and if manfred did not have eriks lightning reflexes he could move much faster than anyone would expect eriks shove had sent him out of immediate danger and by the time the knight assigned to murder manfred had reached him the prince had his sword out a sword he had learned to use extremely well over the past year his assailant attempted a feint which manfred countered by the simple expedient of lopping his arm off the knight went one way the arm another blood poured over the tiles for a moment erik studied the remaining knights in the salon they were still frozen in place immobilized by the sudden and unexpected violence clearly enough none of them except two had been directly involved in von stublaus plot von stublau and von welf were struggling back onto their feetno easy task for heavily armored men sent sprawling to the ground von stublau was on eriks side von welf nearer to manfred von welf never made it up at all manfreds sword in a backswing shattered his helmet and the skull inside it von welf sprawled back onto the floor and lay there motionless erik disarmed von stublau with a quick hooking motion of the hatchet a maneuver the prussian neither expected nor had ever encountered before he was still looking more puzzled than anything when his attention was riveted by the razor edge of the hatchetthree inches in front of his eyes make any move and ill take off your face said erik cheerfully that nose guard might as well be a ladys veil as much good as itll do you von stublau froze the icelanders thin smile was as friendly as a wolfs you made two mistakes von stublau the first one is that bell you see that isnt the one from saint marks square thats the marangona the bell they ring every morning at the arsenal it goes on for half an hour every morning so you should know it as this isnt morning and as the arsenal is working right now i imagine someone has found out about your plot the knightproctor looked startled then began to pale and the second one is that you shouldnt assume everyone is as stupid as you are he raised his voice prince manfred earl of carnac your uncle his imperial highness charles fredrik holy roman emperor has given me orders to kill any man who threatens your life erik grabbed the lower edge of von stublaus helmet and jerked him forward kicking the knightproctors legs out from under him and driving him back down the prussian grunted with pain as his knees smashed into the floor kneel traitor may he be shriven first my lord earl everything was moving too fast for the remaining knights to understand what was happening most of them were still slackjawed with surprise but at least two thirds of them out of training if nothing else had drawn their broadswords the doors at the back of the salon opened the entry of soldiers or other knights might have simply made the situation explode into violence outnumbered sixteen to two erik and manfred would have been hardpressed to survive long enough for any kind of rescue except by an unarmed haughty imperiallydressed woman accompanied by an elderly gentleman in court clothes the woman looked like a princess she certainly wore enough jewels francesca smiled at them from under her tiara the knights parted like the red sea before moses opening up to allow her and count von stemitz to walk through she curtsied to manfred the count bowed low manfred behaved as if he had not a few moments back been in a fight for his life and didnt have a bloody sword in his hand princess his mind raced for a suitable address well there were enough little principalities in the empire let the knots guess how may we assist she smiled regally your imperial uncle has asked me to deliver certain warrants to you she handed him the sheaf of parchments hed left with her not an hour before manfred took them and leafed through them as if he hadnt written them himself count von stemitz he said calmly who am i please explain that to these assembled knights von stemitz bowed again you are prince manfred earl of carnac marquis of rennes baron of ravensburg you are also privy emissary plenipotentiary for his imperial highness charles fredrik of mainz he has invested you with the full and independent power to act for the imperial throne manfred cleared his throat i have a message from emperor charles fredrik to read to all of you he says to remind the knots that he holds their charter the deeds to all their monasteriesand that they are perilously close to his displeasure and that he has more than sufficient military forces to crush the entire order of the knights of the holy trinity should they persist in defying him and to remind any confrere knights that he is their sovereign and their estates are his to dispose of the salon seemed to chill by many degrees of temperature charles fredrik was known to be reluctant to use military force except when he felt it was necessary he was also known to use it with utter ruthlessness when he did so the threat was particularly shaking obviously enough to the confrere knights who made up perhaps half of the force assembled in the salon not one of the confrere knights in the salon doubted for an instant that the old emperor would make good his threat to kill all of themand expropriate their families in the bargain as surely as a farmer will butcher a hog for a feast erik cast quick eyes around the salon he could see at least fourno five then sixof the confrere knights start shifting their stance moving nowand none too subtlyto be prepared to subdue the two regular knights who were most prone to religious fanaticism and then saw the other regular knights sidling away from the two zealots the sudden shift in the balance of forces was as palpable as a lead weight count von stemitz coughed in the tense silence may i remind you further ritters that standing in the presence of the emperors nephew and privy emissary plenipotentiary with drawn weapons isahdangerously close to treason weapons were sheathed hastily with the naked blades absent the tension began to ease manfred meanwhile had been sorting through the bundle of parchments as if he had not a care in the world beyond scrupulous attention to the emperors correspondence here erik he handed one to the icelander who still held the kneeling von stublau show him that erik held the parchment in front of the knightproctors eyes see that seal von stublau said erik coldly your life your lands and your familys lands are forfeit you and they are landless peasants you are shortly going to be a dead landless peasant the big prussians eyes widened he had been afraid of the axe thisto the prussianwas worse i i didnt know you knew said manfred scathingly he looked down on von stublau you and von welf both knew now you must pay the price of treason your lands are confiscate to the crown i will however temper justice with mercy i will not act against your familys holdingsif i am told the full details of your plot should it emerge later even twenty years hence that you didnt tell us all you knew then your kin can join the polish peasants on your lands the peasantry will kill them whimpered von stublau theyll tear them apart maybe you should advise them to start some reforms immediately said von stemitz dryly erik gestured at the door time for this later manfred there are a lot of knights out there and sachs too manfred nodded true de grinchy lutz take charge of this one bring him with us they marched out with manfred at the head of the column of knights erik watching his back reflected that power was a strange thing sachs and the knightproctors involved would have chosen their adherents for this squad yet when francesca had shifted their balance the reins had ended up firmly in manfreds hands even the two zealots eriks lips twisted in a smile that was as bitter as it was wry the worst of sachss camp followers would be the quickest to strike off any head from anyone who dared to dissent and yet really in actual fact they were still completely at the mercy of their former foes how did you know to come now he whispered to francesca and where did you get the jewelry i wouldnt like this jewelry examined in broad daylight or by a skilled jeweler said francesca quietly ive taken my task seriously erik ive had my watchers keeping an eye on manfred too you know hes a very valuable client to say the least eriks eyes narrowed besides you know von stemitz francesca dimpled at him indeed you are too observant erik hendrik has been a regular ah friend but i really dont think manfred needs to know that petty detail mutely erik shook his head francescas dimples were now quite dazzling ah what would you do without me mutely erik shook his head chapter benito was a little edgy for starters the old man couldnt move very fast for a second thing the town felt like a powder keg there was a tension in the air you could almost taste he and lord montescue had gotten to the gondola landing to find several anxiouslooking people with brassbound staves waiting to take their vessel thered been someone running back across there then theyd entered the narrow winding calle which led to marcos digsand found a cluster of people in front of them in the middle of what was obviously a tense confrontation and then he heard maria shout ill shoot at least one of you others he left lodovico and ran forward benito maria nearly dropped the pistol you idiot i almost shot you lopez stared at benito you then incongruously he burst into laughter it needed only this benito noticed that kat was pushing the muzzle of her own pistol into the spaniards belly er kat why are you doing that hes maybe the one behind all the magical murders snapped kat and he probably killed the bishop toothat you nearly got executed for killing hes certainly the driving force behind venices woes the lightning progressionmaybe probably certainlydidnt seem to perturb kat in the least the youthful inquisitor in full fury benito took a deep breath hes also a legate of the grand metropolitan in rome andwell hes helped me lopez bowed his head and smiled wryly the fact that a cocked pistol was pressed into his midriff didnt seem to worry the man in the least here at the request of metropolitan michael to investigate the activities of the servants of the holy trinity he elaborated in quite a calm tone of voice particularly with reference to their persecution of magicusers since then i have been seconded to try to find out who was committing these magical murders as well as how they were being achieved and to determineand thwart it at all possiblethe purpose behind them luciano growled well look no further than your precious servants of the holy trinity then theyre in league with chernobogbe sure of it and the woman youre looking for is that socalled nun of theirs katerina puffed lodovico who had just hustled himself forward what is happening now and why are you threatening this gentleman with that pistol be careful for the sake of god youve got it cocked kat frowned uncertainly but her weapons training had been rigorous she removed the weapon from lopezs waistline then carefully and expertly disengaged the lock i hope it may just be a misunderstanding grandpapa benito heaved a little sigh of relief then pointed to zianettis which was not twenty yards distant that taverns the place to settle this not here on the street milord dorma and marco can join us there he gave lopez a polite little bow thats marco valdosta im referring to lopez nodded valdosta yes there are portents attached to that name for the first time since kat had ever seen the fiercelooking basque standing on brunellis balcony the year before his intense face suddenly burst into an expression of pure good will she was almost stunned by the sheer charisma the man seemed to exude a tavern it is then now if you will allow me to introduce my companions he gestured to the two men standing behind him father pierre from the savoy and father diego diego like myself is from spainalthough poor soul not blessed with being a basque on the other handalso like mehe has the pleasure of being able to claim some jewish ancestry the last statement was made in such an offhand manner that the import of it did not register immediately on kat when it did she relaxed still further the paulines especially the more fanatical ones tended toward religious intolerance no pauline zealot for a certainty would so casually announce that he had some jewish blood running in his veins kat realized that lopez had made the statement deliberately the basque clearly enough was a skilled diplomat whatever might be the ferocity with which he seemed to act otherwise father pierre as you will see for yourself the moment he opens his mouth continued lopez cheerily is blessed with the usual savoyard skill for mangling civilized tongues but he is quite accomplished in other ways the detection of black magic for one welcome to venice said benito with a laugh let us buy you a glass of wine at zianettis zianettis tavern was relatively deserted the accademia was emptying fast and they got a small private room time for straight talk said benito yes said lopez firmly the fate of venice is at stake benito shrugged uncomfortably i dunno about the destiny of venice but you kept me free and alive true enough benito saw the puzzled looks around the table look never mind its a long story i got into stupid trouble and he helped me out he was very truthfuland very rude father diego laughed ah yes the true eneko dont feel bad hes rude to everyone lopez allowed himself a brief smile it has been on my conscience but i have told you the other priest the savoyard said something he pointed at luciano lopez looked carefully at him he says you are a mage he says there is a stink of blackness luciano nodded tiredly hes right but the stink isnt coming from me itslike a man whos been in smoke and still smells of it i have just been performing a rite one which you christians would term black on the other hand i did itat the peril of my soulto try to save this city and my coreligionists i have been practicing necromancy on an agent of those who serve chernobog there was a silence and then lopez said you are dottore marina of course a grimas indeed i dont really approve of necromancy of course but there are worse things what did you discover dottore marina and did you allow him to confess and be received back into the arms of god luciano shook his head warily chernobog snatched him back from me i was nearly drawn in myself but we know now that this is his conspiracy and that the nun who is with the servants sister ursula said lopez renowned to be one of the greatest practitioners of christian magic in the northeastern frontier luciano snorted she may once have been but shes nothing more than a vessel for chernobog now but she is a nun protested diego she bears the crucifix luciano pulled a wry face you will find that it is broken or bathed in the blood of unbaptized infants or desecrated in some other terrible way or not even there at all chernobogs acolytes are masters of illusion masters of corruption kat leaned forward what i want to know is why lucrezia brunelli should want marco valdosta dead and why you lopez stayed at the casa brunelli lopez shrugged i stayed at the casa brunelli when i first arrived because the lodgings were offered to me by a man well known in venice and in good repute with the grand metropolitan as for lucrezia lopez seemed to shudder a bit for just a moment as if a sudden unpleasant memory had come to him im afraid i was perhaps oblivious to the womans other vices since i was so preoccupied with avoiding a particular one he pursed his lips thoughtfully as to why she might want marco valdosta dead i cannot think of a reason offhand except she seems to have an insatiable appetite for men perhaps he turned her down too brusquely his lips thinned the woman is ah quite taken by her own beauty shes in this up to her elegant neck said kat savagely deceive yourself if you like senor lopez i know for a fact she has ordered magical materials from the east ive delivered them to her but shes no strega lopez rubbed his face the worst i know of her is that she passed on a message from capuletti that he would meet me at midnight at the san trovaso chapel instead of in the morning i had tracked this dealing in that vile black lotos to him somewhat by accident while dealing with a signor tassole i confronted the bishop about it and the peril to his immortal soul he denied it but wrote to me later to say it was true and that my words had troubled him he said he wanted to fast and pray for the night but had things on his conscience that he wished to confess it was the letter of a deeply troubled man ill bet she was in that up to her neck too snarled kat she probably dictated the second letter herself and then killed him marco and petro dorma came in looking for them petro seemed to accept lopez and his companions as perfectly logical people to be there still no sign of the schiopettieri said petro sitting down ive left a message over at marcos old apartment for them to come here bribed several of the locals to wait for them still if theyre not here in ten minutes i must go and rouse the council of ten myself i wonder why they havent arrived marco had been drowning in kats eyes paying almost no attention to the conversation it took a few moments for petros words to drum through i wonder why they havent arrived that and aleris last wordwhich he and petro had agreed did sound as if aleri might have been starting to say caesarefinally registered marcos immediate reaction had been that cant be true but walking across the darkened campo the thought had come to him what allegiance did caesare aldanto owe to venice he was for sale to the highest bidder after all hed always seemed good to marco but the way he had cheated maria um would your schiopettieri messenger have gone to caesare aldanto petro turned on him pursing his lips it was his name it was that name that the chernobog destroyed aleri rather than let us discover oh jesus ive given the city defenses into the hands of a traitor hes a traitor and a murderer all right grated lodovico petro took a deep breath he could wreak more havoc than all the montagnard firebombs put together i cant take the chance even if ive guessed wrong and hes innocent what the hell am i going to do maria stood up what you should have done in the first place dorma call out the arsenalotti they havent joined your stupid militia because they are insulted by it the defense of the republic has always been their responsibility dorma nodded get me paper and sealing wax he commanded rafael he turned back to maria you obviously know the arsenal woman my cousins are caulkers said maria stiffly my father was a caulker would they rally to the republic if you were to tell them that the defense of the arsenal and the doges palace are in their hands that they must deal with any rogue militia maria snorted youre so stuck up dorma that you have no idea of course they would and most of the boatpeople too send marco to rally them they saw him with the doge and he has a reputation five times as good as yours they trust him petro stood up good because i have work tonight for every one of you you too lodovico montescue i am at the service of the republic said the old man stiffly but i hope that that work includes arresting caesare aldanto thats dangerous work said petro mildly but i have another task for you i want to know which of the triestecoasters is running messages to trieste you have the contacts get onto them if need be arrest them i want to know to whom these messages are going and i want to alter a message kat and lodovico gaped at petro how petro smiled sardonically you can thank the doge i would have closed you down he said the gray trade would exist anyway and he would rather it was in the hands of someone we knew and who was loyal to venice someone that we could use if need be besides the doge felt the jews and the strega did a great deal for venices wealth and wellbeing he thought your trade supported them just because he has that childish devotion to clockwork devices doesnt make him a fool you know kat recovered her wits first captain della tomasso he is carrying messages for the sots and if anyone knows of any other secret messages being carried itll be him his ship leaves on the full tide at about two oclock this morning ill see to him said lodovico but who gets to arrest aldanto i can provide a charge and i have evidence said benito in the shape of a bound and lockedup hired murderer lying in our apartment giovanni matteoni marco gaped at his younger brother petro took a deep breath i will my sister is going to be angry he sighed and i must try to do something about lucrezia while my messengers rouse the council ive heard ricardo brunelli has sent lucrezia away to safety announced lopez ah then with you lopez and the doges swiss guards and what other force i can muster we will go to the imperial embassy and confront the knights he turned on luciano the attack is at least in part magical the strega must contest that can you damp fires rafael will go to see that that is in hand i must go to the marciana library there is a guardian if i can arouse it it will do more than any firedamping very well marco you will go with this lady petro pointed to maria i will give you a signed order for admiral marchese ring the marangona rouse the arsenalotti send any men who can be spared to piazza san marco and i want squads of men to proceed to as many of these addresses as they can take no chances douse any gunpowder they find or toss it into the canal and then proceed to rouse any of your canaler friends you can find send them to san marco marco looked alarmed but nodded benito your task is the casa dandelo benito smiled savagely yes although ill arrest caesare first for you if you like marco gaped at his brother again petro looked calculatingly at him no ill do that you deal with the casa dandelo neutralize it destroy it he sighed i go beyond my authority here to act against foreigners is easy but a venetian casa even to order a search will take time and manpower i dont have the place is like a fort mused benito considering the problem in that moment he seemed much older than he was i know do it benito grinned si how much gold do you all have im going to need a fair bit and mariayou going to come and help when youve finished talking to the arsenalotti ill need a couple of your cousins good honest boatmen ill see you at giaccomos were going into the barrel delivery business and the signori di notte and the schiopettieri are turning a blind eye maria nodded come and choose them si ill need some gunpowder from the arsenal anyway petro looked rather warily at the imp hed just set loose but he dug into his pockets i guess that leaves me said kat id better go with my grandfather to della tomasso petro took a deep breath no lodovico montescue is old enough not to need his hand held you go with marco we may all be dead soon you may as well he waved a little feebly be together lodovico looked at marco valdosta shrugged my house is in ruins anyway be happy at least cara mia marco faced a crowd a sea of faces the torches made the planes of the faces stand out showed the lines of hard work and poor food particularly in the clustered caulkers hard times and hard faces mouths set in a grim line his stomach turned itself inside out he looked at maria there was the same grimness the same determination in that square jaw as there was on the faces in the crowd and maria said that he not she must tell the arsenalotti what petro had said he looked at kat she reached out and squeezed his hand and he realized just how right petro had been he still did need someone to hold his hand introduce me he said to maria she stood up onto the marble step arsenalotti there were a few cheers a number of smiles a good many waves everyone here knew maria garavelli honest as the day was long even if she had a temper on her that you could boil a kettle on what are you doing up there maria this is marco valdosta he needs to talk to you hes case vecchie but he has doctored some of your kids hes a good man and hes got a message for you from the council of ten marco got up onto the step thank you maria there were a few people clapping he heard his name repeated he cleared his throat and looked at kat she smiled who has always defended the doge the piazza on whom has the last defense of venice always rested his voice cut through the silence no one answered then someone in the back of the crowd said not petro dormas damned militia valdosta right said marco not the militia the arsenalotti that is the way it has always been and that is the way it must stay the crowd cheered marco knew in his bones that he was doing the right thing he had them he held up a parchment dorma made a mistake hes man enough to admit that i marco valdosta have his writ here the council calls the arsenalotti to the defense of the republic a strange power infused his voice in the name of the winged lion of saint mark you are called to arms will you answer the assent itself was a roar and to marcos shock he realized that they were chanting valdosta valdosta he stilled them with a gesture this is my brother benito hes the one who is good at organizing and plans hell tell you what the council wants benito wideeyed was pushed to his feet to face the cheering crowd ill get even with you for this marco he said quietly face it benito said marco you tell people what to do far better than i do and benito went on to prove him dead right chapter erik stared at the desecrated lady chapel grim silent pellmann had not run away after all as his remains testified but it was the bells that were the most offensive made from infant skulls with a small thighbone for a clapper the cross was broken the walls were scrawled with strange and unpleasant symbols scrawled in what could only be blood and excrement rusty stains marred the once white altar cloth pieces of clothing a cotte a knitted cap a richly embroidered nightshirt lay on the floor but of the wodencasket which had been placed there there was no sign i think i am going to throw up said manfred quietly under our noses right under our very noses well sachs what do you have to say to this the abbot defiant furious and threatening divine retribution until a bare minute ago sank to his knees my god my god forgive me he may but i wont said manfred grimly where is it and where is she sachs the former abbot looked into manfreds implacable eyes looked around at the desecrated chapel sister ursula the casket and an escort of knights left this late afternoon there was a chance that the witches could he faltered thats what she said she said they would try to liberate it that it would be safer with our friends on the mainland my god my god i have been weak misled by the carnal desires of the flesh my god forgive me erik hit him enough time for selfpity and remorse later you stinking swine where have they gone sachs whimpered i dont know she said something about forts to aldanto the polestine forts said francesca erik turned to manfred shes going to turn the woden loose on the forts presumably to clear the way for a fleet from milan which will be coming down the po river sachs nodded wretchedly sforza is coming but we didnt know i thoughtshe said it was christs work manfred pointed at the chapel well now you see whose work it really was what is this about trieste a thousand two hundred of our knights the chapters from greifswald landsberg and schniedemuhl are ready to embark to restore order and seize the arsenal they wait for our message so said manfred sardonically you stripped the northeastern frontier for this adventure the grand duke of lithuania must be very pleased with you what do you think erik shall we turn them loose to make a demonstration on the border against emeric of hungary thatll keep him out of the mess anyway and them away from here yes erik nodded and we will need local guides if we ride hard we may get to the wodencasket in time manfred nodded francesca and count von stemitzwith an escort of knightscan ride for the brenner pass to reassure uncle charles fredrik that i am still alive now wed better go and look for petro dorma a knight ran in there is a huge party of venetians disembarking outside looks like some mercenaries too and cannon knightproctor von dusbad and etten are readying defense he stared at the horror in the chapel what is this sister goddamned ursula is what it is hells teeth lets see if we can stop this you manfred pointed to one of the knights you see to it that the servants are marched in here to see this abomination he pointed to the kneeling sachs and take him and lock him away open up in the name of the holy church and the republic of venice demanded someone outside let us out the wicket door you can prepare a charge in case there is a problem ducking manfred erik and several of the senior knights came out to face the venetians erik felt his heart lift to see petro dorma out there in the torchlight petro may have felt similar relief but he didnt let that show on his face or stop the mercenaries lining up the small cannon all he said was where is abbot sachs i sent him off to be locked up said manfred we dont want trouble dorma in fact i need to talk to you ciao petro said francesca sweeping forward with her hands outstretched as if greeting an old family friend dormas mouth fell open his face seemed to flush a bit francesca smiled at him you look like a catfish with your mouth open petro close it dear you really do need to talk to them theyve just foiled a plot against youand the holy roman empire this large young man is the emperors nephew as it happens who would have thought it and i believe also his emissary plenipotentiary having obeyed francescas first injunction to close his mouth petro dorma then did an even better catfish imitation youd better come inside said erik we have found out who has been committing those murders do you have her prisoner asked a slight man with an aquiline nose and a solid single dark line of eyebrow i am eneko lopez a legate of the grand metropolitan of rome we demand to speak to sister ursula erik shook his head too late weve found her foul chapel but shes gone come the doors were opened dorma and some of his party were escorted to the desecrated lady chapel one of the priests gagged immediately and clutched his nose chernobog he gasped the stench is horrid fierce even under the circumstances the mans broad savoyard accent was unmistakable erik looked curiously at the fellow hed heard of witchsmellers but had had no faith in them in times past now erik sniffed experimentally himself yes it was the same odor hed smelled in sachss study that one day hed thought it was sister ursulas perfumeand how odd it was for a nun to use perfume it was sort of sickly sweet confined in sachss room it had made him want to sneeze perhaps sachs himself had been the victim of a powerful amount of magical manipulation manfred was talking to petro dorma three parties ten will remain here the message to trieste should stop the knights if not well those who remain here can pass on charles fredriks orders the rest are split into the party going to tell emperor charles fredrik that im not dead yet and the bulk of us are riding after sister ursula take us with you said lopez she is what we seek manfred looked him over we want to leave as soon as we can get a boat to the mainland mounts may be a problem he hesitated and itll be a hard chase even for soldiers lopez snorted i was a soldier once ladand longer than youve been i venture to say you think i got this limp from the stairs in the vatican nor have i led what youd call a soft life since dorma interrupted i can solve one of your problems we have remounts on the mainland at the landing at chioggia ill send capi dstrozza with you hes from chioggia and will see you through to the forts and as he says senor lopez was once a knight despite the limp i think you can still ride no lopez smiled better than any ritter i suspect well find out the last sentence came out almost gleefully holy the man might be nowbut clearly enough there was still that basque truculence lurking somewhere within his soul over on saint marks square a bell began to ring frantically petro looked despondent the alarm tocsin now what erik smiled part of this conspiracy that we have partially unraveled i suspect give us your capi and well be moving and you can get back to saint marks he peered into the darkness at the hazy haloed moon looks like youre in for fog i hope your capi is a good navigator petro smiled back the best he was a smuggler before i recruited him fog was one of his favorite kinds of weather down on the water on the mainland side of rialto benito could have told erik the fog was thick enough to cut with a knife already it smelt odd marshy not the usual wetwool and smoke smell of venice fog benito wasnt going to let it worry him giaccomo was enough to worry about the heavy balding man was not the type to be impressed by case vecchie clothes or orders money would talk however benito hoped he had enough theyd picked up valentina claudia was off somewhere the way valentina said somewhere meant strega stuff dont ask your eyes almost seem to be glowing said maria looking at him curiously benito knew he could get killed doing this so could maria so could other people it didnt stop him loving it all he was feeling brave so he put a hand on her forearm that was gambling with your hand with maria its in my blood my grandfather and my father she flicked the hand off but almost gently your grandfather ive heard about delleste is a legend but the valdosta i asked theyre like marco benito pulled a wry face were halfbrothers really maria i think my father was carlo sforza she stared at him wideeyed sforza the wolf of the north she shook her head so just what are we going to do to get into the casa dandelo there are probably up to thirty dandelos and their slave overseers there are god alone knows how many montagnards there too we have thirty men and one thief there must be three hundred slaves said benito and the way out is going to be through the casa maria nodded true and having been in there myself killing a few slavemasters might be sweeter than freedom to a lot of them well keep it simple clever plans go wrong ill do my best you want thirty empty casks giaccomo looked at benito then at maria what for he went on polishing glasses and your small barge benito ignored the question and began counting out gold coins onto the counter he noticed that giaccomo had stopped polishing glasses youre with dorma nowadays said giaccomo quite the young case vecchie gentleman with a brother who once tried to sell me fake relics i want to know why boyor no deal not for twice as much im not marco said benito calmly giaccomo flustered marco benito knew you just had to keep calm around him have i ever done you wrong giaccomo i brought coin for you once yeah but i still want to know and nobody else has barrels enough benito shrugged dorma wants me to blow up casa dandelo destroy the place we had a dead certain tipoffhe couldnt resist the punthat its full of montagnards theyre due to cause trouble when the invaders come benito smiled and we all know how maria loves the dandelos a small corner of a smile touched giaccomos face she aint your tipoff benito knew that giaccomo regarded even a whiff of magic as bad news so he chose his phrasing carefully party called aleri heard of him giaccomos eyes narrowed he nodded he didnt look friendly you cant trust him ah lets put it this way he was answering certain questions for the signori di notte in an involuntary fashion giaccomo actually smiled he pulled three of the stacks of coin towards himself id lend you some manpower he paused this has nothing to do with aldanto has it benito shook his head very firmly giaccomo pushed one of the stacks of coin back benito pushed it over again its dormas money and its only right to tell you that if things go wrong you wont see your barge again aldantos got money from ferrara sitting here been coming in ever since you and that brother of yours showed up you see him you tell him theres two lots here the expression on giaccomos face said and i dont mind if he doesnt fetch it the barge is round the back jeppo will help you get the barrels loaded fifteen minutes later giaccomos barge was heading for the casa dandelo with a cargo of wine benito hoped that valentina had the gunpowder in position when theyd cased the joint picking up the guards on the roof shed said that it would be easy he hoped she was right because theyd need the distraction the cargo wouldnt get into the casa proper but there was an enclosed loading bay into the stores and slave quarters he maria and marias cousin luigi poled the barge little more than a floating flatbed full of barrels around to the front of the casa benito went and pounded on the door who is it at this time of night demanded someone far too quickly wine delivery from giaccomos yelled benito go away bellowed someone within we didnt order any wine benito yelled back party by the name of aleri came in and paid for it special delivery tonight there was the sound of talk as if a small argument were going on but benito was relaxed confident no one behind that door was going to turn down a cargo of wine and the deliverers were not exactly a threat a ragged fifteenyearold boy a seventeenyearold girl and an older bargee odds on the extra guests had already worked their way through most of the dandelos wine stockand with the war on heaven knew when theyd see more the door cracked open an eye appeared examining benito for a brief moment and then for a much longer moment the cargo on the barge all of that for us benito laughed you wish five casks the rest are for barduccis the boss wont let us do one person deliveries and barduccis is running dry gotta have it there inside the hour party there tonight with everyone going off to war you goin to accept this load or do we take it away again that dire threat brought the final decision bring it round the side some of the men will come down and open up send someone to offload too cheeky little sod does your master know youre so lazy ah come on on your way the men will see you there on his way down the side canal benito whistled loudly tunelessly out of the corner of his eye he had seen a glimpse of valentina on the opposite roof grappling hook ready she wasnt going to swing across herself but the small barrel of black powder was going to pendulum across valentina reckoned itd smash through those shutters like a knife through silk it didnt matter whether it did or not just so long as there was fire and trouble in the main residential part of the casa still benito wished he could watch he also hoped like hell valentina didnt stay to watch the dandelo men had already gotten the rusty portcullis they used to enclose their dock half up by the time they got there when the barge was in as benito expected the portcullis dropped again that made good security sense what happened next was not however what benito had expected at all there were seven dandelo men there as soon as the portcullis dropped the leader smiled at the barge crew and rubbed his hands well we got thirty barrels and three slaves for the price of five barrels and its on aleris coin ha take em boys hey protested benito you cant do that giaccomo knows where we are and hell send for the schiopettieri and you dont mess with giaccomos cargos the slaver laughed by the time he knows youve gone itll be too late hear that tocsin you got in just before the bell boy now were shut up siegetight until sforza gets here so come quietly or youre going to get hurt benito was paralyzed for an instant not knowing what to do thendead on timean explosion rocked the walls bits of mortar fell it was like a slap around the ears benito realized he still had a lot to learn about black powder it certainly stunned the dandelos but maria and her cousin luigi were tipping barrels as if it hadnt happened arsenalotti were scrambling out from under weapons in hand benito hadnt waited either hed gotten between the doorway and the dandelos and the first fool didnt even try to avoid the rapier hed snatched up from between the barrels he hadnt been prepared for the horror on that face but he didnt have time to think the blade was stuck right through the slaver so he pulled his knife out the next few moments gave him several reasons to write off part of caesare aldantos crimes only the training hed had at aldantos hand kept him alive two minutes later at the cost of one dead and three wounded men the dock was theirs and even from here they could hear the chaos that valentinas black powder had generated they moved out to the slave pens heavy hammers and cold chisels in the hands of two blacksmiths from the arsenal began making short work of the locks two of the arsenalotti stood by with a barrel full of cutlasses in the meanwhile maria and her ten escorts raced up the stairs looking for the passage shed found through to the casa itself the barrel of black powder they had with them should see that door blown open then it would be a case of shepherding freed armed slaves up and in listen up all of you shouted benito we have to cut our way out of the casa loot what you can especially clothes and dont kill anyone wearing these hats he pointed at his red woolen cap theyre our people when youre out into venice toss the cutlasses into the canal scatter act like citizens otherwise the schiopettieri will put you away not strictly true but the last thing petro dorma wanted on top of his troubles was a rampaging mob of armed exslaves arsenalissue cutlasses were cheap compared to that risk there was a ragged chorus of cheers most of the slaves were still staring unbelieving they started to believe when big gio smashed open the first lock with his cold chisel men andfrom the next penwomen streamed out taking the weapons as if theyd been handed the holy grail there was a small explosion from upstairs a much more controlledsounding one at least maria had an arsenal gunner to manage her black powder up shouted benito up the stairsand at the dandelos the cheer now was a wild deepthroated roar like a tiger uncaged and seeking furious vengeance on its trapper benito led them on up reflecting all the while on an old proverb hed once heard about the risks of riding a tiger maria had found being back inside this place a nightmare it made her feel weak and scared not the fighting or the danger just the horrible place itself still they had a job to do and casa dandelo would rue the day they had taken her prisoner she heard the tumult of the slaves coming up the stairs and saw benito at the head of them there was a fierceness in his shining eyes this wasnt the mischievous laughing boy she knewand had once made love to a memory she found strangely haunting this was the blood of the wolf of the north she didnt like it she didnt like it at all but when she thought about it it had always been there lurking under the surface for all his charm there was also something a little frightening about benito she followed after the rush fifteen minutes later she and benito were out on the grand canal in fog the casa dandelo was burning behind them well thats that said benito rubbing his hands in satisfaction i suppose youre proud of yourself said maria quietly well said benito swelling his chest a bit it was a good fight we didnt expect them to have milanese soldiers hidden in there but those slaves didnt let arquebuses or even the magicians stop them no finesse but lots of courage they had lots of courage because they were desperate benito and no way out and you used them as cannonfodder and that distraction of yours exploded in the family living quarters you probably killed and maimed a whole lot of kids so i hope youre not too proud of yourself benito valdosta because im not we just did what we had to do thats all benito started to say something then he stopped himself so what should i have done seeing as you are so clever he asked but there was doubt as well as hurt in his voice maria looked back at the burning building i dont know she said quietly but that was the way the wolf would do it the old fox kills for family not just for fun he would have figured out a better way uhhuh well ill think about it when i havent got a war to fight said benito the adult male gruffness in his voice did a poor job of covering the hurt in the boys wed better get back to the piazza and find out what that tocsin was all about the bell was lucrezia brunellis way of telling the city that its second most important citizen ricardo brunelli was dead murdered and not five hundred yards away a building was burning a runner came up panting arsenalotti count badoero has landed at the sacca della misericordia with many men chapter nobody challenged sixty fully armored knights riding through the dark they crossed the brenta and the piave bridges without opposition now as the sky was turning gray with the dawn they only had the last league or so to go we might be ahead you know said erik they landed at mestre we saved a fair distance by going around by sea to chioggia hmm said manfred as long as they didnt meet up with francesca no point in worrying about that said erik more immediate is the problem of how to stop the forts from opening fire on us or what to do if we see ursula and her escort manfred snorted she has twentyfive knights and a bunch of servants of the holy trinity we have sixty we ride the bastards down erik was tired and irritable it had been a long night shell have picked up an escort probably from the scaligers possibly arquebusiers think manfred and this caskethow do you think she plans to use it lopez who had been riding beside them as if hed been born in the saddlequite unlike his two companionsturned slightly and answered she and the servants will probably abandon their escort and head for the fort posing as distressed holy pilgrims the fort will let them in particularly when they see one is a woman and there are only five of them then i imagine they will release the woden from the casket they alone will be protected when everyone is deador flees which most of them willthe troops will come up and turn the cannon in this fort on the other and then the enemy will sail through to attack venice erik nodded thats what id do i suppose if that monster in the casket is so powerful and what would you do about meeting the knights and the escort it would depend on the terrain and the light answered lopez arquebuses are inaccurate at the best of times and pretty useless at night he eyed the large prince or was the question aimed at you manfred sighed eriks trying to get me to say a double feint or something senor lopez and then hell say no keep it simple stupid always flank them hes a blasted teacher born there was a flash of teeth in the halfdark from the basque a good one too then simplicity is usually bestin war as in all things their guide rode up theres a party of soldiers ahead a barricade look like mercenary arquebusiers can we go around the guide looked at the heavily armored knights shook his head too swampy theyre not venetians are they asked erik the guide shook his head again scaliger colors erik was not surprised by the answer the scaligers were the ruling family of verona traditional allies of milan and supporters of the montagnard faction in italian politics since they controlled the adige route from venice through the brenner pass into the holy roman empire they had been expected to intervene in the war in alliance with milan and how far are we from the fort asked manfred the guide shrugged half a league maybe less i think weve got to move fast ritters snapped manfred ill bet theyve left their escort and are advancing on foot erik shook his head scout it quickly first it shouldnt take ten minutes itll rest the horses and it may spell the difference between success and failure ursula must plan to arrive when the forts defenders can see them easily that gives us a few minutes they halted the guide slipped forward on foot he returned to report that there were some hundred or so cavalrymen breakfasting on the edge of a field of peas right manfred took a deep breath we dont want to lose the time fighting the troops and let ursula get into that fort if we defeat every one of them and she and her henchmen get in weve failed remember that chapel that is what were dealing with not some italian mercenaries erik you tell them how you want to run this that way you cant complain if i get it wrong erik nodded skirmish combat against wild tribes in vinland was something he had three years of experience with and more than that in the similar type of warfare which plagued clanridden iceland knightproctor von oderberg you are going to take care of the troops manfred von gherens etten and i will keep riding with lopez and his companions dont get your horses among the peasyoull lose mobility if you keep those scaliger mercenaries dismounted and busy von oderberg thatll be fine you dont have to do more than that try to tell our fellow knights you have orders from sachs to turn them back but if need be cut them down they caught sight of the little band bearing the casket not three hundred yards from the fortresss walls by the sounds of it von oderberg was butchering the escort or being butchered erik didnt turn around to look he just bent low over his horses neck one of the monks did turn perhaps alerted by the sudden thunder of hooves he shouted something the monks and sister ursula stopped erik could see that sister ursula was scrawling something in the dust with a long staff wind laden with grit and debris leapt at them horses reared and screamed ritter etten and father diego fell erik struggled to stay on his horse hastily almost falling himself he managed to dismount the horse fled erik manfred and von gherens now dismounted formed a phalanx of steel around lopez and father pierre as they began to advance lightnings crackled off the steel behind them eric heard lopez saying let that which cannot abide the name of jesus begone and somehow the resistance eased they continued plodding forward etten came up to join them father diego is too dazed from his fall he muttered to erik we wont have his help erik saw that sister ursula was ordering the monks to lower the casket to the ground as they drew closer he could see that the casket no longer carried its heavy chains and securing locks nothing held the lid down beyond its own weight they were ten yards away now ursula stood next to the casket at the center of the circle she had scrawled her staff held upright in one hand with the four monks standing like guardian statues at the cardinal points the circle seemed to sparkle the nuns wimple had fallen and her hair was revealed a great mane of it in a dark corona around her white face the face itself seemed to bear no expression at all it might have been the face of a statue if marble could blink its eyes and move its lips you cannot prevail vessel of chernobog said lopez repent and save your soul i am eneko lopez legate of the grand metropolitan and master of holy magic you cannot prevail let your darkness begone fiat lux light leapt even from the stones except inside the circle ursula laughed the sound was mocking but emptyas if an actress were feigning an emotion she had never understood or had forgotten i might even be afraid lopez lucrezia told me that she failed to find the chink that most men have in their armor foolish woman she thought she was as powerful as i impossible when she refused to join herself fully with the great lord eriks flesh crawled everything about the way the woman spoke was empty the nuns habit fell aside the body that was revealed wore clinging black silk the halftransparent silk hid little in fact it seemed designed to tantalize rather than to conceal but again the display was empty there was no woman there to give the shapely flesh any real allure erik finally understood how completely chernobog had consumed the creature she reached forward and tapped the casket and i have my little friend here servants of the holy trinity see what you have in your midst shouted lopez the monks didnt move they stood like statues arms outstretched warding they are mine body and soul said ursula unlike lucrezia i insist on total control she stinks of ice and chernobog said pierre it was true thought erik that was what the smell reminded him of breaking sea ice with a sickly sweetness over it it was very strong now suddenly the savoyard priest clutched at his crucifix and sat down gasping a moment later his eyes rolled back and he slumped on his side unconscious manfred ignored pierres collapse he glanced at erik and said lazily i heard she was fat as a sow when she joined the order sold her soul for a pair of tits erik realized what manfred was doing exactly what the venetian swordmaster giuliano had taught them unbalance your enemy make them angry it was a dangerous game erik was not prepared to leave him to play it alone she got cheated he sneered shes still too ugly to get customers anywhere except the docks but the gibes seemed to have no effect on ursula at all erik caught the tiny telltale signs of manfred tensing when he lunged forward so did erik so did von gherens and etten eriks sword struck the air above the circle it was like hitting a wall he caught a glimpse of ursula swinging her staff a huge and shadowy hand swung towards him it didnt actually make contact but fear and pain washed though erik he wanted to scream to turn and run von gherens stumbled and fell etten whimpered manfred grunted and tried to press forwardbut was driven back ursula shrieked words erik did not recognize small biting pinching imps leapt out of the air they turned to ashes as they struck armor but there were so many it impossible to see or move then lopez shouted reverse your swords hold them like a crucifix and ground the tips in the honest earth erik and manfred immediately obeyed staggering back onto his feet so did von gherens etten tried but the sword slipped out of his hands lopez began to chant in latin immediately the imps were immobilized in the air then began to shrink then vanish into wisps of smoke the monk guardians began to crumple ursula shrieked again another command of some sort the four monks seemed to summon their fading strength and began scuffing the soil with their sandals within a moment the circle which ursula had scratched was broken at the four cardinal points at the broken points hot air seemed to eddy out of the circle and wash over erik and manfred and the others the same hot air swirling at the four compass points like miniature cyclones sucked the monks dry in an instant four skinbags full of bones collapsed to the ground the heated air seemed to glow and darken simultaneously as if drawing power and form from its consumption of the monks no closer warned ursula she laid a hand on the caskets lid no closer or i will release the woden lopez walked forward coming to stand next to erik he held a very small crucifix in his hand this is a fragment of the true cross witch evil cannot prevail against it lopezs words seemed to have no effect ursulas lips curled in what erik would have called a sneer had it not been for the emptiness of the face which framed it a woman can sneer a vessel cannot besides if you open that casket said manfred your plot is at naught at that moment ursulas face underwent a transformation a horrid one the face thickened grew heavy the shapely cheeks sagged into jowls the fair brow swelled looming now over sunken eye sockets inside the orbs a womans dark eyes became slits of pure black and now for the first time emotion filled the face anger and cruelty overlaid by triumph erik understood that the vessel was now filled to the brim and overflowing this was not ursula this was chernobog himself lurking inside her flesh the horrible facehalfman halfwomanbared white teeth turning yellow as erik watched do not presume to instruct your betters stripling there are plots and plots if the woden cannot accomplish one task it can certainly succeed in another eriks mind seemed to be working much faster than his body he understood chernobogs new purpose and desperately tried to reach manfredto seize the prince and hurl him back out of danger but some magic was causing his flesh to move like soft lead the same magic seemed to have frozen manfred and von gherens completely etten was no longer standing at all the knight had crumpled to his knees his head lolling chernobogursulas voice rolled on here fool boyuncontrolled and unwardedthe woden will kill and kill and kill you will be dead and your precious empire left with one heir the less ursulas hand had remained female now even more suddenly than her face the hand changed grew swelled became first the hand of a large man and then the handthe paw ratherof something still larger the claws plunged into the wood of the casket lid and began to raise it heat and darkness spilled out of the crack like a flood a horrible stench came with it lopez stepped forward and met the surge of darkness from the casket with the tiny cross he shouted some words erik did not understand in greek he thought not latin neither the action nor the words seemed to have any effect on the swelling darkness but erik felt the paralysis which had kept him almost immobile suddenly lift he could see the chernobogursula face open its mouth the thick lips began to twist began to utter words of their ownwords which erik had no doubt at all would counter those of lopez the basque priest was still shouting greek phrases but the paralysis was completely gone now erik moved faster than he ever had in his life the algonquian war hatchet sailed across the distance and buried itself up to the wirebound hilt in hisher skull blood gushed the obsidian eyes seemed to flame black fire for an instant before the body toppled back and fell to the ground as it fell all traces of chernobog left the face and then more slowly the hand but the talons remained longest of alllong enough to draw the lid of the casket open as ursula fell the hot stinking blackness poured out like lava from a volcano sweeping over erik and manfred and all the others erik could hear the gleeful shriek of a monster somewhere that shriek was immediately overridden by another ettens voice that was howling in agony erik turned toward the sound his eyes tearing from the heat and the stench the woden monster had seized upon etten he knew etten the weakest of them was being consumed by fire from within suddenly lopezs voice rang out more loudly than erik would have believed possible coming from such a small man in an instant the darkness vanished and erik could see clearly again etten was writhing on the ground his fingers clawing at the straps of his helmet smoke was pouring up through the visor von gherens nearest to him leaned over and began to help a flash of flame seemed to leap through the visor and smite the prussian knight in the face now it was von gherens turn to writhe on the ground screaming in agony quick shouted lopez use your swords moving together erik and manfred grabbed their swords by the hilts and held them up like great crucifixes one over each panted lopez manfred stooped over von gherens erik over etten after a moment the smell of burning flesh seem to ebb slightly not much erik glanced at lopez the basque priests face was drawn and haggard it is too strong he murmured too strongand too attached to etten lopezs eyes seemed hollow under the solid eyebrows but whatever weakness the priest might be feeling none of it was apparent in his next words kill etten do it now while there is still time erik stared at him the basque shook his head he is dead anyway erik the burning has already destroyed too much of his body but we can still rescue his soul if we release him from the woden in time still erik hesitated he glanced at von gherens the prussian knight seemed unconscious erik could see enough of his face through the visor to see that there was still a face there whereas etten he looked through the visor of the knight below him through that visor he could see nothing but burnt flesh like a piece of meat charred in a fire still he hesitated and then what do the same for von gherens and then what cut our own throats lopez shook his head wearily i cannot fight this monster in salamander form if pierre were still with usor better yet dottore marina again he shook his head i can hold it at bay for a time but not combat it directly you will have to do it erikyou and manfred manfred had said nothing but he had apparently been following the discussion fat chance of that lopez what erik and i know about magic wouldnt fill half a manuscript page and all of it would be gibberish lopezs laugh was more of a crows caw than anything else have no fear of that i cannot fight the thing but i can transform it into something which you can fight but i warn youit will be monstrous eriks hands tightened on the sword hilt something flesh and blood you mean heh in a manner of speaking yes a particularly horrid form of it you understand flesh and blood is flesh and blood growled manfred he hefted the sword higher and steel is steel do it the last two words were spoken by a prince and no one could mistake it erik hissed his own agreement and lopez bowed his head for a moment when the basques head came back up however there was not a trace of obeisance in his face his was the face of a man born to command himself obey me then erik kill etten manfred stand back from von gherens erik hesitated no longer using the hilt to drive the sword he plunged the blade through the gaps in the armor into ettens throat then twisted it to open the wound before withdrawing the sword arterial blood fountained for a moment not long that wound would have killed an elephant he stepped back manfred had already done the same von gherens began to writhe again as smoke again began to rise through his visor lopez shouted somethingagain in that odd language which erik had thought was greek but now suspected was something else entirelyand held the crucifix high what seemed like a clap of thunder struck the world all around erik flinched so did manfred von gherens screamed and arched his back a stream of black something spewed out of his gaping mouth and spilled onto the ground several yards away another clap of thunder a wave of darkness then for the first time since the battle had begun erik felt all traces of magic vanish the sunlight was clean again with no obscuring darkness he felt enormous relief pouring through him and took a deep breath and deeply regretted it the stench was worse than ever but at least now the source of the stench was clear and obvious on the spot where the black something had spilled a monster rose on its haunches it was huge half again manfreds size somewhere in its misshapen and hideous form erik could detect the remnants of something which had once been humanor close to it mostly in the upper face which still had a recognizable aspect the one eye possessed by the monsterthe other was scarred over as if the eye had been torn out sometime long agowas quite human in appearance bright blue piercingly blue the eyebrows were as blond as eriks own the rest the lower face protruded in apelike jaws though they bore a closer resemblance to those of an eel than those of an ape when the monster bared its teeth and roared its fury a thick tongue writhed purple behind teeth that were not even remotely mammalian they reminded erik of sharks teeth more than anything else everything about the monster had that bizarre horrible halfandhalf quality the hind legs were those of a land animal of some kind a giant wolfs perhapsexcept the skin was naked almost scaly the arched heavy spine was also that of a mammal with a straggly mane that resembled human hair more than animal fur but the heavy tail was purely reptilian the front limbs were perhaps the worst of all heavy powerful armsalmost human except for their sizeended in a demons taloned paws except no demon erik had ever heard of possessed suckers on its palms and forearms as if an octopus were part of its ancestry again the monster roared there was a peculiar glee to the sound as if the creature had been forced into silence for so long that the mere act of making noise was a joy in its own right any advice lopez asked manfred cheerfully the big prince was holding his sword by the hilt now ready to fight erik glanced at the basque priest but lopez he saw immediately would be of no more further assistance the man was clearly exhausted lopez simply shook his head and whispered this is your affair now prince of the realm i can do no more god and the right erik felt a moments dismay at the last words he knew that manfred would sure enough dia a coir bellowed the prince striding forward two steps and bringing his heavy sword down on the monster with a great twohanded swing reckless idiot erik lunged forward the monster squalledhalf in fury half in gleeand evaded the blow deftly the sword sank into the soil an instant later spinning the wodens tail lashed around and knocked manfreds legs out from under him the prince landed on his back his sword flying out of his hands fortunately eriks training in wrestling enabled manfred to break the fall by slapping down his arms but for that moment he was helpless the woden charged forward like a crocodile great jaws gaping a taloned and suckered hand raised for the death blow this time it was the monsters turn to misgauge erik moved far faster than the woden expected his sword met the downstrike and removed the hand at the wrist as neatly as a carrot top removed by a knife the hideous thing went sailing through the air and plopped into some nearby bushes the woden shrieked in agony black blood pumping from its severed wrist the jaws lunging at manfreds throat veered aside and snapped at erik another mistake again the monster was caught by surprise no human it had ever faced moved as quickly as the icelander erik sidestepped the snapping jaws then as they gaped wide again his sword slid through the teeth mangling the great tongue the woden squalled in pain and fury and twisted aside blood gushing from its maw the tail lashed around striking at eriks legs but the blow was blocked first by erik driving his sword into the soil then by manfred lunging forward and grappling the monsters hindquarters the prince gathered his legs under him ignoring the claws scrabbling at his armor then with a grunt heaved the monster completely off the ground and slammed it into a nearby tree the treea sapling reallybroke under the impact so did the wodens ribs erik was astonished hed always known that manfred was far stronger than the average man but he realized now that hed never really seen manfred exert his entire strength this wasalmost superhuman the monster must have weighed at least four hundred pounds again the woden lashed its tail and again knocked manfred down this time however the prince had been expecting the blow so he was simply staggered to his knees rather than upended desperately erik raced forward as badly injured as the woden was the horror was still alive and still quite capable of wreaking havoc and manfredhis charge and responsibilitywas facing another attack unarmed and on his knees the woden sprang at the prince using its hind legs to drive and its remaining forelimb for balance the jaws opened like a sharksand if the tongue was a ruin the teeth were not to erik everything seemed to move as slowly as ice the jaws were approaching manfred faster than his sword could intervene jaws now gaping wide enough to close on manfreds entire head helmet and alland erik didnt doubt for a moment that those jaws were quite capable of crushing the helmet like a snail manfred broke its jaw one punch with an armored fist skewed the wodens bite into a harmless snap the monster coughed blood halfstunned but its forward momentum knocked manfred on his back again this time with the woden sprawled across him erik hesitated unsure where to strike with the sword that wouldnt risk hitting manfred then gah what a stink the monsters head and back suddenly lurched up manfred lying beneath the creature was holding it up with his big hands clamped firmly around its gullet holding it upand steady do me the favor would you hissed the prince eriks sword drove into the glaring blue eye and deep into the wodens brain the monster twitched and shuddered and kept twitching and shuddering after erik jerked the sword loose from the skull with another great heave manfred tossed the thing off soaked with blood he rose to his feet and stalked over to the place where his sword had been sent sailing then stalked back the woden was lying on its side still twitching and shuddering manfred spent the next considerable period of time hacking it into small chunks he didnt stop until each single piece of the monster was lying motionless and the blade of his sword was as dull as a table knife erik tried to restrain him early on so that he could examine the prince for injuries but manfred would have none of it dia a coir was repeated perhaps two dozen times intermingled with other expressions which were vulgar and profane beyond belief eventually erik gave up and went to help lopez who had begun tending to von gherens the prussian knight was alive though still unconscious but now that the basque priest had removed the mans helmet erik was relieved to see that the burn marks on von gherenss face were not as bad as he had feared hell be all right with a little rest murmured lopez the facial scars will be bad butat least hes a prussian they treasure the things so there should be no really adverse consequences he glanced at manfred still furiously dismembering the alreadydismembered carcass of the woden and smiled slyly unlike your friend whoi daresayis adding years in purgatory with every oath that comes out of his mouth erik wasnt quite sure how to respond lopez shook his head not your problem my fine young icelandic friend you are not responsible for protecting the hohenstauffens from god after all erik couldnt help grinning true enough seeing that lopez needed no further help with von gherens for the moment erik went over to retrieve his hatchet from the corpse of sister ursula but there was no corpse just a burned piece of grass and there was no hatchet either only the wirebound shaft remained after a time erik fell silent lopez clucked his tongue and i daresay youve just added as many years where did you learn to curse like that anyway stolidly erik stared at the priest then pointed at manfred who had finally left off with his hacking oh sure grumbled the prince blame everything on me chapter erik and manfred stood in one of the bastions of the northernmost of the polestine forts watching the venetian cannons finish pounding the last of the milanese galleasses into rubble it seemed a somewhat pointless exercise since the galleass had ceased being a watercapable means of transport quite some time ago but a quick glance through the gunports in either of the bastions retired flanks was enough to see the reason the ditch in front of the curtain wall was a charnel house with nothing more to fire at beyond a relative handful of wounded and maimed soldiers in visconti colors nothing alive at least the ditch was mounded with shattered bodies all that was left of the milanese mercenaries who had stormed the fortress thinking a quick rush would be enough to overwhelm the few surviving defenders the rising sun cast a pale reddish glow over a landscape which seemed redsoaked already the mercenaries trapped at the curtain wall had tried to surrender soon enough but the venetians were in no mood for terms on this day at least the normal conditions of italian condottieri warfare had been suspended milan had tried to destroy venice the city of the winged lion was returning the compliment the gunners in the bastions had kept firing on the men piled up along the curtain wall until they had been turned into so much ground meat then still raging turned their fire onto the grounded and crippled galleasses there too clearly enough they would not be satisfied until the ships had been turned into so much kindling manfred squinted into the distance where the retreating milanese army could be seen frantically trying to build fieldworks their galleasses destroyed and the assault on the forts having been driven off with heavy losses sforza had led the visconti forces into a retreat along the river had tried to rather now finding that enrico delleste had cut off his retreat with a far larger army than anyone believed ferrara could possibly put into the field sforza was doing what he could to prepare a hasty defense no old fox out there today mused manfred hes looking for sforzas blood or i miss my guess erik did not argue the matter that was his assessment also he thought the duke of ferrara was behaving foolishly but given what he knew of the personal history between delleste and sforza he was hardly surprised the old fox had waited for years to obtain revenge on milan and now that the day had come he clearly intended to show carlo sforza who was really the wolf of the north they heard footsteps behind them clambering up the stone stairs to the bastion with an oddly arrhythmic pace before they even turned their heads they knew it was lopez the basque priest had been tending to his two companions in the forts infirmary below diego and pierre had both survived the encounter with ursula and the woden monster but they had been badly shaken lopez limped over to stand next to them he spent no more than a moment or two studying the distant scene with eyes which had clearly seen more than one battlefield in times past stupid he pronounced we have no idea what is transpiring in venice itself while ferrara obtains his revenge here the city may still be lost that neatly summed up eriks assessment manfreds also judging from his nod come commanded lopez if we can reach delleste in time we may still be able to convince him to forego his pleasure he turned and began limping off what can we began manfred but lopezs impatient wave of the hand stifled the rest you are the emperors nephew young dolt and i have a certain talisman which may help now come im not entirely sure i care for that man said manfred sourly as he and erik followed the basque toward the forts stables erik smiled and i on the other hand am entirely sure that father eneko lopez doesnt care in the least what you think of him he should grumbled manfred im the emperors nephew dammit by the time they reached the ferrarese lines and were able to negotiate their way through to the dukes presence the battle was well underway not that it was much of a battle yet clearly enough from what they had seen as they approached the old fox hadnt lost any of his tactical acumen since he had sforza trapped he intended to bleed him with gunfire as long as possible before ordering any direct assaults dellestes own soldiers were mercenaries for the most part professional soldiershighly experienced italian ones especiallyhad little use for commanders who wasted their lives in premature assaults the dukes field headquarters consisted of nothing more elaborate than a simple openair pavilion erected on a small hill overlooking the battleground they found delleste standing just under the overhang studying sforzas lines with a telescope like all the optical devices of the day the telescope was a heavy boxlike affair mounted on a stand the old duke was slightly stooped peering through the eyepiece hearing their footsteps he stood erect and turned to face them he gave each of them a quick study in turn perhaps oddly he spent most of his time studying erik and manfred the two men he had never met before knights of the holy trinity he asked his lips quirked into a wry smile not wearing full armor i think you might be excommunicated if youre not careful manfred frowned erik chuckled im from iceland your grace spent time in vinland also full armor in todays world is just stupid the dukes eyes fixed on manfred and you large one do you agree manfred was clearly struggling not to glare outright so all he managed in reply was a muffled grunt which could be taken as a form of agreement i declare you honorary italians pronounced the old fox then he faced lopez his smile disappearing theres no point in discussing the matter father i know perfectly well why you came venice is venice ferrara is ferrara ive done enough for venice this morning the rest of the dayand tomorrow and the day after if thats what it takesbelongs to me and mine he turned his head his fierce old eyes glaring at the distant milanese lines i will have sforzas head and spend the rest of my days planning to reap viscontis me and mine demanded lopez the priest reached into his cassock and drew forth a small object when he presented it to the duke erik could see that it was a miniature portrait he had wondered what the object had been that hed seen lopez tucking into his saddlebag when they left the fort do you remember what you said to me when you gave me this socalled old fox old boar more like dumb as a nearsighted pig erik was surprised to see that delleste did not bridle under the sarcasm indeed for a moment his lips even twitched as if he were trying to control a smile lamb of christ is it murmured the duke lynx of christ more like feral as a starving cat lopez ignored the riposte he simply held the portrait up in front of dellestes face after a moment the old man looked away most of all you must remember the mother eneko lowered the portrait exactly so he pointed toward the milanese it was not sforza who murdered your daughter other crimes can be laid at his feet ive no doubt but not that one had he not abandoned her hissed the duke visconti would never have dared to strike at her the same could be said of you retorted lopez instantly dellestes face turned white as a sheet his handold and veined but still muscularclenched the hilt of the sword buckled to his waist the eyes he turned on lopez were hot with fury erik held his breath next to him he could feel manfred tensing eneko never flinched the little basque priest returned the duke of ferraras glare with one of his own which in its own way seemed just as hot indeed he rubbed salt into the wounds the father condemns the lover he demanded for the same deed which he committed himself lopez pointed a stiff finger at the unseen figure of carlo sforza what that man did was give you a grandson a grandson who istoday now this minutefighting for his life in the streets of venice the basque dropped his arm contemptuously like father like grandfather no doubt you will abandon the grandson as you did the mother nothing may be allowed to interfere with a petty lords overweening pride a sin which he will try to mask by giving it the name of honor eriks eyes were on the dukes hand clutching the sword hilt the knuckles were ivory white and the sword was now drawn an inch out of the scabbard so he couldnt see the expression on dellestes face or that of lopez but he couldnt mistake the sneer in the basques voice old fox was ever a man more badly misnamed to give up his chance for vengeance on viscontiwho did murder his daughterin order to salvage his pitiful dignity on the body of a lover erik glanced up quickly seeing the twitch in the hand holding the sword the fury in dellestes eyes seemed adulterated now filling with cunningsurmise at leastinstead of sheer rage the dukes teeth were clenched his next words were more hissed than spoken explain lopez once again demonstrated what erik was beginning to believe was an almost infinite capacity for surprise the priests face suddenly burst into an exuberant grin finally the italian asks the basques advice on a matter of vendetta about time he rubbed his hands almost gleefully then crossed himself i cannot speak to the point concretely you understand im sworn to the work of christ but at a glance it seems to me that the son is better suited to settle accounts with the father than you are at the appropriate time andgiven some sage advice and counsel from his grandfather in the months and years to comeis certainly the best choice to settle accounts with the mothers murderer again he crossed himself god willing of course but on this matter i suspect the lord will smile kindly again he crossed himself provided of course that the son is alive tomorrow and providedagain he crossed himselfthat he manages to avoid falling into the pit of sinfulness the day after more sedately um to be precise manages to clamber out of the pit being as i suspect he is already halfway into it the sound of the sword hilt slapping back into the scabbard jolted erik a bit the dukes harsh chuckle even more so id ask you to become his counselor said delleste but i suspect that would fall into the category of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse lopez managed to look aggrieved not much how soon do you need me in venice asked the duke the priest shrugged the sooner the better but he glanced out at the ferrarese forces constructing their own fieldworks the quick assessment was that of a man who had once been a veteran soldier himself under the best of circumstances you cannot manage the task sooner than the day after tomorrow that should be good enough even if the enemy wins the battle in venice today they will not be able to fortify their position in less than a week not in venice not without sforza the duke nodded very well ill start today but i intend to bleed sforzaand viscontiof everything i can before leaving goes without saying agreed lopez nodding sagely drain every lira from his pay chest leave his mercenaries moaning their lost money but savoring their salvaged lives they wont be able to do anything about it anyway since you will naturally demand their guns and their pikes he pursed his lips considering the problem probably best to leave the officers their swords except sforzas of course youll want to break that over your knee in front of him the duke of ferrara was smiling thinly now fierce you are father lopez the days when i could break a sword over my kneea good ferrara blade anyway and be sure thats what sforza possessesare long gone allow me the privilege then said manfred forcefully he extended his huge hands i wont even need a knee oh exclaimed lopez how rude of me i forgot to make the introductions enrico delleste duke of ferrara meet manfred of brittany hes the emperors nephew by the way and has some incredible list of titles i cant remember them all earl of something marquis of whatever baron of this and that dellestes eyes may have widened a bit but not much mostly he seemed interested in manfreds hands youll need a pair of iron gauntlets he mused damn things have to be good for something growled erik manfred snapped sforzas sword like a twig the commander of the milanese forces italys most famous condottiere did not so much as flinch at the sound whatever else he was carlo sforza was no coward you look just like your son commented manfred mildly as he handed sforza the point end of the broken blade except benitos not reached his full growth yet and he isnt as meanlooking sforzas round hard muscular face registered surprise as much at the return of the blade perhaps as the mention of his son youve met him yup manfred held his right hand above the ground about an inch lower than the top of sforzas curly hair so tall dont think hell get any taller he gave sforzas stocky form a quick onceover but i think hes going to wind up even thicker than you the kids already got the forearms of a small bear for a moment a shadow seemed to cross the condottieres face that was the first expression other than stoic resignation erik had seen sforza exhibit since the surrender ceremony began in midafternoon and it was now well into sunset i havent seen him in years the great captains words were almost whispered you will predicted manfred he held up the hilt end of the broken sword in his left hand there was more than a foot of the blade left ill be giving this to him when i see him next he nodded toward the duke of ferrara standing stiffly some distance away as his grandfather commanded some daydont ever doubt it sforzahell be coming to get the rest of it and when that day comes said erik between tight jaws i strongly urge you to have found another employer or your guts will be the carpet he uses to get to viscontis throat sforzas dark eyes swiveled toward him eriks grin was quite savage believe me carlo sforza im an icelander and i know a feud when i see one ive met benito also ill consider your words the dark eyes got even harder i told filippo visconti this was a fools errand damn all dukes and their complicated schemes but he pays well very well manfred snorted idiot benitoll spill your purse before he spills the rest of you thats my boy murmured the wolf of the north others doubted but i never did chapter the grayness swirled thick carrying the sounds of combat and dying despite everything theyd done some of aleris agents had survived fire bloodied the fog to the south and the smell of it was thick in the air marco turned to kat a heaviness in his chest and the edge of despair in his voice were losing in spite of everything were losing count badoero must have brought at least a thousand men caesare has made sure the damned militia are ineffectual the arsenalotti and the boatpeople fight well but this fogit confuses everything theres something wrong with this fog its like its fighting for them it feels heavy not natural said kat shed acquired a cut on one cheek and two ash smudges on the other with or without them marco still thought she was the most beautiful wonderful person hed ever met she lightened the fog around her and in the face of her hope and determination he lost some of his despair if kat believed in him in their cause maybe she patted his arm youre a good general marco people rally to you he pulled a face he didnt want to be a general and it wasnt what he was good at if only there was something he could do to make a bigger difference than merely whacking at people hed rather be meeting over a glass of wine at a taverna benito is twice the organizer and i hate this killing someone came running out of the fog it was rafael gasping for breath luciano says needs you the marciana they headed across at a run they werent that far from san marco anyway rafael led them upstairs to a room and they burst through the door sigils and arcane symbols were chalked on the floor and all three of them came to an abrupt halt before they so much as touched a toe to one of those sigils a complex triple circle with squares at the cardinal points and an internal octagon occupied the center of the roomthat wasnt chalked it was inlaid onto the floor of the room this is aa working chamber marco realized a place for magic and nothing else christian magic jewish strega all three perhaps there was some overlapmore than just some if brother mascoli was to be believed emeralds twinkled from the cardinal square nearest themsapphires from the one across the roomtopaz to the left and rubies to the right the lines of the diagrams were laid out ingold and silver well for some strega magic the magic with the purest intentions that called only great spirits silver and gold were a good thing not something to be avoided silver for diana and gold for dianus or silver for the moon and gold for the stars or silver for earth and gold for heaven the jewels glittered and the whole of the diagrams seemed to scintillate the boundaries werent fully up yet but the energies that would create the walls between the realms werent white they were opalescent rainbowed the air was thick with incense luciano clad in a long white robe loomed out of the scented smoke he looked old and tiredolder than marco had ever seen him before and frail his skin seemed translucent as if the motral part of him was wearing thin and his soul shining through it are we winning marco sighed and shook his head despair once again pressing down on him no we have more men but badoero and caesare are just too damned good and they have the certainty of more men coming kats grandfather got the message off to triesteif that works at least we wont have to deal with the rest of the knots manfred and erik and lopez rode off to try to save the polestine forts from that nun we wont know for some time whether sforza is on his way here with the milanese in the meantime were fighting firesand each other often enoughin this damned fog lucianos lips thinned with anger it is indeed a damned fog it is caused by chernobog working through someone here in venice lucrezia brunelli i would think is the only one powerful enough to do it alone but shes supposed to have left the city so perhaps it is several mages working together the only good thing about it is that its taking nearly all of their energy weather magic is hard expensive magic theyve obviously got gold to burn said marco bitterly the expense i refer to is of magical energy said luciano tiredly and what i have been doing is alsoexpensive i had hoped to avoid this but it seems we have little choice i will perform a summoning if it works it will save us save venice but it calls of all things for one of the case vecchie blood one of the longi and only four families are listed two are no more the other two are valdosta and montescue what do i have to do asked marco a bit doubtfully a summoning just what was luciano going to summon not necromancy dear jesu be within the circle of invocation give some of your blood it seemed simple enough some of his bloodthat couldnt hurt not here it was a token sacrifice not an actual one something perhaps to remind a greater spirit of a promise from long ago blood to blood ill do it said kat decisively it says montescue doesnt it luciano shook his head the script is faint but it clearly says a son thisthis is a christianized attempt at a far more ancient ceremony but it is all that i have hence he waved an ancient bronze knife vaguely at the rest of the room all this according to this it should be the metropolitan who is doing this but he didnt finish the sentence what will this do marco asked feeling oddly detached and strangely calm luciano shrugged the spell has only been used twice before yet this is a very ancient copy of an even more ancient spell it is called the lions crown and it invokes the spirit of the lion of the marshes one of the oldest of the great neutral spirits the guardian of the lagoon the marshes the islands and yesthe lion is still here and strong it influences much still but mostly it slumbers waiting for venices hour of need it is what chernobog has feared most all along and why he maneuvered so stealthily if the lion awakesawakes fully as only you can donot even chernobog can stand against it not here not in venice the memory of a brushing of wings passed through marcos mind but was gone before he could snatch at it luciano looked directly into marcos eyes as if weighing the heart behind them i think this is that hour of need and not only do you bear the blood you carry the mark of that lion scrying glasses turn to you ive long known you would wear the mantle after im gone but you can also wear the crownand do it now are you willing the mark of the lion mantle crown but this was no time for questions not now questions could wait until after when this was over if they all survived this might be the only way for them all to survive certainly the enemies of venice whether they were evil spirits or came with fire and the sword would not leave any of them standing marco nodded its my city and they are my people i am your person too said kat quietly and im scared for you marco i dont understand any of thisandandit sounds like a sacrifice he leaned forward andfor the first timekissed her cheek gently itll be all right and if we dont do something it wont matter the city is burning caesare and count badoeros men are winning somehow she composed her face stilled her trembling drew herself up and stood like the daughter of montescue that she was i love you marco valdosta his heart swelled with pride for her and i love you too katerina montescue luciano stamped his foot impatiently come on there are auspicious times for doing these things and one of them is dawn its hard to tell in this fog but that must be soon step inside the circle and let me close it behind you this is a great spell and it will tax me to my utmost kat was left standing head bowed disconsolate his kiss still warm on her cheek to watch as the wardfires flared a tear trickled down her nose this was dangerous horribly dangerous she felt it in her bones no matter that marco didnt seem to think anything of it a strega mage practicing a christian version of a pagan spell it was crazyhow much could go wrong or had gone wrong in the transliteration luciano was taking on more than he should ever have dared and he had dragged marco in after him or was she just getting overprotective about marco she fumbled out her talisman and took comfort from the fact that at least the medal was cool the door opened and kat whirled one hand on her saint hypatia medal the other on her dagger the medal flared with heat lucrezia brunelli stood there smiling in triumph crying for your lover little montescue she asked smirking cruelly its a waste of time and tears kat gasped youre supposed to have left then as the words themselves penetrated and damn you im crying for a good man lucrezia laughed throwing her handsome head back theres no such thing girl believe meive tried them all from capuletti to my brother ricardo kat gaped for a long moment as lucrezia waited for the sense of that to penetrate unable to believe what she had actually heard your byour brother lucrezia smiled lazily but the smile had a nasty edge cleopatra slept with hers he did crawl into my bed when he thought i was too young to understand but in the end he was just a man and i did have my revenge after all ive had him killed for it the words so cool so unemotional chilled kat to the bone and now lucrezia continued i need to kill these two while i still have the strength weather magic is wearisome bbbut kat was trying to ask why but the words wouldnt come by now the hypatia medal was almost burning her hand but was that caused by what luciano was doing or was it lucrezias presence or both lucrezia obviously understood what she meant to ask oh for many reasonsbut among others its enough that they are two of the three who ever turned me down strange those potions you brought me from ascalon were very effective you know and to have them fail so significantly on two occasions your sweet little boy and that upright priest priest dottore marina isnt i wasnt talking about him unfortunately luciano disappeared before i had access to those philters if id had them she licked her lips as if she tasted something bitter perhaps we wouldnt be having this discussion now rafael who had been standing ignored on the other side of the room chose this moment to try to deal with her in a rush he stopped as if he had hit a wall paralyzed kats medal enveloped her in warmth at lucrezias gesture rafael dropped the knife and folded to sprawl before her feet lucrezia shook her head i am far too powerful for little strega with their little knives lie there little strega and watch as your friends diefor i believe that i will allow you to die last of all she turned back to kat i learned a great deal from the grand duke of lithuanias emissary you knowin no small part what not to do she allowed chernobog to possess her in exchange for her beauty and power i have not made that error you kat tried to speak lucrezia smiled viciously and oh my dear little virgin montescue luciano made a most incalculable mistake in allowing you here for you will make the perfect sacrifice to break the circle of power inside the circle marco was unaware of all of this lucianos words were like the droning of bees as he walked the sevenfold circle why seven why not three or five or nine he tried to remember what brother mascoli had been teaching him seven wasnt a strega number though it was pagan it went back a lot farther than that to the romans or the etruscans it felt right though each time luciano completed a circuit the rest of the room receded a little the sound from outside faded and the less important what was outside seemed he noticed vaguely that someone had come into the room but well it just didnt matter marco found himself transported with the words of power they carried him somewhere else or perhaps it was that the interior of the circle became somewhere else the air was not full of incense instead it was a smell he knew far better that the smell of driftwood fires of the marshreed pollen of the delicate scent of water lilies of marshmallow of sweetflag blossom the air glowed with the thick amber light of the sun cutting through the mist luciano beat on a drum or was it a drum it was more like his own heartbeat but slow slow and full of heat the air thickened until it was as sweet and heavy as honey and lucianos voice wasnt chanting words anymore it was the bees that were droning the chant then came a rumble that built up slowly and from a distance in the thick air thunder nonot thunder a roar marco heard a roaring echoing across the marsh the last great refuge of lions in europe but no lion had ever roared like this no lion he had ever heard of this roar was thunder in the sky from a throat like the mouth of a volcano he glanced at luciano for reassurance butluciano didnt look right he was pale and sweating the hand that held the little drum shaking and his breathing coming hard chiano he askedbut luciano didnt respond the steady drumbeat faltered the beater fell from lucianos hand a hand that clutched at the front of his own white robe looking remarkably like a claw chiano marco shouted panic in his voice slowly lucianos knees gave out and he sank to the ground slowly the drum too fell from his hand rolled across the floor and overset a bowl of some dark liquid that had been laid aside when luciano had completed the circles and luciano marina toppled over onto his side and did not stir and then luciano was silent the mists and brightness around him cleared and marco understood why luciano marina would not be summoning anything again whatever this was it had been too much for him his eyes were glazed staringand empty the yellowed old book was still on the pedestal where luciano had been standing a longbladed bronze knife was lying atop the open pages marco took up the book it was only a bookbut what was in it had killed luciano the circles of power still held but the magic within them faded with every passing moment i have to do something but what he was no magician besides looking at what was said at the top of the page this called for a willingness to make the greatest of sacrifices what had luciano said only been done twice before and two of the families listed are no more perhaps perhaps it had been no token sacrifice valdosta and montescue were left i am valdosta a faint sound penetrated the thinning circles of power and marco looked up as if through a mist or through frostcovered glass he saw lucrezia saw rafael fall he tried to push through the barrier that luciano had raised it was like steel he beat at it he might as well have pounded on a rock with his fists they were watching him nowkat with one hand at her throat and the other clutching her medallion and lucrezia lucrezia had a cruel smile on her face and a long steel and silver dagger in her hand the handle like a dragon or a winged serpent with eyechips of ruby marcos arms fell to his sides he felt frozen with fear and indecision they all seemed frozen in time insects caught in amber something cold touched his foot and he jerked out of his paralysis he looked down the puddle of spilled liquid oozed across the patterned marble and touched his foot mingled with a thin trickle of blood coming from lucianos outstretched wrist and a mist passed over it for a moment and marco saw as if from above venice burning children screaming dying and the body of kat sprawled abused and then a sequence of people he knew and loved gutted raped burned and the face of lucrezia laughing with a great darkness behind her he knew it for a true scrying vision of the future a future which lucianohis friend and in many ways more truly a father to him than his own blood had beenhad been prepared to sacrifice himself to prevent perhaps when he failed luciano had dared use his last lifeblood the last of his own magical power not to save himself but for this vision so that marco would know the consequences of failure and act marco took up the bronze knife put it against his chest and began to read the words from the ancient book from outside the enchanted circle lucrezia gaped if he read her lips aright before the brightness and mist engulfed him she was saying no no caesare benito looked down from the barricade hed just climbed caesare aldanto looked up from maria he had an arm around her neck and a knife against her breast i nearly killed her when she came through the gap he said conversationally quite a reunion this wheres that brother of yours also around why demanded benito do you want to make a clean sweep of the valdostas benito tried to figure out what do next he had an arquebus in his hands but the weapon was far too inaccurateeven in the hands of someone expert in its useto risk a shot at caesare as inexperienced as benito was with firearms hed more likely kill maria but benito made himself a promise that if anything happened to maria hed blow caesares mocking smiling face apart at this range not even benito would miss now why would i do that benito said caesare ive always looked after you benito scrambled down other arsenalotti faces appeared but there were several of caesares men too all with arquebuses you got money from ferrara for looking after us said benito coldly its sitting at giaccomos you never really did anything for any reason except for money did you caesare snorted what other reason is there benito smiled tell you what caesare ill show you another reason you let her go and ill fight you it took caesare a moment for the implication to sink in maria he said incredulously you love thispeasant i dunno about love said benito carefully but i care a whole damn lot about her use the word love if you want so ill fight you for her freedom aldanto laughed cocky little brat arent you at your age you think youre immortal and you expect to win no said benito calmly i dont but youll have to let maria go no yelled lucrezia gazing in horror at marco and the knife she looked around wildly i must stop him kill him come here girl i need you for an instant kat felt the sheer power and compulsion of that voice then a further warmth a heat a fire spread from the saint hypatia medal that she held and with a shake like a spaniel pulled from the dirty water of a canal she shook off the compulsion instead of answering lucrezias beckoning hand she pulled her pistol from her reticule shed reloaded five times in the fighting the last time shed had to take powder from a dead arquebusier but the balls hed carried had been too big so shed filled the barrel of the pistol with some metal junk from a ruined shop thrust it down and hoped it would work lucrezia laughed your little toy wont do me any harm you stupid child do you think i havent taken the simplest of precautions i command the spirits of air and water and darkness the powder wont fire the balls will miss as kat hesitatedcan that be true can she really do that lucrezia sneered at her besides you dont know how to use that silly thing anyway doubt assailed her and once again lucrezia was using all her powers kat wanted to drop the weapon run closer warmth rushed over her again and a glowing delicate hand insubstantial as a kiss and warm as life closed over the hand that held the pistol she squeezed the trigger instead the metal junk cut into lucrezia who had halfturned ready to throw her knife it knocked lucrezia to the floor lucrezia screamed and of all the screaming kat had heard that day this was by far the most horrible sound she had ever heard in her life it went on and on and on as lucrezia writhed on the floor thrashing spinelessly her thrashing as horrible as the scream and then the womans body began to change metamorphose the point of the knife broke the skin and a single drop of blood formed on the blade strangely there was no pain before he could press harder and end the ritual with his own death somethingtook him the light the mists thickened again in an instant golden sweet the honey of the jesolo and held him so that he could not move light blinded him and light permeated him it became him and he felt himself change felt a roaring in his ears that came from his own throat felt great golden wings spring from his back and begin to grow and grow its been a long time said the great voice that was within him but was not him huge muscles flexed and stretched his golden hide twitched he was no longer indoors instead from the columntop he looked out over fogshrouded piazza san marco so a valdosta again is it said the great voice last time it was a montescue theyre more bloody minded marco felt his wings extend though he was not the one to flex his muscles stretch his claws spread his wings who who are you he asked timidly there was a roar of laughter warm and full i am you and you are me you have taken up the crown as well as the mantlethe first to do so in many centuries and we are the lion the lion of venice now the lion of etruria that was the back and shoulder muscles tensed enormous wings beat down in a great surge of power and the lion bounded up through the cloud and out into endless blue of the sky the lion of saint mark marco looked down as the lion looked down fog was streaming away from the downbeat of the great wings below he could already see the piazza clear of all but the last wisps of it again the lion laughroared saint mark i nearly ate him he wasnt even the mark of your four books you know you little children youve confused him with one of my romans a secret christian that roman a christian who hid his fellows in the jesolomarcus fidelusthat was what they called him mark the faithful and you people managed to get him confused with the other hic requiscet corpus tuum on this spot your body shall rest it was meant as a threat not a prophecy the lion roared with laughter and marco had to admit it was rather funny but that marcus was pious enough and holy enough and had the magicthe magiceven if up until that moment he didnt know it i knew it and you four little swamp thievesterrio montescue lacosto and valdostayou that had set out to rob him and instead became his converts begged for his life you were my people and he won you won you fairly but you were my people and when you beggedwhat was i to do i let him live and gave him leave of my domain ha not only did he make free of my marshes he also took seizin of me to come and go and look and know he became one of mine save only that he was first and always the child of christ and in exchange that we be of one heart and would i still hold sovereignty here and not be driven from the place by later mages of christ that my people be free to make their own choices in who they servehe laid this form on me this binding with the blood of the four families i think it a good bargain i steer my families and look after my lagoon my marshes and my islands and sometimes when the need is dire they take the crown and they steer me the great laughing roar shook the body again so steer me valdosta what do we need to do some grasp of the great strength that was his to command dawned on marco first lets get rid of all of this fog its not right the lion spiraled upward into the dawn sky above the cloud yes it is a magical one a sending from a great and evil power but this is my place my lagoon my marshes and my islands my power is stronger here the great wings beat down the wind beneath those wings was more than just air it was bright with strength and the wild primal magic that was the lion marco felt not only the beating of the wings but the rushing of blood to those great wingmuscles he knew that the very arteries and veins of the lion were somehow channels that nourished the reedbeds the canals that carried the trade and they all moved to the heartbeat of the sea the lion was marco it was also the soul of the lagoon it was rich with the love of the generations of venetians of many many people not just some few wealthy lordlings but all of its people and like them the lion treasured its liberty and independence the fog the fog was no mere cloud it was a thing of strangling darkness of hatred and domination issuing from the bleak northeast but although it might overwhelm cities and kings it was feeble against that independence of spirit of the love venetians had given this place this special place over the centuries the lion was a repository of all of that chernobog was great but it was also a great distance awayand was now trying to extend its power to a foreign land foreign to chernobog not to the lion the lion who was also marco drew its strength from the land the water and from many many small sources generations of thembrought together in the unity which was the lion individually they were mere drops of water against stone that was chernobog together they were like the raging torrent and chernobog a mere loose cobblestone flung willynilly before the fury magical power surged like the sea with each great wingbeat and below them the fog scattered and tattered the last spellshreds of chernobogs power here tore venice and the lagoon appeared the sun striking the red roofs and dancing brightly off the clear water and now asked the lion let us break up the fighting put fear into the hearts of those who want to destroy venice somehow marco knew that was the right thing to say the lion rose higher toward the rising sun let them see my shadow in the minds of our enemies the shadow of the lion is more terrifying than the lion itself it releases their fears to those who love venice my shadow is a shield in a slow spiral the lion turned above the canals of venice marcos keen lioneyes picked out the knots of fighting men picked out his brother on the barricade picked out maria picked out caesare aldanto and saw into the core of him saw him for what he was he roared the air blurred and shivered with the sound the roaring was like that of a thousand trumpets but it was a glad bright noise to maria it was like an infusion of strength that little fool benito was going to get killed it must have had the opposite effect on caesare because suddenly she was able to pull free she spun around and with all her strength kicked him in the testicles caesare folded up nicely maria scrambled up the barricade she heard the roar of an arquebus but if it was fired at her the bullet went wild and then the fresh seascented wind hit her in the face what the hell benito pulled her flat arquebus fire boomed fog streamed in the sudden gale a gale so strong that it flung masonry fragments from the barricade the dawn sun came striking at the walls bright and warm and then there came a huge winged shadow maria suddenly realized that caesares schiopettieri were running away as if in a panic and so was caesare running as if the very devil was on his heels and somewhere between venice and the rising sun a huge winged being flew caressing the city its lagoon and marshes with the shadow of its great wings kat stared at the devilish thing that had been lucrezia it was redeyed silver bodied snaky like lucrezias dagger handle had beenand it was wounded in a dozen places maybe she hadnt quite killed it but shed certainly stopped it it was leaking black ichor from the wounds and from the moment marco had fallen it had no interest in her instead it was struggling to fly on torn batlike wings it was heading for the windows as if drawn by an invisible wire half the town seemed to be fleeing for their lives the other half appeared to be chasing them benito would have sworn he was the only one who looked up as they pursued caesares party across the piazza san marco it might have been the brightness of the morning sun but hed swear that he saw the winged lion settle back onto its column is there anything more the lion asked marco looked around and couldnt see anything there wassomethingfar off it is of no consequence the lion said dismissively the christmage the one who limps he and his knights have conquered it and its vessel and there is another but believe me he laughed this time a deep rumbling in his chest your young mate and her power have that well taken care of nowshortly you must become yourself again but marco valdosta you not only bear the winged mantle now but you have also taken up the crown as long as you live only you may be the one to call me no mage may do it for you you must take care marco valdosta you must have a care for yourself and most especially when you think it might be good to leave my lagoons and my islands should venice need me in your absence it will not have me for only you can call me yes lion marco replied obediently feeling the burden of responsibility settle on shoulders that stiffened to meet it i will remember if i leaveit will be because there is no other choice not only for me but for venice the lion seemed satisfied you do not complain good it does not seem a great sacrifice to me i do not know why you humans are so itchyfooted nowtime to put an end to this before youor icome to like it all too much the monster crawled towards the window and kat felt fear mixed with rage itshewas going to get away lucrezia had unleashed war in the streets had killed men with her own hands or her own orders had hurt rafael and she was going to get away not this time little sister the golden glowing hands over hers made her drop the pistolmade her reach to the side and take a book from a shelf therea very very heavy book which must have weighed several pounds encased in a silverchased cover a bible and throw it it landed squarely on the monster there was a flash of light that was somehow black a scream that cut through kats skull so that she clapped both empty hands over her ears in a futile attempt to block it out then there was nothing nothing but a silverchased bible in the floor and a snaky black smudge on the marble hmm whats appropriate i wonder a little knowledge is a dangerous thing the word is mightier than the blade ah i know let evil beware the weight of the word of god there wasa golden laugh that washed through her erasing the pain that the scream had left behind and the feeling of uncleanliness then the presence was gone kat shivered convulsively then saw the candles in the magic circle suddenly snuff out saw the air suddenly clear and the glittering circles of power fade to nothing more than the silver and gold inlaid on the floor oh godmarco she pushed forward past lucianos body marco lay still and cold with the blade still pressed into his breast katerina had the impression of a misty and insubstantial gold crown on his head but the image faded almost instantly and she had no time to think about it she tugged at the hateful fateful dagger it fell and snapped as if it had been made of the finest venetian glass she stared there was no blood she ripped at his shirt scattering buttons marcos chest had a tiny vshaped cut on itnot a fingernail deep kat seized his wrists she was shaking too badly to feel for a pulse she pressed her ear to his chest after a terrible instant of fearsilencethen she heard his heart beating beating steadily suddenly marco breathed deeply and put his arms around her she clung to him like a drowning woman i can never leave here you know he said softly he said so i have to stay or he cant protect venice she burrowed against his chest not giving a damn who he was i will never leave here then either it was benito who found them nearly an hour later he walked in and stared at the two of them thank god claudia knew where this place was otherwise you two lovebirds might still have been here tomorrow tore the shirt off him eh kat he was grinning broadly i must get maria to have a little talk with you girl tearing the breeches off him is much more satisfying for everyone benito roared marco it was a real roar the windows rattled benito started at the sound but the grin stayed on his face even if it became a little less broad but as he looked around studying the room the grin faded away the bodies the paraphernalia so i didnt imagine the lion he said quietly i think you two had better get out of here before someone else finds you ive got news for the two of you besides that dorma and montescue are both searching frantically for you they got up tell benito said kat whats happened benito managed another grin well lots of stuff the doge has stopped slipping into a coma but hes really weak hes offered his resignation as he says the city needs a strong doge in these times i reckon petro will be chosen even as young as he is a boats just come in from chioggia grandfather delleste and the knights of the holy trinity and the boys in the polestine forts made my father and his army head back to milan his good cheer faded but it looks as if caesare aldanto managed to escape what they both exclaimed simultaneously damn him added kat snarling benito walked toward the nearest window still covered with heavy drapes lets get some light in here what say he shrugged nothings ever perfect aldanto had a galley readyin case things went wrong i guess thatd be just like him when the fog cleared and the lions shadow spooked them he took advantage of it just in time too petro dorma is spitting mad about it and hes looking for you pair of lovebirds he looked quizzically at them so what are you going to do now marco took kats hands kat you realize that this doesnt change anything i made my promises im still married to angelina kat smiled marco ill be your mistress if you want me ill be your friend if you dont but i wont leave you again epilogue vilna the shaman raced frantically through the water trailing blood from several gashes behind him their jaws leaving their own red trace came the vengeful undines insofar as the shaman could think at all in his state of panic he was sure he could elude his pursuers he was well into the open waters of the gulf now beyond the lagoon and he was a better swimmer than the undines the thought was not especially comforting undines were not the only menace he faced the shadow of the lion sweeping across the lagoon had not only cast terror into the minds and hearts of venices enemies it had also emboldened veniceand its friends among those friends often enough the tritons of the gulf and the open sea could be counted and those more fishlike than the undines he could not outswim for that matter the blood he was trailing might draw sharks as well and if the sharks were no friends of venice they were no friends of his either again and again he cried out in his mind for the master to rescue him open the passageway open the passageway there was no answer no passageway when he sensed the disturbance in the water quite some distance away the shaman veered aside that was the sound of a ship breaking up and men spilling into the water no threat to him in itselfbut it might draw tritons occasionallynot oftenthe sea creatures rescued drowning sailors but his masters voice finally appearing commanded otherwise find the ship and its sailors seize the strongest one and bring him to me the shaman did not even think to protest the order partly because he was too glad to finally hear his masters voice mostly because he had never heard that voice groan with such a terrible agony as if the master himself were trailing his own spoor of blood the shaman was indifferent to the masters pain but not to the rage that pain had so obviously brought with it when the shaman found the sundering vessel he had no difficulty selecting the strongest man of its crew he was the only one who had not drowned yet and was already sinking below the surface himself gasping with exhaustion fortunately his golden hair made him easy to find the shaman seized the collar of his tunic in his sharp teeth he hoped the master would open the passageway soon the drowning man was larger than the shaman in his fishform he did not think he could tow him any great distancecertainly not while keeping the mans mouth above water the shaman was nearing exhaustion himself but the master was apparently alert a moment later the passageway formed gratefully the shaman plunged into it bringing his goldenhaired burden with him dripping water but no blood now that the shapechange had closed his wounds the shaman lay sprawled on the floor of the grand dukes private chamber gasping for breath and feeling as if he could not move at all next to him the goldenhaired sailor gasped also his eyes fluttered for a moment blue gleaming through the lids as the man began to return to consciousness the shaman sensed the huge form of his master looming over them when he looked up halfdazed he was paralyzed still further by the sight the grand dukes forehead gaped open his face was coated with blood the shaman could see his masters brains through the terrible wound the shaman had long since understood that his master was not really human any longer had he any doubts that wound would have resolved them no human being could have possibly survived such an injury much less have been able to move and talk i must have food hissed the grand duke in a voice almost hoarse from screaming now glancing toward the great stove against the wall of his masters private room the shaman could see that the fire was already burning in its belly drops of blood spilled from his masters head wound were sizzling on the side of the huge fry pan the cleavers and flensing knives were ready on the butchers table nearby the grand duke seized the halfdrowned sailor by his golden hair and lifted him up as easily as he might an infant but then seeing the mans face for the first time he paused him he muttered despite his fear and exhaustion the shaman was fascinated to see the way the grand dukes forehead wound was beginning to close up much more slowly than one of his own wounds would heal during a shapechange of course and the shaman could only imagine the agony the grand duke was suffering no wonder that the master craved his special food it would speed the healing immensely and alleviate the pain the shaman was so fascinated by the sight that he didnt pay attention to his masters odd hesitation it wasnt until the grand duke lowered the goldenhaired head back to the floor that the shaman tore his gaze from the wound and looked at the eyes below he wished he hadnt even before he heard his masters next words i may have use for this one i can get another shaman the grand dukes giant hand seized the shaman by his long hair and dragged him toward the butcher table the shaman fought in a frenzy along the way but he might as well have been a toddler for all the good it did once on the table a blow from the grand dukes fist ended his struggles which was perhaps just as well the shaman was too stunned to really feel the blade which began flaying him his screams didnt start again until much of the skin was already gone but by then the master was ready to prepare the blood sauce a quick slice of the knife ended the screams when caesare aldanto finally returned to full consciousness he discovered himself sitting at a table a man he didnt recognize was working at a stove nearby huge man he wasinches taller than aldanto himself and perhaps twice as broad adding in the walrus fat so obvious under the heavy robes he probably weighed three times what aldanto did when the man turned around and approached aldanto hissed partly because of the wound on the forehead the likes of which he had never seen except on the body of a corpse mostly because of the black and inhuman eyes under the heavy brow the manthe monstershoveled something out of the fry pan directly onto the table eat now he commanded there is no time for platters caesare stared at him then down at the food before him when he recognized what it wasthe tattoos alone made it obvioushe hissed again and began to draw back a savage blow to the head halfdazed him then a hand with the strength of an ogre seized him by the hair and shoved his face into the food eat it like a dog slave i have no use for fancy table manners neither do you from this time forth the piave river i think it would be best if i were escorted into venice by your troops instead of my own enrico the emperor scanned the countryside along the piave the muscles working in his heavy jaws bad enough ive brought them this far but so long as venice itself doesnt get its back up im not too concerned about the reaction of the rest of italy not at the moment at least when the bastards are cowed the duke of ferrara nodded i agree your majesty he hesitated a moment then but i urge you not to be too cautious either the scaligers of verona have managed to infuriate just about everyone by now venice ferrara and rome by their actions milan and the rest by their failure charles fredriks lips parted in what a shark might call a smile you think the time is ripe to take them down a peg or two break them in half rather growled the old fox well said snapped baron trolliger riding to the emperors left unlike the emperor trolliger was wearing armor he seemed as annoyed by the martial equipment as he was with the state of the world in general trolliger was a courtier not a soldier or perhaps it was simply that he detested travel see to it hans murmured charles fredrik use wilhelm gneiss and his bavarians you can leave the military details to him but make sure the scaligers are bloodied you neednt besiege verona i dont imaginebut tell wilhelm not to hesitate if necessary i want the territory under the control of the scaligers shrunkin half as the duke of ferrara says spread the pieces around as seems best to you during the negotiations he glanced at the old fox make sure ferrara gets the biggest slice ive always been partial to legnano said delleste almost idly pretty town after trolliger trotted off riding his horse about as awkwardly as a man can and still stay in the saddle the emperor glanced behind him at a figure who was riding her own saddle with considerably greater ease and skill would you allow us a moment in private enrico certainly your majesty the duke of ferrara trotted his horse away with the same superb skill that the old man handled a sword or a hammer the emperor waved francesca forward when she drew alongside him charles fredrik glanced at her manner of riding and made a face how do you manage that anyway francesca smiled its the fashion in the aquitaine for ladies your majesty i learned to ride sidesaddle when i was barely old enough to walk she plucked the dusky folds of silken lacetrimmed twill covering her thighs i could hardly wear something like this straddling the horse its quite a costume agreed the emperor his tone was meaningful francesca gave him a sidelong glance i did not think your majesty would appreciate it much if i were seen in my usual costume discretion and modesty seemed well advised smart woman not the old man gave her a sidelong glance of his own for a moment his eyes seemed those of a much younger man that i wouldnt have appreciated the other im quite sure francesca said nothing her smile was almost that of a madonna charles fredrik cleared his throat and why didnt i see that other costume mariefrancoise de guemadeuc since your arrival at innsbruck youve both dressed and behaved as a most modest and chaste demoiselle in my experiencewhich is considerablemost courtesans would have cheerfully pitched over a prince for the sake of snaring an emperor francesca hesitated a little play of subtle emotions running over her face before she could speak the emperor continued three possibilities come to mind the first is that you have a rigid sense of honor which would preclude that course of action on the grounds that it skirts incest but since you are aquitainian i think we can dismiss that possibility out of hand we do have a reputation francescas accompanying chuckle was soft and throaty indeed i agree we may dismiss it out of hand the second possibility then you have formed an attachment with my nephew which transcends the obvious bond between a courtesan and a young nobleman he stopped abruptly cocking an eye at her um i am fond of manfred your majesty genuinely so in fact but charles fredrik heaved a sigh of relief thank god im not dealing with a madwoman francescas chuckle now was neither soft nor throaty indeed it was almost an open laugh please manfred is charming vigorous goodhumoredoften genuinely wittyand far more intelligent than he likes to pretend his company more often than not is quite delightful far more so than that of most of my clients but anything more serious she shook her head firmly theres nothing in it neither for manfred nor myself although im good for him now your majesty that i do believe the emperor nodded i also i have no objection to a continuation of your liaison actually im in favor of it he cleared his throat you do understand of course yes yescertainly now that manfreds identity is in the open he can hardly remain simply one of my clients a rich young knight can share a courtesan a prince requires an exclusive mistress it was her turn to clear her throat before she could speak charles fredrik snorted yes yescertainly i know itll cost me he examined her briefly spending more time on the modest but expensive clothing than on her wellcovered but intrinsically immodest figure plenty the way in which francesca smoothed the fabric of her dress was demure propriety itself perhaps which brings us to the third possibility said the emperor loudly the gaze he now bestowed on francesca was almost angry every now and thennot oftena whore becomes truly ambitious andif shes smart enoughrealizes that the ultimate coin in this sinful world is trust francesca meet the fierce eyes with calm ones of her own trust which would be quite shattered if i abandoned the prince for the emperor for the one as much as the other the emperor nodded good nowit is time to speak honestly i will allow you two lies no more what do you want mariefrancoise de guemadeuc tell me all of it she grimaced first of all i dont want that name francesca is now thats the first lie be careful woman for the first time since hed met the courtesan her aplomb was shaken francesca almost jerked in the saddle it is not a lie she hissed i am simply she broke off staring at the countryside with eyes which clearly saw a different one my god she whispered it is a lie of course it is snapped charles fredrik the mistake your mother made mariefrancoise was settling for revenge she should have bided her time and waited until she could triumph they rode on in silence for a bit then francesca shook her head as if to clear it yes and no your majesty oddly enough i find that i like francesca de chevreuse rather more than i did the girl she was so i believe ill stick with the namewithin as well as without again that soft throaty chuckle but yes i will keep an eye out for the possibility of triumph good what else he waved a thick hand wealth ease comfort all that naturally but what else francesca seemed to be groping for words the emperor clucked his tongue well its time you did start thinking about it clearly for a change he twisted a bit in the saddle until he was facing her almost squarely let an old man provide you with some assistance the what else im quite sure is power and influence your own power and influence not that which you derive from befuddling a mans wits with yourno doubt magnificentlegs and bosom francesca hesitated then nodded abruptly good that ambition an emperor can trust for the simple reason that it cannot be achieved without trust his smile was almost that of a cherub and i must say youre doing quite well for such a young and innocent girl francesca began that soft throaty chuckle again but this time she choked it off almost before it began good god youre serious umyour majesty of course im serious the cherub smile was replaced by something infinitely grimmer take it from an emperor child what you know about sin is pitiful what you know about wickedness almost nothing again they rode on in silence after a time the emperor spoke again ill be sending manfred off soon enough its time for the next stage of his educationas well as the education of the grand duke of lithuania francescas eyes widened no girl said the emperor softly i am not sending him off to war not directly at least the time isnt right for a war with jagiellon not with emeric on the throne in hungary still unbloodied and now this rot in my own he broke off then cleared his throat never mind that but i do think a demonstration is called for since that lithuanian bastard chose to use a demon from the svear against the svear it shall be francesca seemed to wince the emperor grinned oh please demoiselle i do not expect you to traipse around with manfred and erik in the marshes and forests of smaland but i will expect you to accompany them as far as mainz and then possibly to copenhagen the emperors grin widened seeing the eager light in the young womans eyes yes yesintrigue with the danes against the sots all that youll have a splendid time of it but theres something else more important we need to discuss i am all ears your majesty thought you would be have you ever given much thought to finance francesca de chevreuse after a short pause didnt think so time you did more than anything else girl wars are fought with money dont let any one ever tell you different especially generals andtake it from an old emperororganizing the finances of a major war is even more complex and difficult than organizing the supply train takes even longer to do it right and its far more treacherous to begin with on they went across the piave now heading west toward the city of the winged lion the emperor never stopped talking great financiers especially with war looming are always old men you see it occurs to me that a gorgeous young womanespecially one with a disreputable past and a flavor of scandal about herespecially a smart and witty one and francesca was all ears venice it was easier kat was learning to triumph over evil than to explain it she and marco holdingno clutchinghands openly were spared having to repeat what had transpired in the magic chamber over and over again only by the intercession of petro dorma with an efficiency that was almost terrifying hed sent them straight to the doges palace where theyd been fed and allowed to restrest not sleep although both of them were swaying with exhaustion they hadnt gotten much past the first few mouthfuls when marcos strega friend rafael joined them he didnt look any better than marco both of them had huge bruisedlooking circles around their eyes and both of them must have been existing on nervous energy alone heaven only knew she was and she must look much the same here they were three tattered and stained vagabonds in a room that usually entertained the most prominent folk in veniceand often in the world the murals on the walls alone were stunning works of art worthy of the grand metropolitans palace in rome and the amount of gold leaf on the carved woodwork didnt bear thinking about it could serve to repair casa montescue five times over what are they going to do with us rafael asked dully the answer came from an unexpected source petro dorma himself who entered the sumptuous dining room behind a servant bearing a gold pitcher ah my weary young heroes petro said quite as if he was not as weary as any of them i want you to eat and drink while my messengers round up everyone who has any interest in what went on in that chamber where dottore marinas body was found then i want you to tell your stories answer questions for a reasonable length of timewhich will probably be quite a bit shorter than usual given that we are all rather the worse for wear by that time you wont be able to walk three paces without staggering so you will all be escorted to comfortable bedchambers here in the palace where i suspect you will probably sleep until this time tomorrow unbelievably terrifyingly efficient if petro became the new doge which was the rumor kat had been hearing he was going to be something to be reckoned with petro joined them thus making a tableau of four tiny figures who were dwarfed by the chamber and humbled by the crimsonandgold trappings mostly gold katerina couldnt help but notice she thought casa montescues desperate financial situation had probably been somewhat alleviated by the recent events surely the moneylenders wont harass us for a few weeks but maybe not they ate slowly katerina concentrated on every bite not least because the food was deliciousout of all expectations considering the conditions of the last day and night when did i eat last she wondered it seemed a year ago or more whenever it had been she was as hungry as she was weary but hunger at least could be easily remedied they were only just finished and nibbling in a desultory manner at sweets when a servant in dorma livery arrived and dorma rose we seem to have collected everyone were going to find he said come along the sooner this is over the sooner we can all sleep the three of them got slowly to their feetkat at least was aching in every limband dorma escorted them all out both grandfathers were there montescue and dellestesitting side by side for a wonder nine men who dorma had whispered briefly as they entered represented the senatebut kat suspected were really along with dorma himself the entire council of ten and metropolitan michael of course all these kat had expectedbut not the cluster of priests surrounding michael nor the horde of secretaries seated at tables running the length of the room behind the notables she felt uneasily like she was falling into the hands of inquisitors gentlemen dorma nodded to all of them these young people are the first we will hear beginning with marco valdosta continuing with katerina montescue with he shook his head clearly going blank when it came to rafaels name ahtheir friend who also witnessed what happened as the last of the three hold your questions until they are finished and try to keep them brief marco began omitting nothing and although kat found herself blinking in stunned disbelief when he got to the part where he apparently collapsed in the magic circle and described what had happened but neither the metropolitan nor the priests with him seemed at all surprised a spirit a pagan spirit but also the protector of venice the very lion that met saint mark sonow im bound to the lion he finished wearily then out of nowhere managed a brilliant smile and my pauline relatives will surely disown me now for such blasphemy his grandfather the old delleste fox snorted and her grandfather choked on his drinkwith suppressed laughter she realized a moment later those of your pauline relatives who are stupid enough to be fretted about blasphemy after all thisnone of whom are on my side of the family i might mentioncan go hang themselves the old fox growled ill lend them the rope nonsense barked lodovico montescue sell it to them ill go in with you in a colleganza the room erupted in a roar of laughterand there was an end to that topic the priests added a few questions mostly about the lion what it and marco had done and the awakening spell but very soon the metropolitan himself called a halt anything more we can learn from the book and it will be more certain than this young mans memory he said i will confer with father lopez when he returns but i am satisfied that there is not so much as a whisper of evil about this creatureto whom and this young mage we can only be grateful and then it was her turn everyone listened in silence until she got to the part where lucrezia brunelli appeared ha exclaimed one of the priests smacking the table and making her jump father pierre was right i thought he was dont interrupt her commanded michael sternly then unexpectedly smiled at her she continued wanting to close her eyes to better recall lucrezias exact wordsbut knowing that she didnt dare to because if she did shed fall asleep she managed well enough until she got to the part about the warmth that filled her coming from her hypatia medal the pure sweet voice in her head and the glowing golden hands that overlaid hers then she saw something that she would never ever have imagined she saw metropolitan michaels eyes widen and his jaw sag actually at that point there were many jaws dropping especially among the priests the only one who didnt seem surprised was marco who squeezed her hand encouragingly no one interrupted her though and she continued doggedly through the point of lucrezias transformation the seizing of the bible and the aftermath and then the voice said let evil beware the weight of the word of god and theni suppose it was gone because the warmth went away she concluded she prudently omitted the other outrageous puns that the voice had made as well as the remarks that had prefaced and followed the aphorism shed been told to use heads nodded wisely all over the room except for metropolitan michaels he appeared to be choking for a moment but quickly composed himself did he get the joke a moment later a glance from his dancing eyes confirmed her suspicion that he had oh dearest dottore marina now i understand what you meant about history becoming somewhat cleaned up and simplified who except perhaps for this single cleric would ever understand the full version who would ever appreciate it for what it meant yes there was terrible evil in the world and yes they must fight grimly to defeat itbut there was also peace love and joy and to forget that would be to forget there was a god i have no questions but i would like to examine the young ladys medal michael said gravely she pulled the chain over her head and handed it to the page who came for it feeling uncomfortable and naked without it michael and his group of priests each examined the saint hypatia medal closely and they put their heads together and muttered for a moment then the metropolitan handed it back to the page who brought it back to her she put it back on with relief i would like to place into the record of these proceedings that we have found the original protections placed upon this talisman by the order of hypatia as well as a very recent reinforcing spell placed on it within the last three months or so by some other magician whom i believe to have been dottore marina he paused significantly all of which bear the completely unmistakable aura of sanctity this medal has been used within the last day as a vehicle for one of gods own spirits we are not prepared to state which spirit but i believe we can assume it was at the least one of the angelic order of the cherubim michael raised one eyebrow possibly higher possibly the saint herself but without having a christian mage as a witness we cannot state that this was a bona fide hypatian miracle and therefore we will confine ourselves to pronouncing it a genuine case of divine intercession well that caused as much of a buzz as marcos revelations and rafael got off with doing no more than providing confirmation for her story and marcos with no questioning and very shortly after that they were all three dismissed and followed their pagestumbling as dorma had predictedto their rooms kat found attentive maids waiting who stripped her with the same terrible efficiency as shown by petro dorma popped a nightdress over her head and eased her into a bed she didnt even see after thatshe didnt even dream but the next day all of the peace of mind which had come to her came crashing down the moment she stepped out into the public corridors two pages were waiting for her and whisked her off to join marco chattering at her the entire time she and marco it seemed were the saviors of venice father lopez still covered with dust from his hurried return to the city explained it all to them never mind petro dorma or the arsenalotti forget the brilliant tactics of delleste ignore the subtle intervention of the emperor completely discount the actions of the knights under confrere manfred and his friend eric hakkonsen pretend that father lopez never battled sachs and ursula and the horrible thing they had brought in on behest of the dread grand duke of lithuania she and marco were the saviors of venice dorma was with marco and senor lopez joined them a moment later you must make an appearance dorma told them firmly before they could make any objections lopez nodded even more firmly kat discovered that when sandwiched between two such forceful personalities no becomes a word that does not effectively exist dorma and lopez took them both to the very very public scala di giganti where the new doges were always inaugurated and as they all stepped out onto the top step a roar went up from the piazza san marco as she stood there once again clutching at marcos hand halfblinded by the sun and deafened by the noise she realized to her horror that the piazza was packed solid smile dorma shouted into her ear wave she did the crowd roared again now come this way dorma took her arm and steered her along the secondfloor balcony to the side that faced the lagoon as lopez did the same for marco the piazza was too densely packed for anyone to follow but that hardly mattered since the wave of sound propagated along as they passed and when they got to the seaward side of the balcony it seemed that every floating object in venice began parading past at least here facing the doges palace and the lagoon where not so many people could crowd up against the building it was easier to hear keep smiling and waving lopez said gravely doing the same then he and dorma explained to them how and why it was that they were suddenly the saviors delleste is not one of us dorma said bowing as one of the house racingboats passed with every scion of nobility the house possessed manning an oar the knightswell so far as the average venetian is concerned they have only just redeemed themselves for the actions of sachs and the sots and besides they arent our people either nor are we the foreign clerics and never mind who sent us here lopez agreed wryly and petro dorma his lips twisted in an attempt to suppress a smile petro dorma is a fine example of the best of the casa vecchie and he will surely make a great doge but he is balding middleaged and has an undistinguished nose not the fine figure of which legends are made dorma chuckled true enough nothere a bit smuglythat my humble nose is going to stop any of the single ladies of the casa vecchie from seeking out my company with an eye to matrimony but yes i will be the first to admit that i do not make an appropriate figure for the future statues which will commemorate this triumph he gazed at marco and kat you on the other handyou are both handsome young andwell that problem still has to be dealt with but the rumor of your little romance is already sweeping the city not so little actually you have ended a feud between your families to rival that of the capuletti and montague in verona you have served as the vessels for the oldest of venices magical protectors and of a bona fide angelic power so i can hardly blame the people for deciding that we old men only sat and twiddled our fingers while you two saved the city smile he added as kat began to object and wave this is what is meant by noblesse oblige as our aquitaine friends would say the two youngsters did as they were instructed but kat had the sinking realizationsinking like a stone anchor at seathat the rumor sweeping venice was going to make her life a lot more complicated than it already was the ugly term adulteress crept into her mind making her wince she wasnt sure if she should keep holding marcos hand but his grip was far too firm to resist anyway even if shed really wanted to casa dorma you have used the children quite enough go any further and you imperil your souls eneko lopezs words were spoken softly but to enrico delleste they seem to ring through the luxurious salon in casa dorma like hammer blows on the anvil in his workshop as always the concept of uncertainty seemed utterly foreign to the basque priest the old foxs lips twisted in a wry smile if the grand metropolitan of rome refuses your request to found a new order father you might consider taking up prophecy as your new vocation im quite sure you could learn to carve stone tablets with a bit of practice a nervous little laugh rippled through the salon lopez showing that easy humor whichoddly enoughalways lurked beneath his implacable surface flashed the duke of ferrara a quick grin then nodded acknowledging the hit the acknowledgement of course did not sway him for a moment the fact remains milord that you cannot manipulate everything for political purposes not without risking eternal damnation petro dorma coughed drawing attention his way theres no need to argue the theology involved father lopez as it happensfor political as well as personal reasonsi agree with you dorma had not spoken so far since the discussion over the fate of marcos marriage to angelina had first begun everyone had expected him to be one pole of the debateand quite the opposite oneso his statement brought instant silence a case vecchie who is wise instead of shrewd murmured eneko truly we have entered a new age of miracles again laughter rippled through the roomless nervously this time almost with relief dorma shrugged i have done my best for my sister but the fact remains that angelina is unstable and venice cannot afford to have marco valdosta in an unstable marriage nor for that matter can it afford to have katerina montescue develop the reputation of an adulteress he gestured with his head toward the great window overlooking the grand canal even though the window was closed and the piazza san marco was some distance away from the dorma palace the roar of the huge crowd filling the streets and piazza in triumphal celebration was loud enough to be heard easily now in its second day there seemed no sign yet that the festivities were abating some of that applause is for the emperor of course charles fredrik is the first holy roman emperor to visit venice in two centuries and since his visitunlike the last oneis seen as a show of support for venice the crowd is casting its republican sentiments aside for the moment growled lodovico montescue if the emperor isnt smart enough not to leave within a few days you watch how fast thatll change and good it is oh stop being a grouch drawled delleste look on the bright side the montagnards have been dreaming for years of the day when the emperor would enter veniceand now that its finally happened theyre all hiding in their cellars he and lodovico exchanged cold smiles petro dorma sighed montescue your house is still in dire financial circumstances so you cant afford assassins anyway i can interjected delleste immediately and lodovico can find them for me he turned his head and smiled gently at antimo bartelozzi seated in a chair behind him no offense antimo but i always feel its wise to consult the local experts antimo nodded solemnly quite so milord enough snapped petro he glared at the old fox ferrara is not in charge of venice insofar as anyone is at the moment i am im certainly in charge of the lords of the nightwatch discreet as ever he did not add the council of ten also so if i discover either of youor both togetherhave been conspiring to assassinate montagnards ill take measures dont think i wont ive had enoughso has veniceof these damned factional wars the old fox was tempted to rise to the challengeand just how will you take measures against ferrara venetianbut he resisted the temptation easily enough he had nothing to gain and everything to lose from entering a pissing match with petro dorma besides i give you my word lord dorma he said almost insouciantly but it wont stop the crowd from doing it word is the arsenalotti have organized their own assassins and the canalers are guiding them to the montagnard hideouts petro made a face then shrugged what the venetian commons do at the moment to settle their scores does not concern me theyll crush the snake and be done with it casa vecchie vendettas take on an insane life of their own lodovico montescue had the grace to flush and look away a bit to his surprise enrico delleste found himself doing the same my word delleste repeated this time with no insouciance at all after a moment with a tone of aggrieved resignation that brought another little ripple of laughter lodovico added his own vow good enough said petro again he gestured at the window what i was about to say however is that most of that applause is not for the emperor it isas everyone here knowsaddressed at marco and katerina he rubbed a hand over his bald pate smiling ruefully about whom the wildest rumors are sweeping the city whats wild about them snorted lopez marco valdosta does carry the mantle of the lion and wears the crown also it seems seeing the uncertainty in the faces of the hardheaded venetian grandees in the salon the basque chuckled harshly oh yeshave no doubt about it metropolitan michael tells me he was able to study enough of what dottore marina left behind to understand what happened even if he could not duplicate the thing himself im not sure anyone could except a grimas from the back of the room where he had been sitting uneasily in a chairhe was not accustomed to such societyfather mascoli spoke up for the first time his words were soft but firm for all that there were many witnesses milords who saw the lion leave and return to the pillar i have spoken to several of them petro swiveled in his chair and examined the priest it was at his insistence that father mascoli had come you have spoken to sister evangelina mascoli nodded yes lord dorma and she has agreedprovided angelina is not coerced in any way petro nodded and turned back i have not coerced her in fact it was angelina who first made the suggestion herself his round face took on an expression which was partly one of chagrin partly one of fondness my sisters moods swing back and forth rather unpredictably at her best he straightened in his chair her marriage to marco was a fiction as all here are well aware angelina in her way has grown very fond of marco and seems now to have become determined not to be an impediment to his happiness he raised a fist to his mouth and coughed into it she proposed in fact a simple annulment on the grounds that the marriage was never consummated which as it happens is quite true in this case but he broke off his expression clearly showing his unease enrico immediately understood the quandary and slid into it with all the grace of an expert swordsman in a fencing match petro naturally you would like to avoid the public embarrassment of admitting that the child is not marcos delleste saw no reason to add the obvious even if no one in venice except halfwits believes it anywayand even the halfwits dont believe it once they see the bastards hair as always for case vecchie formalities and appearance were as important as the reality i see no problem petro he continued easily he glanced at father mascoli if angelina has agreed to take holy orders that gives another ground for annulling the marriage one which is much less awkward for all concerned what about the baby asked lodovico angelina cant very well take her with her to a nunnery and if you give her up you undermine the whole purpose of the subterfuge dorma smiled again the expression conveyed that odd mix of fondness and chagrin ive spoken to marco he immediately offered to raise the child as his own truth to tell he already spends more time with the girl than does my sister dorma hesitated then his innate honesty forced him to keep speaking delleste was quite delighted venice would need an honest doge in the time to come i must point out the possible problem said petro an annulment due to my sister joining a religious order will take quite some time the grand metropolitan will agree to the annulment readily enough im quite sure but he will insist on following the established procedures dorma halfturned his head looking back toward mascoli the hypatian order requires a one year novitiate before the final vows can be taken until that time passes the annulment will not be final in the meantime his words trailed off into silence most of the people in the room shifted uneasily in their chairs a year and it took no great perceptivenesscertainly not for anyone who had seen marco and kat in each others company over the past few daysto realize that the two youngsters were hardly likely to wait cant afford another scandal gruffed lodovico certainly not echoed delleste well have to insist that they see each other rarely and then only with a proper chaperone in oh for the love of god snapped petro dormas mother rosanna since the discussion began the old woman had been sitting against the wall tending to her pointvice embroidery men katerina is a sensible case vecchie girl shell understand the precautions neededand where to find them the faces of all the men in the room grew pinched except that of eneko hah barked the basque priest of course shell know where to find them shes been trafficking them i dont doubt the faces of the other men grew very pinched lodovicos expression was downright vinegary and what little she doesnt know from lack of personal experience lopez continued blithely shell have no difficulty at all learning from her close friend francesca de chevreuse rosanna dorma almost cackled for that matter i couldnever mind she and lopez exchanged smiles the basque shrugged i see the moment of wisdom has passed replaced by that detestable shrewdness he made a motion with his hand which might have been that of a prophet carving stone be done with it o ye wise men of venice allow them their love in peace in whatever manner they choose until they sanctify it in marriage there will be no harm done and you have used the children quite enough look to your own souls the venetian grandees stared at him their jaws a bit loose the church had never formally condemned such practices true but they were much frowned upon by clerics not to mention fornication and adultery lopez returned their stares with his own and his jaw was not even a bit loose chernobog has seized the throne of lithuania he said almost snarling if anything emeric of hungary delves into even blacker arts the church rots from the inside or takes on the coloration of its enemies the rumors from egypt he rose to his feet abruptly and began limping toward the door enough worry yourselves sick over matters of petty shrewdness if you will grandees of venice i return to the wisdom of the crowd saluting its young champions after he was gone delleste looked at dorma and lodovico then shrugged and rose himself and why not the worst that can happen is another bastard wont be the first in our families and certainly not the last the piazza san marco a few days had done a great deal to change the city and the political landscape thought benito looking at the celebrating crowd horsemen had come in to report that the scaligers were scrambling out of fruili with the whole countryside rising against them and imperial troops hot on their heels a sharp merchant had brought the first pirogueload full of fresh vegetables down the po past the sunken remains of the milanese invading fleet venices foes had put the bulk of their forces into that fleet and now they were in dire trouble benito wasnt sure he wasnt in dire trouble too maria hadnt given him the heros welcome hed rather thought he was going to get instead shed said i fell in love with a wolf once im not giving my throat to another one benito and im not sure if what you are is fox or wolf youre still young its hard to tell but ive had enough of wishing to be something i cant be and shed turned on her heel and left him standing there after a while hed shrugged hed try later in the meanwhile half of the girls in venice seemed very pleased to see him they thought he was hero at least later in the afternoon someone took benito by the arm and drew him away from a young female admirer oddly enough he didnt feel any urge to resist even before he saw that it was petro dorma ive got news i felt you should hear right away a crew that arrived this morning came upon a shipwreck in the gulf the day of the fighting i just got the word caesare aldantos galley it was are they sure dorma nodded somberly they say there were big seas that afternoon probably stirred up by the gale that blew the fog away they saw a galley in bad trouble and were heading for a rescue when a double wave came through the galley snapped in two and broke up by the time they got therethe waves were very severe it was all over no survivors after the sea calmed they recovered some of the bodies caesares was not among them and they say it was much too far from land for anyone to have a hope of swimming ashore dorma took a deep breath theres more part of the wreck was still floating the captain had a look and theyve hauled that section out and brought it back someone had hollowed out a great chamber in the keel when it hit the waves it snapped we think this must be how the other galleys were lost well be checking them all now benito closed his eyes briefly the smuggling scheme now he wondered if it had really been a smuggling scheme and not just caesares way of sabotaging venices commerce whichever it had been caesares own mischief had come back to sink him after dorma left benito wandered through the huge throng aimlessly he was trying to decide how he felt about aldantos death on the one hand hed planned to kill him anyway if he could on the other he sighed remembering all the little ways in which caesare aldanto had helped him for his own purposes to be sure but not always perhaps and even if it had all been done for nothing but mercenary reasons the help itself remained benito had long known that life couldnt be separated into neat blacks and whites now he was discovering that gray is also a much more confusing color than it looks at first glance out of that welter of confusion one thought came clearly i want to see maria the piazza was redolent with the smells of feasting not a few of the arsenalotti had already been dipping deep in the casks of good veneto red that petro dorma had caused to be set among the tables benito found laughter smiles and winks from pretty girls and even snatches of song amid the laden trestles what he didnt find was maria garavelli it worried him hed been looking for her for quite a while the afternoon was rich and golden everybody was full of happiness everybody except benito valdosta it seemed and maria maybe he thought thered been a tear in her eye when she left him earlier or maybe he just hoped so only where the hell had she got to ah a familiar face hey tonio you seen maria the bargee nodded yeah saw her heading for the moorings down by the side of the marciana thanks benito quickened his pace and walked off towards the moorings beside the library she was sitting on a bollard staring out across the gently bobbing rows of gondolas and the forests of masts in bacino san marco a lonely figuresheltered from the noise and laughter of the piazza here only the occasional gull shrieked and squabbled overhead so whats wrong now he knelt down next to her and put an arm over her shoulder she shrugged it off i just want to be alone she snapped you wouldnt understand try me she lifted that square jaw its not a casa vecchie problem now go away whats this casa vecchie stuff im benito he stood up and backed away a pace raising his hands in protest she looked him up and down benito was acutely aware of his velvet and lace its a poncy outfit he muttered but dorma insisted maria stood up and turned to face him hands on her hips her dark eyes fulminating oh the next doge insisted you poor thing benito flushed acutely aware that she was slightly taller than he was so i am a canaler benito you on the other hand youre behaving like an absolute copy of caesare strutting about benito felt that was unfair all right so hed been enjoying the victory enjoying the waves and yeah enjoying the kisses some of the girls had given him maybe that was it whats wrong with you why are you biting my head off im not i just asked you to leave me alone seeing as you only seem to want to see me when it suits you benito felt his mouth drop open give me a break ive had to spend time with marco and my grandfather and dorma and there just hasnt been much time and ive been to see you twice and you were with kat or out twice said maria oh i am sorry i should have stayed in just in case you came to call im a canaler benito valdosta i have to work you know benito took a deep breath well thats sort of what i wanted to talk to you about i thought what was he thinking anyway hed been wandering around with a vague notion in his head of making it all work out with maria the thought finally came into clear focus he was too surprised to keep from blurting out the words well then you and me should get married maybe he added hastily seeing the storm signals there was a long silence i mean you wouldnt have to work or and dorma and my grandfather said theyd set me up um get some experience in trade one of the colonies he trickled off into uncertainty youre proposing to me she said flatly to get me off the canals well yes benito said awkwardly flushing i thought it would be best i dont but but youd be rich and comfortable and and a canaler in the casa vecchie no thank you i wont marry for that reason benito was bright red we could go to corfu or negroponte oh excuse me where venice cant see me marias voice would have cut steel i thought you would want to marry me you dont have to said benito beginning to get angry himself now his anger was nothing to her whitehot sarcasm oh what a favor the next doges brotherinlaws younger brother is doing me a poor little canaldrab like me should be so delighted at his attentions well listen to me benito valdosta vafuncula and she turned and walked off to her gondola leaving benito still gawping at the obscenity a few moments later she set off a lone vessel heading up the grand canal into a virtually deserted venice benito wandered back there didnt seem much point in staying here he was not concentrating on his footstepsor where he was going it took severely disturbed concentration to walk into someone the size of manfred benito managed it manfred looked more amused than anything else ah my crazy young friend from our visit to the dandelos and a little assault in courthouse dressed like a princeling today not an urchin or a dorma servant what are you doing walking around with a face like your girlfriend just gave you some really bad news whats wrong benito shrugged women he said trying to sound casual about it manfred laughed i know what you mean my uncle seems too fascinated by francesca for her to have any time for me either cant figure it out hes not even staring at her cleavage his shrug was a massive copy of benitos women just as you say lets go and find some wine wine always has time for us and wine doesnt mind if you have another goblet of wine either the grand canal it came to maria that someone had been whistling to her for some time she looked up valentina and claudia with a very suspiciouslooking bag maria garavelli i wish the schioppies were as dreamy as you said claudia from the fondamenta give us a lift will you she pulled up they slung the bag in it clinked a good time to be shopping said valentina cheerfully everyone is at the celebration claudia looked curiously at maria why arent you i didnt want to stay said maria curtly i would have thought benito would want your company there is nothing between me and her lip quivered benito he doesnt love me and i dont need him anyway im going to marry my cousin umberto i just made up my mind my familys been pestering me about it for weeks theyve got it all set up there was a startled silence from the two thieves oh thats very sudden said claudia we thought its not exactly something that can wait said maria bluntly valentina and claudia exchanged glances how long at least two months said maria shortly and noi dont know who the father is probably caesare um maybe not i always took precautions with him after the first few days the other thing happened too quickly she broke off squaring her shoulders what difference does it make its either caesare or one other and either way if i dont get married its a bastard she shook her head never mind my cousin mario is a sweet manive known him since i was a kidand he says he doesnt mind itll work out i wont marry for security and i wont marry for position and i definitely wont marry someone who still doesnt know if hes a fox or a wolf she looked at claudia and valentina they were staring at her im babbling she realized and why am i telling this to a couple of thieves so enough of that where can i put you off er here will do fine said valentina she sounded as uncertain as maria sounded to herself the road to rome when father eneko lopez and his two companions recognized the three horsemen who overtook them on the road to rome their jaws fell even the basque priest for a moment lost his composure your majesty croaked diego he glanced at lopez seeking confirmation lopez had spent time with the emperor in private discussion diego hadnt enekos jaw snapped shut almost audibly this is most unwise your majesty the holy roman emperor should not be traveling the roads of italy escorted only by two bodyguards his eyes squinted at the costume charles fredrik was wearing especially not disguised as a prosperous merchant charles fredriks scowled nattering at me like trolliger and here id been looking forward to your company too he plucked at the rich fabric as for this its far more comfortable than my imperial robesmuch less armor and its necessary anyway to keep my identity a secret it is essential that i be able to meet with the grand metropolitan in person breezily ill not forget to put in a good word in favor of founding your order eneko be sure of it less breezily andahi felt the secrecy was needed not for only for its own sake but becauseah pierre barked a laugh the emperors face darkened a little well yes admitted the most powerful man in europe the last time a holy roman emperor visited rome he may have left some residue of ill will seeing as how he sacked the city so i felt a certain modesty and discretion would make for better diplomatic results i have got to bring this damn petrinepauline feud under control down to a simmer at least he brought hard eyes to bear on the three priests who hoped to found a new brotherhood of struggle against a rising satan as im sure you will agree under the circumstances eneko nodded as to thatcertainly but your majesty its simply dangerous the emperors laugh sounded like a lions roar oh nonsense he slapped a meaty hand on the even meatier shoulder of the man riding to his right here i have my nephew who quite recentlythe ferocious old man couldnt keep the pride out of his voicebroke the back of a svear demon you saw it yourself father and to my left another meaty hand slapped a shoulder which though sinewy rather than massive sounded more like iron than flesh the finest scion of clann harald eneko smiled grimly who on the same dayunless im badly mistakengave chernobog himself the worst headache of his life he raised his hands in a little gesture of surrender i suppose youre right emperor with such an escort you probably dont have much to fear from highwaymen id say not murmured diego in fact id feel a little better myself having them accompany us done then pronounced the emperor you will provide us with still more in the way of disguisepilgrims going to romealong with your own convivial conversation of course and we will keep the odd ruffian from pestering you pierre nodded solemnly in the sage
