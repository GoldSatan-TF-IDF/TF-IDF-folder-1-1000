a deniable death gerald seymour prologue the bell began to toll and doug bentley was one of the first to stiffen straighten his back and wipe the smile from his face the sound always killed the quiet chuckles and murmured stories the former lance corporal in the armys pay corps had come to do a job as had the friends around him it was the fortyeighth time he had been to the towns high street in the previous eighteen months and he had missed only a very few of the occasions when the tenor bell cast in had been rung with the slow sad beat that recognised the approach of death and its cortege the town its bell the church of st bartholomew and all saints and the high street had become part of doug bentleys life in that year and a half and truth to tell he wondered sometimes how he had found any purpose in his life since retirement before the opportunity had arisen to make the regular journey there he knew all about the town the coaching inns and the fine fossils that appeared in the mud springs the unusual architecture of the town hall built on columns more than four centuries before and donated to the community by an earl of clarendon he knew all of these historic points because the town was now central to his existence and beryl seemed not only to tolerate what he did but supported it he needed her support each time they came on the number bus from swindon no charge because they were senior citizens this day as on every day he came to the town he had checked the varnish on the staff for his standard and satisfied himself there were no blemishes he had renewed the blanco on the large gloves he wore until they were virginsnow white he had buffed his black shoes shaved carefully and put polish on the leather support for the bottom end of the staff beryl had pressed his grey slacks ironed a shirt and inspected his tie she had brushed dandruff flecks from his shoulders picked fluff from his beret and made certain that the bow of black ribbon that would top the staff was not crumpled when the bus dropped them off she would leave him to the company of his new veteran comrades and he would not see her again until the ceremony was finished the bell tolled and as always at that moment he felt his stomach tighten doug bentley lived in a village to the east of swindon beside the infant and junior school a squat brick building was home to a small community of the royal british legion it could support the parttime services of a bar steward and they had a committee that had met there eighteen months before and agreed that doug bentley volunteer should go to wootton bassett on the far side of swindon to represent the branch at the next repatriation of a serviceman killed in action the former pay corps lance corporal a member of the armed forces for two years of national service in which he had never been posted overseas and of course had never heard a shot fired in anger had preened with pride at the award of this honour that he had never been in action or up the sharp end in no way diminished in his eyes his right to be regarded as a veteran he had done his time done what was asked of him he had the respect of his colleagues in the legion and theyd chosen him the same pride captivated him on this summers day as it had on the fortyseven previous times he had made the journey there with beryl he was in a line with around a dozen others they represented the royal british legion branches of towns and villages as far away as hungerford marlborough bath and frome and raf associations canal zoners onetime paratroops and they formed their line just on the road off the kerb and crowds had gathered to press behind them doug bentley thought there were more photographers and cameramen than usual he would not have admitted it to a stranger but he always watched the tv news on those evenings after he had returned home to see himself and was always pleased when he went down later to the legion if members remarked that they had seen him they made a neat line old men recreating paradeground disciplines he could be a tough old goat had earned his living as a longdistance haulage driver but would admit only to beryl that when the tenor bell tolled and the line was formed his gut churned and sometimes there was a smear of wet in his eyes he had read of the one who was coming home aged eighteen years and four months just accepted into a guards regiment and killed by an explosion three days earlier in bloody helmand province five weeks after arriving in afghanistan the family friends and supporters were dribbling out of the cross keys public house and were crossing the road weaving between the last traffic that the police would allow up and down the high street before closing it it was a good word that was used repatriation and he liked the thought of it for a fallen squaddie the town wootton bassett in wiltshire with a population of about ten thousand and nothing special to say for itself represented as the quiet fell from a sunlit blue sky the mourning of a nation for a soldier who had given his young life that a greater number might walk in freedom and in peace well that was what the tabloids printed no more traffic now the relatives friends and supporters were in place and some of the kids among them wore tshirts with a picture of what seemed to be almost a child soldier with a smiling face and a battlefield helmet that was a size too large they all had flowers and some had already started to weep every eye and doug bentleys gazed left down the street towards the raised town hall and the top of the hill beyond the church and its bell tower where the road came from the raf base into which the coffin had been flown he saw women in floral dresses kids in jeans and sneakers men standing straight and clutching shopping bags the staff of shops banks and coffee houses and people with dogs that sat still and quiet at their sides early on doug had realised this was no place for generals admirals air marshals or senior politicians the tabloids called it the tribute of middle england three police motorcyclists led the convoy coming at a crawl heads appearing first then the fluorescent yellow of the shoulders and last the blue lights on their machines the bell had stopped and the engines made a mere murmur but the sobbing of one woman was clear the motorcycles went on past doug bentley and the others then a marked police car but the hearse halted to the far side of the town hall and the funeral director climbed out of the front passenger seat the local man who did the drill calls for doug and the standardbearer party gave the command and the dozen were raised the tips dropped into the leather case that took their weight he felt the sun full on him and a bead of sweat trickled down his cheek the funeral director wore a top hat and a morning suit he had a fine walking staff with a silvertopped handle as he moved forward a woman opposite doug bentley seemed to contract in a convulsion of tears and a man beside her who had pink knees below the hem of his shorts rubbed her neck gently as the funeral director reached them top hat now carried the command came softly spoken and the standards dipped all those years before as a lance corporal in the pay corps he had loathed drill sergeants had been clumsy and useless at the coordination required but he could do this now the hearse eased to a halt and doug bentley dropped his head as if in prayer but he could see beyond the glass the closely pinned union flag over the new clean wood of the coffin he often wondered what they looked like inside the shrouds and below the lids at peace and unmarked or mangled beyond recognition it was those bloody bombs that did for them what the tv said were ieds improvised explosive devices eight out of every ten who were brought through the town on their way to the hospital in oxford where the postmortems were done had been killed by the tribesmens bombs doug bentley didnt know about war and his military service as a conscript had been about ledgers officers expenses and other ranks salaries but men in the branch in his village who had been in the paras or the marines spoke of the bombs and what they did to a body just eighteen years old the guardsman had been and the picture on the tshirts showed a face that was immature arms and legs that had most likely been skeleton thin all ripped apart by a bomb he saw the mother of the boy soldier and the middleaged man with her stood back a halfpace he saw the father with a woman in black behind him it always struck him how few of the dead soldiers had parents who still lived together he and beryl had been together for fortysix years had reared two kids and flowers single roses little posies of the seasons last daffodils and pretty sprays of chrysanthemums were being laid on the bonnet of the hearse against the windscreen and on the roof the grief was naked and raw it hurt doug bentley to watch some of the family had laid their open hands on the glass sides as if in that way they might touch the body in the coffin how long were they there a little more than half a minute the funeral director who had faced the hearse now swung round as if he had been a military man in his time and waved his stick dramatically he had the top hat back on his head and started to walk forward up the empty high street the hearse nudged along after him a few of the flowers sliding into the road the hearse left the relatives friends and supporters clutching each other wiping eyes and sniffling it edged past old men who had brought out their medals for the day the television satellite dishes scanner vans and cherrypicker cranes another police car came behind it a backup hearse and a fourwheel drive for the military police some he knew had predicted that what they called grief tourism would suffer from fatigue that the crowds would dwindle but they had been bloody wrong the kid the guardsman with a childs face and a helmet too big for him had been shown the same respect as any serviceman coming through six months and a year before up the high street the hearse again stopped briefly the funeral director and the driver gathered up what flowers had not fallen away and laid them inside with due but brief reverence then the party drove at growing speed with the motorcycle escort down the road and towards the motorway in the first minutes after the convoy had cleared the town the standards were raised then lowered and the command was given for the old servicemen to fall out a few words of conversation slipped between them but the appetite for jocularity and the recall of times past seemed spent hands were shaken and they moved off to start the journey home the family and its party had returned to the room at the cross keys where the management provided coffee and biscuits but a few lingered outside to drag on cigarettes most of the crowd who had borne witness to the sacrifice of a young life in helmand province stood around on the pavements as if unsure what should follow pensioners veterans shop workers and the idly curious seemed reluctant to break the mood of pensive resignation and quiet the traffic managed that petrol tankers removal lorries supermarket delivery trucks jostled to accelerate up and down the high street doug furled his standard collapsed the staff and threaded the parts into the canvas carrying bag he said his goodbyes almost stepped on a single red rose and went to look for beryl he went past a drycleaners a bakery a motoraccessories business a fish bar the oriental aroma a pictureframer and a charity shop he remembered what someone had said about ieds that the bombs were a new form of warfare more deadly than anything the army had faced in the last halfcentury he knew next to nothing about explosives but could reflect on the tshirts and the mothers weeping he thought that by standing in the road with his lowered standard he had played his part and he knew he would not be able to do so much longer they were planning to move the repatriations to brize norton he dreaded that much of the purpose of his life would be extinguished when the hearses and their escorts no longer came through wootton bassett the mood of the town would never be recaptured at another location he didnt want to think about it he searched for beryl and couldnt see her she might be in the library or in a bank just windowshopping or damn near bumped into a woman on the pavement tears streaming down her face quite pretty she might have been in her early thirties she had fluffy blonde hair in sort of curls and her mascara was smudged she wore a scarlet skirt that doug bentley reckoned was some way short of decent and a white blouse that was not buttoned high at her neck was a thin gold chain and a pendant that spelled out her name ellie ellie cried from her soul and gazed up the road where the hearse and its escort had gone are you all right love just a choke as if a sob was caught in her throat its these bloody bombs he said the bloody bombs are you family love she sniffed heavily he produced a handkerchief and she blew hard into it then used it to wipe her face she grimaced theyre all heartbreaking love he said im with the royal british legion represent my branch were here every time to show our respect its a terrible loss to you and im not family just came to give them solidarity most people do that and theyre heroes arent they serving queen and country making the ultimate sacrifice heroes yes the bravest of the brave heroes all of them doug bentley still couldnt see beryl he didnt know how to react to this womans grief his wife wasnt there to tell him and he thought it was probably only five minutes now until the bus left just take it one hour at a time then one day at a time then one week theyre heroes and their families must be so proud of them he saw a broad wedding ring on her hand and with it a diamondcrested engagement ring which looked expensive are you from an army family ellie is that why youre here she seemed to snort as if the question invited derision absolutely not no heroes among my lot his people must feel so honoured by him she shrugged he was confused now its none of my business and i dont want to intrude but did you come today to be with the boys family show your support no god no i was filling up with petrol at the shell the road was blocked and i wandered down seen it on the telly of course but its different when youre you know im all right now thanks for your time she wandered away without a backward glance and he realised beryl was now close behind him ellies backside swung as she walked they went for the bus where already a goodsized queue waited his wife told him he had been chatting up a bit of a tart he said that one minute the woman had been in floods of tears and the next quite offhand but jabbering about heroes beryl followed her with an eagle eye you know next to nothing about anything doug she said not that im holding that against you they walked together to the bus stop her arm tucked in his chapter an unobtrusive man he was noticed by few of the pedestrians who shared the steps with him that climbed to the pavements of vauxhall bridge in the november rain he left behind him the cream and green walls and the darkened plate glass expanses of the building that those outside the disciplines of the service called ceausescu towers the headquarters of mi he walked briskly it was his job to move unseen and not to attract attention even inside the towers len gibbons was known to few of those who passed through the security gates morning and evening alongside him or shared the lift to and from the third floor where his desk east stood or waited in the canteen lunch queue with him the few who did know him however regarded this middlegrade manager as a safe pair of hands and in the trade that was about as good an accolade as could be handed out as a safe pair of hands he was entitled to trust and responsibility and he had received both that afternoon at a meeting with the director general no notes taken the word of the day was deniable the meeting in itself was deniable the matter discussed was deniable and the conclusions reached were deniable the actions that would be taken were also deniable len gibbons had been called to the upper floors and briefed over a pot of tea and a shortbread biscuit take the bastard down len would be the vulgar way to put it take him down and leave him on a kerb so that his head rolls in the gutter and the blood runs down the drain not of course that we like vulgarity we might more politely call it interdiction actually i prefer take the bastard down itll be deniable my diary has me in the cabinet office fifteen minutes ago and there all afternoon so go to it len and know that many men and widows will be cheering you on if you bring him down there will be cheering to the rafters its not the sort of thing weve done in years a first in my time but it has my total support as long as it stays deniable half an hour later he had cleared his desk and with a filled briefcase had allowed his assistant to leave ahead of him he had switched off the lights locked the doors and they had gone down to the central hall in the lift they had swiped their cards at security walked out into the rain and headed for the bridge he did not look back at the building did not know how many days he would be away from it and whether he would win or lose but the job would get his best effort that len gibbons guaranteed across the bridge he headed for the underground station he preferred to mingle with the masses that crowded the trains he bought the two tickets and passed one over his shoulder no turn of the head no smile to sarah and felt her take it quickly discreetly descending on the escalator he had the briefcase held tight across his chest his coat sleeve hanging far enough forward to mask the chain linking the handle to the handcuff attachment on his wrist inside the briefcase were the maps charts and lists for coded contact that would assist towards the statesponsored killing of an individual whose life was considered forfeit all of course deniable he wore the years well fiftynine and was physically fit mentally alert with good colour in his face his trade demanded ordinariness rather than eccentricity and there was little about him that those on the platform would remember no sign of the hairstyle under the trilby and behind the beige scarf no sight of his shirt or tie because the raincoat was buttoned high the briefcase bore no eiir embossed in gold which would have shown he was a servant of the state if any had noted him glanced quickly at the trilby they might have thought him a rather boring man whose employment shelf life drifted to a close they would have been wrong god in the towers had known gibbons the length of his professional career would have judged him a man of insight and acumen but handicapped by a throw of the dice those damned events that could derail any intelligence officers career he might appear a buffoon might cultivate that image might use it as a cover to divert attention from the reality of a stilettosharp mind he trekked into the heavier rain as the afternoon closed dankly on central london the underground behind them they passed the entrance to the ritz hotel then skirted the south side of piccadilly circus neither looked up at the eros statue and turned down into haymarket she came level to his elbow and murmured the number they should look for he nodded they were a team the rains drips fell regularly from his hat brim and her hair was soaked but they made no smalltalk about the awfulness of the weather probably her mind was swamped as his was with the enormity of what they hoped to achieve in the next hours and days not weeks there was a doorway and inside newspapers were scattered instead of a mat a man in commissionaires uniform sat at a desk but they were not challenged and declined to use the lift instead they walked up two flights and slipped along a corridor of closed doors none of which boasted the legend of a company or business she had a yale and two mortise keys out of her handbag and he stood at the side while she unfastened the door gibbons did not know when the service had last used the premises whether they were regular or occasional visitors he assumed that a front company held the lease and that all connections to the towers were well disguised old procedures died hard no interior lights were switched on until sarah had gone to the windows of both main rooms the kitchenette behind a partition the toilet and shower room and pulled down the blinds there was a room with a desk a chair and a small settee for him and a room with a desk chair portable tv and a folded single bed for her there were cupboards for each of them a safe with a combination lock now the reserve on his face faded that buzz the adrenalin flush and the excitement surge replaced it he was a bureaucrat and a small cog by fate of circumstance between large wheels and he accepted that but he took pride in what he did usually he succeeded in providing what was asked of him bare walls confronted len gibbons and a wintry smile settled on his lips she had emptied his case of photographs and the big folded map and had the roll of sellotape in her hand she did not bother to ask him where she should display the images a ceiling light lit the desk on which were his phone laptop notebooks pencils and the paraphernalia that travelled with him she chose the wall in his direct eyeline as the place to stick up the photographs some were classified and others were not she fastened them in the same haphazard jumble in which they had been displayed before there were pictures of armoured vehicles all shapes and sizes all wrecked some turned right over some on their sides and some left as debris because the wheels had gone or the tracks the craters in tarmacked roads leading straight across flat sand landscapes were great gouges in some a soldier could have stood the top of his helmet hidden stillframes a quarter covered with arabic text showed a moment of detonation that had been downloaded from websites there were clear portraits taken with a macrolens in extreme closeup of the gear used in the bombs and their sophistication he liked to know his enemy and thought it important to display the enemys work and skills to have them present around him at all times there were photographs from the party last christmas at a rehabilitation home where young men with military haircuts all amputees waved stunted limbs defiantly at the camera and there was one magnified picture of a procession slow and black in the high street of a country town he had been with the operation from the beginning and thought now that if his maker was willing it approached the end at the beginning two years and three months before a man had sneezed he might have caught the mild dose of influenza from his wife or children he had sneezed and gone back to his labour on the electronics bench he did not know that the sneeze would kickstart an operation launched from a faraway city he had been bent over the bench and was wearing the magnification optics he used when working on the software he adapted with kit brought in from the united states from the land of the great satan he could obtain dual use passive infrared devices or highpowered cordless phones with a range of near to seven miles from a base station and dualtone multifrequency gear the pir hpcp and dtmf and the zappers for unlocking car doors and the engineer used them to provide the electronic signal to improvised explosive devices and to his design of explosive formed projectiles from the safety and security of his workshop he created the bombs that would be carried along the ratruns that crisscrossed the border of his country with iraq to kill and maim the sneeze had been perfunctory and he was able to get his handkerchief out from his trouser pocket to smother the second he had not stopped in his work and had not thought through the consequences of that minor eruption in his nose had he done so he might have realised that a fine film had scattered from his face some minuscule droplets had wafted down on to the bench and a few had come to rest on the circuit he was putting together he had gone on with his work methodically and carefully he had built the explosive formed projectile he had a production line in a small factory area behind his workshop and the shaped copper charge was manufactured there to highprecision standards by experienced technicians by his latemorning break he had completed the electronics of a killing kit capable of defeating the electronic countermeasures of his enemy and had begun on another using the same procedures and techniques they could almost have been described as a signature the device onto which he had sneezed was now sealed boxed and ready for transportation he did not know that the device had failed to detonate a trigger man as the great satans troops described the bomb layer and the peasant charged with firing the device had panicked when an attack helicopter had flown low over the sand scrape in which he had hidden himself some three hundred yards back from highway the convoy route he had broken cover and run later to gain the reward of ten american dollars he had fabricated a story of an advancing foot patrol the need to destroy the firing software its burial and his flight the engineer did not know that the sight of the man emerging from his hiding place and sprinting towards nowhere had alerted the apache crew a followup had been mounted and the abandoned device retrieved that had been four weeks and two days after the engineer had sneezed at his workbench and given forensic scientists something akin to gold dust a sample for dna analysis at a laboratory in the west of england a woman in a white suit with a face mask over her mouth and her hair in a showercap would say christmas has come early it has to be the man who put it together there had been a meeting of ammunition technical officers and explosive ordnance disposal experts and the intelligence had been fed to them one who had been to the palace for a gallantry decoration and was said to have exhausted more lives than any streetwise tomcat had said allowing himself a gallowshumour grin we chance our bollocks when were out in the donkey shit trying to defuse these things in the hope that we can get fingerprints anything a speck of blood because the trigger raghead cut himself on a thorn and thats just to identify a footsoldier here we have the dna of the top man in the chain weve got it on a plate thats a hell of a start the chair of a committee of intelligence officers and agent handlers gaunt from the weight of responsibility had briefed im assured that only a small number of men experts in microengineering are capable of making these things as you all know but its worth repeating ad nauseam four in every five of our own and us casualties are laid at the door of these wretched things the engineer knew nothing about the basic information his sneeze had provided he had gone on working through a full day until a car had taken him home he had eaten with his wife and he had told his children jahandar and abbas the ancient persian fairy story of simorgh and of gods three sons prince jamshid prince qmars and prince korshid he had not known of the chasm he had made in his personal security when he sneezed neither did he know that fiftyone days later a slim file would be handed to a journeyman intelligence officer charged with the coordination of an intelligence trawl she had to stand on tiptoe to fasten the top corners of the map to the wall with lengths of sellotape he didnt help her but sat down and swivelled away from the pictures of bomb damage his shoes were on the corner of the desk and his chair tilted comfortably as he gazed at the map because len gibbons had never been to iraq let alone visited iran he had little understanding of the terrain topography and general culture of the area there were large yellow patches desert and a pair of narrow green strips that represented the cultivated irrigated areas beside the tigris and euphrates rivers as they came to a confluence at alqurnah before going south as one there was blue for what seemed to be great inland lakes with little symbols of marshland printed on them across the extreme eastern corner of the watercovered area was the bold mauve line of a frontier and almost on that line in what was marked as iran there was a bold cross in black ink she looked at him and he nodded all he would offer in the way of praise but sarah would take no offence he was to her a good man to work for and she was on board for what the operation sought to achieve she had no qualms about its morality she stood for a moment hands on hips legs slightly apart enough to tighten the skirt across her buttocks but it would have taken more than that to awaken any interest in him they shared the scent of pursuit and the excitement she went to make a cup of tea leaving him to stare at the map she could remember the day when his screen had exploded into life when a sparse file had started to thicken no one forgot such rare febrile days it was three hundred and nineteen days after rashid the engineer had sneezed over his workbench that a man walked into the lobby of the british consulate in the gulf emirates city of dubai and requested a meeting with a diplomat the engineer had gone to work late because he had spent the morning with a doctor in the town of ahvaz his wife had been examined because of the persistent but still relatively mild headaches that sapped her concentration at work the doctor had prescribed aspirin and rest so rashid had taken naghmeh back to their new home then set off for his bench at the small factory he did not know that an iranian had requested asylum from the british authorities and would therefore be challenged to explain his value he did not know that a spook attached to the staff operating under consular cover would say you claim you are a member of the iranian revolutionary guard corps you said your unit was from the alquds brigade but i have to ask what sort of information you might bring with you that would justify from us your asylum and safety facts my friend are the currency needed and of course rashid the engineer did not know that a traitor who had been assigned as a guard to an inner perimeter of an iranian revolutionary guard corps camp on the road south from ahvaz was now in flight and faced if again in the custody of alquds either stoning to death or strangulation at the end of a rope perhaps rashid the engineer had seen this guard as his mercedes swept him through the gates of the compound perhaps the man had swung them open and saluted rashid did not know that the man had denounced him because death faced him in his own country his crime had been to defile a commanders daughter the girl had been a willing party but now cried rape the man said i can tell you about the engineer who made the bombs that killed so many of your soldiers in maysan and basra provinces and many americans i can tell you who he is and where he is from and where is the camp that he uses for the building of the bombs and he was left in the bare interview room with a wellmuscled security guard while the intelligence officer composed the signal to london that would ask whether such information was indeed sufficient currency for a promise of asylum only a promise of course and rashid the engineer knew nothing of this it was fiftyone days ago two years and six weeks after a sneeze that the defining moment had been reached sarah did not have a photograph of the features of the bombmaker to fasten to the wall on his right instead a black outline of a head and shoulders was superimposed on a white background with a name rashid armajanrashid armajan the moment savoured with strong coffee had provided confirmation that the dna sample extracted from the abandoned workings of an explosive formed projectile matched that of a target identified by a walkin at diplomatic premises on the gulf meetings had started and len gibbons had bustled between them he had contributed little but had taken brief notes he had learned the requirement of his seniors and how it would be achieved matters had been moved forward at a location he could not picture and was marked in his mind only by a crude cross on a map but that was immaterial to him he could reflect gazing at the featureless face and at the name in her bold handwriting that the moment had brought him considerable satisfaction the collection of a used cigarette end smoked only a third down and tossed aside had supplied the opportunity for the moment had involved considerable resources a budget allocation all handled by gibbons and manpower deployment he told sarah that the positioning of the sheet of paper on the wall was excellent and almost smiled the child molester from the alquds brigade of the irgc had said that the engineer was a prolific smoker that had been enough to determine len gibbonss course of action in confirming the named target they had told rashid and naghmeh that the tumour inside her skull was now the size of a songbirds egg it cut across the nerve routes that controlled speech and mobility her condition had deteriorated over the previous weeks with more intense pain in her head increased dizziness inability to move and great tiredness she could no longer look after her children the doctor in ahvaz had realised the importance of her husband and had pulled strings to raise funds for the couple to fly to tehran for more detailed scans and biopsies they had stayed two nights at the medical school attached to the university rashid armajan could not fault the treatment and respect they were shown an official car had met them at the airport to drive them to their accommodation and had been available to take them back for the return flight they had sat numbed and silent on the aircraft the enormity of what they had been told had cudgelled them she had gone inside their house and would be with her mother and the children now the engineer walked on the concrete paving in front of their home he could see out over the water in the lagoon to the reed beds where there were gaps in the reeds he could see more water and the berm which was the border hazed in the afternoon sunshine he lit a cigarette and dragged on it he smoked the zarrin brand and had deflected or ignored his wifes pleading that he should give up his concession to her was that he did not smoke inside their home many men he knew believed and told him so that he gave up too much for her when he went outside each time he needed to smoke he supposed that the two medical men who had faced them across the table in the neuro wing made a habit of telling patients and their loved ones the brutal news of imminent death it had been suggested to him that he alone should hear their verdict after the test results were back but rashid and his wife had refused that option they were a partnership and a bond of love held them they had been together when the assessment was given them it had been done without sentiment the condition was inoperable given the equipment and talents available in tehran the condition would deteriorate rapidly and she had a few months to live she would be dead within the year he was fortyone and she a year younger they had been married for fourteen years tears welled in his eyes and cigarette smoke ballooned in front of his face he wore better clothes than he would have chosen had he been in the camp at his workbench good trousers a good shirt and a lightweight jacket the sun was tilting and much of its ferocious heat was now dissipated by palm trees to his left just short of the small barracks where his own security was housed and border guards were stationed an old man came towards him bent in the back and shoulders harmless and feeble he carried a plastic bag in one hand and a broom of dried fronds he crouched to pick up unseen pieces of rubbish swept the pavement and gutter then cleared the dried leaves that had fallen rashid thought he was an arab there were many in the region of khuzestan they did the menial work and had no education in ahvaz some police and irgc members thought of them as terrorists but this was an old man and he threw down the cigarette turned on his heel and fished in his pocket for the packet and his lighter he looked for a kingfisher over the water and saw a heron poised and still a hawk flew low past him he would not accept what they had been told in tehran his wife and he had gripped the others hand and she had choked a little he had sniffed hard it was not right that a man who worked for the alquds brigade of the iranian revolutionary guard corps should show emotion and fear of death his own father nineteen years before had gone into an unmarked unlisted minefield to rescue a pupil from his school who had wandered into it after a puppy the dog had tripped an antipersonnel device in the end the puppy was dead the pupil alive his father had tripped another mine and had lived for four or five hours he had shown no fear from beginning to end the hawk had gone past the barracks and the heron was in a statue pose another cigarette was thrown down and another lit he would not accept that the wife of an individual of his importance could be sent home to die because of the states medical inadequacy his status he was not praised or decorated in public if a security chief a brigadier or general came to ahvaz rashid armajan would be an invited guest he would sip coffee or juice and describe his newest work the research he did and the effectiveness of the killing devices he created he built the best he was almost the father of the efp many coalition troops had gone home in bags from iraq because of explosive force projectiles that had come from his workbench the software firing mechanisms he put in place were ahead of and defeated the electronic countermeasures they employed he was proud to be supreme in his field now that iraq was almost purged of foreign military he concentrated on developing the roadside bombs of great sophistication that would be issued to units of the revolutionary guard corps if his country were invaded by americans their poodles or the zionists he was also called upon to instruct leaders of the afghan resistance in the manufacture of simpler devices and he had heard they had learned well what he had taught them the best of his work as used in iraq would repel any invader of his beloved country he thought his status should afford his wife the help she needed another cigarette was thrown down another pack opened he heard his name shouted it was part of the engineers status that he was allocated a personal security officer he turned the officer was ten or a dozen years younger and walked with a limp but would not use a stick or crutch he had no love for the man objected to his constant presence round their home he would have thought the secrecy surrounding his name his work made protection unnecessary but the man was evidence of status a stream of apologies babbled from the officers mouth he had been told that the engineer and his wife were due back on the last flight of the evening from tehran he said they had caught the first that two passengers had been dumped off the manifest his face would have shown the grimness of his news he walked back towards the house and heard the officer mansoor yell abuse at the old arab man his status permitted him to demand better he did not know that a cigarette end had already been picked up and placed in a plastic sachet to be taken across the frontier along one of the many smugglers routes that passed through the marshes he did not know that the cigarette end with his spittle on the filter would be flown to europe for examination or that men and women privy to the result would clap and cheer sarah had come off the phone and read to len gibbons the dishes on the takeaway menu from the trattoria at the top of haymarket beyond the drawn blinds the evening had closed quickly and he thought the central heating in the suite needed a tweak there might be a frost before morning he was on expenses and there was a quite generous allowance for evening meals on duty but he had never been one to abuse a systems finances just a pasta dish with some chicken and tomato sauce a bottle of italian mineral water and the matter of the engineer had seemed to be stymied and the momentum had seemed to have died he had not made the presentation but had sat silently on a hard chair in the corner while men and women of greater rank did the talking his own section head had read verbatim from len gibbonss brief the great and the good two weeks and a day before had cringed what go on to iranian territory statesponsored terrorism by us inside irans frontiers ask our special forces to violate that hornets nest theyd be entitled to refuse point blank it would be an act of war and the consequences of failure too awful to consider i couldnt urge my minister to permit this action however much of our blood is on this reptiles hands out of the question even to consider assassinating an iranian on his own territory simply not possible but a woman from the foreign and commonwealth office rapped her pencil on the table for attention she did liaison between the towers and government had grey hair styled close to her skull a lined face and wore a blouse that some might have described as stuffy with jewellery that had probably come from a grandmother len gibbons noticed her beacon eyes jutting jaw and narrowed lips she spoke rather quietly any former students of ancient history here done mesopotamia no well there was a king of babylon hammurabi powerful enough to have left a code behind him written in akkadian it was passed to the writers of leviticus exodus and deuteronomy broadly all those years ago it was stated an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth legitimisation for an act of revenge would it not send a message if it were done with discretion done somewhere wherever somewhere might be my summary we couldnt approve any act of extrajudicial murder and would wish to separate ourselves from any such folly we would not wish to hear any more of this nonsense and im as busy as the rest of you and have other matters more pressing to concern myself with he thought she caught his glance and that she winked fractionally at him the barest flutter of an eyelid all except his section head and himself had left the meeting convinced that a plan of outrageous folly and illegality had been roundly squashed by the lady from the fco back in his office that evening the daylight ebbing his screen had lit with a message relayed from another floor of the towers a man had apparently been selling dates at a border settlement it was a good part of the world for dates and they were a local favourite many sellers roamed communities for the opportunity to trade the engineer saw the date seller when he came out of his home and walked towards the palm tree that threw shade on the chair that the security officer mansoor used the man carried a pair of baskets each slung from the ends of a pole that he balanced on a shoulder the engineer saw that mansoor had a handkerchief on his lap and it was loaded with dates the seller had scored once at least when he himself was approached he waved the wretch away he had never of course heard of abigail jones known to a choice company as echo foxtrot a codesign for the eternal flame and had never of course imagined that an itinerant date seller could earn five hundred american dollars for each day he spent loitering at the border settlement he had come back from their doctors surgery at the hospital in ahvaz and had received the answer that had been telephoned from the headquarters building in the former tehran embassy complex of the great satan of the alquds brigade he had told his wife the news he had been given and they had clung to each other she had wept on his chest and he on her shoulder and then he had sat her by a window where a light curtain would shield her from the sun he had come out to smoke a cigarette and inhale the relief the date seller had heard part of what he said to mansoor but the engineer could not know that a second doctor abroad more experienced with the brain as soon as arrangements can be made because time for her is so short and he could now cling to hope and the security officer nodded sucked another date then spat out the stone he had never spoken to echo foxtrot the eternal flame had he len gibbons would have congratulated her without reservation and if the information had come at a cost of five hundred american dollars a day then it was cheap the yanks would likely have paid five times that for it and thought it a bazaar bargain it was the end of their day she would guard the phones during the night and use the collapsible bed and he would go to his club not the travellers or the reform or the garrick but one that specialised in discounts for couples from the old empire sarah had cleared away their supper and the tinfoil would go into a rubbish bag which hed take down to the security desk when he left for his accommodation his last job before shutting down for the evening was to make phone calls the list in front of him was written in her neat hand the number of the american who would be waiting in his office on a sidestreet off grosvenor square and further west that of the israeli in the fortified wing of their place in kensington abutting the park both men would be similar to himself facilitators not movers and shakers they were functionaries the oil in the wheels that made things happen after that their photographs were on his desk and later they would go on the wall two more men would be contacted it was rare for len gibbons to entertain ideas that were not necessary to the business in hand he lifted the photographs in turn one of a younger man and one of an older and held them where she could see them ridiculous unnecessary but he did it for you and me sarah our moment in the spotlight is nearly over well be moving into the wings and itll be their turn to hog the stage if theyre any good well win if theyre not well i hate to think of the end game if theyre not good enough and where theyll be anyway im sure theyre good men she said gently the best available he reached for his phone which theyll need to be he was a star his exceptional abilities accepted by all who came into professional contact with him he knew the range of his talents and treated less skilled croppies with disdain something near to contempt he had childhood friends no boozing pals the best relationship currently in his life was with his oppo ged there were some on the team who murmured behind their hands that ged deserved beatification for tolerating stags with that cocky little prick but everyone acknowledged that danny baxter called badger to his face was the bees bollocks when it came to the arts of working in a covert rural observation post where he and ged huddled against the elements on a freezing night halfway up a valleys slopes in the hide theyd built aged twentyeight and still nominally a policeman badger had been transferred the previous year to the surveillance teams of box their callsign for the security service there was always work for the men precious few women who were best at shitting in a bag and whose creed was to take in and take out then excrement went into nappy bags their urine into plastic milk bottles and they left behind no sign of their presence badger and geds stag in the hide had less than fifteen minutes to run their effectiveness was already stretched to the limit and they had been there since a little before first light the darkness was well set now and the rain was coming down hard it buggered their efforts to keep the scopes lens clear and the audio stuff was on the blink hed give the guy on maintenance back in the police station at builth serious hassle for the audios failure and won no friendships there but he couldnt give a damn they were off the beulah to abergwesyn road and overlooked a track that led down to a farm that had a field with a halfdozen fixedsite mobile homes holiday caravans three that week were taken by eight muslim kids from north luton that day there had been physicalendurance stuff filling big rucksacks with stones and cantering up steep fields scattering the sheep and theyd done jerks like they had a physicaleducation pamphlet around they must be thick the farmer who owned the caravans had a nephew in the birmingham police and had rung in to report his guests behaviour always the way with town people believed that the countryside had no eyes they could have run round the streets of north luton and not been noticed it had been a good stag for badger and ged the hide was close to two hundred yards from the caravans up the hill on the far side of the valley theyd crawled into the gorse from where the sheep had grazed in summer and tunnelled through it it was a useful hide because none of the outer foliage was disturbed both wore issue gillie suits that broke up the lines of their bodies and similar headgear badger had made his own and when ged was assigned to him hed told the man four years older than himself that what hed concocted was crap and had made him a new one the others on the team were astonished that the arrogant bastard had done something for someone else and the new camouflage headgear was best grade their faces beneath the scrim netting that hung over their eyes mouths and noses were smeared with cream in green and black slashes and the scopes lens had more scrim over it the bloody rain dripped on them it had been a good stag good enough to justify the damp and the hunger theyd eaten only a muesli bar each over a fifteenhour period and drunk minimum water badger had identified the natural leader among the muslim kids bad not having the audio working but the scope lens was enough to sort out the men from the boys there was one to whom the others seemed to respond he gave the instructions didnt do the runs up the hill with a weighted rucksack he was a tall man wore hiking boots jeans and a heavy anorak he didnt have the trademark beard of a jihadist or the closecropped skull he wore thick rimless spectacles and might have been a library supervisor or a junior accountant could have been anything which meant he had worked on his anonymity with the help of a razor badger wasnt armed and ged had a disabling spray canister on his belt under the gillie suit the power of the scopes leica lens and the ml one on the camera meant they didnt have to be closer there was support at the pickup point with glocks and h ampks but that was down on the road and in a layby closer to beulah than abergwesyn the kids from luton would have been fired up with holywar stuff and the discovery of a covert team watching them would have bred no argument angst and from angst came violence and from violence came a knife and a bared throat when a victims head was yanked back the lenses they had been issued with meant they could stay a decent distance back up the hillside and do their business and it was useful intelligence they had gained and they had highquality pictures and the numberplates of a transit van that would be picked up when it was back on the road then it would be urban surveillance and the guy with the rimless spectacles would be flagged for major attention theyd each used a plastic bag tinfoil and three bottles ged was wriggling to get them into the bergen the leader guy and one of the others had been outside a caravan had stood and shivered the scopes nightvision attachment had shown this to badger and must have talked something serious and not to be shared badger and ged had identified a lieutenant more trusted than the others and could match up the nightvision image with the pictures taken in daylight so that he too could be marked out for extra attention there was a scenario in it the leader and his righthand guy did the speeches talked of the sacrifice and might even have chatted up the prospect of the famous seventytwo the virgins waiting for a dismembered suicide warrior behind the gates into paradise then they slid away and left the bastard dosed up with fervour to walk on to a train or a bus or into a shopping mall leaders and lieutenants did not do explosive vests wrapped round their own chests the rest of the group would be fodder for the tailor who made the vests and wove into them the pouches for the ball bearings screws tacks and razor slivers but theyd likely be rendered harmless if the top man and his bagcarrier were taken down at the knees lights burned now in two of the caravans and the booking with the farmer was until the following day he reckoned the lads would be gone at first light thered be one surveillance vehicle facing down into builth another towards abergwesyn and a biker was floating they left the way they had come and not even the farmer who had made the first call and who had worked that hillside with his dogs and sheep would have seen a sign of their approach or their departure or noticed anything disturbed in the gorse in the back office of the police station where local priorities were listed on a poster as combating antisocial driving and curbing speeding on the llanwrtyd wells road beyond beulah the staff had all gone home they did the debrief and the pictures were downloaded on to a laptop and there was a message for you badger the team was run by a an officer from the box and hed looked pleased to have the clearcut portraits of the guy in the rimless glasses the tails were waiting to track them back into luton where the van had been hired a call for you he was looking for a shower and a meal to warm his guts and his bed in the small hotel where they were billeted and where they were thought to be from a floodprevention unit he took the piece of paper from the hand offering it and shoved it into his smocks inner pocket id read it if i were you badger and id call them he hadnt taken it out again actually boss ive done a bloody long stag and a pretty good one for results a wash food and bed are my priorities who called im not your fucking answerphone young man a guy from six actually from the dirtyraincoat crowd south of the river maybe he wants to take you off our hands id say that work from six would suit anyone with as high an opinion of themselves as you because it would be exacting and likely tax a genius well miss you do me a favour just ring him he called the number and it was answered he said who he was and that he was replying to the call hed expected to be told why hed been singled out but heard a monotonously flat voice tell him where he should be and when there were no plaudits just brusque business he said into the phone if its a job for croppies i like to work with my mate as oppo hes ged the suggestion was ignored the voice repeated where he should be the next day and at what time others around him drank gin but joe foulkes stayed with the tonic he had been invited to spend a full day with the battalions recce troop then stay the night in the officers mess he always enjoyed time spent with any of the parachute regiments specialist units found them receptive to the experience he had accumulated in a career of covert surveillance in uk conditions through the four seasons in rural and urban locations theyd enjoyed his anecdotes over the meal it had been a good day the man who called him gave no name but instead offered the boxs poste restante number a code good enough to tell him the secret intelligence service had sought him out after a surprisingly brief exchange of pleasantries barely civil he was told he should be at northolt main gate the guardroom no later than hours he had started to explain that the call had reached him at the mess of the parachute regiment nd battalion which was didnt the man know in colchester a hell of hike from the other side of london that would mean a bloody awful early rising but his destination was repeated and the time at which he was expected then the call was terminated he had not taken offence and was more than interested that six wanted his knowledge first hand he thought of himself at fiftyone as a bit of a legend in the field joe foulkes had been a policeman since the age of eighteen and a surveillance expert for more than twentyfive years he had a good command of one of the more impenetrable languages on the planet and had therefore many seams of information ready for mining and extraction that day he had been back to his first love he seldom used it for real these days but he kept his veteran gillie suit in the boot of his car and always brought it out when he gave lectures and supervised field exercises he had worn it when he had lectured recce troop and his audience of young soldiers had been rapt hed said out in the rain and scrub beside the shooting ranges that the basics should always be observed and hed used the buzz words that anyone attempting rural surveillance in iraq afghanistan or northern ireland should have at the forefront of their mind the outline of the human body was so distinctive that its shape must always be broken shadows were an aid and should be hugged the biggest giveaway unprofessional and unforgivable was the silhouette any kit surface the bulk of binoculars or the length of a spotter scope must be broken up when a team moved spacing was critical the last of his six bullet points was smell hed talked of how long it lingered on open ground if there was no wind and not just fags toothpaste and weapons oil but the insect repellent you needed to keep maneating iraqi mosquitoes at bay they were terrific those young fellows and they gave him respect hed ended the outside session with a popular theme how useless the americans were and the story of the fbi agent in the hunt for a redneck abortionclinic bomber in the mountains of north carolina the agent was supposed to be on a covert lieup and had freaked out because he couldnt take the darkness or the silence another from alcohol tobacco and firearms had started to shriek because he wasnt permitted in his hide to smoke his daily ration of marlboro lite and a sheriffs deputy gone for a weeks duty in a forest had broken his spectacles on the first day out he hadnt brought a spare pair and could barely see his hand in front of him for the rest of the stag if foulkes had been talking to an american audience then fbi atf and the deputy would have become british and if it had been germans the miscreants would have been poles it had been a good dinner and he had felt valued at the table they called him by the name hed been given a couple of decades earlier he was foxy foulkes hed wandered away from the group had faced a fading print of paras in the heat of aden snapped more than fortyfive years earlier before any of his hosts were born hed taken the call and felt perplexed by its brevity the lack of information but elated the mood had stayed with him during the rest of the evening but there was an early start and he needed some sleep before the wakeup call and the long drive now he thanked them grimaced and said something about an old dog needing its rest a major asked him for his card difficult to get hold of you foxy through the proper channels prevarication and obfuscation at every corner weve really benefited from your time and would like you back the boys enjoyed it hugely and learned a great deal delighted to he took out his wallet he fingered in the pouches for his card and a photograph floated down to the carpet a lad crouched picked it up and glanced at it there was an admiring nod as it was handed back to him that your daughter foxy pretty girl he flushed then pride caught him my wife actually lucky you congratulations foxy foulkes warmed yes weve been together seven years second time round for me and the same for her frankly we make a good pair she works in navy procurement in bath i think we can say no hesitation were both happier than weve ever been ive felt blessed every day since i met ellie we complement each other as you say im lucky to be with her anyway time for bed if you dont mind he wouldnt call her that night she didnt like to be disturbed late if he was away he would call her in the morning truth was he yearned to call her and drop a hint that it was secret business he was wanted for but shed be sharp with him at this time she would have been impressed of course if hed called her with his news but it was too late he couldnt imagine why he was wanted by six at short notice and at an airfield what for where chapter a man with an angular face and a weary voice had greeted him he seemed to have the organisation in hand and had told him i understand people call you badger if you have no particular hostility to the name then thats what well use if you dont know somebodys name and title and you dont know mine what would you call them hed said that if he didnt know the name of a man who ran a show hed refer to him as boss oh id like that and over there thats foxy i dont think anyone else will need identifying foxy and badger very good well talk a bit when we get there but in the mean time id be grateful for your patience they had been led by ground crew towards the lear jet its engines ticking over and the steps down all bizarre but danny badger baxter was not one to be fazed by lack of information the flight was smooth they were above the clouds and he had shown his documentation at the gate and the raf police hadnt jotted down any of the details listed on his box id hed been told to park his wheels in a space outside the perimeter fence like no one wanted to acknowledge that he had ever been here then hed been taken in a minibus to a prefabricated departure annex he was half dead on his feet had left builth before five reached the airbase a halfhour before dawn and hadnt spoken to either of the other men waiting for the flight call he had almost been asleep when the boss had spoken to him when hed left home to take up the work in wales locked the door of his bedsit in the hostel the police used in bristol he had been wearing clothes that could either be described as rugged or vagrants gear but he had clean socks and underpants that probably stifled most of the smell he looked ragged and felt out of sorts because of it hed noted that the other two had eyed him as if they expected dogshit on his shoes and fleas in his clothing he was unshaven and hadnt run a comb through his hair it was a blackpainted american aircraft with no markings that hed seen the pilot spoke with a drawl and dispensed minimal information how long would they be up wasnt told what was the flights destination wasnt told would there be inflight coffee and a bacon sarnie wasnt told the boss sat in the front seats and across the aisle from him there was a heavyset guy who also had an american twang but a more civilised one than the pilots there wasnt a girl with a coffee jug or anything to eat the remaining passenger foxy had what baxter reckoned was a death pallor and there were nicks on his throat from shaving one had transferred blood to the collar of his clean shirt he wore a blazer and the tie knotted at the collar might have been a military one his hair was neatly cut and brushed his slacks had knife creases and his shoes were polished badger didnt own a blazer had precious few shirts that were smart enough for a tie and the only one of those easily at hand in the hostel would have been black for funerals the man had looked exhausted in the departure area out on his feet and by the time they had been up a halfhour a gentle rhythmic snoring was coming from foxys den badger knew about foxes had often enough lain up in hides at the edge of woodland to watch a remote house the foxes cubs and adults would come close to him and scratch for worms or sniff around him he was fond of them there werent many that danny baxter was fond of his father and mother lived in the shadow of the nuclearwarhead factory at burghfield near reading in berkshire had a bungalow there and a secondhand vehicle business he reckoned the location close to armageddonville meant theyd picked up a property cheap to live in and work from he saw them no more than twice a year and there was nothing of his work he could talk about and nothing of their lives that he was much interested in no one at the hostel would have cared that he was being ferried destination unknown in an executive jet and probably by now his regular oppo the faithful ged would be heading east to leeds in yorkshire where he was based he would be thinking more about how much of his gear he could get into the washingmachine than about where badger was going no woman to care there had been fran frances to her developer father who owned the harbourside flat overlooking the water in the bristol dockland shed been a thirdyear student history of art at the university and might have found him exciting might have craved a bit of rough theyd been together a bit more than six months but it was never going to last no row no flying plates hed left a note for her one day propped on her pillow which had an epic view over the water keep safe have happy times and best luck badger hed loaded up his big bergen and a little rucksack all he owned in the world closed the door locked it put his keys through the letterbox and tripped down the stairs to the little van nondescript that he used and driven out of her life to the hostel a bloody awful exchange but the time had arrived when she might have thought him right for moulding to her style or chucking out he had done it in his own time and at his moment of choosing about the only thing that owned danny badger baxter was the job it ruled him it exerted enough of a pull that he wasnt concerned that no one had told him where they were going when or why the man in front foxy still snored he was woken by the steepness of the descent they had come through the cloud and there was a crosswind but the pilot flew as if he had the controls of a fighter aircraft the lights for beltfastening were late coming on and joe foulkes was jolted forward in his seat damn near catapulting into the back of the one immediately in front the man sitting in it had introduced himself as gibbons hed only given his name to foxy not to the fellow in the back who looked like a tramp waiting for a night shelter to open he hadnt spoken to ellie that morning hadnt wanted to from the prefabricated lounge he hadnt had the bottle to explain he was on a magical mystery journey to god alone knew where and wouldnt be home that night if he had made the call explained he would be absent again he would have listened to the inflections in her voice whether she seemed to regret it whether she was indifferent or unable to disguise a riffle of anticipation because he would be away but he had sent a text tied up workwisecalled awaywill ring when possibleluv massive foxy one had come back before theyd boarded shame missing you love elliexxx his phone was off now would stay that way till whatever wherever whenever had been done he assumed he was to give a lecture what else did he know he knew that the greeter from six might be the man of the moment and in charge but he was shitscared halfway to terrified of flying foxy could see the way the fists held the arms of the seat and the face was white he knew that his best instincts were usually the first ones and he had formed an immediate dislike of badger but that could be managed his own age and seniority would determine they were not equals he would have rank on the younger man whose appearance was simply inappropriate and it was the sort of landing an aircraft might have made on a carriers deck abrupt short on the taxi jerking to a stop the big sign over a distant terminus was just recognisable as prestwick and a helicopter was waiting close by on an empty desert of wet concrete its rotors idled then picked up speed as the lears engines were shut down the pilots came out of their cockpit door and the main man the one whod have had battlefield wings over kuwait or out of da nang spoke briefly to the american passenger he didnt make eye contact with any of the others joe foxy foulkes had several failings but idiocy was not among them the helicopter like the lear was blackpainted he could see no flightdesignation markings and they were a hell of a way from the tower and the prestwick buildings out of sight and out of mind he reckoned this was a flight that had never taken place they came on to the apron and scurried for the chopper the rotors blew rain into their faces and a crewman gave them a hand up into the hatch door they strapped the harnesses into place the military canvas bucket seats and the frames hurt foxys thighs it was years since he had been in the close confines of a helicopters cabin with the noise growing until the ear baffles were passed to them hadnt been in a helicopter since leaving the base at basra after a fourmonth tour seven years back a shitty place horrible and a man who might have been middle eastern stared at him warily and didnt respond to foxys cautious smile short darkhaired swarthy and stinking of cigarettes the six man gibbons had tried to take the fellows hand but it had stayed buried in a pocket the other taller and paleskinned with curly blond hair lolling comfortably and chewing gum was late thirties or early forties foxy recognised the military uniform of mufti a doublebreasted navy suit with a prominent stripe black ankle boots and a waxed jacket that might have been useful out on a moor the eyes seemed distant and didnt focus on trivia such as what foxy wore badgers messy hair or the white knuckles of the six man they lifted sharply they were in cloud buffeted by winds and the pilot made no effort to get below the weather above or round it they rocked and shook and foxy wondered if the intelligence officer might throw up he played games in his mind a business heavy in secrecy and international flavours it reeked of deniability he supposed that at six if they planned a deniable operation they dusted down a cardboard file that would have been written in the fifties or sixties and dictated a quiet remote location suitable for briefings lectures and the mull of kintyre helicopter crash had taken the lives of police and intelligence officers from northern ireland who were heading for a meeting at a garrison camp close to inverness the various arms had needed to be brought to neutral territory if jealousies and conceits were not to stymie cooperation perhaps tensions and stress points were yet to be revealed foxy almost chuckled the beast seemed to stumble through the cloud then it might have been thirty minutes after takeoff light flooded through the small porthole windows and rain distorted the view but foxy made out the shape of a castle keep in grey stone that matched the cloud there was more grey from the breaking waves in a bay and from the stones on a geometrically curved beach back from the sand and shingle a field was half flooded and behind it a grand house on three floors with a portico could they not have booked a house in southwest london or anywhere north of the capital but closer it spoke of delusions they were down but the engines were not killed he was last out of the hatch and the crewman steadied him as he jumped clear the others were ahead and hurried between the puddles towards the main entrance where the rendering was chipped out in front moving easily and lightfooted was badger the american and the foreigner kept pace with him foxy felt the rotors pressure blasting him from behind and staggered as the beast anonymous and black rose again and headed back over the bay gibbons was beside him why this place foxy might have nudged a hint of sarcasm into his tone the outside of the edifice seemed to drip water from roof gullies and guttering and he expected that half as much again would be falling through the ceilings into the salons and bedrooms he held tightly to his bag and thanked the lord he always packed more socks smalls and shirts than he anticipated needing all of them had overnight bags except badger who likely stank and would be higher by the evening not down to me he who pays the piper calls the tune know what i mean he blinked in the rain i dont all in good time foxy if you dont mind the familiarity its always best if names are in short supply our esteemed colleague from the agency is paying the piper the americans are doing the logistics which means their bucket of dollars is deeper than our biscuit tin of sterling its the sort of place that appeals to them and people live here survive here there is a life form in the inner hebrides that probably needs to huddle for comfort in the kitchen im assured we wont be disturbed by the family truth is for this one the piper needs quite a bit of paying because its not the sort of thing monday through friday we usually do lets get out of this bloody weather they went in through the high double doors but no warmth greeted them foxy had good eyes and a good memory and his power of observation in poor light was excellent he noted the washingup bowl in the centre of the tiled floor the portrait of a villainouslooking kilted warrior above the first bend in the stairs the faded pattern on the couch that the paint was off all the doors the smell of dogs and overcooked vegetables an older man in earnest conversation with the american and a woman with bent shoulders a thick sweater and a bob of silver hair the rain beat on the door behind them water dripped into the washingup bowl and badger sat on the bottom stair showing no interest in anything around him foxy noted all of it the voice of the greeter was soft in his ear their grandson was scots guards in iraq attached to special forces didnt survive the tour theyd want to help and as i said the americans have a deep bucket improvised explosive device on the alkut road youre going to hear a bit about improvised explosive devices but im getting ahead of myself foxy said vacuously i have some experience but this should be interesting the man laughed without mirth and foxy couldnt see what had been funny about his remark about anything to do with improvised explosive devices when the engineer worked in his laboratory or was on the factory floor checking the craftsmanship of the machinetool work he could escape from the enormity of the crisis that had settled on him it was like the snowclouds that built up over the mountains beyond tehran when winter came when he played with the children he could briefly think himself free when he walked on the track in front of his home and watched the birds hovering swirling and wafting there were moments when the load seemed to slip away when he was at his bench working on the use of more ceramic material to replace metal parts and negate the majority of the portable detectors when he was out on the long straight tracks that had been bulldozed beyond the camp into wilderness and studied the capability of his radio messages to beat the electronics deployed against him he sometimes forgot the moments never lasted there was laughter rarely and there were smiles sometimes and there were those times that the work was successful beyond dreams countermeasures failed detonation was precise and a target was destroyed in testing but every time the cloud formed again and the pleasure of achievement was wiped out he could see the evergrowing weakness in his wife the depth of her tiredness and could watch the bravery with which she put on a show of normality she was dying and the process would each day be faster the end nearer he could not acknowledge it to her but he realised his fingers were clumsier and his thoughts more muddled he suffered he couldnt picture a future if when she was taken only once had he called in the debts owed him by the revolution of when the ayatollah had left paris and flown back to his people he had been nine years old and had watched the television with his father who taught mathematics in susangerd as the imam khomeini had come slowly down the aircrafts steps he had been three years older and had wept when his father had dragged him back into their home he had been about to join the child volunteers who would be given the key to paradise in exchange for clearing the minefields laid by the iraqi enemy making safe passage for the revolutionary guard corps and the basij militia his father had locked him into a room and not permitted him to leave the house for a week he had gone back to school and there had been many empty places in the classroom it had been said that when they had ran across mined ground they were killed by the explosions their body parts scattered that rats and foxes had come to eat pieces of their flesh it had also been said that on the third day of the clearance operation the children his friends from school had been told to wrap themselves in rugs and roll across the dirt so that their bodies stayed together were easier to collect after the line had moved forward he resented not having a plastic key to paradise he did not believe the lie of foreigners that a halfmillion had been imported at a discount rate for bulk from a taiwan factory he had been twentytwo years old a secondyear student of electronic engineering at the shahid chamran university in ahvaz when his father had died the martyr mostafa chamran educated in the united states and with a phd in electrical engineering had fallen on the front line and was revered as a leader and a fighter there had been many around him to whom rashid could look for inspiration living and dead he was the regimes child and its servant and he had gone where he was directed to university in europe and to the camps in his country where his talents could be most useful on workbenches this once he had called in the debt in the afternoon he would be on the road that led away from ahvaz towards behbahan a new shipment of americanmade dualtone multifrequency equipment had come via the roundabout route of kuala lumpur then jakarta and he would test it for longdistance detonations the americans almost had gone from iraq but it was the engineers duty to prepare the devices that would destroy any military advance into iran by their troops he would be late home but her mother was there the message had come by courier the evening before neither he nor his wife ever used a mobile telephone in fact the engineer never spoke on any telephone no voice trace of rashid armajan existed others communicated for him from his workshop and he used encrypted email links messages of importance were brought by courier from the alquds brigade garrison camp outside ahvaz one had come the previous evening he and naghmeh should be prepared to leave within the week final arrangements were being confirmed he was not forgotten was honoured the state and the revolution recognised him at his workbench out of sight of others he prayed in gratitude was there anything another doctor a superior consultant could offer would a long journey weaken her further and bring on the end but the courier had brought a message that gave hope he saw death on internet screens and from recordings on mobile phones the killings were caused by his own skills he lost no sleep over that knowledge but had not slept well since the tehran doctors verdict when he had seen the bleakness in their eyes now hope small existed they would be in gods care before we concentrate on the individual who has brought us together today who and where he is theres something id like you both to respond to first you foxy in your long surveillance career what was your most satisfying achievement it was of course a trick question and it was not unique to len gibbons hed heard it put twice during his thirtyfive years at six in seminars when individuals were being evaluated the answer usually revealed much about the subject they were sitting in a horseshoe on hard chairs and no notes were taken but away to the side a board was balanced against the back of an armchair covered with a drape he sat at the extreme left and had introduced himself as len the american was the cousin and the israeli from unit of military intelligence was the friend there was foxy and there was badger and between them the tall handsome suited man the major there had been time for them to go to allocated rooms have a tepid wash meet a pack of jack russells and spaniels and drink instant coffee from petrolstation mugs then gibbons had shepherded them into what might have been a ballroom no water came through this ceiling where the main furniture was cloaked in dustsheets but at the far end to the left of a huge unlit fireplace there was a small table with a vase of flowers on it and a silverframed photograph of a young face smiling above a guardsmans ceremonial tunic gibbons thought it appropriate and would refer to it he had set out the chairs while the others were on the first floor had borrowed enough from the dining room he had gone to the sister service across the river the box the antiterrorist command and the branch the box had come up with badger and special branch had said that joe foxy foulkes was the only one worth considering it was a good question because it gave a man enough rope either to climb to a higher level or to hang himself he saw foxy a capable man with a number of successes behind him stiffen well he would be evaluating the audience of gibbons the cousin and the friend and wondering what badgers take on it would be gibbons knew the record of foxy foulkes a policeman of thirtythree years a nineyear spell with special branch four months in basra and a further seven years of lecturing in the arts of covert rural surveillance he was a man who expected to be listened to and was foxys tongue flipped over his lips to moisten them gibbons saw that the tie was straightened which bought another few seconds then a cough to clear the throat the man was dependent on his instinct foxy said in a good clear voice as if they were his students satisfying yes interesting one thereve been a few more than a few could be when i was with the branch and we were doing the business on two iranian attaches on a manchester visit theyd made twice before our stakeout was on a golf course and there was snow on the ground i had a youngster with me didnt know his arse from his elbow and we came in close enough to see the drops on their noses when they did their contact a muslim kid working in the clubs kitchens we did the approach so that not a flake of snow was disturbed within the arc of their vision yes that was a pretty good one and early in my time with west yorkshire we had a budding pira cell on our patch the irish were clever by then and knew the procedures they had a meeting and stood out in the middle of a football pitch there was no way we could get close enough with a directional microphone i had the answer i picked the lock of the groundsmans hut took out the line marker after filling it with the white stuff and went right round them then did the goal areas by the time they were used to me i pushed the marker right up the halfway line and they actually apologised for being in my way and stepped aside theyd been swapping phone numbers so we had those and bust them up and another i did a hide in county tyrone up by the village of cappagh which was difficult country populated with very difficult and very suspicious people the hide was in a hedgerow and looked into a cattle barn where a barrett calibre was hidden we thought it needed the human touch not a remote camera id dug the hide out and the first afternoon a sheep got caught in the hedge not fifteen yards from me the farmer a committed provo considered reliable enough to have responsibility for the weapon came up to free the ewe he walked right over my hide and his wellington boots would have been less than two feet from my face in the camouflage headgear it was an exceptional hide and we were able to report when the weapon was moved but the military werent fast enough and lost its tail anyway they were three of the best did the man expect a ripple of applause he might have done and if so was disappointed the cousin gazed at the ceiling the friend at the floor the major had been paring his nails but now reached down to the case resting against his ankles and started to ferret in it len gibbons wished fervently that sarah was there with her competence and reassurance it was ridiculous that the players should have been carted up to this pile of old stone but the cousin must have felt this to be a onceinalifetime opportunity for baronial glory and the friend had demanded remote anonymity he thought the old couple would be rattling around in another wing and had learned that a divorced daughter lived with them she would have been the mother of the officer killed by a roadside bomb and he wondered what delicacies would be provided at the lunch break time to ask the other man the question designed to disrobe expose thank you foxy very comprehensive so badger what in your professional career are the achievements that give you most satisfaction the man looked straight at him unwavering eyes direct and challenging none boss and i dont send herograms to myself silence len gibbons realised hed win nothing more from the younger man no point in demanding it and he thought badger had played with foxys ego tossed it up into the air let it fall on the bare patch of carpet and ground a heel on it the veteran had laid out the depth of his experience put it in a showcase so that the rookie boy was bound to fall short each had done well and like two dogs theyd circled each other hitched up a back leg and pissed on the available lampposts he wondered how they would do together gibbons said a difficult moment now confronts us we will soon enter realms of great secrecy you will have seen its quality the secrecy this place your journey here you both come with your praises sung but after we begin the briefing process its too late for one of you to say i dont think i really want to pull the shirt on for this game put crudely you either piss now or get off the pot are you in gentlemen or out foxy first are you staying or going youve put me in a difficult position i dont know what youre asking of me im a married man the wrong side of fifty id have appreciated the chance to talk to my wife but im staying and you badger i go where im sent again there was a spark in the young bucks face and a short wintry grin gibbons said it starts now with a young woman callsign echo foxtrot and those are the initials of eternal flame which some colleagues call her because the eternal flame never goes out its a little joke a joke because its so inappropriate in her case shes out a great deal more often than is usually sensible step by step gentlemen but well start with her and shell lead us to the meat so echo foxtrot for her and for the guys with her known to her inner circle those entrusted with lifeanddeath confidences as the jones boys it was a halfhour of maximum danger they had been at the roadside in the shade of some trees in excess of thirty minutes their two suvs pajeros from mitsubishis factories in japan were battered and abused they looked like heaps of sandscarred rusted crap but the armourplated chassis doors and windows were hidden from any but the most persistent observer the vehicles were off the road but the engines murmured and their weapons were armed she stood nearest to the road and the dust from lorries wheels and pickups flew on to her burqah the yank was harding and the irishman corky they were close to her khaffiyeh s draped round their faces and covering their hair they had on dirty jeans and jackets weighed down with grenades and gas in the inside pockets each had a pistol at the hip held in by his belt in the pajeros with heavier firepower on the empty front passenger seats were shagger the welshman and the scot they called hamfist they were employees of proeliator security a private military contracting company and were paid to be bodyguards to abigail jones a six girl without them and their show of grudging loyalty she would have earned the title eternal flame the one that never goes out she was far from her secure base in baghdads green zone or the premises at the basra airport complex because she trusted with a degree of fatalistic humour the jones boys dedication the quality of their noses and their understanding of when stupidity overtook duty she did not deal with them on a needtoknow basis but talked each move through with them so that hamfist shagger corky and harding were privy to the secrets of the six operation that had now run for some two years ever since an unexploded device had been recovered and subjected to analysis for the uniqueness of a mans deoxyribonucleicacid deposits she had been permitted two fourmonth extensions of her posting almost unique but she hoped to see the operation to its conclusion to have a part in its death the jones boys would be on the ground as long as she was it was a commercial relationship that had become family but they called her miss or maam and took no liberties of familiarity each time though that she went out and they hit the road she took care to explain where they went and why now it was to meet an informant he hadnt shown there should have been approaching through the mirage mist of the road a motor scooter with an old man astride it the heat would have distorted their first view of him from perhaps a mile down the straight highway and as it had cleared they would have known him by the matted grey beard many months before the informant had gone through the marshes and along the berms crossing them with the papers in his pocket to identify himself as a resident of the ahvaz arab community on the far side of the frontier the scooter had been left well hidden and he had walked waded where there was still water in the lagoons and had cut old reed fronds to make a broom for sweeping he had cleaned a road and a pavement pocketing cigarette butts strewn behind a man who smoked as stress gripped him a few days before the relative by marriage of the cleaner had travelled as a pillion passenger on the same scooter with two baskets of dates he had had similar identification papers forged but good enough to pass a check by iranian police border guards even men of an alquds brigade detachment posted for the security of a valued man he had asked vague questions in a coffee shop had had gossip answers and had overheard enough of a conversation to win the glowing smile of abigail jones echo foxtrot a fistful of dollars had been paid to the informants for the retrieval of the used cigarette filters and for a snatch of talk she thought it most likely that either the informant and his relative had decided they had made enough money for their needs had been intercepted and robbed had unwisely shown a glimpse of riches in a coffee house or had boasted and been heard by any of the myriad ali babas who lived in what was left of the marsh wilderness shit she said but it was good while it lasted enough hardings eyes raked the road has to be maam corky wilting in the heat of over a hundred degrees said too long miss that weve been here shit so the heroes coming from home will have it all to do for themselves without a local hand to steady them no guys dont tell me this is lunatic theyll have to go in there and do the business on their own shit she walked to the lead pajero the two vehicles pulled off the dirt and on to the road accelerating fast five miles down the road towards basra city they saw a huddle of men and a police car an ambulance was coming towards them they would not slacken their speed and their faces were covered to hide the pale caucasian features as were the automatic weapons loaded and with the safetys off easy to see a small scooter on the sand beside the tarmacadam a body with its head covered but new shoes exposed they would have cost in the city what a man survived on in the marshes for a month a second body was covered except for the head with its grey beard corky beside shagger said quietly so they got greedy and were bumped my thinking maam they were lucky if the bastards of the vevak had picked them up then to get robbed and shot would have seemed a blessing the shoes will be gone before they get put in the ambulance wont go to waste but you had your moneys worth out of them she did not respond under her codename echo foxtrot she had her satphone out of her bag and was tapping out the numbers badger listened as the call was wound up no im not suggesting theres anything else that can be done i appreciate were not talking about a flat tyre or an empty tank i accept also your assurance that neither party would have been where hostiles could lift them paid too much pretty ironic if you try to buy a man and end up going over the top of his avarice quotient but it is still possible to go forward with this its a setback but not terminal we are still on course i value the reassurance you will of course be given travel itineraries as soon as thank you stay safe please it was not possible as badger saw it to conceal rank disappointment it was in the bosss voice as he spoke softly into the receiver they had all watched him they were the sort of men himself and foxy the cousin the friend and the major who made an art form of studying weakness setbacks badger briefly let his imagination wander to the big map on the board propped on the easy chair that the major had unveiled before uttering that first sentence changed the outcome of a war from a triumphant that contact a remote clipped accent somewhere along highway between alamara and basra probably near the town of alqurnah all marked on the map and linked by a ribbon of red where the tigris and the euphrates met fuelled his understanding of the heat the hatred and the sheer danger of the place the boss sat very still and seemed to ponder then he shook his head as if to clear his mind and pocketed the phone he said i can promise you gentlemen that in this matter you will not get halftruths and evasions from me in the business that confronts us we had a hope of local resources but no longer so it is in our hands alone which is probably a disappointment but perhaps a blessing i apologise major for the interruption please they were no longer fighting cocks badger reflected not pirouetting or prancing in rivals faces linkage with a faraway place had rendered that sort of pride secondrate on the map he could see the road the line of an international border the symbols of lakes and marshlands and the major breathed in hard as if his mood also was altered before the call he had started by saying that improvised explosive devices had changed the outcome of a war from a triumphant and victorious mission accomplished to something that was close to mirroring ignominious retreat then the phone had trilled in the bosss suit pocket and the major had stood silent while the call was answered the frown had set in his forehead and he had scratched the back of his neck back to where i began the improvised explosive device is the weapon that has snatched victory from the coalition and replaced it with a very fair imitation of defeat its a poor mans weapon deadlier and more influential than the famed kalashnikov rifle i would like to quote from kipling a scrimmage in a border station a canter down some dark defile two thousand pounds of education drops to a tenrupee jezail the crammers boast the squadrons pride shot like a rabbit in a ride written more than a century ago i suggest that the education was heftily expensive and that ten rupees in the bazaar at jalalabad or peshawar bought something pretty cheap nothing has changed we take the modern tenrupee jezail thats a longbarrelled flintlock or matchlock rifle extremely seriously how seriously between and next year the united states defence family will spend in excess of thirty billion dollars yes you heard me on all aspects of research to negate the effectiveness of these devices from scanners to detectors and into the world of vehicles that can survive an attack i said in excess of thirty billion dollars and the principal parts of such a weapon can be bought for five or ten dollars in any iraqi souk more sophisticated parts are brought into the middle east from american factories its a bewildering crazy world the most sensitive devices deployed in iraq were to beat our strategy of putting a convoy inside an electronic countermeasures bubble that has a safety range of around a hundred metres the enemy developed the technology of sitting off maybe a kilometre away and using combinations of passive infrared and telemetry modules and even such simple kit as carkey zappers household alarms the workings from inside a cheap wristwatch bought off a pavement stall right now in iran theyre ahead of the countermeasures the roadside bombs often deployed in a daisychain configuration thats half a dozen devices linked over a couple of hundred metres or in fake rocks made of papiermache or replacement kerb stones create fear among troops for every fatality they knock down four five six wounded they destroy morale and drive our armies into overhead flights by helicopter or overland drives in a truck with plate armour sides then along came the efp the explosive force projectile which costs next to nothing to build and can destroy a main battle tank worth ten million sterling the efps crushed us and the cousin said i know all this i dont need a highschool lecture the friend said we have experience of this it is taught in military kindergarten the majors eyes narrowed its gratifying that some of you are so well informed is anyone not familiar with efps anyone foxy said he had served in southern iraq and shrugged and the boss smiled limply as if to show he was up to speed badger said ive never heard of an efp and if you think i should know and itll be important when you get around to explaining this business then im all ears thank you badger does anyone want to go and make coffee or walk in the rain no he paused he was a handsome man and would have fitted in on horse guards or anywhere else in full dress uniform danny badger baxter understood there had been a time when hed been on a week of stags watching a remote parked caravan where a nutcase guy was thought to be building a device to use against a supermarket chain when the guy was picked up the bombdisposal people had moved in above the suit the laundered shirt and the smart tie badger had recognised the bleak worn gaze maybe the boss the cousin and the friend didnt know about the people who did bomb disposal and made things safe to be different was badgers thing right then ill continue the efp involves a shaped charge and we call that the munroe effect charles e munroe an american worked out the theory of the shaped charge a hundred and twenty years ago while stationed at the rhode island base where they had a naval torpedo station jozsef misnay and hubert schardian made refinements as they developed antitank weapons for the wehrmacht in the s there is a metal tube with a shallow copper bowl factorymachined at one end and behind it explosives perhaps military or perhaps triacetone triperoxide a detonator a trigger apparatus and a method of sending the signal for firing the copper becomes a molten slug travelling at a thousand yards per second and will penetrate the armour of a tank a personnel carrier pretty much any vehicle on wheels or tracks the efps are deployed at predictable choke points where a road goes from four lanes to two where theres a bridge an elevated highway or repair work the devices have been tested thoroughly across the frontier and inside iran the range of the radio signals will have been determined and dickers will have been used on the iraq side to watch the procedures used by the coalition and to report back on them several times the convoy will have gone by not knowing it was under electronic surveillance and the results sent back across the frontier theyre in no hurry they have endless patience they test and experiment and dont move until theyre satisfied still with me what could they say the boss nodded the cousin and the friend forced a smile foxy shrugged badger said sharply with you the major said and im coming to the core this is a peasants weapon i repeat its a peasants weapon to deploy to activate to see it kill and mutilate but it is not a peasant who builds the electronics that run ahead of the countermeasures or who oversees the factory where the shallow copper dish is milled to high standards the view is peddled by the pentagon and the mod that the bombmaker is a lowlife raghead who deals in very basic science concepts such assessments are dangerous misleading and wrong a small number of clever innovative men is capable of wrongfooting us so consistently that the bodybags keep going home and the injured with wounds theyll carry to their graves this particular individual rashid armajan is a man whose professionalism i would have reluctantly to respect we know him also by the title given him by his employers and on the base where he works he is the engineer because i have looked at these people i feel free to offer a stereotypical image of him with some confidence his family would be of huge importance to him alongside that we can say that religion is a major motivation along with a profound love of his country hes a perfectionist and with that comes personal egotism he believes himself the best religion and nationalism give him the right to butcher the troops of the great satan and the little satan anyone on the wrong side of gods will im not exaggerating if i say that this one individual is responsible in no small degree for the foulup that is the coalition campaign in iraq and dont forget how many casualties killed and wounded were caused by roadside bombs we call an enemy a bravo rashid armajan is a big bad bravo and we should take every opportunity to locate him and the clap of the bosss hands cut off the major in midsentence badger had been concentrating and hadnt anticipated the interruption then as if satisfied that he had eye contact with the major the boss softened thank you very much major for that comprehensive and thorough study of our target its time for a break and a sandwich a frown settled on badgers forehead and he thought vaguely that part of an agenda had slipped by him as if it flowed through a separate channel his mind moved on because he had seen tv clips of the hospitals clinics and rehabilitation centres where the amputees were taken and of men struggling to hop along a corridor of parallel supports he thought that after the sandwich he would be told what the mission was and what was expected of him she told her mother what had been agreed the children were at school and would not be home for two hours her husband had been driven at dawn to the laboratory workbench in darker moments she would have said she competed with soldering irons circuit boards little silver detonators alarm devices and mansoor who oversaw the security at their home had seen her husband taken away and the escort car that had followed and would now be in his room in the barracks she walked with a stick held in her right fist and her mother supported her left arm she did not care that the sun was high and burned her face perspiration dribbled under the loose black robe and the scarf was tight round her head she could feel inside the material and pressed against the bone the size of the growth she said her husband refused to accept the verdict of the doctors in tehran her mother walked with her would not interrupt she said that her husband had demanded of senior officials that she be allowed to leave the country and visit a more advanced centre of medicine that funds be made available for such a journey and that arrangements be made for her to travel they walked past the lagoon in front of their home birds flew low over the water and skimmed the tips of the reeds the light played on the ripples where fish fed at the surface she said that her work with the mineclearance programme was not finished and that if she was snatched away the deadly beasts would continue to take lives and maim children she told her mother that rashid could barely contemplate life without her she urged her mother now in her sixtyfifth year to look after the children if then she smiled and declared she had faith in the consultant she would see where she did not know when she had not been told her mother cried softly and the wife of the bombmaker who organised the clearing of old minefields for which there were no charts tried to hold her smile it had to be soon she said that the arrangements were made because she did not believe she had much time she was in gods hands and with her would be her husband the only man she had loved a good man she thought the ibis the most beautiful bird that flew over the reeds as it turned towards the raised island beyond them to naghmeh it was frail and vulnerable so delicate and she scanned the skies for the eagles that swooped on the ibis in his experience men who had been at risk of assassination for months or years became careless when they first believed themselves important enough to be targets of their enemy they would slink in the shadows but few could sustain the effort also when the target was away from his base and the familiar streets where the safehouses were he would consider himself untouchable and go to cafes or restaurants if he were flush with his organisations cash he would sleep with his mistress in a hotel hire a car and to bring his mistress from sidon in lebanon and fly her on a budget airline to malta international and have her share his double room in a waterfront hotel in sliema was careless the man was not a fighter but a strategist and a tactician and some in the higher echelons of unit intelligence gathering believed he was among the principal architects of the hidden tunnels and underground strong points from which a bloodletting had been wreaked on the israeli defence force among the bare harsh hills in the south of lebanon where the common border was a target did not have to be a fighter to be a strategist or a tactician was cause enough for a file to be lifted down and put into the tray of high priority when an asset told of an extramarital affair the name of a mistress and her travel bookings few informants were governed by ideology and principle many were alert to good payment the target would have left the girl in bed she would have screwed him until hed wondered whether he was close to a coronary then he would have pushed her off showered and walked to the internet cafe there he would have finalised a meeting with a colleague now based in tunis and another in rome and walked back to the hotel when unit went to war it was not with a straitened budget an aircraft loitered outside maltese air space and held together the facets of the operation the controller in the air was in communication with the slight young man who stood near to the taxi rank in front of the hotel like any other hopeful stud waiting for his girl at the end of the esplanade a motorcycle engine was ticking over the rider helmeted with a second helmet on his lap along the coast two or three kilometres a highpowered launch was moored as a concrete jetty further out to sea on the edge of the radar horizon a merchant ship registered in the port of haifa was on course for a rendezvous on occasion the unit used a mobile phone loaded with enough military explosive to destroy the side of a mans head when he answered a call or they might have built a bomb into the headrest of the drivers seat in a car or put one under the nearside front wheel they might attack with a commando squad of up to eight men or there would be a single assassin with a short range barak sp short recoiloperated and lockedbreech pistol with fifteen mm rounds in the magazine only two would be used the target came close he was careless enough not to see the young man wearing a nondescript grey tshirt lightweight windcheater and faded jeans ease away from the lamppost and wave to somebody down the road behind his target who did not look over his shoulder so did not see that no one was there carelessness killed two shots to the head one through an eye socket and one into the brain via the canal behind the ear as the target stiffened went rigid then sagged to the ground the target was in death spasms tourists and hotel staff ran up then stood petrified as the blood came close to their feet the young man was gone and the motorcycle stolen three days earlier powered away in the marina a launch revved its engines the older men who had planned the killing believed that a message was given when a body bled on a pavement and that such a message was always worth sending youre good the friend asked fine thank you foxy answered looking forward though to finding out whats asked of me we wouldnt be in this circus ring if it wasnt considered important itd be more respectful if a man of my experience was brought inside the loop rather faster than this foxy had done enough buffet lunches to be able to balance a glass of mineral water and a plate of sandwiches the friend smiled with ice in his eyes hed met israeli counterterrorist officials at special branch meetings with suicide bombers on the days agenda and had thought them unemotional uncommunicative untrusting and above all arrogant hed heard it said by a branch veteran that the answer was to get them into a bar and force drink down their throats until they pissed their pants without knowing it then they might behave as human beings as colleagues youll hear soon enough when you need to know youll know if i dont like what i hear itll be goodbye and ill be at the bus stop waiting for transport home with a broken leg perhaps a broken neck whatever needs to be broken to prevent you walking out of here walking out you lost the chance hours ago does the rain stop do they grow rice here youll know soon enough and then i guarantee youll be frightened and so will your young colleague hes not a colleague i know damnall about him you will youll learn everything about him everything and be frightened together fear is good it bonds men and makes them effective i think well go on and then youll understand why were in this shitheap and whats required of you be brave foxy never before had he been spoken to by a foreignagency officer as if he were of similar importance to a drinks waiter his shoulder was smacked water spilled from the glass and the israeli smiled coldly he must have flinched and he thought badger would have seen him take that step back they were led again into the briefing room he believed the friend he didnt want to but he believed that the time for quitting was long past and that fear would be justified chapter to foxy it was choreographed nothing was here by chance it was as if they had both himself and badger been manoeuvred towards the proposition and it had been done quickly like he supposed a good hanging was with a pretence of casualness times have changed things are different the cousin said who can be trusted never many but now the number has shrunk the friend said what ive learned you want a job done well you get your own people to do it then you know youre in the best hands the boss gibbons said they had been together in the afternoon and the cousin had talked an accent that was distant tyres on gravel pronounced but not harsh and had shifted awkwardly on the chair he seemed to come alive when he spoke of the marshlands east and west of alqurnah and north and south of the town the drought there the dried cracked mud and stagnant pools where water no longer flowed because of the great dams built far to the north in turkey syria and iran he spoke of a cradle of civilisation and the location of the garden of eden did it well of cultures that stretched back several millennia and a people who had been bombed gassed hit with napalm jelly and driven from their homes then on to ratruns and the smugglers trails along which the padded crates brought the bombs into iraq through doors left ajar and along corridors with stone floors came the wail of a kettle boiling that would have been the signal to the triumvirate boss friend cousin that business should have been done praise from the boss youre both the best in your field excellent and professional admiration from the friend your files tell us youre of high quality this is not work for men at the second level the proposition from the cousin we can identify gentlemen the targets location hes about two kilometres inside iran hes protected but hes about to travel away from his guards we dont know where or when hes going we think are pretty sure that you are the guys wholl give us the answers thats what were asking of you be there watch listen and tell us what you see and hear he was the older man predictable that their eyes should bead on him first he could see had adequate eyesight and wore glasses only for close work or with binoculars he could listen because six and the agency and whatever gang the israeli was signed up to would have topoftherange audio equipment and he was almost fluent in farsi not interpreter standard but the level down from that it would have been the language that had ticked boxes when they had trawled the files he had also rusty but never forgotten the skills of a man trained in the techniques of covert rural surveillance he had served a few days less than four months on attachment to the joint forces intelligence team at the shaibah logistics base where the questioning had been robust or in more legal phrasing had involved coercive interrogation techniques his breath came harder and almost he realised whistled through his teeth did he want to go did he hell where did he want to be the map was fastened with drawing pins to the board then propped against the back of the chair a dull ceiling light economy bulbs fell on it nowhere near east or west of highway or near the hawr al hammar marshes or within spitting distance of those turgid stinking cesspool rivers and the towns that smelt more of human excrement than of donkey shit he wriggled on the hard seat of the chair he was given no help would have gone down on his knees in gratitude if hed heard of course foxy this is just a fishing exercise and if you dont want to bite well forget you were ever here in the cousin the friend and the boss he saw no mercy if he had been given further explanations perhaps on the physicality of the operation he might have been able to peddle excuses about the state of his hips his ankles or the cramps he was subject to at night but his file would have stated that his condition was first class the product of gym work and once a week an hours crosscountry he would have liked to be at home with a malt in a crystal glass and ellie in the kitchen maybe humming to herself he would have liked to be at a seminar in a mess or at a conference maybe in wiesbaden or madison wisconsin with a spotlight on him and his words heard respectfully he wondered how long they would let him writhe before coming to his aid look foxy if youre not up for crawling in the shit across the iraq and iran border with a directional microphone your language skills and that little creep alongside to carry the gear you only have to say so and therell be no criticism of you the room was at the corner of the building and the wind caught against the stone and howled the branches of an overgrown shrub lashed the windowpanes the wind came through and lifted the curtains and there was the sound of waves on shingle two small truths gnawed at him first ellie his wife of six years was less often in the kitchen now and his dinner was more likely to come from the microwave also the chance of sex had become remote the second truth was that the invitations to talk and lecture and address were fewer and now he never had to concern himself with two clashing on one date allowing a pall of silence to hover was a tactic used at the logistics base by the interrogators of the joint forward intelligence team foxy as the interpreter had played the game silence disturbed men he didnt know how to break clear beside him the quiet was broken the voice of the young man fucked foxy im assuming im next to be asked sos we dont mess around till christmas im on thats it smiles broke their faces and there was light in their eyes as they reached to shake badgers hand the cousin and the boss had to stretch across foxy if the bastard had asked about the positioning of backup what fee would be paid and how much upfront what the insurance aspect would be foxy might have been able to keep the wriggle going and find a sticking point too late sounds important sounds necessary he thought himself truly skewered managed a thin smile im taking it that the ground works been done im on board of course his hand was shaken the heavy fist of the cousin the light lingering touch of the friend and the cursory grip of the boss none of the bastards thanked him it was like hed jumped a river and there was no going back he assumed they were unable to put a drone over a house and a barracks inside iran and that they didnt trust locally employed assets or didnt have them the three sat back and badgers arms were folded across his chest he seemed relaxed gibbons said i think we might take a break now tea and hopefully cake plenty after that to push on with i said i was accepting your offer but there are matters outstanding what matters he hesitated could have done with badgers support but was denied it no damned response felt the loneliness for a start whats the backup very adequate and youll be well briefed on it before youre inserted is that all im getting its enough at this stage tea will be waiting he blurted the business of remuneration well where were being asked to go am i not entitled to know the recompense the cousin said we were under the impression that you were still foxy a serving police officer therefore salaried and liable for full pension if you care to quit and take it probably theres an overseas per diem allowance disability stuff and widows entitlements in the package id say youre well looked after the friend said your remuneration is a great deal healthier than anything my government wants to or would be able to pay the boss said if youre having trouble in the cash area foxy i can always arrange for a diversion on the way to the airport via headley court youll get a chance to talk to amputees victims of ieds and efps and see them learning to walk again or eating with artificial aids you can discuss disability payments your money and a soldiers wage badger gazed at him no contempt there but a dry smile i was just checking because of my wife because of ellie tea would go down well thank you for your understanding i suppose ill want to learn about the target his security and he touched her hand there were few gestures of intimacy between them when they could be observed he did not care then that her mother watched as he let his fingers fall on her wrist he saw the thinness of her arm under his fingers he didnt care that mansoor the security officer eyed them dark thoughts flitted in his mind he could imagine her mother making love to her father when he was still alive she had comforting weight about her hips and stomach warm against a man a sparkle in her eyes he couldnt imagine this for mansoor who limped from the rocket fired by the americans drone mansoors wife worked as a typist for the intelligence officer in the guard corps barracks the crate camp garrison off the ahvaz to mahshar road he had never seen her without her burqah mansoor seemed devoid of tenderness and without the need for a woman rashid the engineer yearned to celebrate triumphs with his woman underneath him her nails in his back and her small squeals in his ear not loud enough to wake the children when his work in the factory and on the testing ground went well or when she cleared a minefield sown three decades earlier or gained new funding from the provincial government they would not lie again together he did not believe that medical success could be snatched abroad but he had demanded it he smiled weakly he said that very soon he would have the detail of where they would travel and the name of the expert she would visit he went again to read to their children and tell them more of the three princes the story was about lions that terrorised a farmers oxen and how prince korshid took the harnesses from the oxen captured the lions harnessed them to the plough worked them and freed them they went back to the hills and left the farmer in peace it was a story his children loved he saw the sad way naghmeh watched him sitting in her chair with her mother beside her her eyes never off him there had once been a girl in budapest where he had studied who had terrified him with her openness memories of her and of that time reared more often now that he could only watch his wifes growing fragility he would do what he could he would fight bluster and argue for her but he had no faith in the miracle required when they travelled it was interdiction badger had heard the word spoken twice the evening session had been given to the friend the israeli had talked of the alquds brigade its place in the ranks of the iranian revolutionary guard corps its influence in gaza and south lebanon its authority throughout iran the discipline commitment and elitism of its members he had talked like an academic a schoolmaster and had not used the rhetoric of an enemy combatant it was relevant hugely so because the home of the target was under the protection of both the border guards and the alquds crowd they lived beside the small garrison barracks because his wife naghmeh was influential on a steering committee dedicated to mine clearance along the frontier her work would suffer if she was shut away in a guarded compound far from the ground where the personnel and tank mines had been laid where children and adults died or were mutilated as regularly as once a week he talked well was interesting and did not demean his enemy he spoke of him with dislike but not contempt vilified his cruelty admired his commitment and gave respect and if they whatever organisation the friend represented knew so much why did they not themselves provide surveillance expertise badger had been to a moderateperforming school on the outskirts of reading and had left with qualifications only slightly better than mediocre he had been idle and unmotivated had not gone to university lack of formal education did not make him a fool why did not the friends crowd do it themselves simple they would have wanted a broad church a coalition of the willing they were akin to bookmakers who laid off the risk of financial calamity by slicing up big wagers it had been a good talk then supper no alcohol a meal that must have chilled in the kitchens because it was hardly edible it was brought in by the house owner the grandfather of a dead soldier and left on a sideboard most had not finished their plate of the main dish stringly beef boiled vegetables and heavy gravy some had toyed and the boss hadnt tried but badger had done well he wasnt fussy about his food hed heard little hisses of dissatisfaction from foxy while they ate the cousin had returned to the marshes and the major to the sophistication of the bombmaker later the boss had led them back to the lounge and the fire had been made up badger had done what he was good at had sat listened and watched twice he had heard the word interdiction the major had said to the friend care about passionately is interdiction i used to lie awake at night at the basra palace dreaming of it better than a wet one what needs to be done and the friend had nodded in fierce agreement the cousin had said to the boss every time it has to be interdiction so the motherfuckers get the message and the boss had sagely inclined his head it was a word beyond badgers vocabulary later when foxy talked to the cousin about heat exhaustion when wearing gillie suits in the temperatures of the marshes badger had sidled towards the boss and asked what interdiction was the boss had said he thought it had stopped raining and he wanted fresh air and the wind on his face they were outside had taken faded old coats from hooks by the door the wind had come on as a gale there might have been hail in it the seas crashed on the rocks and he could make out the shape of a sheep flock huddled at an angle in the fence the hand pointed to the outline indistinct of the ruined castle keep you know badger theres history here and violent history at that that place was the seat of clan mafia gangsters and thugs and theyd been there since the fourteenth century there was a banqueting hall inside and sunk in the floor of an annex a dungeon that had a water level of three metres there was a round stone in the centre that topped the surface a prisoner consigned there had to sit on the stone and pray he didnt fall asleep after two days or five he might stay awake for a week but it was inevitable that hed drown i fancy they wouldnt have screamed the victims or begged they wouldnt have given the bastard up above that satisfaction a serious place and damnall to do with this operation yes boss badger wanted to trust to believe what is interdiction a pause badger couldnt see the bosss face and couldnt imagine why he had been brought outside to shiver the answer came latin stuff something about hitting communication lines in a military context but i think youre asking badger what this plan means for our target and what your role in this is leading up to am i about right there a very fair question and one that deserves answering what its about yes im being very frank badger and probably going past my remit but where youre going and what youre doing entitles you to total honesty we hope to track rashid armajan to a place where we can approach him we cant do it where he is have i been naive boss not at all with your help badger we get up close thats an approach you understand theyd bung him cart him to a safehouse and turn him the engineer would sing i understand thank you that was indiscreet and id get my wrist slapped its time to get back inside and tomorrows a hell of a day what a dreadful wind you did absolutely right mr gibbons he and the major were in the hall out of earshot an untruth but justified he seemed to swallow approach the major murmured in his ear hes a young man hasnt been where killing and mayhem are maybe hes good at his job but hes not hardened in the way the older man is hes going to be staring through a scope and binoculars at a target and hell bond with him after a fashion they all do hell get caught up in the trivia of the targets life and the medical condition of the wife there are kids arent there hell see them hell get to be by proxy a part of that family at home at his work hes looking at a man wholl be arrested and sent to gaol were talking interdiction zapping the bastard our badger might not cope too well with that you did right which was why i did it serious business killing a chap dont you know a smile flickered at gibbonss mouth some days it was hard for him to remember his name that day his identity hovered between gabbi who worked occasionally as an investigator into tax avoidance from an office near the ministry of finance and zak and yitzak which was how the sailors on a freighter had known him as well as the embassy people who had seen him out of the airport at catania in sicily he had many names in the last year he had used amnon saul peter david and jakob and had seemed to have many places of work on occasions his hair was blond but it could also be jet black or mouse and cut short or topped with a flowing wig the debrief would be the next day and he had gone home and would sleep until he was woken by the clatter of keys in the door the tap of her stick and her footfall he had been met at a military airfield no trumpets he had come down the short steps of an executive twinengine plane and the units driver had had the front passenger door open the woman in an adjutants role was on the apron her hand out for the passport with his last now discarded name and the photograph with the light hair she had also taken from him the unused float for incidental expenses on malta and a mobile phone that had been operational she had returned his own and asked if he was well hed said he was and she had told him at what time he was expected at the unit in the morning he had been driven to their home in the suburb of ramat gan hed made one call on his own mobile and had left voicemail for leah telling her he was back in the apartment one living room one decent bedroom a small bedroom a bathroom and a kitchen he sprawled on the sofa with the bamboo frame he had eaten yoghurt from the refrigerator and some cheese and drunk juice he might read later if he had slept and she hadnt come back from her desk at the defence ministry in the hakira district on the stairs to his secondfloor door he had met solly stein and his wife miriam they would have noted he was back and would have known that the apartment had been empty for four days they would have thought he had been away on revenue business chasing a fatcat crook who was perhaps a politician the apartment was always empty when he was abroad because leah slept at her mothers solly stein did not know never would that the hand of their neighbour across the secondfloor landing the one miriam held as theyd talked briefly the weather the price of milk had the previous day fired two killing shots into the head of a hezbollah strategist if they had known she would have kissed his cheeks he did not endure agonies of conscience as he lay on the sofa he never had nor was he cold unfeeling he had been told that the resident psychiatrist attached to the unit regarded him as unique among his colleagues without remorse rabid xenophobia regret or triumphalism like a man who worked in an abattoir and earned a monthly wage an enigma and not understood but depended upon there were some in clinics and others who beat their women and a few who thought themselves so above the law that they hit banks and were now locked up he heard the tap of her stick against the door must have dozed but was immediately awake he rolled off the sofa and his bare feet slithered across the tiled floor he heard the key go into the lock she knew what he did but never spoke of it or of her own work at camp rabin in military intelligence she had been blinded in lebanon by the shrapnel scattered in the explosion of an iranianbuilt missile the wounds inflicted were beyond the skill of surgeons and she lived in a world of black and grey shadows they hugged and the love shone youre good im fine i brought supper wonderful they clung and kissed are you home for long if you can answer it was possible in what she did at the ministry that she helped choose the targets allocated to him she might have worked on the selection of individuals of hamas hezbollah or the fateh alaqsa martyrs brigade who were thought of sufficient importance perhaps and perhaps not soon i will know i am home tonight they were lovers and she was leah she could not have said what name in their bed he would answer to the pool in the zone had a bad endofseason look about it if she had been a holidaymaker and paying good money to lie beside it with her book she would have thought the place was up for sale or that the maintenance money had run out or that this was yesterdays destination there was a betterkept pool in the embassys garden but she preferred the dowdiness of this one the weeds that grew between the tiled and paved surfaces gave it more of an office feel and negated any guilt at apparently skiving off for the day she was happy anyway to be far from her office in the secure section distanced from the interminable gossip of the diplomats and their support staff her guards were not permitted at the pool and had to sit in an airconditioned shed by the entrance to that sector of the zone the book actually was interesting on one side of her quietly snoring a towel across his face was hamfist his flak vest beside him with the rucksack in which his gear was stowed and an ak assault rifle with a magazine loaded and another taped to it her mobile lay on her thigh the back smeared with sun cream she took breaks from the book to make calls and check texts hamfist was a scot a clumsy sod as she called him with any refined equipment other than one that fired a highvelocity shell he had been in a scottish infantry unit had done nine years that included a spell in alamarah up on highway he had come through a mild load of posttraumatic stuff better than the clap but civilian life had not welcomed him instead he had signed for proeliator security and close protection for a six officer she thought he took more pride in wearing the newly washed and ironed tshirt with the logo of the jones boys band than almost anything else she read about the birds in the marshes on either side of highway that stretched in places to the border dividing iran from iraq pretty birds majestic birds endangered birds some so small shed need a telescope to spot them on her other side was corky not from the southwest of ireland and county cork but from the andersonstown quarter of west belfast but there was no logic in acquired military names he had been mentioned in despatches for his reaction in an ambush in basra seven years back and was in awe of her but he allowed her to help him choose birthday and christmas gifts for a son in colchester aged eleven and a daughter in darlington aged five her phone vibrated and she raised her eyebrows gold the colour of her hair lifted it read the message and cleared it she had organised the paperwork by which part of his salary was paid by proeliator security to each of the mothers he had the same gear as hamfist except that his rifle was an ma with a muzzle velocity of feet per second and a catastrophic hydrostatic shock effect on tissue when it hit which cork swore by he wore a rumpled tshirt camouflage trousers big wraparound shades his boots and was always a tousled mess somewhere behind her out of view harding and shagger would be on plastic chairs or hunkered on their haunches ready to go she knew she merely had to hitch a leg off the lounger and drop the book field guide to the birds of the middle east into her bag on top of birds of iraq and they would be on their feet by the time she had draped the towel around her legs and knotted it at the waist all four would be wearing their flak vests and rucksacks with their weapons in their hands when she stood and lifted the bag shagger would come forward with her own vest and hold it up so that she could shrug into it when she quit baghdad at the end of this show took the six shuttle flight down to kuwait then headed for the towers she reckoned they would be devastated not her problem but it nagged she thought often with relief or ruefully that the jones boys ensured her celibacy it would be a rare bastard who ambled towards her and began a chatup routine hello there do you believe in love at first sight or should i walk by you again or excuse me ive left my wallet behind do you mind if we share an armoured personnel carrier home if an officer american or british latvian or australian a diplomat or an administrator had tried to get his hand in her pants most likely hed have ended in a casevac tent there were times when she ached for she had long legs tight waist fair bumps pretty mouth and a good sunkissed complexion but no man she called quietly guys can you come over guys please she had the four around her dont get me wrong this is serious and not bull were concerned about the survival prospects of the basra reedwarbler smart name is acrocephalus griseldis the blacktailed godwit the greater spotted eagle the sacred ibis threskiornis aethiopicus and a few others how theyre dealing with drought and what effect renewed oil exploration in their habitat will have two supposed surveillance experts are taking off tonight and will hit here tomorrow the ecogame is the cover questions there never were they relied on her to tell them what they needed to know and she gave them more than was necessary which showed her trust in them in their world and hers trust was a big factor sometimes the biggest and theres people we have to see and bits of paper we have to collect what do i think of it doesnt matter were back theyre forward and over the frontier at what you guys call the sharp end were supposed to be their support but easier said than done rather them than me its all a bit oldfashioned a bit of a shout from the past but im up for it anyway if the birds get oil on their wings theyre bollocksed she went to get dressed in the female changing area where they wouldnt follow her and now felt challenged she sensed she was heading rollercoaster towards an endgame more hazardous than anything she had experienced before and that the risk factor had ratcheted the piper played what he assumed was a lament their host and his wife were on the front steps in their foreheads the positioning of their eyes and the push of their jaws foxy foulkes thought he could read something of the grandson in the photograph the old man and woman had shaken hands as theyd left by chance foxy was last out of the door and they had gripped his might have been because he was the last or that small morsels had dropped from the table and they knew a little of what was planned in the iraqi marshlands maybe intuition told them that in their home an act of revenge was plotted against someone anyone who had worked to kill the grandson who might one day have taken over this pile of damp grey stone it was grim stuff that the piper played a light rain fell on his shoulders and there was a stag in the field that seemed forlorn lost the dogs ignored the helicopter and chased furiously after crows that flew away from them the grandmother held foxys hand and shook it foxy didnt know whether he should thank them for their hospitality or they willed him forward a murmur of god keep you safe from her and a growl from him remember us and go after them wherever you find them it was all theatre had a majesty to it decayed but there and the pipers cheeks puffed with his efforts and the dirge was fit for a funeral but went mostly unheard as the rotors gathered speed he raised his voice well do what we can it was rare for foxy foulkes to feel that his words drowned by the helicopters engine and the pipers efforts were utterly vacuous felt it then could have bitten his lip what he thought of as banal was a beacon to the couple he saw their eyes blaze and wetness formed in the grandfathers she stood tall and kissed his cheek roughly shaven that morning in tepid water he freed his hands and scurried past the piper the crewman waited on the lawn for him near to an old rose bed the others had boarded he thought the american would have paid in cash for the privilege of using the house and that there would be no paper trail the helicopters flight plans would have been listed as training exercises and the flying logs would have perpetuated the lies there would have been foxy realised elderly men and women the length and breadth of the country who mourned grandsons cut down by the bombs left at the side of a straight road traversing a desert men and women who had lost children young women whose husbands had come home in coffins and children taken to full military funerals who had no father he was as trapped as if they had taken him to a pathology theatre at the john radcliffe in oxford where the corpses were brought to the military hospital in birmingham or the headley court rehabilitation clinic he could never have refused the crewman put a gloved fist under foxys arm and heaved he flopped into the cabin the others were already belted to their seats and he saw the looks of impatience because he had delayed them for a minute and a half he wondered what he would tell ellie what sort of phone call was permitted how long and how detailed where the kit would come from and what the duration of the operation would be he knew so little and there was an almost infuriating calm about the little beggar sitting across the cabin from him they were airborne and there was a view of the once grand house the couple on the steps who waved the castle keep the grey sea the grey rocks and the shingle beach then they smacked into the grey clouds and the little beggar showed no sign of letting the lack of information fester in him of course he hadnt been there the helicopter shook and the pilot made no concessions to the comfort of his passengers if badger baxter had been to iraq he might not have been slumped in his seat apparently relaxed about close support how near they were expected to get and foxys knowledge of the language raced in his mind what the quality of the directional audio would be had he been able to reach across the width of the cabin he might have kicked the little beggars shin and wiped the calm off his face it was his language skills that had done for him they powered through dense cloud the cousin and the friend talked into each others ears protectors lifted foxy could not read their averted lips the boss gibbons sat upright hands tight on the frame of the canvas seat foxy met badgers glance hadnt intended to was rewarded with a brief smile as if they were equals and shared authority responsibility he wouldnt tolerate that they were not equals he shivered couldnt help himself he hoped the thick coat wrapped round him would mask it he shivered at the thought of the reed beds the water in the lagoons and channels the heat and the hatred and saw again the faces some bloodied but not pleading some bruised but not begging in the interrogation rooms of the joint forward intelligence team god help them if they were taken because of the hatred that had been incubated in that fucking place he was walking with his daughter when the mobile phone warbled he let magdas hand go reached into an inner pocket saw the number and did not recognise it few people had his personal phone details and the majority of those he worked with did not it was a way to protect his privacy had the number been generally available his phone would have controlled his life he answered yes steffen there was a pause a wrong number he spoke again this is steffen it annoyed him he was a busy man sometimes almost overwhelmed by the volume of work that his success and reputation brought him and he valued the moments he spent with his daughter who was seven she had been talking about her day at school the art lesson his own number was given by the caller but not in german the man spoke in the farsi of his past the caller waited he repeated in german this is steffen yes the caller persisted again in farsi was he not soheil the star was his name not soheil he called himself steffen he was married to lili who had been a theatre nurse at the universitatsklinikum hamburgeppendorf from the day of their wedding he had cut his links with an old world and his history lili and her parents had expected it of him and his patients did not wish to be treated at a time of personal crisis by a specialist who was obviously an iranian immigrant he had a pale complexion and his german was excellent the habits and culture of the new identity had been easy to acquire his wife was blonde and pretty and his daughter was not obviously mixedrace they had settled well into the prosperous society of the city they had chosen as their home his daughter tugged at his arm wanted his attention again was he not soheil the star it was fourteen years since he had left tehran on the day he took the flight to europe he had recently qualified at the tehran university medical school his talents were such that he had been sent to the neurosurgery wing of the ukhe to study under the tutelage of a chefarzt he had not gone home he had married changed his name had believed he was forgotten it was now four and a half years since the embassy in berlin had last contacted him to make certain he was happy and content and to tell him that his achievements were watched with pride by those who had provided him with the opportunity to go abroad magda tugged harder he let go of her hand and she sagged back he thought she might fall he could have cut the call he could have switched off the phone taken his daughters hand walked on beside the hansahafen and put the contact out of his mind he was asked if it was convenient to talk there was an edge to the voice his thoughts meandered to speak in german or farsi to answer to soheil or demand to be called steffen the professor of oncology in tehran almost your fosterfather asked to be remembered to you he is old now and his wife is in poor health times at home are difficult in what is their country and yours soheil there is violence and there are difficult people who exercise authority in some areas the taint of treason is attached to those who befriend the few who distance themselves from the islamic revolution is it convenient to talk he asked for the identity of the caller and was told he was just a humble functionary at the embassy in berlin magda had gone to the edge of the quay where there was a drop of three metres to the waterline she was beside a gap between two traditional sailing boats he could not shout at her because she might flinch and trip he remembered the professor who had reared him from the age of nine after his parents both doctors had died in a forward medical post under mortar attack during the battle to liberate khorramshahr when tending the wounded the professor and his wife childless had taken the orphan into their home he understood the nature of the threat to them he did not contradict and give his german name he had qualified with the highest marks was the son of martyred parents and had practised for a year in a slum district of the capital he had therefore been permitted to study abroad but had not returned he answered in his native language his wife and daughter his colleagues at the klinik in hamburg and the medical school in lubeck between which he split his time understood no farsi his daughter reached into his overcoat pocket for the bread they always brought when they walked beside the harbour the blunt question you work in the field of brain tumours i do there is a procedure called stereotactic it is in my field there are cases where a condition is inoperable in conventional surgery but where stereotactic is an alternative there are you have a high reputation but you have not forgotten your familys roots your parents heroism your fosterfathers sacrifices the states generosity what do you want of me his daughter threw bread into the air gulls flew close to her screaming they had huge predatory beaks that you see a patient for whom nothing can be done in tehran nothing it was a cold voice he presumed the patient terminally ill without a procedure that was always a last resort and fraught with complication would be a senior man in the clerical or revolutionary hierarchy we are talking to you because nothing further is possible in tehran the patient would come here or to hamburg the bread was gone and the child was at his side tugging his sleeve and saying loudly that she wanted to go home she started to pull him towards the burgtorbrucke and he let her take him it is intended the patient would travel there are more experienced consultants in frankfurt vienna paris and london men better qualified than i we would not have the discretion that we gain from you the confidentiality there will be no electronic messages only brief telephone communication i will come to visit you soheil when the travel arrangements are complete i am so glad that i can report your cooperation the call ended he understood discretion and confidentiality were the keys perhaps it was a prosecutor with blood on his hands who now faced his god would imminently be with him and was important enough to demand the full resources of the state to buy him a few more months or a general in the revolutionary guard corps or an imam he could not run from them he held tight to the little girls hand as they crossed the bridge and headed for the fine villa that was their home his daughter also perhaps vulnerable and a weapon to be used against him sprinted ahead he shouted at her to slow down and she turned wideeyed shocked by his anger he accepted that even here in his adopted town he could not be free of them ever he let himself into the office closed the door behind him and locked it she was at her desk len gibbons noted that in his absence she had turned her room and the one allocated to him into something that was as much a home as a workplace she had arranged two small vases of flowers one on his desk which he could see through the open connecting door and one on hers and a tray for teamaking lay beside the electric kettle with a biscuit tin on a wall away from the photographs of bombs the featureless picture of a target and the enlarged map of the marsh region between the confluence of the rivers and the frontier she had hung a picture he smiled as he dumped his bag down and shrugged off his coat there was a big sky in which birds flew and a long meadow between forests in which an elephant wandered a scarlet parrot perched and a deer grazed in the background far down the meadow a robed man led two naked or near naked figures enlighten me sarah its the garden of eden gods there with the two innocents its by jan brueghel the elder painted in adam and eve before the apple upset the cart appropriate i thought how did it go well are they all right we call them foxy and badger theyre probably just about all right he was leaning over his desk checking the notes she had left him and pitching them into the shredder is all right good enough he looked up sharply has to be we make do with whats given us i must cut my cloth according to my means very thoughtful of you sarah as always and such an appropriate image they were in business class foxy said that they would have pulled a heavy one a favour required with the carrier they would be up for around six hours on a nonstop flight to kuwait city badger said nothing they took off gibbons had seen them into the terminal then shaken their hands and left they had carried their bags of one change of clothes dirty and washbags to checkin badger reckoned he was expected to carry foxys while the older man did the talking at the desk he did his own talking interrupted to make the point left the bag on the floor and foxy had had to go back for it they went up into the night and badger felt more gut knots than hed ever known beside him foxy was biting hard at his lip and was close to drawing blood badger didnt like to be afraid it unsettled him chapter a wall of heat hit them badger saw foxy recoil from it it seemed to suck the energy out of his own chest his lungs and he had walked only a few paces the suns light smacked upwards from the expanse of concrete its force mocking the effectiveness of his sunglasses everything that was beyond a hundred metres away was distorted and bounced like a mirage he could barely make out the distant terminal buildings but the flags topping them hung limp foxy seemed to stagger as if the wall not only surrounded him but punched hard badger heard him fucking place fucking weather by the by here youre badger and im foxy i dont want any mucking with proper names enough on our plates without chucking identification around to whom it may concern and us those are our names nothing fucking changes a fuel truck drove slowly towards their helicopter and a humvee had parked on the far side of the cockpit it would be for the crew there were two pajeros in front of them a woman stood tall in front of one scratching at her loose robe she wore a head scarf close round her hair and badger thought it was against the sun not for modesty there were two men in each vehicle the windows were up and the engines were turning over which meant they had airconditioning badger assumed foxy was talking to him not to himself nothing changes except the flags my place was about a quarter of a mile the far side of the terminal any time after about seven in the morning and before five in the afternoon you could hardly walk that quartermile without dehydration youd need a couple of litres straight down and if you walked it before seven and after five you had to wear a flak jacket and helmet and be listening for the mortars whistle or there were rockets incoming i loathed it then and i loathe it now badger said nobody cares foxy he had stamped on the moan not the first and it wouldnt be the last during the long relay of their journeys he had felt no inclination to humour the man hed seen foxy crumple as if the wind was squeezed out of him when the request for permission to call home was curtly refused hed had to make do with a text of about five lines and show it to gibbons before he sent it a poignant moment badger had been close by when the message was punched out and the mobile switched off the boss had taken it and put it with badgers into a plastic bag which he had pocketed there was no one that badger would have called he had had his boots in the car and been able to bag them but foxy had only been carrying a pair of heavy trainers which would not have been waterproof badger should have been sympathetic about it but was not and should have been grateful that foxy had negotiated the fee with the boss at the eleventh hour but he had not thanked the older man for winning payment over and above their salaries there had been the flight to kuwait city where theyd been met by a corporal american from a logistics unit who had escorted them out of the civilian area to a military annex they had spent three hours in a departure hut with airconditioning chilling them and had been offered upright chairs foxy had sat in one with his back straight but badger had made a space on the floor wedged his bag against the wall lain down with his head on the bag and slept later the same corporal had driven them in a minibus to the pad where the helicopter waited there had been machinegunners on the cabin doors weapons armed and theyd done contour flying hugged the dirt woven and come up where there were cables slung between pylons but otherwise kept low badger had never been in a war zone too young for the northern ireland experience and he noticed that foxy stared straight ahead looking ill at ease roads with occasional cars and ancient lorries homes were singlestorey and surrounded by dumped vehicles and giant refrigerators kids waved women ignored them and men looked away goats and thin sheep stampeded a checkpoint where the iraqi flag red white and black fluttered briefly as the helicopter drove draught across it and there were local soldiers or policemen the gunner cleared phlegm from his throat and spat the sand stretched away until it reached green corridors that would have been vegetation alongside rivers they went up one of the beds and were over mud and exposed wrecks it was like the life had been taken from a waterway they had not been issued with headphones and were given no commentary on the route the security scene the duration nothing might have been junk and on the way to a refuse pit they had come fast over a perimeter fence and the huge scale of the base the empire it had become was exposed a place built to survive for ever as far as he could see there were prefabricated constructions hangars and maintenance bays blast walls and stores warehouses they had hovered then the skids had touched and the heat wall had clutched them when his feet had hit the concrete badger had wiped a handkerchief across his face his body under the loose tshirt was wet but foxy still wore his blazer and tie foxy led badger let him they walked him three paces behind towards the woman and the vehicles he heard foxy mutter could have opened his door could have damn well stepped out to meet us yes badger said barely audible he was not used to meeting six officers and didnt know what to expect hed better be bloody good as good as hes arrogant cant argue with that do they think were temporary staff for the kitchens washing up or him not being here to meet us is just bloody ungracious discourteous prat christ this bloody sun i wont be quick to forget alpha juliets breach of manners and i expect your backing when i take him to task they were close to her her hands were on her hips and she swayed a little on the balls of her feet badger thought she had control and could have described it as authority there was a wildness about her appearance that appealed a raffishness and he made that judgement in spite of the full robe the trainers that peeped out below it the headscarf and the dark glasses welcome here gentlemen and thanks very much for making yourselves available im abigail badger was alongside foxy and said softly so that makes you alpha alpha juliet correct im badger and hes foxy he grinned were the sweepings off the floor pleased to meet you badger and good to meet you foxy shed shaken badgers hand first briefly then took the older mans badger saw the confusion and near embarrassment in foxy the cussed old thing would be wondering how far his voice had carried in the stillness once the helicopters rotors had shut down there was something about her mouth that was mischievous and hed have bet that behind the glasses there was a sparkle might be fun amusement or even contempt before he had gone off to work for the box and hed been a croppie with his local force a judge had been under threat during an organisedcrime trial he was wanted off the case and violence was in the air so the surveillance team was holed up for days at the back of the property on the edge of a cotswold village the judge had a younger wife with a flash of cheekiness in her smile and shed brought them in the hide at the start of the second week of observing fuckall a tray of tea and shortbread shed had that gravel growl in her voice sort of husky and deep she hadnt cared that she might have blown the exercise the voice had said old money it had been raining and badger and his oppo were well into their stag cold and wet and old money good breeding and the rule of instincts it was the only time hed ever climbed out of a hide in his gillie suit pushed back his camouflage headpiece sipped a mug of tea dunked a biscuit offered thanks and told a woman to bugger off out of it foxy said good of you to meet us abigail appreciated she took them to the vehicles foxy said wed like a chance for a wash maybe something to eat light a salad then some sleep and could be a problem the bit about sleep were very tired i have to say abigail that we havent been treated well since being dragged into this mission the briefings have been general in the extreme all detail excluded whats called for now is rest then a comprehensive evaluation of the ground the equipment backup and the time scales thats after were satisfactorily acclimatised and sorry and all that but those scales are pared down to the quick i can do you the shower and some camclothing everything else is on the hoof maybe it was his tiredness maybe the heat or the weight of the blazer but foxy barked it seems pretty much of a shambles to me and we deserve better the man in uk gibbons he called himself who put this together he warrants lynching it screams wishful thinking and incompetence she had the door of the back pajero open for him foxy seemed to huff then slid on to a back seat strewn with weaponry magazines and vests she said like it was no big deal i put it together its my shout if it fouls up and you lose your head itll be my neck on the block for decapitation its the best i can do the door was slammed on foxy with a thumb she gestured for badger to follow her to the lead vehicle he had to burrow for a space on the back seat when she was in and the doors were shut they were driven away he didnt catch her eye didnt see the point in trying and kept silent best to stay silent as he couldnt picture where the road led or who it led him to the engineers car had diverted in the city of ahvaz off the route that was shortest quickest to the camp it had crossed the karun river and gone to the principal clinic in the town where his wifes medication awaited collection but the painkillers were not on the usual shelf and the man administering the pharmacy had not come to work that day the woman who replaced him was unfamiliar with the stock held in storage and there was a delay by the time the plastic bottles containing the pills and capsules were in his hand he had lost the first halfhour of an appointment awaiting him when he reached his workplace not his drivers fault that they were late but the man his driver for nine years loyal and fully aware of the importance of rashid armajan to the alquds brigade went now for a backstreet cutthrough to get them onto the main highway out of the city they were away from the wider boulevards and the big concrete housing blocks the post office and the railway station were behind them and the homes were smaller more roughly constructed cyclists men on scooters women walking with children and carrying water cans from or to the standpipes blocked and slowed them the driver blasted the horn rashid knew ahvaz had spent three years at the university in the city but this was a district he had not been in and the size of the mercedes in the narrow streets made it an alien object he warranted as a senior man tinted windows and blinds that covered the back windscreen none of those who peered resentfully into the back of the car could have seen him but the engineer could see them and when the mercedes nudged the rump of a donkey or made children skip and women stumble aside they would have known from the car that its passenger was esteemed by the regime at a crossroads three policemen stood warily by an open jeep holding carbines another was behind the wheel and had the engine running fumes spilling out of the exhaust the mercedes braked sharply and the engineer was jolted forward some of the papers he was trying to read spilled onto the floor by his shoes through the front window there was a brief exchange between the driver and the police sergeant who pointed away from the direct route the driver was headed on his arm made the sweep gesture of a long diversion the engineer could not hear them above the noise in the street but the driver shook his head vigorously as if rejecting advice and the sergeant shrugged the window powered up and they went over the crossroads he asked what had been said the driver did not turn was concentrating and weaving through obstructions they were on the route to the gaol the most direct way out of the city there was a demonstration at the gaol and they must pass it to have taken the diversion would have added twenty minutes to the journey and they were late a highranking official would be waiting for them but the engineer had been instructed never to use a mobile phone there were satellites above that trawled for calls did voice recognition and located the source of calls and their destinations mobile phones were the enemy of a man seeking discretion the engineer did not know of any specific threat to his life but the security officials had emphasised to him that anonymity was his best protection the official who had come to see him from shiraz would have to kick his heels and sip coffee or juice and why would there be a demonstration at the gaol the police had not said it was an arab quarter they had been through the street widened and they were edging clear of the alleyways he reckoned his driver had done well to ignore the sergeants directions the gaols wall was ahead and there was a rumble in front of them like tyres on an uneven surface but muffled because the windows were up and the airconditioning was on they came round the corner a crowd enveloped them he saw the faces through the windscreen arab faces not iranian ahvaz was the city of arabs and the sepidar gaol was their prison it was as if the car was not seen and the mass of chanting shouting men had their backs to the bonnet the driver edged forward and ahead the yellowpainted arms of two construction cranes jerked upwards the men suspended from them kicked in their desperation but the arms rose until they were raised high enough for all the crowd to see them a line of policemen with riot shields and helmets made a cordon between the crowd and the cranes which were mounted on the flat beds of lorries the gaols gates were behind the driver was able to go forward slowly the hanging was outside the gates in public view so the condemned were rapists narcotics smugglers or robbers and would be arabs the movement of the legs had slowed and the nooses had tightened rashid armajan had never before witnessed a public hanging he tried to bury his attention in the papers on his lap but sneaked another glance at the bodies the spasms had ceased now and they spiralled on the ropes his driver murmured that they had been scum and it was good what had happened to them they were arabs the crowd having watched the deaths noisily seemed to the engineer to be at a loss as to how to respond until some noticed the mercedes he was an influential individual a persian or he would not have had a big mercedes with blackened windows so he was a target a fist beat on the bonnet another on the front passenger window then more on the other windows within seconds faces and bodies obscured the sky the hanged men and the raised arms of the cranes faces pressed against the glass and there was darkness he could not see the papers in his lap hatred boiled around him there were enough of them to lift the car then let it fall and lift it again higher one more heave and they might tip it over if the mercedes overturned he was dead a gas canister exploded above the car and the crowd the faces contorted in loathing as the white gas spread it came in through the air ducts of the mercedes his driver had spat on his handkerchief and held it as close to his eyes as he could while leaving himself a view of the open area in front of him the crowd had melted away sandals lay crazily on the tarmacadam with some shopping bags a separated child howled the crane arms were still high the bodies still turned and the gas dissipated he had never before witnessed an execution but then the engineer had never made the journey over the frontier to highway and taken up a position to watch a convoy pass and the lethal force of his work he had seen it only on the video screens of handheld cameras and phones he had never been close to death never near the explosions as he had been when the cranes arms had been hoisted he had never known how the soldiers of the great satan or the little satan also called the poodle were when they spilled out of their vehicles or were lifted clear by medical teams or were brought out as charred unrecognisable shapes he did not know if they screamed or thrashed what limbs were left to them or lay supine on stretchers with their faces covered the windows were down the gas was blown out of the interior and the driver swerved a police officer shouted instructions as to which road they should take the crowd had retreated to the edge of the square in front of the gaol and the bodies would soon be lowered rashid armajan would have said then if asked that the deaths of and injuries to soldiers in iraq foreigners or crusaders were matters for those in greater authority than himself that his responsibility lay with the electronics on the circuit boards he manufactured some said to his face that he had done more to drive the americans and the british from iraqs cities and deserts than any other individual he could feel pride in that accolade they drove on and left the gaol wall behind them he hoped that day to hear when he and naghmeh would travel to visit a betterqualified consultant quite soon breaking onto the main road and with the car speeding he had forgotten the faces pressed to the glass his mind was on his meeting and when he would be told of his departure date he felt calmer the gas was gone the windows were again sealed and the little tremor of fear was lost she had left them to shower and the jones boys had a bundle of kit for them an officer who was more junior than herself based at the basra airport complex as sixs representative had made himself scarce run like a scared rabbit with cause neither the junior billeted on sufferance with the americans and rarely allowed within the agencys wireprotected compound nor the seniors in the green zone attached to the uks embassy nor the team at the airport in camp cropper would have wanted to be contaminated by abigail joness mission there would have been no volunteers to step outside the protection of diplomatic status that six personnel enjoyed in this liceblown donkeyshit country but it was her shout and abigail jones would see the thing through she understood the pitfalls of deniability and would live with them most would not the junior wanted nothing to do with them and had scooted as theyd pulled up in the pajeros she called in was connected to a len gibbons she had taken the incomers to the shower room and shown them how it worked the older one foxy had waited for her to get out before even starting to unbutton his shirt not the young one badger was stripped down in seconds muscled back a close waist and cleanlined buttocks and had gone into the shower turned on the water and looked at her there was soap but he didnt reach for it and shed seen all of him there was a store room off the office area and hamfist was in it with corky and a heap of clothing all the kit they might need and the dinghy everything if they could carry it badger hadnt spoken foxy had talked for both of them but she had seen the light in the young mans eyes and amusement hed looked clean into her through her on the link the voice was curt clipped as if gibbons disbelieved manufacturers claims on scrambled protection she said that the younger one badger seemed fit and was likely competent but that foxy looked on the edge of capability for where they were going you have to imagine the problem we had in locating covert rural observation post experience along with decent farsi doesnt grow on trees for crop i had a halfdozen to choose from but foxys the best qualified for the farsi aspect there were no alternatives it was him or we were into the business of an interpreter listening and translating then having that fed to the rear or of putting in someone like yourself alpha juliet who has the language but no experience of sitting in hides you are anyway ruled out because youre on the inside theyre ignorant theyre capable and most of all deniable theyll do because they have to time is not with us she told him when they were leaving and at what hour each morning and evening she hoped to make contact with him if she had anything to report his response was sharp over the distorts on the link not if but when please understand that a lot hangs on this the call was cut she looked through the door not as a voyeur but to learn the older man was in the shower now and the screen was misted so he was only an outline the younger one was towelling himself hard full frontal he did not turn away from her not brazen though she saw that the soap was still in the bowl seemed dry like it hadnt been used she would have lathered herself from toe to scalp she wondered how well in london it was understood what was asked of these two men who already displayed raised hackles when confronting each other in london in an office that had been set up away from the towers would they have the slightest comprehension of the resourcefulness required easy enough to flick across files draw out names and proposition in such a way as to make it near bloody impossible to back out with selfrespect intact they would have been skewered those two and her mind moved on did she have the slightest comprehension of how it would be to lie up in a hide while the clocks ticked the hours dribbled by and they were beyond a frontier out of reach of backup abigail jones career intelligence officer was not certain she did she called loudly for harding and shagger to get the vehicles ready then to hamfist and corky to hurry with the kit foxy had hung his clothing on two wire hangers except for his underwear which he dropped into a paper bag he put his wallet into his blazer pocket he glanced wistfully at a photo with his wristwatch a fistful of loose change and his wedding ring his shoes slotted into the bag then went into his overnight grip the younger one threw his clothing wallet and watch into a plastic sack all their possessions were secured in a steel locker they trooped the two of them with towels round their waists into the storeroom it was a long drive across bastard country nobody in their right mind would want to be on that road when darkness had come where they were going they might as well send a telegraph by western union if they took a lift in a helicopter the sun was sinking when they pulled away from the base she thought the older man was steeled for a fight about lack of sleep so she put him in hardings pajero and let the younger man badger ride with her they were her eyes and ears without them the mission was doomed with them it had a chance not great but a chance they wore camouflage fatigues and foxy had borrowed a pair of boots and they had a bergen of food water medicines whatever a second bergen held the binoculars the audio probe and directional microphone the cameras the batteries that everything needed the radio the sleeping bags the scrim sheets gillie suits god alone knew how theyd get it off the ground and shift it on foot and a shovel with a collapsible handle they had flags iraqi pennants on the front offside wings when they were past the forward sentries and the perimeter lights were drifting away hamfist armed his weapon the rattle tore into abigails ears and she thought that beside her badger flinched there were two handguns in the bergen with their supplies ammunition for four magazines flash grenades and gas hed looked at them carefully then deliberately shaken his head was he firearms trained hed answered almost apologetic that he was not she cocked her own weapon a browning mm pistol and checked again with her hand that the rifle was on its clips along the bottom of the bench seat in the back behind her ankles she had done what was demanded of her and a little more and had no fucking idea if any of it was sufficient they hit the road and shagger said theyd burn some rubber they went north and the sunlight low bathed her if she couldnt comprehend what it would be like in the marshes over the border who else could are you all right mr gibbons it must have been threequarters of an hour since he had spoken with abigail jones on the link and he had sat through that time with his chin on his hands staring across the room at the map with the lines marking the rivers the route of highway the edges of the marshes the larger islands and the canals the strongest line was the border with iran and his focus had been the cross in black marker ink that located the household of rashid armajan the engineer a bombmaker of great skill his head jerked up she had allowed him his chance to reflect had twice put fresh tea beside him but neither mug had been touched nor the biscuit she would have thought his mood had lasted long enough he twisted to face her thank you im fine sarah he grimaced what do we say at these moments we say mr gibbons on a wing and a prayer a dodgy wing and a big prayer she turned to the window the rain ran hard on it and seemed set in for the afternoon he drained the lukewarm mug then crunched the biscuit he clicked on the memory of his phone and called the cousin first then the friend the american told him that all was in place whatever we can give you len we will but at days end your guys have to deliver the friend said his people waited to be told of developments were ready to go but we need the ticket filled out and thats for your people at our end we can run len gibbons did not doubt what he was told that the friend could produce a killer gabbi asked dont you have others the man did not take offence at the challenge there is a file read it do you not have others it was not a complaint more with amusement that he was asked again so soon do you want a state secret revealed do you wish to know how many competing operations are in discussion development do you have to be told who has influenza a hernia who has a pregnant partner about to give birth do you concern yourself with who is tired who might have lost the faith the file is thin but will thicken he opened it in the unit there were still older men conservative who preferred to use paper rather than rely exclusively on the electronic screen the file contained four sheets of a no photograph no street map he had driven in from his home had dropped leah at the defence ministry they had talked about the coming public holiday whether to go to the beach not about choosing targets or killing them at close quarters and why the refrigerator failed to achieve its maximum chill range there was a concert at the end of the week at the mann auditorium and the israeli philharmonic would be playing beethoven theyd talked of that and he had left her at the gate seen the greetings of the sentries as she flashed a card at them and started to walk with her stick swinging in front of her many in the ministry her section would have wanted to bed her only a few tiny fragments of the rockets casing had blinded her and she was not scarred her skin without flaws many times on his travels gabbi could have called whores into his hotel rooms he had not he believed she had not the file had a name a cursory biography a map of a border area and an internet digest on brain tumours for beginners dummystyle the last sheet told him that the wife of the target was believed to be about to travel abroad for final efforts at treatment his smile never carried humour a finger stabbed at the map and found a point fractionally on the iranian side of the border with iraq im pleased to read this i thought you wanted me to go there how soon would i travel wherever i travel to there are surveillance people who go close today or tomorrow to watch the house and try to learn perhaps it will happen perhaps not if word comes therell be a stampede and you are giving it to me he shrugged he might go to a sales conference and he might not he might be heading for a marketing seminar and might not he might be called into a researchanddevelopment brains trust and might not he might be sent to shoot a man at close range but might not he had been present at the killing of moughniyeh in damascus of majzoub in beirut he had been in gaza and in turkey for a syrian that morning he had gone through the debrief and had told it factually without remorse or triumphalism he had reported that the pistol issued to him kicked to the left when fired he had sat with the units psychologist and they had talked of the programme the philharmonic were offering at the mann the report the psychologist would write might have been dug from the records it would be the same in essence as that produced after his return from damascus beirut gaza city istanbul he changed little and was not scarred by his work stay close of course he finished the glass of water offered him and stood he had heard it said that the man behind the desk elderly a little obese bald and almost haggard had been a junior on the planning team for the incursion into tunis when the life of khalil alwazir who rejoiced in the title of abu jihad father of the holy war was taken and the blueprint of the operation was taught to recruits as a model gabbi would not have considered flippancy with this man who had much blood on his hands it was the end of a long day the dusk fell on the city throwing shadows on the buildings the last of the sunlight blistered on the sea beyond the empty beach call me we hope to hear soon the americans bring the money the british bring the idea and the location we bring you its a good arrangement and gives us currency for the future which is leverage i do not know no apologies where you will go i have my darling lili a problem he had been in hamburg that day he had operated after seven hours in theatre the patient was a prince from riyadh who might if he survived buy a new wing for the neurosurgery section the consultant drove slowly and carefully home he had been unusually complimented by the chefarzt for the skill and precision of his work but he could not be sure that the beast was fully extracted or whether enough remained to grow again beyond the most delicate reach of his knife he had done his best and been praised it is from iran from my past and it pinions me he came off the autobahn and turned for lubeck his pleasure at the praise was diluted what he might say to his wife after he had read a story to his daughter as they sat at dinner and she poured wine served the food she had cooked and told him of her day played on his mind when he interrupted her she would hear him out with a frown and an ugly twist at her mouth then she would snap tell them to go to hell put the phone down on them reject them out of hand if they persist then call the bundesamt fur verfassungsschutz its what theyre there for to deal with foreign threats theyre in the book are you intimidated by those people are you steffen theyre no part of your life she could not understand he would not know how to explain to lili a little thicker on the hips since childbirth and fuller in the bosom with the first grey hairs that needed the salons attention dressed from the best of the shops in the konigstrasse the power and reach of the alquds brigade and what could be done to the elderly couple who had fostered and mentored him they would end the meal shouting and doors would be slammed and the little girl would be crying on the stairs no one who had not lived there would understand he came off the big traffic circle and headed for rockstrasse sleet was in the air and there might be snow before morning she might throw at him are you not prepared to stand up to these people tell them to go fuck he owned a fine villa much of the old part of lubeck had been devastated by british bombers in the spring of but the grand properties beyond the burgtorbrucke had survived untouched he was proud to have been able to buy a home on this street it was an accolade to his work and endeavour the light was on in the porch to welcome him and the sleet flew in lines across it he would say nothing she would not understand neither would her father nor counterintelligence officers he thought himself alone isolated he parked his car went inside and told lili of the praise heaped on him he read the story to magda sat at the dinner table complimented lili on the cooking and asked about her day he said nothing of the cloud hanging over him he had been dozing might have been snoring gently when the first shot hit the pajero he was thrown forward bounced off the back of the front passenger seat then cannoned into the door more shots followed badger had woken fast since they had been on the big drag which she had said was highway she had opened her window unclipped the rifle and let it rest on her lap the guy called hamfist had a weapon peeping out into the growing darkness he was awake there were men milling in the road lit by the pajeros headlights and probably half blinded by them one crawled and seemed to scream up into the night he might have had a broken leg what the fuck badger murmured for want of something sharper the road was clearing and the girl was shooting hamfist too he heard her say it was thieves and that harding had hit one with his front fender corky might have winged another they had gone straight over one of the tyres left in the road to slow vehicles down he could see the lights of the first pajero where foxy was then the flash and the screaming moving light it would have been about a hundred metres in front the light went past the front of that vehicle and carried on across black open ground there must have been a berm or a dune because it exploded shagger swore and called it an rpg round hamfist matched the obscenity theyd gone off the road into a ditch and badgers elbow was driven sharply into his ribcage he thought they bucked over the sand and scrub for about a quarter of a mile then the wheel was wrenched again and they tilted climbed and ground up onto the road for a few seconds the two vehicles were side by side stationary the six lady didnt speak but there was a fast exchange between harding and shagger in a military patois badger deciphered enough to learn that thieves had put tyres on the road to slow vehicles then stop them to rob the passengers of valuables and cargo one thief had been run down another had been shot around thirty bullets had been fired at the two pajeros and one rocketpropelled grenade was it par for the course badger didnt ask neither harding nor shagger reckoned their tyres had been damaged now she spoke can we please move off and get the hell out they went on in darkness mostly the road was clear but a few times men emerge would from the dark dragging along a packbeast and a few times great lorries drove towards them and made a chickengame challenge there were dull lights at a shack that seemed to serve food but had no customers and there was a police roadblock but the pajeros had their pennants up and were waved through without having to slow badger reckoned they wouldnt have slowed anyway would have kept going and might have started shooting again theyd come into a town she whispered that it was the garden of eden and badger hadnt any idea what she meant but again the windows were down and the guns readied they crossed a bridge and there was enough light for him to make out a sluggish stinking flow of water it looked a crap place and he didnt see an orchard with apples any naked girls or a fellow with a fig leaf for modesty out of the town the bridge behind them and the road emptying again they were on a track and the front pajero threw up a dust storm they had to drive through there was enough moon for the surface to be visible without the vehicles headlights badger closed his eyes clamped them tight and the pain lessened in his ribs and arm the end of a road at a broken gate that had posts set into a sagging wire fence through the gate there were heaps of discarded rusted piping that went nowhere he realised it meant oil and that it had been bombed hed carried his bergen the fullest and heaviest and had made certain he accepted none of the jones boys offers to help there was a singlestorey concrete building with little compartment rooms that were filthy shrapnelspattered looted hed taken one and foxy had been next door but there were no doors there was pain though badger was on the sleeping bag spread on the concrete floor he didnt realise she was there he could hear a constant drone of mosquitoes in flight but they had not bothered with him yet there was no light but the subdued sound of a radio playing soft jazz maybe new orleans hed have had to strain his ears to hear it better staying still on the bag killed some of the pain she was standing over him are you bad or good hurt or in one piece he blinked tried to make her out in the darkness couldnt the movement he made in reacting to her voice hurt his ribs and he bit his lip thanks for asking im fine are you injured bruised does that mean wrecked no i have to ask ive answered can i see it what for badger shifted to face her he had told the truth and he would go on because i want to he heard authority in her voice and doubted there was a future in argument i want to know what state youll be in when you go forward i wont be a passenger not alongside him open your shirt he did he could smell her breath and sweat no deodorant excellent professional in this sort of place badger reckoned you wouldnt know when you might have to burrow into a hole while the bad guys went by and the smell of toothpaste or deodorant was the worst giveaway now he rated her higher than he had just on the evidence of her skill through the ambush shooting well and fast leaving the driver to do the driving and hamfist to put down the main suppressive fire he had the buttons on the camouflage top loose and rucked up the lightweight khaki tshirt he wouldnt show that it had hurt she didnt use a torch but moved her fingertips across his skin paused when he winced her face was close to his and the darkness was around them a guy did a trumpet solo on the jazz that was playing and he had to lift his arm so that she could get more easily onto the place where the elbow had hurt his ribs he couldnt see her eyes but her breath was on his face the pain seemed to go she eased across him slipped a leg over his hip and her fingers played on his skin foxy foulkes was dreaming he had forgotten the name of the hotel and which junction he had come off at and had forgotten the number of the motorway he had forgotten too what the room had looked like its decor and what was in the chilled minibar he had not forgotten over seven years that a lift had been offered from the training course for greater manchester police that she had been in the forces computing team and was going to a seminar in london he was going south she had put her hand on his thigh and music had played hed wrenched the wheel at the junction and theyd checked in without baggage both had been half stripped before they used the little key to open the fridge and take out a halfbottle of fizzy stuff it was a hell of a good dream him with ellie now his wife his blazer was on the floor in the dream and his trousers and underpants her clothes scattered over them it was passionate even frenzied at the start but the second time had been calmer and quieter hed told her they were soulmates and in the dream they did it a third time nearly bloody killed him and shed sighed he had dozed and then thought he was dreaming but he was awake he heard a grunt through the wall and struggled to find ellie then he sat up listening bloody hell were they at it abigail jones asked herself what did you do that for and answered god only knows she could have talked through a hundred reasons or ten and could have decided that none made sense she used a tiny beam from a pocket torch to guide herself down the corridor past the open doorway into the older mans room and came into the big area where the gear was she let the beam rove around shagger and corky were on their sides on the bags and seemed to be asleep hamfist was hunkered against a wall facing the outer doorway he had an ak assault job with two magazines taped on his lap he reached towards the small cddvd player to cut the music but she waved a hand and he let it play on harding the american would be sitting on the buildings outside step with an imageintensifier sight on his weapon watching the broken gate and the parked pajeros a burr in the accent and a whisper they all right maam theyre fine they know what theyre into maam probably as much as is good for them the torch was switched off and the jazz lulled them she sat crosslegged with her weight against a loaded bergen rather them than me maam a fertile imagination isnt called for foulkes foxy told me what he regretted most was that id taken his wallet off him hed got a photo of his wife in it and wouldnt have it with him maybe other aspects bothered him but that was all he let on i dont have a picture of the wife the ex or the kids i sent them money for new bikes last christmas didnt hear back doubt thered be any tears if an rpg aimed straighter except that the money would stop the younger one badger reckoned i was good why because i hadnt used toothpaste or soap today or yesterday his story the best of the south africans when they were fighting cubans in angola had their teeth falling out why because they were the most dedicated covertskills guys in the bush and toothpaste is like soap the scent lingers no soap no toothpaste no cigarettes no alcohol no curries and nothing spicy i suppose it was a little lecture in how serious the work is the way that scent and smell last i may just have been too damn idle to use toothpaste and soap oh and armpit spray would be an appointment at abu ghraib i learned that this evening she asked herself again what did you do that for and answered god only knows they were in grey light grey sky before the sun came up above a berm on the left side of the track to the east of them grey water brackish and stagnant in the centre of a lagoon and grey mud with dark cracks that showed how far the marshes had been drained artificially then flooded then drained again by the dams upstream and evaporation drought from lack of rain the reed banks also had no colour that would come with the morning two pajero jeeps low on their chassis from the armour plate fitted to the doors and engine casings the added layers of reinforcement underneath kicked up dust trails as they took a raised track between what had once been lakes and went east no radio on in either vehicle and no conversation the briefings were finished and had been reiterated over sips of bottled water before they had loaded up they drove along an old bund line packed dirt and mud thrown up three decades before in the early months of the war with iran by bulldozers and earthmoving gear for the convoys of iraqi tanks to traverse the marshlands and reach the border for the drive towards susangerd and ahvaz the four employees of proeliator security the officer of the uks secret intelligence service and the two deniables had no interest in the history of the terrain they crossed there was no talk of them being in the lost garden of eden or having passed alongside the tree of life in alqurnah during the night or that they were where the great flood had occurred and the ark had grounded they did not observe that they were in the cradle of civilisation where cultures had emerged five millennia before and where a people the madan had existed among the marshes since before history neither did they consider drainage dam building nor drought but they had gone by two tiny encampments shanties with corrugatediron roofing and other buildings in the traditional style of woven reeds the mudhifs children and dogs had chased after them but the thump of generators had not penetrated the thickened windows of the pajeros all of the buildings had been adorned with satellite dishes the armies of the medes persians greeks romans and arabs had been here and the mongol hordes british infantry had fought a battle close by ninetyseven years ago and had struggled in the same heat that would rise later in the day the marshes had been places of refuge for malcontents rebels insurgents smugglers and thieves there would never be nor ever had been allies here for a stranger ahead the grey landscape took on light colours red in the sky green in the reed banks mud brown in the water and dust coated the vehicles pigs and otters took cover and birds flew away from the intruders they could no longer see the derricks of the oil platforms discarded damaged awaiting new investment in the majnoon fields but ahead was a horizon the vehicles stopped the dust settled in the few seconds that it hung obscuring any view of where theyd halted two men pitched out then the woman and two more men festooned with weapons pulled the bergens clear and the small inflatable boat no hugs no exhortations about the importance of a mission across a frontier just a brisk cuff from her on their shoulders and a nod from the two armed men the two slid down the bund line onto cracked mud and into crackling dead reeds the others were back in the vehicles and the wheels spun forward to the limit of the tracks width then reversing and they were gone the dust clouds thinned who might have seen that the pajeros were lighter by two men and two bergens no one the silence fell around them a lonely quiet intense and frightening as it had always been for strangers who came unannounced and unwanted into the marshes chapter they went forward and were into the third hour since they had trudged away from the dropoff point foxy foulkes still led there were no maps to follow and this was ground that ordnance survey did not cover anywhere he had worked in britain or northern ireland there had been bigscale maps with signs marking telephone boxes churches pubs and points of interest like the summit of high ground there were no buildings and no elevated terrain he was slowing but hed be damned if hed allow the younger man to pass him and take on the role of pacesetter there was emptiness and stillness both in foxys mind were delusions and delusions bred a climate of danger among the reed beds and on the little mud islands that rose perhaps a metre above the waterline of a channel or an open space or two metres above a driedout bed there would be the small villages of those marsh people who had survived the persecution of the dictator the ebb and flow of the war fought along the frontier an invasion of foreign troops gassing bombing and shelling drainage reflooding and drought there would be tiny village communities that had tv screens but no schools or medical care they could exist through murder and thieving and by being paid for information foxy did not doubt that small craft of which he had seen photographs in the intelligence reports at the interrogation centre seven years earlier nudged through the passageways between the reed banks he did not doubt that their progress not as fast as when they had started out left a track of sound the sun was climbing it was now barearsed ground he and badger had an understatement insufficient cover and no map that helped the gps handset guided him they had been through water to their knees in stinking mud to their ankles and in reeds that towered over their heads the option now was to walk in more water or climb a bank scramble to the top on all fours and get on a bund line or it might be a berm there was a difference a berm was an earthwork thrown up by bulldozers as a military defence or a flood barrier and a bund was a raised road to go up would make an easier route but they would be exposed barearsed which would break every rule in the croppies bible he wanted water better he needed water and speed he realised he couldnt set the pace required to get onto the flat top of the bund or the berm would ignore one of the core basics foxy taught them when he was out with recruits shape shadows shine surfaces space and silhouette if he went up onto the bund and took the youngun with him he would be silhouetted against the skies the reeds and the mud might as well have brought a bull horn with him and shouted that they were coming he stayed down his boots went through the water it was a small satisfaction that their prints in the mud would be hidden by the water there was clear quiet breathing behind him like the guy had no problems with the weight of his bergen if they were seen they would be at the mercy of thieves who lived off what they could steal and sell on they would be stolen and sold on and then theyd be right for the orange jumpsuits and for what used to be called the baghdad haircut in the interrogation centre the suns light and strength drained his energy and the cloying mud sapped the muscle power in his legs there would be plenty of groups ready to stand in an orderly queue for the chance to bid big money at any auction if a pair of crusaders were up for grabs orange suits were the uniform for the camera shows where poor bastards pleaded for their lives and rubbished their politicians policies the jihadists put them always in the same colour as the americans prisoners wore at guantanamo as if that legitimised the killing the haircut wasnt a short back and sides but the head wrenched back and the throat exposed so that the blade had an easier cut and the same bloody camera would be running the bastards in luton and the west midlands bradford and the northwest who lived in the mean terraces and who between their prayer sessions flitted between the internet sites that showed the beheadings would likely get a hardon if they had a fuzzy view of foxy foulkess head going back and the flash of the knife damned if it was him who was going to stop first and he didnt know how far they had still to travel to the frontier the symbols and numbers on the gps were blurred with the sweat dribbling off his forehead into his eyes they stayed in the lee of the bund and there was a toppled battle tank ahead his feet sloshed in water and his stride was shorter it was only the third hour and there might be another three to the border then two more at least to where they would make the hide he wore his gillie gear and the bit that covered his head and face a gillie was a man who held the rods for the gentry on a salmon river or guided marksmen towards deer theyd been called up in the great war from the estates to match the prussian snipers with their skill in concealment their knowledge of the elements and cover and theyd developed their own suits which gave them greater protection from searching eyes and lenses the camouflage was good for the mud and dirt wall of the bund but poor in the reeds he listened for a gasp behind him exhaustion at the limit but heard nothing should have concentrated had the orange suit in his head and a man himself pleading to a lens for mercy guys were behind with rifles and one had a knife he went by the tank its body was intact and he couldnt see the entry hole of an armourpiercing missile but one of the tracks was broken it would have been a mine then an internal explosion and fire the plate on the turret was rusted by the wind and dark from the fire it could have happened thirty years ago and they might still be inside thieves would have stripped the interior the wristwatches and jewellery from the dead crew if they were salvageable but would have left the bodies the thoughts of the jumpsuits and then the rotting dead brought him back to ellie a cars wheels on the gravel its door slamming a key in the lock her coming in him hi darling whereve you been her hesitating then up to see tash didnt i tell you i was going do i know tash course you do she used to work with me you never listen love course i told you made it home earlier than id thought hed moved to kiss her but shed averted her mouth and hed just caught the back of her neck but hed smelt the perfume lovely scent he couldnt see her face a sort of distant voice i came back through wootton bassett love and got held up they were bringing home one of the soldiers the traffic was stopped i couldnt go anywhere i watched theyre all heroes arent they his coffin had the flag on it the legion was there everyone stood to attention old blokes had medals on there was a family with flowers people crying loads of them it was for a real hero fantastic hed said well love im not a hero but i negotiated the motorway all the way up from the far west and it was a poor effort at a joke shed rounded on him and the rant had started you dont bloody listen do you im talking about heroes the bravest of the brave real men its about sacrifice a man told me that at the petrol station giving their lives for us he called it paying the ultimate price thats nothing to make some stupid remark about and there had been a slammed door the bloody irony of it he was slogging through mud at the edge of a bund had a bergen on his back and a gillie suit that about suffocated him and he was doing hero stuff his throat was parched and he was dehydrating and theyd not allowed him to send a decent text irony was cold comfort two trucks had come off the bund and gone engine first down the sheer slope their bonnets were in the water maybe theyd been bulldozed off to make way for more tanks the water was stagnant and the smell was bad he retched and had to step further into the water until it was lapping his knees he saw three legs of a creature stuck upright and wondered where the fourth was the carcass was of a water buffalo and it was about fucking landmines he was swaying the heat and smell were destroying him he started to sink its not the promenade at bognor a voice behind him mocked shift it he must have opened his hand let it slip the stink of the animal clogged his nose he scrabbled for it couldnt find it the weight of the bergen seemed to pull him back his voice croaked give me a hand badger you a passenger foxy a hand want me to lead that it do a donkeys job i want to stop rest we have to get there before dark thats what the boss lady said a drink and some help say it properly foxy some help properly foxy please some fucking help please and his voice must have lifted a flight of ducks lifted out of dried foliage on the far side of the lagoon and he remembered what alpha juliet had said he wondered rambling if they were marbled or ferruginous or whiteheaded duck a hand came under his arm he felt himself propelled forward and they rounded the sunken trucks leaning behind the buffalo carcass with the hand in his armpit the weight of the bergen lessened they edged back under the bund the mud seemed thinner now and the pace quickened a water bottle was passed to him and he swigged he couldnt hide it back there i dropped the gps it sank i lost it no answer not even a look that killed he passed the bottle back he thought they were heading in the right direction the bloody irony of it when could he have refused stepped back smartly and walked away the opportunities were never available for little people like joe foxy foulkes she was still in bed alone the central heating had failed in her workplace of the last two years naval procurement in bath and the buildings on the hills south of the city were as little fit for purpose as the communal boiler system theyd shivered all through yesterday and the decision had been taken to close down until the problems were fixed she heard below the bedroom the front gate squeal it needed oiling shed asked foxy to do it twice reminded him only last week a vehicle swung into the drive ellie got up shivered remembered shed turned the heating up last night to twenty foxy didnt like that and said sixteen was high enough but foxy wasnt there shed had the text there were footsteps on the gravel and two mens voices one was by the front door the other beyond the gate she hooked on her dressinggown and parted the curtains a man was leaning on her gate and his car half blocked the lane her eyes tracked across the drive and there was foxys car the bell rang she had had the text two mornings before hi love in a hurry have to be away work dont know how long verboten to phone luvya foxy she had rung his mobile eight ten twenty times but it was switched off she went downstairs it was a decent cottage in a country lane in a village outside the wiltshire garrison town of warminster pretty with climbing roses over the porch wisteria on the front walls small mullion windows a garden three bedrooms two bathrooms and a new kitchen shed chosen when theyd met shed been coming out of a divorce with most of her savings gone in legal fees shed probably have ended up in a studio flat if foxy hadnt offered her the lift down from the northwest no way she could have afforded a chocolatebox cottage in the country she had something to be grateful to foxy for but over the last two years that something had become vague almost out of sight since shed met piers she opened the door the man wore a white shirt a chauffeurs style black tie probably with an elastic band round the neck and an anorak he held out the keys your husbands mrs foulkes half asleep early in the morning and no alarm set what bringing back your husbands car we picked it up from the car park where he left it sorry we couldnt manage it yesterday he was turning away it was a forlorn chance and where is he wheres he skived off to in midstride he paused angled his face to her a laugh without a chuckle dont imagine they tell me things like that not for the likes of me to know just a thought if hes away more than a couple of weeks i suggest you turn the engine over sos the batterys not flat when he gets back she closed the door on him failed to thank him upstairs she checked an internet site a town halls page learned a date and a time then called the guy who did accounts at the naval procurement offices he stood under a palm tree and gazed out over the marshes they were a source of fascination to him an endless pleasure he enjoyed little in his life mansoor was in his thirtyfirst year he should by now have been prominent in the alquds brigade looking for further promotion and higher command but the chance was denied him because of the explosion of the hellfire missile fired from the predator drone neither seen nor heard and giving a warning in fractions of a second as the light stream and the roar of power fell from the sky he could stare out over the marshes watch the wind move the reeds and ruffle the trees on the island across the lagoon see the hunting herons and kingfishers the ripples on the water when the fish rose and always there was the changing weather threatening benign calm dramatic and the light no two days were similar he would not advance because of the injuries muscle tissue even some bone had been torn from the back of his left leg above and below the kneecap he would have recovered better if he had been close to medical aid he had not numb with pain mansoor had been carried on a litter from northern iraq across the mountains the hospital where he had received the first serious treatment had been in the iranian city of saqqez there had been traces of gangrene in the poorly bandaged wounds and the surgeons had deemed it necessary to take as much again of the remaining muscle tissue and bone as the missile had his limp was pronounced and his future as a combat officer was finished he had been sent to the marshes on the border as security officer to the engineer rashid armajan he would not have believed it possible he knew the names of the birds that flew over the water and nested in the reeds those that were gentle and harmless and those that had sharp talons and wickedly curved beaks he knew also where the otters lived and bred where there might be pig with young and which island had the greatest infestation of poisonous snakes he also knew that in these marshes half a century before there had been striped hyenas wolf packs and rarely a leopard crippled he provided security for the engineer and learned about the beauty and life of the marshes at first while his wife continued to work as a computer operator at the crate camp garrison he had loathed the prospect of guarding this man he had almost considered leaving the alquds he had arrived at the house had been billeted in the barracks that fronted onto the lagoon had come to know the family and the wild life of the marshes and could not have said now which mattered most to him there were godwits and a small swimming group of pygmy cormorants and babblers and he kept japanese binoculars hanging from his neck it the birds panicked he would look hard to see if a pig had disturbed them a large dog otter even a leopard or a wolf it might be pilgrims going to and from najaf across the border or smugglers bringing opiate paste from afghanistan and crossing iranian territory the birds were almost the sentries that watched over the little community and more efficient than the men he commanded with time he had realised he was honoured to have responsibility for a man as important in the defence of his country as the engineer that morning he had been called by his father an informer for the revolutionary guard corps he was a parttime postal official and also helped with the executions at the city gaol he was a man of few talents and many interests who let it be known that his son had failed to fulfil expectations his father would have expected to ride on the back of his sons successes he had been uninterested in the medical prognosis after a section of his sons leg had been gouged out by a missile and more concerned with his return to authority and influence that day his father had telephoned him from the prison with details of the public hanging of two arabs he had been the link between the hangman and the crane drivers in their cabs telling them when to hoist the arms he had enjoyed the morning it had gonewell from his fathers knee through his time as a recruit of the guard corps during his selection for the elite alquds and lying on a makeshift stretcher to be hauled across mountain tracks he had honed a hatred for all enemies of the state whether arabs in ahvaz or the distant operators of the remote guided predators he could not salve his loathing of the great satan take revenge for his damaged leg but the engineer had hurt them which enhanced mansoors loyalty in the evening he might bring out his fishing rod to catch a carp and then too he could watch the marshes he was devastated by what he knew of the illness of the engineers wife he was he thought almost a part of their family there was stillness in front of him safety the lenses of the glasses roved over the water and the flourishing reed beds no creature moved sharply or thrashed to escape in the heat of the afternoon the police came they had two battered pickups corky had alerted her when the dirt trails were still more than a kilometre away she had shrugged into a robe and her face was part covered with a scarf both corky and hamfist had done this territory with their regiments and would have regarded the police as deceitful and treacherous they had probably sent a few to martyrs graves they had talked this through and the drills were understood two spotter scopes up on the bund line round the wrecked drilling camp looked down into the marshes that surrounded the site harding was behind one and shagger had the other both had bird books and pamphlets beside their stools abigail had not seen an individual come close to the camp and none of the jones boys had warned her of a dicker looking them over from cover they would have been told and they would have come the routine was that she would explain in her halting arabic that they were a part of a unescosponsored ecowatch additionally funded by national geographic they had the full support of the ministry in baghdad and the provincial governors office she had the papers of each organisation to prove her point a clutch of to whom it may concern letters all with impressive headings a fiftydollar bill attached to each one she had anticipated that after each paper was examined the money would have gone she knew what they earned and remarked that she and her colleagues were grateful to the local police for watching over them she could bore and did so her anxiety about the potential for oil pollution of this amazing habitat unique in the world to iraq the species of bird and animal life here needing monitoring which were not found anywhere else in the world iraqis from across the country could be proud of it had they not been told she was coming with colleagues and an escort she had the smile and her appearance was harmless but the policemen would have seen the two men gazing out over the marshes through scopes breaking off to write in notepads they also had cameras while two more carried automatic weapons and were in the shadow of the buildings when she had bored them enough they left she said to harding that was probably good enough for today and maybe for tomorrow but theyll be back i dont think in a couple of days theyd manage enough links to unravel it at baghdad or basra level three days maximum four would push against the limits he nodded truth was she liked him more than the others the original quiet american he spoke rarely but of them all he was the one abigail trusted with her life she said i doubt the fox and the badger will be in much shape after three or four days was it flawed two men who might have been inserted too late and find the bird flown or had gone in too early and would be unable to sustain the watch they might be there too long and show out she had liked the scrapping between them there was no way other than to have men on their stomachs peering through lenses with earphones clamped to their skulls it couldnt be done with satellites on the electronics in the drones it would be their shout the mission depended on them she had thought the antipathy at each others throats more likely to raise the competitive streak that would dominate their relationship too cosy and they wouldnt be efficient it was personal to abigail jones because she had examined badgers bruising and had worked a leg over his pelvis to see it better he had said something about the smell of her body then the taste and she had done as much stripping as he had she had made a complication where there should have been none she always kept a couple in her wallet and when she had gone at first light to clear her system the condom had gone into the hole with their rubbish for burial all a complication but abigail jones did not do regret it couldnt last more than three or four days he met his wife catherine in a coffee shop on regent street she told him what was in the bag two shirts three pairs of underpants four pairs of socks and a new pair of pyjamas len gibbons thanked her awkward he had been since theyd first clapped eyes on each other thirtyfive or so years earlier he couldnt tell her how it was going she could ask him nothing about what kept him in london or why he needed changes of clothing he couldnt tell her how long he would be there she couldnt ask when he would need replacements and whether he would need another suit brought up heavy or lightweight nothing to say about the garden because of the weather and she hadnt heard from either of the children both students the job ruled him not that it had treated him well another woman in her place might have harboured doubts about her husbands staying up in london and sharing an office with sarah the faithful assistant she didnt had actually said so last year catherine gibbons thought that most days he didnt notice what his assistant wore probably hadnt registered what she his wife had dressed in she was a widow to the service they sipped coffee and nibbled shortbread he looked at his watch twice and flushed when she caught him at it naughty of her but she challenged him important len is it he surprised her didnt change the subject or sit in silence important as anything over my desk in years and we have no idea how it will end or where weve people out at the end of a line and does that tell you anything her eyes were bright and mischievous is it legal he didnt bat her away most would say its illegal no one would say its legal a few would say they dont bloody care thanks for coming up she persisted those people at the end of the line do they know whether its legal or not they know what they need to know yes i appreciate your coming up he left her had already outstayed the time he should have been away from his phone he knew badger and foxy had been dumped would be moving forward towards their lieup and soon be at the border which was sort of a defining moment legal or illegal he didnt bloody care as long as it stayed deniable it would be a huge step as big as anything he had handled since he was a greenhorn should it have been asked of them bit bloody late len to be worrying on that he was like a donkey refusing to go any further its hoofs stuck into the mud he thought of foxy as a stubborn thickskinned ass but the guy had stopped and he was a hell of a weight heavier when the momentum was lost badger swore softly he tried to take the next step but couldnt tug foxy forward he turned his face was in the older mans whose lips moved there was more water ahead of them but they had stopped on a small raised platform of mud and rotted vegetation foxys right trouser leg was caught on a strand of barbed wire his lips kept moving but badger couldnt hear what he was saying he had been thinking about alpha juliet and that their approach through the shallow water and scattered reed beds had been about the most feeble and unprofessional he had ever attempted foxys lips were still moving badger bent and freed the trouser leg tearing it the lips moved if youve something to say then say it nothing to say to you who to then myself how knackered you are and unfit not up for it something you wouldnt understand try me foxy said try smartarse halae shomaa chetoreh answer khoobam mersee i asked how you are and you told me youre well and thanked me were at the border and theres something called the golden hour which you wouldnt know about were going to stop and rest for an hour golden or not got me we dont have an hour then you can go on ahead and when you find a friendly policeman you can say raah raa beman neshaan daheed mehmaankhaaneh otaaq baraayeh se shab but its unlikely hell drop you off at a hotel where you can book a room for three nights its dont curl your lip at me farsi which is spoken from where we crossed that wire its why im here i speak the language youre just the fucking pack animal that helps me to get close to the target i matter you dont if i want to rest then then you rest it was a quick movement a twist of the shoulders a halfswivel of the hip and a step to the side badger extricated himself from foxys weight he took a pace forward then another he was over the wire would have given a hell of a lot to have ged alongside him quiet authoritative more than able to take his share he spoke not a word of that language and neither did ged there was a channel in front sliced through the reed banks and open water beyond it he thought it would be a kilometre and a half to where the cross had been on the gps screen their destination he detested the man he was shackled with but badger had no farsi he took another halfdozen steps stopped and heaved off the bergen he tilted his knee rested the pack on it out of the water and rummaged he found the packaging ripped out the plastic inflatable and fired the air canister it hissed grew and floated he worked the bergen onto his shoulders again turned and beckoned to foxy the heat blistered up from the water and the gillie suit was one more burden he didnt know how much more of his strength he could depend on but he was not about to show weakness foxy came to him another gesture for foxy to get into the dinghy the little craft not much bigger than a childs on a beach bucked under his weight badger lifted off foxys bergen and dumped it on the mans lap there was a length of nylon rope which he slipped across his shoulder and pulled hard he walked skirting the channels edge the water was level with his knees they went by a collapsed watchtower which would have been felled three decades before two of the wooden legs were out of the water and half of the platform they rounded a sunken assault barge he asked from side of mouth whats the golden hour you want to know wouldnt have asked if its army speak its the time the backup should take to reach an fob thats a forward operating base when it comes under sustained attack and risks being overrun the men know that backup will reach them within the hour by land or by helicopter its the pact between the military units an article of faith at the fob they have to hunker down hang on in there and know that within sixty minutes the cavalry will be coming over the horizon thats the golden hour theres other uses like getting treatment to the wounded but thats the relevant one and her and her lads theyd get to us inside an hour almost droll from foxy like he enjoyed it like he had hold of the balls and squeezed them do you want it giftwrapped grow up young un meaning there might have been a tremor in badgers voice but he swallowed hard and hoped it was hidden theyd get to where that watchtower was and the wire the border they wouldnt cross it thats how far theyd come forward in the golden hour not a metre further they wont cross into iran they wont discharge firearms at personnel inside iran theyll lift us out from behind the border but wont come in and get us theyll be there within the hour was the promise maybe now you understand why i was reluctant to take the next step and why only an idiot would rush on got me yes god did you take it all on trust didnt you think of asking one important question like wheres the backup took it on trust he started again to pull the nylon rope and the water deepened it was at the top of his thighs clammy in his groin in england on operations the backup was never more than ten minutes away here to hold out for the golden hour they would have to retreat to the border and there they would have handguns one each with three magazines gas fists and boots it had an emptiness to it take on trust that echoed in his head i asked it mattered to me because ive a wife didnt you ask that woman the clever bitch no the van was driven into the car park at the rear of the hostel and a car followed it to both drivers it seemed a desolate place of stained weathered concrete and late morning it was deserted most of the windows had the blinds up but no interior light on a few had the blinds down they might have wondered whether this anonymous block with no name only a street number was the correct destination but a woman came out of the doors in part of a police uniform which matched where they were supposed to be the door clattered shut and was selflocking the van driver was sharp enough to register the difficulty and called to her hed brought a car back and hed need somewhere secure to leave the keys he had a name daniel baxter was she supposed to have heard of him hed kick the door down if he had to to find somewhere to leave the keys safely the policewoman grumbled but took them they were attached to a ring with a picture of a badgers head she punched the doors code and dropped them into one for each residents locked boxes and was thanked she ran for her own wheels the van driver said to his colleague i dont know where hes gone baxter but id bet my best shirt that nobody heres even noticed hes away the consultant came out of the doorway hoisted his umbrella and started to run he saw the man his principal theatre was in hamburg but he also had a clinic in lubeck at the university hospital and medical school with scanning equipment where he could see patients his was a new block but there were many old buildings on the campus that had stood for more than seventy years on the far side of the street was the cafeteria to which he liked to slip away in the middle of the day for a baguette and coffee and to glance through the days paper the morgenpost the football reports cleared his mind before he returned for the afternoon the man not a german was in front of the cafeteria it had been raining all morning if the consultant had kept running heading for the cafes door he would have had either to sidestep or collide with the man he slowed in the middle of the street and found himself anchored there a delivery van hooted at him the man had no umbrella no raincoat water glistened on his short hair and the shoulders of his jacket the shirt under the jacket had no collar and was buttoned at the throat and the cheeks were swarthy he thought the man was from the east perhaps baluchistan province the trousers were baggy at the knees and the shoes dulled by wet the man had the appearance of a guestworker in the northern german city he could have been a bus driver a plumber a constructionsite worker or a bookkeeping clerk in a warehouse and would have been a ranking intelligence officer working under diplomatic cover he was rooted in the road and a car swerved past to his left a trio of students on bicycles trilled bells at him the man had dressed the consultant realised to emphasise the old world of an orphan in tehran and of a student who had prospered because the state had paid his way there was a smile from the man as if they were old friends he came across the street with his arms outstretched he ducked under the canopy of the consultants umbrella and kissed soheil on both cheeks not steffen there was a whiff of a spicy sauce on the mans breath and a hint of nicotine he would have been an official of vezarate ettelaat va amniate keshvar and any official of vevak was to be feared he had not told lili of the call and through that morning he had thought only twice of the contact he blurted ive just come out for a sandwich i have little time and i have driven from berlin and you have distinguished soheil as much time as i need you to have so do we stand here and cause an accident or go somewhere your office cant someone go out and fetch coffee for you juice for me some food will you entertain me in the rain or in the dry would he take an iranian intelligence officer into his sanctum hang up a wet jacket beside a radiator introduce him my friend here is from the ministry of intelligence and state security in tehran everybody knows dont they that im not really german that im iranian by birth my education was subsidised by the ministry of health in iran and now the debt has been called in they want a favour from me please make him feel at home and bring him juice and a sandwich salad with fish would be best and see if his shoes need yesterdays newspaper in the toecaps he took the mans elbow and led him towards the cafe there was a table by the window and three chairs they took two and the official kicked away the third so they had the table to themselves from the wet on the mans face hair and jacket the consultant thought he had waited for him for at least a halfhour and knew he would have stayed there all day if necessary no appointment had been made but that screwed the pressure tighter he brought the tray with coffee and juice a sausage baguette for himself and another with salad and fish the man was reaching into his pocket and a cigarette packet emerged the consultant soheil or steffen hissed that smoking was forbidden on all the university sites the man smiled we can bring the patient at any time now he was known for his cool head and was said to be as sure as any in the big hamburg hospital if he was faced with potential catastrophe in theatre he stammered that he had not yet had the chance to check the availability of facilities the stammer became meandering waffle he did not know what was required would not know until he saw the patient had read the case history and examined the scans the man let him finish he might have fought called a bluff but he didnt dare what he did dare was to ask my patient who is he the smile was laughter who we have not yet decided on a name for them the man took the consultants hand as a surgeon he was reputed to be slick and fast which kept anaesthetic times to a minimum and lessened the dangers of internal bleeding now the pressure on his fingers showed him how vulnerable his talent was i will see the patient i didnt doubt it and i will look into the availability of theatre and scan equipment i know we are heavily booked but i will look into it you will do what is necessary his hand was freed he was given a card the mans baguette was finished his own not started the juice glass was empty and his coffee cooling they could come with a hammer force his hand onto a table or one of the low walls around the canals of lubeck and break every bone they could destroy him the man stood up the printed card had a first name only on it with the address and numbers of the embassy in the wilmersdorf district of berlin the man put euros on the table as if it would sully him to accept the consultants hospitality and slipped out through the door into the rain back in his small clinic the consultant checked the availability of scanners in lubeck and the theatre in hamburg then a patient was shown in he forced a smile his daughter had a toy marionette he understood the way it danced to its handlers tune if they had not yet determined the identity of the patient it was a security matter sensitive he thought his life teetered as a chasm yawned it had been a day like many others he had finished the debrief had enjoyed the session with the psychologist and had been shown a file that told him little then he had walked out of the building into the winter sunshine of the mediterranean pleasant and clean and had gone to eat on his own gabbi did not have a living soul in whom to confide had he been dependent on company his wifes the regulars in a bar even others making up the numbers on the team it would have been noted and the information tapped into his file any form of dependency alcohol bought sex or company would have been noted and he would have been sliding fast out of the units building down the steps across the car park past the sentries and into the street it would have ended it would end one day it was not a pensionable activity long before old age caught up with him he would be gone from the unit there was no former employees association no reunions on the eve of public holidays no gossip opportunities with veteran campaigners it would end when exhaustion dulled his effectiveness and the psychologist would call it burnout he would be gone and might get a job in a bank or sell property or just waste his days on the beach his work for the state of israel would be complete and his pension earned he had sat on a bench and watched the sea had had a book open on his knee but had watched the sails beyond the surf the fitness joggers and dog walkers the young soldiers who had their rifles hitched across their backs he knew the case histories of the great failures of the units work he knew more about the failures than the successes he could talk through if he had to the minute by minute intricacies of lillehammer in norway wrong man shot dead the team captured by local police catastrophic could relate the disaster of the botched poisoning of khaled mashal in amman a toxic substance lethal squirted into the ear but the units people being held in police cells and their government having to deliver the antidote that would save the bastards life humiliating a wry smile because the killing of the states enemies could be complex but he did not make judgements and the file he had been shown would carry the same importance as that of the man buried the previous day in beirut who had stood outside a maltese hotel it was always best when he stood in front blocked the path looked into the face he headed for home and would reach it only a few minutes before she was due back it was a day like many the shadows fell the sun dipped on a far horizon and he would wait as he did so often for his pager to bleep or his phone to ring at last light they had their view foxy was beside him it seemed so ordinary so close and yet so remote he could not have said without hesitating what he had expected you all right foxy fine just that you sound clapped out ill manage good and dont bloody patronise me the evening cool didnt penetrate the gillie suit the hood was like a heated wet towel on his head and his hair would be flat and wet under it not only ordinary but dreary and cheap the sight gave out no atmosphere of danger or of a place where an enemy of importance was bedded in an enemy a target like any other could have been organised crime or a serialrapist inquiry or a training camp for the rucksack guys or the vest ladies just a target and the only difference was that the golden hour would be a finerun thing if push came to shove they had come past a herd of water buffalo that had gone on grazing while half immersed and there had been no herdsmen with them they had seen small columns of smoke to the left the north and once there had been voices kids and the sounds of distant life carried across the marsh he had dragged the inflatable with foxy and foxys bergen and if he hadnt they would still have been back at the wire they had gone slowly and twice he had been up to his chest in the water once he had gone out of his depth and had had to cling to the side of the craft and grip foxys sleeve there was a narrow strip going north to south of land and they had come onto it he had gone forward and dared to stand beside the sole tree there he had gazed out and seen enough then gone back for foxy and found that the inflatable had been folded away and was tucked into the top of a bergen they were together on their stomachs the tree was beside foxy and they had a view that went through slowwaving reeds then across water and over the brow of an island that was some eight or ten feet above the waterline a lake stretched away perhaps three hundred yards across and then there was a steep bank palm trees and buildings to the right there was a group of huts put together crudely with concrete blocks badger had his glasses on them the start of his traverse going south to north there were men in uniform at the huts with infantry weapons they wandered and smoked sat and talked hugging the shade he scanned to his left and followed two children who kicked a ball without coordination one of the soldiers joined them and squeals of delight carried to him tracking further left brought him to the mooring in front of the house where a uniformed man squatted and fished the lenses picked up a little red dot on the water a float there was a blockhouse building behind the man and its front was in shade but badger could make out a woman sitting in shadow she was on a hardbacked chair and held a stick the bright colours close to her were a childs plastic tractor and a tricycle he thought where they were now was safe a decent distance from the target zone in the last light a vehicles headlights lit the dullness and the man who was fishing reeled in his line stowed the rod on the bank and hurried towards the singlestorey house the kids abandoned their game and ran to the woman on the chair she pushed herself upright with the help of the stick where they were was safe and useless he didnt have to ask foxys opinion on it it was useless because it was too far back and they would have been voyeurs there wasting their time we have to do it now you asking or telling me a snarled whisper badger said he was telling he was rummaging in a bergen for the audiodirection stuff and a spool of finecoated cable when the car pulled up and they saw him quite a goodlooking guy hurrying from the car to the woman and hugging her it couldnt be left to the morning it would be hard in the darkness but he had to hack it get closer to the guns and where the kids played and the woman had sat he watched them and they had their backs to him they went inside a goodlooking guy chapter the dawn was coming up and the niggle prospered the geography of the location dominated as it always did when cameras or microphones were involved distances were crucial a light wind in the night had rustled the reeds barely audible to the ear they rattled almost clattered against each other when heard through the earphones foxy whispered the sound quality isnt good enough im here for conversations maybe half a sentence the audios beam is having to travel through the reeds and thats dominating any talk by the front of the house and the door inside i didnt set the parameters of this caper im the poor bastard that has to get here wade paddle damn near swim i didnt choose the ground did i hear that right wade paddle damn near swim you were on your backside floating and being dragged along the sun was a gold sliver peeping up far away above a flat horizon that was unbroken by trees or high ground only by the reed beds that moved endlessly with the winds force what im saying is that where we are now is unsustainable more important where the mikes placed is by me of course by you yes where you placed the mike isnt good enough if thats the best you can do we might as well load up turn round and walk out quit i came here to do a job not for my health i see little point in staying if i cant do the work so i have to go forward and move the mike about right and how close do you suggest i go the front door into the kitchen foxy could have stood up stamped and shouted but he didnt one thing verbally to clip badgers ears for his rudeness but another to break the rules of thirty years practice badger ought to show him respect for his accumulated knowledge you should get the mike into a position where its beam doesnt cross a bed of reeds so screening its access to the front of the house simple enough you up for it or do i have to do it a shrug from badger sour little beggar the sound was too poor for foxy to identify more than occasional words the one who fished had come by the house after darkness and spoken to a soldier or trooper or guards corps man but the words had been muffled by the reeds movement the same man had again come into the magnified vision of the imageintensifier and the nightsight had shown him talking to the target both had smoked and their speech had been distorted in a halfhour the house and the low quay in front would be bathed in low sunshine and movement would be dangerous or stupid they had good cover where they were off to the right which was south there was a bund line that bypassed the shallow island where the mike had been placed by the young un the previous evening it marked a boundary to the lagoon onto which the targets house faced and came to the main shoreline on the far side of the buildings hed identified as a barracks compound the bund line was too far away for the mike to be set but might make a better route onto the island more argument not then rolling away from him badger let his hands slide over his suit and checked it involuntary and instinctive then his headpiece he put more mud on his hands and wrists and was gone what else had they bickered over the meals ready to eat one chicken and one beef both with rice and he had wanted the chicken so had badger foxy had insisted had had the chicken the stags hed had to sleep had been dead on his feet but when the young un did the watch foxy had been woken five times hard to get to sleep in the scrape but hed been woken five times and five times could hear sweet fuckall because of the motion of the reeds he had let badger know he needed sleep not the sound of a reed hitting another reed and a thousand more doing the same using the bags had been a point of conflict badger had said they should carry them out foxy wanted to bury them they had a dozen enough for a little cache of excrement and a couple of bottles to go with them he hadnt done it for years been a croppie in a hide having to bag and bottle he could lecture on it could make mens faces fall at the thought of the bag and doing the business a couple of feet from an oppo the bags were in a hole and covered over but whether theyd be carried out was not yet settled they had stripped in the night and that had made for more tension their gillie suits and the clothes under them were soaked their boots were sodden badger had lain on his back and wriggled out of his gear his skin was white had no cream or mud on it it was too many years since foxy had bared all in front of strangers except in the changing rooms at the gym where he did workouts inhibitions which he would not have entertained ten years before had stressed him when he had slid off his boots wrung out his socks then pulled off his trousers he had turned away from badger and criticised youre stark bollock naked what happens if we have to bug out fast he had heard the sharp breath and had known he was held in contempt not given the respect he deserved the boots had dried partially the socks mostly but the gillie suits were still sodden and heavy the light came on fast foxy remembered that from his weeks in the interrogation centre it came on fast in a surge and the shadows were shortening he looked with his glasses for movement in the reed beds or ripples he searched for badger he saw the target in a vest and pyjama trousers sandals on his feet come out and drag on the mornings first cigarette then go back inside a car came the mercedes saloon that had brought the target home the previous evening it parked and the driver stretched spat then lounged he saw two sentries on plastic chairs under the low trees but they stood reluctantly when the officer came by them the children appeared in nightshirts and chased each other one fell and seemed to graze a knee there was wailing which he heard on the headset everything he saw he noted in his log and on the first page was his sketched map of the location the sound failed there had been quite piercing the crying of the child above the reeds motion then silence there was water in front of him beyond the reed beds which were at the edge of the ground they had reached and then there was the last island lower and more exposed without cover then more reeds denser than the others and the lagoon in front of the house and the barracks he had keen eyes ellie had told him his eyesight was above average she liked to say in company that he could see a flea move on a carpet ellies job at naval procurement kept her out of the house too long for her to hoover up any fleas he ached for her always had and always would hed never ached for his first wife liz who might still be a radiologist in yorkshire he didnt know with the two daughters whod been barely civil the last time he had gone up from london for a birthday a uniform out of sight of the house stood on the bank of the lagoon and urinated into the water foxy brought the lenses off him and was traversing towards the house when he saw what seemed a snagged mess of dead reeds caught on a little promontory there were two others out in the water moving languidly with the flow but the one on the promontory which stretched out to form a mud spit was anchored he hadnt seen it before and assumed that the wind more powerful in the night had dislodged it from the foot of the reeds his shoulder was tapped and he started half turned foxy foulkess reactions werent failing his sight was good and his hearing and he would have claimed that his awareness was as sharp as it had been at any time in his life since he had been awarded his own blue book for passing out as a qualified crop man he had not seen or heard him come on where to the mikes out in front its another fifty sixty metres forward we dont have that length of cable what are you saying you want to hear anything we go forward see that kind of island it isnt one we get to the far end of it on the bund line and we can hook up youll have no interference there we have to move now come on theres not cover there he said sharply almost out loud then we make some foxy bit his lip and didnt say what he thought it was too close no cover what the hell was he doing there he didnt say anything thought plenty though thought about the ground on which they would lie up and where he would have a decent link with the microphone where the beam would be clear of obstruction and about the suns climb the spreading light the soldiers who were drifting from the barracks building and the faint smell of cooking he was there because he couldnt have refused the young un badger had challenged him and he thought one argument was settled the shit would be left buried with the bottles he crawled away to get his gear together as badger reeled in the cable if he looked for the target and the targets home he could see the weapons and far out in front of him was the islandshaped platform on which there was little cover what to say nothing the engineer had gone early the sun had been barely up and the heat haze had not yet formed when he had kissed his wife and waved briskly to mansoor the mercedes had pulled away and the day had begun a few months ago before his newfound interest mansoor would have started on the many texts available to him on the types and maintenance of weaponry available to the alquds brigade he would have taken books on military tactics particularly those describing the fighting methods of the iraqi resistance the afghan taliban hezbollah and the north vietnamese from the library of his headquarters at the camp outside ahvaz in his convalescence he had read everything available on the methods used to defeat the american military the forces of the great satan and its ally the little satan he knew what had been done in falujah helmand and beirut where the marines had been bombed and at the plateau of khe sanh then he had nurtured his new interest it did not make him less alert he would have said that his sense for danger or threat was greater than if he had been sitting in the shade with his head buried in a book or pamphlet he knew about the battle of the marshes the battle for susangerd the battle for khorramshah and the battle for abadan and each move that had been made in the karbala offensives which were legend in the history of the guards corps he had done that work and had found a new focus he sat on a plastic chair in front of the engineers house where the sentry would have been at night and looked out in front of him he had good binoculars his own wife golshan flower garden had told him when she was angry and bold enough to speak directly to him that he had come back from iraq and the hospital a changed man embittered she worked long hours at the crate camp garrison and came home late on the bus to her room in his parents house he rarely saw her so she had had no chance to learn of his obsession he sat with his binoculars on his chest and waited for the movement of the birds he looked for the african sacred ibis he could have seen it in east africa south africa taiwan or on wetlands on the east coast of australia but he had never watched it fly low over the marshes in front of the house they were there he had read but they were endangered and near extinct it would be a cause for celebration if he were to see one and even more so if a pair came close he had not yet seen it on this stretch of marshland naghmeh had told him she had watched one drift over the lagoon but it had gone when he had come from his office he watched waited and would break away only for coffee in the barracks and his salad sandwich otherwise he would keep the vigil he had his rifle across his knees and could tell himself in true honesty that he was conscientious in his work he believed that the engineer had told them so at the camp there were days when he thought he had seen one neck extended legs tucked up and powered by wide wings far away over the reeds each time his excitement had surged as the speck had come closer until he could see it was a slowflapping heron he looked also for the predator mansoor the security officer indulged himself with his search for the sacred ibis but he was also on constant watch for the threat for danger the whitetailed eagle had been up that morning the hen but he had not seen it now for an hour the eagle had no equal would swoop and kill the gentle bird if the sacred ibis came if his hope was fulfilled it would likely come low across the reeds and he watched them closely there were ducks and coots and an otter he thought them his allies if the threat was alive the waterbirds would panic and the otter would dive telling him of a killers approach the visitors arrived three cars had brought them from ahvaz susangerd and dezful they would have gathered in ahvaz and come in convoy into the border zone which was under military control and to which access was restricted he went to check the papers to satisfy himself he would get two of his men to move a table under the trees set chairs round it and carry over a tray of glasses and a jug of juice he would put more cushions on the chair for naghmeh whose pain was worse this week then when the meeting had started he would come back to sit and search for the ibis among the reeds foxy listened the sound was good clear and clean the technicians he had met on courses and field trials swore that this version of the shotgun directional microphone yielded quality results at three hundred metres and he estimated it was now secreted no more than metres from the front of the target house he was using around a hundred metres of cable sunken from the microphone to where he lay no way he would say it the position was good the voices were crystal he would have claimed they were exposed and at risk from being so close to the targets zone and to the bastard who sat and tracked across the lagoon area seeming to search it the sounds of visitors and greetings were boosted by the walls and windows of the building behind where a table and chairs had been set and bounced back he realised the skill badger had shown to get forward to the lieup and more to go along the mud strand and place the microphone in the heart of what seemed to be snaggedup debris he was so damn good but foxy wouldnt say it where they were had been dead ground to the view from their nighttime position and a track of sorts led off the bund line to the right there were more reeds nearer to where he was on his stomach the bergens were hidden there and badger slept there foxy needed to have a view of the target house the weak point with covert listening gear the technicians always said was keeping the power going having battery strength and replacement when recharging wasnt an option what they used had output impedance of ohms and a frequency range of hzkhz and an sn ratio of db plus and hed thought badger hadnt understood any of the specifications but he had done well to get them there he reflected two kilometres across a hostile frontier they were alone exposed he also reflected that the chance of success was minimal he knew about the landmines sown in this area by the iraqis during the war three decades earlier the woman had a fine voice that commanded attention naghmeh the engineers wife was at the centre of the table and around her was her committee she talked of a village the new well that was dug fourteen years ago was not deep enough and the water it reaches is inadequate the answer is for the village to go back to the old well but that is where the mines were laid they are not mines against tanks and personnel carriers but against people they are the belgianmade prb m and the nr also put there were the italian sb and vs and there are the jumping american mines the m a and the bulgarian psm if if it is possible i will go to ahvaz with you to demand funds for the clearance programme it is owed to the village which should have decent water i will go myself across the table from her a man and a woman representatives of a village to the east and a halfkilometre outside the borders restricted zone wept quietly she spoke of the farmers you have good sheep of the best quality and good goats but the good land where your flocks and herds should graze is denied you by the mines you have there the yugoslavmanufactured pma which is primarily of plastic and rubber casing it resists the pressure of flails to detonate it but tilts on a foots weight and explodes it does not kill but takes a leg or a foot or a manhood the shepherd and the goatherd cannot use those fields and cannot put their beasts onto them you have waited too long too many of your families are crippled and your children cannot be out of your sight i will go to susangerd and not leave until i have the guarantee of action i can be formidable the peasant farmers who lived on a poverty breadline wrung their hands and lacked the courage to look into her eyes she talked to the man and his wife who had spent their own savings and their extended familys money to buy a building and develop it as a hotel because they were near to a route used by the pilgrims going towards karbala and najaf the shrine of ali ibn abi talib soninlaw of the prophet where each of the minarets was covered with forty thousand gold tiles the side of the bund line that led to the border and crossed it the tracks through the marshes on military roads constructed by the old enemy were mined and the devices came from bulgaria israel and china the minefields were not marked and no charts existed to show their placement the iraqis who had put them in the ground did not care and the pilgrims would not walk or ride on a narrow track but spread across the elevated ground enough had been killed or crippled for no more to come i will go to tehran if i have to where there is oil there is mine clearance when the drillers and pipelayers have to come in the ground is cleaned not only are people and animals killed but the potential wealth of the area is blighted i will demand that something is done so that pilgrims can use that route and stay at your hotel i will burn their ears i promise the couple choked back tears and the woman let her hand rest lightly on naghmehs she turned to two younger women who wore headscarves but not veils they would have come from a city and had education to go with their intelligence as she had i have complained frequently and will continue to do so against the corruption that afflicts the mineclearance work i will not tolerate it corruption is a stain on the islamic state we cannot get the clearance teams without bribing officials first or giving them bonuses then when a contractor is appointed has paid for that privilege he cannot operate without further theft by officials i will see whoever i have to see and sit on their doorstep for however long i have to sit there her voice was quieter as if the effort of talking through the morning had exhausted her she sucked in her breath and felt the pain the silence was broken by a sob from the slighter of the younger women she could endure pain and extreme tiredness she slapped her hand on the table now where is our action campaign let us consider where we can advance they all knew of her illness and that the diagnosis was terminal they also knew that she was due to travel abroad to consult with a foreign specialist and that her life hung by a thread she had their love and respect naghmeh could have made a short speech about her condition telling them of her certainty that they would carry on with the work of mine clearance regardless of whether or not she drove the programme she did not none would have believed her she thought few of them reckoned there would be another meeting such as this outside her home in the warmth beside the lagoon where the birds roamed she faced the water it jarred that the security officer blocked part of her view and that his weapon was displayed the pain throbbed a drum beating in her skull they did the charade and logged birds some species they could name but most they could not the spotter scope used by shagger stood high on a tripod and abigail was beside him with binoculars the sun was high enough for the heat mist to have formed where they were the marsh waters were blocked and the ground around the raised walls bulldozed to safeguard the oildrilling site against flooding was bare and cracked there were precious few birds endangered or common to look for and she thought they might have to resort to throwing down bread if they were to get a decent entry into the log they were watched mostly by kids but there were adults too men when the first halfdozen kids had turned up seemingly materialising from open ground without warning and the first couple of men shagger had murmured had to happen miss like it was written down on a tablet two sets of wheels and us no escort and out here putting up the tripod and the telescope always was going to create interest and the chance of acquisition i dont know how long we can sweat it out she had said by now theyll be in place and will i hope have their eyeball the sun beat down and she sweated they were predictably the main attraction she could have hoped that the area around the devastated drilling site had been abandoned by the marsh people that the war and the draining by the dictator followed by persecution and uncontrolled flooding then four years of brutal drought had driven them away that would have been optimistic harding and hamfist were sleeping and corky sat by the broken gate his face half hidden by his wraparounds the weapon lying on his legs by the end of the day it would come to giving out sweets and they would be wrapped in fivedollar bills here cooperation was bought with a highvelocity bullet and blood in the dirt or by shelling out bribes might be why she detested the place and was counting the days till she was out of it when this piece of work was finished wrapped up there might now be forty at the gate they stood and watched she thought they had a degree of patience unmatched anywhere she had been by any peoples she had known they stood in the harsh light without water or food their entertainment was herself shagger and corky blocking the easy way into the compound with his rifle she did not think them hostile yet merely inquisitive later they might resort to showing pictures blown up on the photocopier of a bustard a bittern or a darter if they were lucky they had another day in place if fortune smiled it might be three days out ahead the mist settled on a horizon of flat earth and reed beds and far away there was water where he was she could remember each cadence of her voice what did you do that for and the answer had been that god only knew an evasion she did not would not make a habit of crouching over a strange man to check the extent of bruising and finding her hands fingertips running over a flat stomach and going lower then grabbing one of his hands and dragging it behind her so that it was under her tshirt and on her skin difficult for abigail jones to know why she had made a pitch for this quiet sometimes taciturn sometimes mocking man who had walked into her life it had been a compulsion regretted shit no she had not met the guy in basra six baghdad or her last london posting who did the business for her there had not been a lawyer a banker or an army man who had interested her the last had been a teacher mathematics for fourteenyearolds in a lambeth comprehensive shed almost lived with him three nights or four a week hed had no money and no prospects but was fun and intense he had jacked in the job put the pensionscheme payments on hold and sold almost everything he owned then gone to teach mathematics or anything in upcountry northern cambodia he was peter hed asked her take it or leave it if she wanted to come with him but that would have meant resignation and a bust career there hadnt been another guy since not in london and not here none of which answered her question on top of a sleepingbag in a ruined concrete office building with shell holes to view the stars and glass carpeting the floor why had she hitched up her robe and lowered herself onto him she didnt know she could still taste him or imagined it no regrets none what was best he hadnt thanked her he hadnt assumed he was going into harms way with the dawn and this was a little boost to courage that might have flagged he hadnt even seemed surprised but had been deep in her and had said nothing it had been good no regrets he wasnt out of her mind and was beyond the haze on the horizon she wore a moulded earpiece that doubled as a microphone and the transmitterreceiver was on her belt it was her link to them and she wouldnt anticipate the code message coming through unless their mission was complete and successful or they needed to abort fast she didnt expect shagger or hamfist corky or harding to remark on what had happened in the derelict building that night but she wouldnt object to his operational input he had the experience which gave his comments value he was the wrong side of forty with a little weight gathering across his belt and he came from the extreme south west of the principality his parents had slaved through his childhood on a subsistence hill farm breeding sheep white welsh mountain ewes hed gone into the army on leaving the grammar school joined a para battalion whereupon his father had ditched his pride and gone bankrupt shagger had fought in africa and the balkans done time in ireland had been in afghanistan in and had left the army the next year a sergeant he was one of the drain who had quit to make big money with the private military contractors he knew about every yard and feature of the road from baghdad airport to the green zone but he had never quite raised sufficient funds for his goal he intended one day to have the cash in the bank to buy back that farm in the preseli hills with each contract he took shagger learned more he gave advice only when it was asked for and she never rejected it she said theyre fine for the moment nothing hostile they can see guns and its daylight miss theyll chance nothing till its dark they thieve miss always have to pull back is a last option its the worst option miss here at least we might be inside the golden hour or on the edge of it we have to sweat it out would they know about the golden hour they know that backups guaranteed act of faith to them where they are theyd need the faith badger listened as foxy murmured translations and interpretations hes the security man the chief has a limp so hes been hurt somewhere if he was hurt in an accident it would have been on their roads if hes a military casualty it would likely have happened inside iraq or up in lebanon hes mumbling doesnt know what to say except that she should have faith in god a benchmark of the work of a croppie as badger knew it was to have binocular or scope vision camera lenses or a directional shotgun microphone aimed at a target eavesdropping watching noting and be able to strip away the armour with which people tried to shield themselves if they expected to be observed few did not many understood the qualities he brought to his work and the capabilities of the gear it was a basic intrusion and he didnt care his life was spent watching men and women noting small private happiness tension and moments of pleasure he was a voyeur he might have been standing on a street in darkness and gazing at the gaps in bathroom curtains as a target prepared to wash or looking into lit homes and seeing bitter domestic arguments he might have been watching a killer burn a victims clothing the sharing of the cash the arming of a group on their way to a hit a man weeping or a guard fumbling for words to a terminal patient the gear enabled croppies to peer inside minds and souls it didnt bother him it was his work she says her committee dont believe they can carry on without her the mine programme will fold if she isnt there shes the icon figure who demands action she repeats that he nods doesnt answer only says something about belief in god they had developed the hide through the morning it was as good as anything badger could remember normal go in at night and do the construction stuff under cover of darkness be cosy and covert when the light came abnormal to burrow out the scrape and cover it do the work in the suns glare and have a man with security responsibilities sitting in a chair two hundred yards away something to be proud of he had called the tune and foxy had stayed with the earphones clamped on hadnt acknowledged that the work was well done was brilliant they were on the extremity of the reeds where they were thin and had taken over a narrow strip of the bare ground the driedout mud he had worked a shallow dip for them no more than fifteen inches deep and had made a rim wall of the soil all of it was covered with debris he had painstakingly collected further into the reeds the same dead fronds that hid the microphone on the mud spit more fronds masked the cable where it came up out of the water and ran across the mud towards them a work of art a collectors piece often the guard raised his binoculars and scanned then badger had been statue still on his stomach and the gillie suit was embedded with more reeds thered been no praise he thought of alpha juliet difficult not to think of her impossible to imagine why she had done it but he was glad she had hes called mansoor thats what she calls him he says he hopes god will watch over her she says her committee depends too much on her she says its time to go and prepare the childrens food for when they come back from school i think hes near to tears right shes gone and he was no longer listening fran had been good enough to run for a few months but hed left and she wouldnt have cried there had been two girls while he was still at school and hed shagged one while her parents were out at the supermarket every friday evening for a month the other in the woods near the nukeweapons factory at burghfield and a woman pc called brenda who ran the organisation side of the team that did surveillance on the gypsy camp where the tinkers who did the countryhouse burglaries up and down the thamesvalley corridor came from nothing important to him she had been alpha juliet and there was no one to tell him why she was locked into his mind he wasnt handsome had fuckall talk he felt the warmth of her and the moistness he couldnt have said that any woman before had mattered in his life the heat burgeoned and his throat was crisp dried his eyes ached from the glare of the water and the man sat in front of the house the rifle across his legs badgers head turned slowly as he watched through his glasses the reed beds the spit where the microphone was disguised and the open ground into which he had scraped the hide they were pressed hard together his hip into the slack part of foxys stomach wall and foxys hip bone sharp against his thigh foxy whispered it surprised me how well my farsis lasted if the man was fishing for a compliment badger wouldnt take the bait he answered its what youre here for what youre paid for you know why were here are you going to tell me were here because they the spooks dont have an asset to put in here they would have wanted a local some guy who could wander around and chat in the coffee house or the garage and talk to the goon guards they dont have one so its us there isnt a turned iranian they could put in and trust and there isnt a lieutenant of the republican guard who thought saddam was the bees bollocks or a slimy little sod from the baath party they can rely on theyve reached down to the bottom of the barrel and its us theyve pulled out its crazy daft idiotic you volunteered so stop whining so close together like lovers that the words barely needed articulation badgers murmur in foxys ear and the two camouflage head kits were almost meshed foxys response were the end of the road for them or the barrels scrapings whichever and theyll feel good they ve done something put two arseholes daft idiots into harms way itll go on the papers they write and theyll get congratulated what chance is there that the target will walk out of his front door and shout in farsi i can understand and no fancy dialect to the bloody sky heh anyone there if you are and youre upset about the growth in my wifes head you need to know im off in the morning to vienna rome kiev stockholm any place where theres someone with good knife skills hear that well see him go perhaps where to well see farewells tears et cetera where are they headed weve no chance you could have refused and theyd have let me walk away grow up young un theyd have made sure it haunted me the rest of my days no more work considered unsuitable branded lack of commitment youre held by the short and curlies didnt the lady tell you or wasnt she talking too much best you shut your mouth but they can have their lunch and their gin and can congratulate themselves that they tried were audacious and when we crawl out of here and get back dont expect a load of backslapping and gratitude they wont remember your name it has no chance badger murmured saying that because youre scared shitless or do you mean it no chance what do you think i think youre crap try it again i know youre crap he thought foxy was close to hitting him and they both lay motionless badger watched as the security man roved the area with his glasses he didnt know if foxy had spoken the truth that they had no chance were small pawns and served other agendas i will do it subject to satisfactory arrangements he was asked what arrangements would have to be satisfactory the consultant had gone out of the building and loitered in front of the cafe he was not overheard he had dialled the number given him had been held at the embassys switchboard for perhaps a halfminute which he thought excessive and when the call was answered he received no apology the patient must have a name there must be a date of arrival and he was interrupted the life of the hospital and the medical school flowed past him the rain fell and snow threatened there was often snow when the christmas market began in lubeck in the square in front of the rathaus and beside the marienkirche then it was prettier and the traders coined cash he was not of course a christian but his wife went to services most sundays and took their daughter and on special saints days he would attend with them the patient would arrive as soon as it could be arranged and the name would be given him when he saw the patient did anything else need to be satisfactory what would be the method of payment these are expensive procedures we require guarantees money lodged in escrow a bankers draft a credit card or a hardening of a faraway distorted voice had he forgotten who he was what he owed did greed govern him im not talking about myself there are technicians scans xrays assume that surgery is a possibility then you have theatre and intensive care his temper was shortening the patient cannot have that type of intervention hours of it then be put out into a winters night he would be told about financial arrangements when the timing and date of the patients journey to north germany were known the call ended he pocketed his phone went inside the building and sucked in a long breath he wrapped a smile of confidence and competence around his face and greeted his first patient of the day his wife waved to him from his car he watched her go all the sentries and security guards knew her if they hadnt there would have been bedlam at his stopping so close to the main gates and inside the concrete teeth placed to prevent access to a car bomber gabbi watched her and for a moment almost unseen his lips moved in to kiss her she swung the stick in front of her legs and went to the guard who controlled the pedestrians entrance with her free hand she would have gestured towards the id in the plastic pouch that hung from her neck all the sentries and guards would greet her they saw her coming and going swinging the white stick and getting to work or heading home as if there were no impediment in her life he shared her with many he left the ministry building and took a route from the city to the south there was a complex at givat herzl that had a smallarms firing range soundproofed at the rear those who used the range as many women as men were from the national dignitary protection unit and the secret service and there were soldiers who did bodyguard duties for senior military staff the instructors knew most of the client base some fired at circle targets others used lifesized figures gabbi had asked for a figure a head wrapped in a keffiyeh he did the fast slide of the pistol from a waist holster then the doubletap shots for the head they did not consider chest shots or those aimed at the stomach to be of any value the instructors taught that bullets should be aimed at the skull that day his weapon was the baby eagle the jericho f with a nineshot magazine manufactured inside the country the instructors would never have been told of the role he played in the affairs of israel would not have expected or wanted it they had seen the clients come and go and could make judgements on the work the shooters did what they trained for gabbi used a different technique on the range from that employed by protection or those who hoped to be close enough to take down a suicide bomber they fired in screened booths and only the instructors would have seen gabbi with his back to the target shape then producing the weapon from under his lightweight coat spinning whipping the pistol up aiming steadying it holding it cleanly doing the squeeze and it was doubletap the instructors would tell him each time he fired twice where his bullets had struck they had nothing to teach gabbi he would not have claimed his skills were too great for him to need practice sweat ran on him clogging at the edges of the ear baffles he was a man apart and did not laugh with others and had no friends there but he had the instructors respect it was somewhere to go somewhere to pass the time while he waited for the call and he never tired of the cordite whiff or the rippling recoil through his wrists forearms and elbows and the kick of the baby eagle the instructors could have made a judgement on his work because he always fired at the head was only interested in head hits that would drop a man dead others would not have coped with the waiting but gabbi could later after a wasted day he would be at the ministrys gate watching for the woman pretty with the white stick and would pick up leah all the shots he had fired had been at the head and all would have killed time to think time to reflect and time to brood len gibbons waited and the phones stayed silent other officers in the towers with time on their hands would have been with sarah in the single room allocated him at the club not len gibbons and not sarah she had made fresh coffee and brought with it a plate of biscuits he owed his wife catherine too much not that it made a jot of difference in sarahs case as she rebuffed all advances from whichever direction and had done since a captain in the life guards had dumped her in favour of a girl from the intelligence corps that had been after the first banns were read he was hugely in debt to catherine and doubted he would ever pay it off he was to everyone who knew him in the towers len gibbons when he was young and catherine was his new wife and the world had seemed at his feet he could have anticipated that within a few years he would be leonard gibbons and on a fast track to the higher ranks his career had come to a juddering halt and the scars were still on his back but for that impact he might have climbed to great things and had not by a thread by a fingernail he had survived damaged a professional debacle and she had stood by him when the scale of his failure had made him nearly suicidal with her encouragement he had hung on and had known that on his record was the condemnation of what had been codenamed antelope that the best he could hope for was to be labelled diligent or worse conscientious the debt ran wider than his wife it permeated the building from which he worked he could therefore be given any bag of excrement and the safety of his hands would ensure that the job was done if he set his mind to it he still had good recall of that bloody border the watchtowers the dogs and the guns he called through the door that the coffee was excellent and thanked her for the biscuits his phone stayed silent and he waited the engineer explained to the brigadier the first principles of the bombs he had made which were now stockpiled and kept in underground storage they would use low explosives and he spoke of tatps contents triacetone triperoxide had minimal scent emitted no vapours and would go undetected by even the besttrained sniffer dogs he told the brigadier who sat stern rapt not interrupting as if he recognised the privilege of access to a man of renown about the blast effects of the largerscale bombs he worked on there was first the positive phase when the windows of buildings adjacent to the bomb were blown in then the negative phase when the debris and glass shards were airborne and dragged out again to refill the vacuum created by the blast calm emotionless he told the officer who would have responsibility for the defence of the province if the troops of the great satan were unwise enough to invade the islamic republic with ground forces of the effects of explosives detonating blast lung injuries from the thrust into the ears nose and throat more injuries from the highvelocity impact of the ball bearings incorporated into the bomb and the glass splinters raining down on a street or flying inside buildings further injuries as soldiers of the enemy were thrown across a street and careered into buildings or cars their brains bouncing against the inner wall of their skulls with a dry smile he indicated a photograph on the wall of an american soldiers helmet an arrow pointed out of a ventilation hole in its side he said that such openings provided a conduit that concentrated blast into the hole like the driving in of a nail he spoke too of the mediumterm damage to troops psychology if they had been exposed to situations where bombs were widespread particularly if there had been casualties in their unit a large number of enemy combatants in the iraq war had gone home with posttraumatic stress disorder as sick as if they had been severely wounded and would not return the brigadier grimaced as the engineer finished and told him that he almost alone was responsible for the defeat of the coalition inside iraq his weapons had destroyed the will and resolve of the enemy he had smiled and shrugged many this year had come to his office had sat where the brigadier sat and congratulated him on his achievement what news was there of the war in afghanistan did it affect his work the brigadier asked he said it was a low priority that the devices used by the resistance were simpler than those employed in iraq they had been taught had been supplied with chemicals and explosives and he had written papers but he kept them at arms distance it was iraq that had mattered where the true victory had been won then they drank sweet tea with cardamom saffron rose water and liberally spooned sugar from small glasses and smoked the brigadier raised it he had heard of the illness of the engineers wife and was privy to plans for sending her abroad for consultation and hopefully treatment they talked about suitcases what sort and size would be best for the journey the brigadier had recently been in damascus with new baggage and could offer advice when the tray had been cleared the engineer spoke to the brigadier of the theory of roadside thermobaric bombs the ability of fuelair explosions to devastate and their potential inside trucks and saloon cars that could be driven by a martyr into the doorway of a building there the blast would be confined and enhanced he was working on that on miniaturisation of the circuit boards for the explosive formed projectile on extending the range of passive infrared beams and he yawned then flushed embarrassed he apologised he was told he had nothing to apologise for he said confiding that it was difficult to focus on his work he was asked if he knew an itinerary he hoped to hear that day or the next when he would travel with his wife it had simmered but had been below boiling the spat stayed with them but was carried along on whispers almost soundless and the voices played like soft winds on the front of their camouflaged headpieces foxy said he needed water badger said he had drunk his ration for the morning foxy said the biscuits tasted foul badger said he thought they were good foxy said they should move to their right maybe forty paces and be deep in the reeds for greater protection badger said it was important they had an eyeball on the property and could ping the target foxy had looked at his watch and wondered barely aloud what his ellie was doing at that moment he had started to relate how they had met and badger had cut him off said he wasnt interested foxy hissed are you contrary for the sake of it you think i want to be here with you the fuck i do the most difficult awkward oppo ever given me i make a remark about my wife and youre not interested correct im not interested in your wife whos special who i miss who i not interested and badger as usual spoke the truth he wasnt interested in foxys wife and didnt want to talk about her he was interested in the onestorey house of concrete blocks the big front windows which were open the door ajar the chairs and table outside in the shade and he was interested in the guard who sometimes sat on a chair and sometimes walked sometimes coughed and spat sometimes smoked and who had now started to fish with a short rod worms and a float he watched the boat that was tied near the little concrete pier he saw the wife who was dying and walked with a stick and the children who were chided by an older woman when they screamed too loudly and too close to their mother if he and foxy didnt talk they didnt argue he knew that the long motionless hours played havoc with foxys knee and hip joints but couldnt bring himself to sympathise hours passed and the sun cooked them he thought how vulnerable they were vulnerable enough for him to bloody near wet himself he would never again volunteer never again shove his hand up the explosion burst in badgers ears chapter foxy knew the sound of an artillery shell exploding there had only been a slight squirm of the young uns body but it was enough to show him badger was ignorant of weapons detonations it gave him pleasure he twisted his head slowly cranked his neck round far enough to see the smoke pall first stationary then climbing into the clear blue of the sky it was off to the right near to the raised bund line it rose spread and began to lose shape silence fell he felt now a heavy pressure on his shoulder as if a hand was spread wide and forced down he could move only his head not his upper body badger had hold of him his pleasure at badgers initial reaction had dissipated he couldnt move was treated like a passenger who wouldnt know how to react in a crisis and needed to be held still what did the man think he was going to do jump up yell and bloody run he couldnt free himself of the hand but could manoeuvre his head tilt his neck and look to the front there was shouting the goon the one he had identified as mansoor who had the rank of an officer and was in charge of security obviously was on his feet out of the chair quick enough for it to have toppled behind him and there were yelled instructions coming into foxys earphones the guard was to be called out weapons drawn from the armoury the sergeant to be found a patrol prepared the pressure of the hand on his shoulder eased a gradual weakening of the force he thought that badger regarded him as old and second class the officer had stopped yelling and now stood rooted in front of the fallen chair his binoculars were at his eyes and he traversed up and down from the bund line to the reed beds and on to the far end of the open ground the lenses would have covered with each sweep the apparently snagged mess of dead reeds in which the microphone was hidden they would have gone over the water under which the cable was sunk across the sand where it was buried and travelled on to the heaps of dried leaves that the wind would seem to have whipped together in the lenses view would be the shoulders of the gillie suits and the tops of the headgear and perhaps the hands caked with mud and the optics that had scrim netting round them and were tilted down so that the sun didnt hit the glass it was a test a good one instinct told foxy to duck his head further chin against chest fill his face with mud and lower the headgear the last halfinch that was possible not to look not to dare to see whether the glasses had moved on from the points that could identify him and badger they did he watched and the glasses scanned where the microphone was the cable was buried and where they were he wriggled couldnt help himself it started as a moan had gained in pitch and was now a scream he had to twist his pelvis lift his hips and backside three inches get the bottle under his crotch and feel the relief the voice in his face had a harder edge what the fucks the matter with you i was pissing couldnt you wait no not the best moment under close observation an alert tie a bloody knot in it not the best moment the scream had raised the birds in panic flight disturbing them more than the explosion had he shifted the bottle so that he could cap it then pushed it back under himself using a knee to get it down by his boots they were still wet from the insertion march but manageable wet boots and socks were the least of the problem not the best moment because of the screams now behind them and the sight of troops jogging along the bund line could have been a halfdozen and the officer was on the low pier that jutted out into the lagoon waving directions he had had to use the bottle men were coming close and frightened little voices edged nearer carefully minimum movement foxy raised a forefinger and eased one of the earpieces back he had now the officer in his left ear and the noises off to the right stumbling curses and whimpers in the other he could see the troops on top of the bund line most had rifles and two had machinepistols the woman had come out and used her stick to take her weight as she made her way from the door to where the officer stood she asked if a mine had exploded and was told that it was more likely an artillery shell maybe mm calibre she asked if pilgrims had detonated it he heard the quaver in her voice and assumed it was concern not the severity of her illness the officer said it was more likely to have been thieves there were dumps in the marshes from the old war and this one might have been stockpiled iraqi munitions perhaps for the artillery pieces of the revolutionary guard corps she knew of the abandoned dumps he sent her away but with courtesy and urged that the children be kept inside all the family should be at the back of their house not by the front windows that made sense to foxy foulkes familiar enough with the ways of the world in iran or in iraq to comprehend why an educated woman and her young children should stay away from their windows and not see what there had been enough of it in iraq when he had served there and the ammunition technical officers had spoken of it they said that the main targets for looters were the copper wires from telephone cables and the casings from artillery shells if the shells were live they would reckon to know where the detonator was belt it away with a sledge and free the casing the casings made good money in the souk and if a few entrepreneurs didnt make it to the market god would take care of their families the atos said they saw too many broken bodies limbs left up trees guts smeared on walls when the sledge hammer had hit the wrong part of the shell the casings could be brass or chromate steel or anodysed aluminium a primer and a propellant of black powder were inside the casing at the tip the warhead might have held high explosive or mustard gas the next scream was closer and the hushing increasingly desperate of those around the casualty they might have been stampeding animals as they ran foxy had lost sight of the soldiers who had come along the bund line and he realised that the fugitives were driven by a cordon of guns towards the reed bank that protected him and the young un the open ground and the water either side of the raised mud on which they had their hide some luck the way the dice came down foxy thought his freedom depended on the young uns skills might be more than his freedom might be his life the skills were those of concealment what badger had done with the scrape in the mud and the camouflage covering it the mud on what little of their skin might be visible the weaving of dead foliage into the gillie suits and the headgear might be good enough to save him and might not it had been painstaking at the time before dawn foxy had thought it exhibitionist shit pernickety little movements that tested the weight and colour of individual fronds before discarding them or threading them into the suits if the work was not done carefully enough there would be a rifle barrel against the nape of his neck his bergen was on his right side and the other on badgers left he himself lay on the spotter scope and its small tripod the first of them in flight broke through the wall of the reed bed they stopped dead in their tracks they wouldnt have known where they were running to they had lost cover were in a culdesac as far as flight went boxed in the stomach wall of the one who had screamed was split open and his tshirt was dragged up he seemed to be trying to hold in his intestines with his crossed forearms another man had hold of his elbow and tried to support him but scarlet fluid was running onto his trousers two more carried a dead man who hung like a rag doll in their grip another with ashen cheeks hopped forward in their wake holding upright a teenage boy in a long bright shirt it was bloodstained from navel to knee he had to hop because his left leg had been taken off immediately below the knee they would have seen the open ground and the water and they would have heard those not screaming or moaning the pursuit behind them in the reed bed and might have seen across the lagoon the officer waving his little force forward and heard the bawled orders they crumpled all of them into the mud soldiers came through the reeds and hope died one walked so close that his foot must have come down on the young uns bergen it was a dustsmeared boot and would have sagged as it stepped on the lower half of the rucksack but the rifle was aimed at the gang cowering and the next step missed badgers feet he took little breaths just the barest amount of air while ants or small spiders half drowned in the sweat on his face he endured the irritations he had forgotten almost that badger was beside him he didnt hear any breathing or feel any movement but he heard the officers shout across the water he couldnt see him now but imagined that he cupped his hands in front of his mouth to give the order foxy gagged he had heard the order it would have been faint to the soldiers but it was loud and clear to foxy he tried to swallow but there was no moisture in his throat worse vomit seemed to creep up to the back of his mouth foxy had been with the army in northern ireland in the bad days when feelings had run high with the military and he had been with the interrogators at the basra airport complex when tempers were lost but he had never heard an order given by a uniformed man such as the one that drifted over the still waters of the lagoon and was crystal sharp in his ear they were shot one by one it wasnt a killing where an automatic weapon was aimed in their general direction foxy couldnt see it but assumed that the sergeant a short man with a machine pistol in a tunic a size too small for him had done the shooting single shots a stench of cordite a whimper from some a curse from others quiet from a few under any circumstances would foxy have intervened no they could have been raping grandmothers pushing down hooded prisoners onto soft drink bottles so that the neck penetrated and he would have stayed silent the corpses were dragged away he heard the slither of the bodies on wet ground then the cracking of reed stems as they were pulled through denser concentrations later when those sounds ended he heard the faraway splashes of burial in water and wondered if they had found stones to weight them they would have been arabs most likely from iraq they had come across the border because this was more likely to be virgin ground for the collectors of shell cases their crime was to have crossed the frontier and what had made it a capital offence was that they had strayed into a most sensitive part of the restricted zone it was a dangerous thought one he had not entertained during his fourmonth posting to the interrogation team it risked sapping his commitment what in gods name had he and his comrades been doing there what were they doing there now what had they been doing there in days gone by when british squaddies had patrolled yanks had driven by in their armourplated carriers the footsoldier was pleased to get a tendollar bill for putting the roadside bomb in place and some damn man who had glasses goodfeatures a finelooking wife who was dying and kids who were frightened had laboured at a bench making the bombs that took the lives in this place which stank of donkey dog fly and human shit the rant rioted in his mind what were they doing there the answer would need a cleverer man than foxy he could have praised badger for making the scrape constructing the hide saving them but he didnt perhaps he was too preoccupied to hand out praise he would have given his left testicle bollock for the chance to hold on to ellie cling to her would have given the whole handful of his tackle for the chance to hold her and be loved fractionally beside him badger shifted his arms moved and then his elbow dug sharply into foxys ribcage he passed foxy a flapjack foxy ate the flapjack then said wiping crumbs lifes cheap worth nothing especially an arabs iranians would see it like shooting a diseased dog dont expect there to be a court of human rights getting steamed up about it badger said nothing they should have been bonded by the experience but foxy realised that neither would offer anything to the other the officer was back on his chair and his glasses were at his chest the ducks and waders were again on the water and the officer had his float out watching it the woman had come out from the house with her mother who carried the washing basket and the kids had their plastic toys the guards had resumed their watch from the shade of the palm trees hard to believe it had happened that anything had happened he thought he and badger would not have been so fortunate it would not have been quick interrogation torture slow execution and not by a bullet he had no idea what he was doing there then and now what was his business he would have liked to talk about ellie but the man beside him had no interest in her the washing was pegged out in the sunshine and the children played the officer caught two small fish which he unhooked and threw back nothing was said and nothing was learned then the shivers started rustling the old fronds that covered them and he couldnt help himself so nearly dead and so damned isolated the marsh area is one of the great wonders of the world it is a unique and precious place were doing everything we can to protect your homes keep you safe and to maintain the habitat of many centuries the crowd had more than doubled might have trebled abigail jones was at the broken gate she had put a scarf over her hair and still wore the loose cool robe she had a bag a local craftwork effort slung on her shoulder and in it were her communications her medical pack and her pistol with two spare magazines three flash grenades and a purse with some money she had reflected that the bag contained all that the modern young woman needed if she was promenading in sunny iraq different from what would be in the bags of the girls she had been at school with or shared benches with in college lecture rooms shed have said that the comms the pack with the dressings and morphine syringes were the most important items not the weapons because she had harding behind her the m would be slung across his chest his thumb would be on the safety his finger on the trigger guard and there would be a bullet in the breach were trying to let the whole world know how beautiful and how important are the marshlands where you live we want to establish the extent of the wildlife that has survived the war with iran the persecution by saddam and now the drought we need to say with accuracy what birds are here and what animals we dont want to interfere in any way with your lives the whole world knows of the hospitality of the madan people but we ask that you leave us to count the birds and other creatures if they believed that shit theyd believe anything they didnt they were close to her there was no hostility in the eyes but the sort of deadened dullness that came from poverty hardship and the sense that an opportunity had presented itself two vehicles good for stripping radios binoculars and telescopes that would fetch useful money in the souk at alamara weapons that would augment those filched from previous conflicts fought out in the marshes she had heard that old turkish rifles retrieved after the battle of alqurna december and britishissued lee enfields were still seen on a tribesmans shoulder there were also food medical supplies and money little whistles of breath came between hardings teeth his way when he was tense he would have known she was talking shit and convincing none of them but she had started and would finish and her arabic was fair enough for her to be understood we ask you please to leave us so that the birds and the creatures are not disturbed and we can count and observe them later when we have finished we will reward your cooperation generously were doing this for you she thought she had sounded so hollow they gazed back at her they might decide that she and her guards were weak and rush the gate might decide that they could shift around the fence down in many places infiltrate and overwhelm or they might conclude it best to wait till darkness not many hours away the eyes stripped her she had like everyone who did a baghdad posting read the works of the explorers mostly british from a halfcentury or a century before who lauded the culture of the madan men and the lifestyle of many millennia they would kill her steal from her body maybe rape her after death and blood lust would determine that the bodies of corky shagger hamfist and harding were mutilated it wasnt political nothing to do with the offensive intrusion of a foreign army it was all about the economic necessity of survival requiring items of value to be taken to the souk at alamara even basra and flogged off so that a new widescreen television could be bought with the generator to power it she smiled to the front and said in english from the side of her mouth not an overwhelming response im getting nowhere it wasnt my shout maam it had been abigail joness decision to seek out the abandoned exploration site and the more reliable maps showed no settlements near to it there had been no alternative actually she didnt know hardings given name and knew less about him than she did about any of the rest of her detail she had never learned what military units he had been with airborne armour marines military police he stayed apart from the banter of the others but when he spoke it was worth her while to hear him out all that was personal about harding who had been with proeliator security for eight years was in his wallet a photograph of a woman a frail face under sparse grey hair not his mother but the aunt who had brought him up in abject penury somewhere in the midwest she thought that when this was over hed hit the russian whores in the dubai hotels he was the smartest of the team immaculate each day in his fatigues and careful she liked that valued it i dont see this as sustainable when theyre hungry enough maam or thirsty theyll come could be tomorrow or the day after could be tonight or in half an hour wed have to drop a hell of a number of them to win not what were here for it would be a disaster dont even think about it she kept the smile fixed but none of them stepped a halfpace back and nobody answered her if theyd heard hardings voice recognised him as american he might not be killed but sold on there were chickens in cages in the souk waiting to be sold and slaughtered goats and sheep that were worth good money theyd get a better price for the american than they would for corky shagger and hamfist she turned to harding talk to me itll be hard to stay here maam but here is within an acceptable distance of our people further back wherever thats possible is not acceptable already theyre hung out rags in the wind i dont see an option hard as it is staying our ground i hear you my opinion maam its not possible and the other guys would say it to leave them out there beyond help wouldnt be able to hold my head high again then well hack it somehow thank you they might be lucky and they might not they might have time the angels singing with them and they might not she bit her lip have i spoken out of turn maam she shook her head he had spoken with politeness respect but had given a clear message rags in the wind and two men far forward couldnt be left after guarantees had been given she had little sense of honour obligation when she gave the services word but her men would have believed in necessary trust and she had felt the younger man against her body inside it hack it and sweat it out she walked away from the gate and considered how many dollars to feed out now how many later the consultant phoned berlin he leaned back in his chair and gazed through the window at the sleet spattering the glass he gave the switchboard the name and was asked his own my name is steffen i am calling from lubeck the connection was made he didnt waste time on pleasantries he began with the costs in euros there was the fee for his own time for the clinic nurses for the scanner and the fee for xrays for the staff operating the scanner and the radiology team he continued with the potential sums required if the examination showed that a stereotactic was possible and that an operation had a chance of success then added you should have no anxiety that we would conduct the procedure merely to gain the payments when we have no hope of a favourable outcome we have a long waiting list we only take a patient into theatre when there are grounds for optimism the numbers were in front of him and bounced in his eyes a consultation and examination and a verdict that denied hope would cost thousands of euros surgery then close supervision in intensive care and a further period of convalescence would add up to tens of thousands he said that debit cards could be used in advance but not credit cards or cheques a money order taken out on a german bank would be acceptable were discounts available to the islamic republic he said that his own remuneration might be subject to a realistic adjustment but all other fees were nonnegotiable he had made provisional reservations for facilities on the following monday the fees were agreed he finished such a reservation will attract comment because as yet the patient has no identity i am not interested in the patients name but would be grateful for one that matches a passport and the medical records brought from tehran i would suggest a name is furnished as quickly as possible or suspicion will be aroused we are talking about an initial appointment for nine in the morning monday he allowed a whiff of sarcasm i trust that finding a name for the patient will not prove too great a problem the consultant rang off he had pushed to the limits but he had won nothing and danced to their tune in his office len gibbons moved paper round his desk sent it in clockwise circles the other way then north south east and west the phone did not ring the sheets were the contents of two files cardboard and downloaded from the computer the phone did not ring because there was obviously nothing to report from that faraway front line nothing of significance it was the life of intelligence officers such as len gibbons who handled men and women who were sent across borders and were at the extremities of survival that the phone only rang when matters reached breaking point he liked to have paper on his desk and regarded the screen as a poor substitute through the door which was open he could see sarah was at her desk typing briskly not in the style of his own battering two fingers she would be busying herself with the detail of the accounts for the operation wise sensible and minddestructively dull nor had there been contact from the towers the paper he moved anticlockwise was headlined joseph paul foulkes it wasnt the first time he had read the resume of a biography or

moral support he was isolated he could have contaminated others so they had effectively consigned him to the leper colony he had the funds the contacts the links and was cast adrift if it all fouled

by his parents paul and debbie baxter on the outskirts of reading his father sold secondhand cars and his mother took care of the books they lived at burghfield close to the atomic weapons establishment schooled at a comprehensive and regarded as an underachiever criticised in schoolleaving report as a noncontributor accepted into the thames valley police in and initial reports described him as quiet resourceful and utterly dependable what had changed gibbons could almost have recited it hed read it often enough one referee had been a doctor an obsessional birder who treated baxters parents baxter had taken him to flooded gravel pits west of reading where he had led him on his stomach closer than hed imagined possible to the perch from which a kingfisher dived he had raved about the mindset and calm of the applicant a second referee had been a local accountant who prepared the businesss final tax papers and whom baxter had taken to the kennet where they had sat through a summer evening watching a female otter with her cubs feeding and playing he had written of the young mans patience and dedication had been taken into the force crop unit at extraordinarily young after three years as an undistinguished beat constable had found his vocation court evidence for a narcotics untouchable at wantage and the principal surveillance on a tinkers site at windsor doubling as a thieves kitchen had been drafted into the west country regional office of the box reported to have the highest standards of professionalism not academic not particularly intelligent but an operator of genuine class almost teetotal does not smoke no known hobbies but holidays are spent hiking alone in the west of scotland if they won through him on the back of foxy and badger in cooperation with the cousin and the friend he would be able to go back to the towers to a place dedicated to need to know word would have seeped through the cracks in the walls and he would be the star of the moment few would know what he had done what had been gained only that a triumph lay at the services feet for many years almost the totality of his career a catastrophe in the terms of intelligence gathering had dogged him triumph wherever it was to be found would help to wipe away dim memories of the watchtowers fences and deceits of the trade but it would be on the backs of those two men foxy and badger he was skilled at judging others gutting their files and could assess himself he still suffered from a cruelty in the youth of his career seemed to make a virtue of dullness and reliability and kept his passions covert from work colleagues he had the chance now to walk tall in the corridors of the towers and take what he thought was his rightful place on the benches of those with influence if two men performed if luck favoured them and if the dice rolled well if the telephone didnt ring and he moved the papers until they seemed to have little meaning then he looked at the pictures sarah had pasted on the walls and an outline of a face gazed down at him it had no eyes nose or mouth and was an enemy he couldnt imagine where they were foxy and badger or how they were she was in front of him inside the bakery waiting to be served he and beryl were next in the queue and he must have banged her elbow with the sleeve that held the two parts of the pole that carried the standard of his royal british legion branch she turned and he recognised her she smiled and he sensed that beryl didnt understand hello doug bentley said so youre back again i come to quite a few she answered and gave a little shrug afterwards i get some bread here it had been a big turnout that day he and beryl had done their usual thing one bus from their own village into swindon then the from swindon to wootton bassett they had met friends the new colleagues they had come to know from their journeys to the town too many of those journeys he did not think it impertinent to ask are you often here in the town she said only when theyre bringing the heroes through its so moving so emotional i come when i can i always see you he had his position with his standard in the line and opposite the war memorial he was well placed each time and faced the relatives who had brought flowers usually roses from the florist behind the library i wouldnt miss it doug bentley said its a responsibility ive been given by our branch to be here the way i see it id be letting them down those coming through if i wasnt here if i just reckoned to be too busy its a responsibility and a privilege youre right the customer at the counter had paid picked up the paper bag with chocolate caramel slices and now eased out of her way she asked for a loaf and he took a step forward beryl was fidgeting in her purse for coins it had been a big turnout because of the work the serviceman had done in afghanistan ammunition technical officer explosive ordnance disposal down on hands and knees defusing roadside bombs many photographs of him young a sergeant had been held up by relatives and posters with messages of love and admiration so many of those who came through wootton bassett had been cut down by the bombs and this man had lost his life in trying to make the wretched things safe in his own military service pay corps national service never out of the uk doug bentley had never come across any officer or nco who would have attracted the level of support that the bomb men had when the bell tolled in the high street the hearse came up the incline and the funeral director walked with his top hat off and his staff in his hand when the relatives had had their chance to put the flowers on the roof and touch the shiny black bodywork that day there had been rivulets of rain running down through the flowers and tears cascading down faces doug bentley had had his head lowered in respect and his eye had been on the black ribbon at the top of the pole above his standard he did not know why good men so loved and held in such regard needed to chance their lives in defusing dangerous devices out in the middle of deserts and in ditches beside fields she paid she faced him and smiled ive changed my hair fancy you recognising me hed known her because of the chain round her neck and the name in gold letters hanging above her blouse resting on the skin where the cleavage started he lied with a grin im good with faces and good with names ellie he didnt say he recognised her because the buttons of her blouse worn under an open winter coat were out of order as if they had been fastened in a hurry she was gone and the shops doorbell rang as she closed the door behind her he asked for a loaf a cob his wifes voice grated in his ear shes been shagging again hasnt she its that tart you spoke to in the summer a woman can always tell shes wearing a wedding ring so its a boyfriend shes been shagging and shell have a husband whos being twotimed and is too pathetic to know it can you not foxy for fucks sake stop your hand moving im trying cant you try harder rare for badger to criticise and rare for him to be with an oppo he hadnt chosen doing continuous stags with only faint chances of a doze not proper sleep last time it had been like a holidaycamp talent contest except that ged hadnt been stripped down to a bikini he had chosen his oppo after going to the line manager and complaining theyd shown out because george had coughed in a bush and theyd had to bloody run george was dumped feet didnt touch the ground he would have preferred a rookie with him now someone who had no knowledge of the tradecraft of covert rural work who would take orders and do as he was instructed and who had been there only to listen for farsi talk badger had good hearing and the shake of the hand beside him was an increasing irritation like a dripping tap theyd had the confession about the language i cant stop it youre tired im tired youre hungry and thirsty so am i youre stressed im stressed youre shaking im not im doing my best not good enough try biting it the confession had been the final issue he could almost take the shake of foxys hand with the rustle of the dead fronds it was what he had said to badger that had made a tipping point hed hidden it and now hed trotted it out a car with a military escort riding inside the cab had pulled up at the front of the house a man had climbed out then gone to the back and opened a rear door he had extracted a bouquet of flowers massive and colourful then gone towards the officer mansoor they had spoken the man had been taken to the door and the wife had come out she had accepted the flowers and the car had driven away badger had seen in the glasses that she had had to fight to control her tears what happened hed asked i dont know isnt it working is the gear down gears great why dont you know its the language the children were out again and the officer had gone back to fishing no bites and smoking badger could see the flowers inside through the open window hadnt anyone known not the boss the american the israeli or fucking foulkes himself had they known and kept quiet in the confession the star word had been dialect there were dialects in farsi tribes had dialects regions had dialects the north and south had dialects as did the east and west there was the vernacular and there was the classical foxy had classical but the vernacular was what the troops spoke and the officer spoke in the confession it was stated that half of what came through the earphones was rough translation and half was accurate how had foulkes managed with the interrogation team he hadnt enough of the language to grasp the nuances that betrayed a mans lie the diplomats he had tracked out of london who had talked with young militants in students unions were educated and spoke classical what could he not understand he hadnt understood what the officer said to the man who brought the flowers or most of what the engineer had said to his wife but he had been fine on the meeting shed taken because that had been formal the hands shook they were together hip against hip shoulder against shoulder two plastic bags by their knees and four bottles of urine they might not even understand the mention of a destination if they were lucky enough to hear one badger said youre useless full of shit youre arrogant full of conceit and piss you you wouldnt even have scraped through in my day i passed out well my day it was a proper test your day health and fucking safety killed the hard bits you wouldnt have come through he was drawn in shouldnt have been i was top rated in marks did you do the claustrophobia one buried in a box with a pencilwide air vent in darkness silence and last thing you hear is the instructors walking away left for half an hour you do that theyd scaled it back wasnt permitted send you up the fire brigade tower did they the vertigo test no restraint harness and lean over the edge of the towers top to read the numberplate of a car parked right under you how were you at that as you well know it had been banned dump you in a car boot did they drive you over rough ground bouncing bashing the boot opens and theres a german shepherd looking to make a meal of you was that tough it had been ditched and isolation what about water and a biscuit pack driven to the far end of an airport fence dropped off and told to sit against it never lose contact with it theres a car parked two hundred yards away and you have to log everything that happens to it moves near it the hazard lights might flash at midnight a guy walks past in midmorning youre there as many as sixty hours and you miss anything youve failed how did you do theyve cut it back its not the same did you do a run with a twentykilo pack two and a half klicks in twelve minutes we did that anyway i did claustrophobia the tower the boot isolation and stamina and i came out top in my class they give you a medal the training counted for something and should be respected badger said assuming its not the wrong dialect and not the wrong tribe and you can manage what youre here for whats being said they lapsed into quiet and watched the mercedes pulled up left the dust cloud to fragment behind it the driver was out snappily came round the front of the car and opened the door for the engineer they had been together enough years for them to do smalltalk on journeys football teams that the engineer had never seen and films he would never go to but he valued the conversations his own door was opened and he was handed the bag that held his laptop and the papers he had worked on he stood arched his back and stretched out the stiffness from the journey the driver opened the boot and lifted out the new suitcase carried it to the door then bobbed his head dutifully and was in his car driving away mansoor came to him i think your wife is resting and that her mother is with the children and their books mansoors voice was breathy hoarse as if he had shouted and strained his throat he demonstrated the wheels on the new case ran them on the concrete of the patio in front of the door showed how they went in all directions and grimaced he asked what that day had happened and was told men had been close in the marshes thieves but they had been intercepted efficiently how was his wife he asked good but tired he could smoke in his car but not in his house he could smoke in his office and in meetings but not in the presence of his children she dictated the rules he could not say how long remained for her a month more or the duration of his life he did not know how long the rules she had laid down would exist there were two pigs in the water near to a reed bed and close to the spit that came off the open ground some two hundred metres from their pier he watched them a fullgrown boar and a young sow emerge from the reeds and sink themselves into the water only nostrils and eyes above the surface huge creatures they moved effortlessly and with grace mansoor told him that before the thieves came he had been watching for the african sacred ibis but had not seen one after the thieves had been intercepted he had fished but had not caught a carp worth keeping large enough to eat the engineer had no interest in the bird had less than no interest in the fishing he did not share his cigarettes but smoked and walked to the limit of the small pier where the dinghy was tied he was glad that naghmeh was resting that she had not been at the door to greet him and see the new case with the special wheels him bringing the case home marked a moment of virtual finality when it was filled and they left the road ahead might fork in two directions they would head for recovery or death there was no middle way mansoor interrupted his quiet he did not wish of course to intrude in private matters but when was it likely they would travel the engineer said distant and distracted that the final arrangements were being put in place but soon soon they agreed it was a fine suitcase mansoor hovered behind him what did he have to say the voice was still throaty as if there had been crisis and shouting here the engineer was told he should not permit his driver to take him through ahvaz the following morning there would be another hanging at the prison a terrorist of the ahvaz cells an arab he confessed his crime placing a bomb near the headquarters of the police and named associates the sentence of death by hanging will be enforced another was with him he did not aid the interrogators and committed suicide i am told there will be powerful emotions in the city tomorrow and after the last experience there have been too many bombs from arab terrorists the penalty must be exacted you should keep out of the city he nodded watching the pigs swim and feed when the cigarette was finished he threw it down and watched it gutter in the water he went back to his house to find his children and show his wife the suitcase he had bought for their journey foxy whispered try this for a bedtime story to make you feel good the advice is to keep clear of the centre of ahvaz tomorrow because theyre hanging a terrorist sorry probably a joker that we or the yanks shoved funds at so hes a freedom fighter the arabs reckon theyre thirdclass citizens in the blessed islamic republic and risk their necks trying to blast the mullahs anyway hes going to be strung up and its likely to make people angry that tells me the local good guys are infiltrated compromised have snitches and touts in their cells and arent secure thats why you and i are here there was another who would have been sharing the gallows tomorrow but he topped himself when the goon speaks to the boss its good educated farsi and i can follow it have you anything else to say like an apology for bitching then sulking badger teased coldly you ready to say sorry no the house was bathed in light from fittings screwed to the top of the walls it fell on the patio and across the track to spread over the pier where the dinghy was tied and the water the engineer sat on the plastic chair and smoked he could have lived inside the camp of the alquds brigade in a fine bungalow near to the commandants residence or had an apartment overlooking the karun river near to the hotel fajr grand he might have been accommodated in a governmentowned villa near to the ahvaz airport but he lived here her choice it had been her decision that when the americans began to crowd onto their aircraft and head for home taking with them the bodybags so many of which he had filled they should make their home near to the water the marshes and old civilisations that captivated her and where she was close to her lifes passion the clearance of land mines she had supervised the renovation of the building had bullied architects and pleaded with builders had created the world she wanted and the pain had come there was moonlight on the far water the reeds and a spit of mud beyond the throw of the security lights and he saw the ripples the movement of the birds and confusion where pigs browsed he heard the racking cough of a sentry he had thought he understood it but he could not now imagine the future chapter foxy pinged her he thought the temperature inside the gillie suit was in excess of degrees centigrade more than fahrenheit he could have drunk water until his belly distended but would not they had carried in the water water where they were was more important than anything other than the audiocapture gear they could survive on little food concentrates with high protein and minimal sleep if the water was exhausted they would suffer dehydration which meant muscle and stomach cramps headaches weakness dizziness and heavy sweating foxy had heard on his basra tour that the body could lose a quart of moisture through sweat per hour he lay still ping was croppie talk for having a close view of a target could have been eyeball which was general for all police agencies on surveillance duties but the guys who bagged the shit bottled the piss and were an elite talked of pinging a target it was the talk that kept foxy alert good to think of himself as elite he deserved it she moved slowly in the sunshine at the front of the house her man was tango one and she was tango two foxy reckoned her more important to their endeavour than the husband and more likely to cough up the evidence of a destination when she was outside or when she was inside the room with the open window and he could see her shadow move or an interior light lit her he eased the controls lifted the volume and struggled for greater clarity in his earphones he believed it was from her that he would break the damn thing then get on the move retrieve the gear and head for the extraction point after this joe foxy foulkes not breaking any confidences of course and not spitting too much phlegm into the face of the official secrets act would be a big man a valued man a man in demand elite he deserved that title had done since the days hed lain in the hide on the hill above the farm near cappagh in county tyrone and been there long enough to feed the warning that the barrett calibre was on the move guys from intelligence and special forces had called his stakeout epic and the battalion adjutant the unit that had fouled up the cordon and missed the damn thing when it was moved had made a personal apology saying that such outstanding surveillance was shortchanged this was beyond any category he had before been involved in the young un slept beside him there was more washing going out more pegs slotting on the line childrens stuff and her husbands clothing she would not of course hang out her intimate clothing where it could be seen by the guards from the barracks her mother followed her and carried the plastic basket with the shirts shorts socks the kids dresses towels and washingup cloths he had the binoculars on her but didnt use the spotter scope the visuals were of small interest compared to the audio system wouldnt have said it into badgers ear but the microphone was well placed on the mud spit and well camouflaged the gear was good and the sound quality was fine but their language was difficult for him because they didnt speak mother and daughter in the classical but in the vernacular he understood each time she wanted another peg that the small boys shirt had not washed well and that the girl had torn a skirt playing outside he had to believe that the clue would be given him the young un slept it was unequal badger could sleep for the full three hours while foxy was on stag when foxy slept badger would elbow him if there was conversation on the patio he had been woken when the engineer had come from the house at dawn and paced at the waters edge enjoying his cigarette and talking about football scores with two of the guards he had been woken again when the car had come and the goon mansoor had repeated the warning about keeping clear of the centre of ahvaz then asked about the engineers day he had seen the shrug and heard a remark about meetings all the day is meetings and a question was asked about the suitcase but he had not caught the reply and had assumed that the wife approved of it then he had been allowed to sleep again twice he had received the elbow and been told that he was snoring foxy as routine dug his fist into badgers hip each halfhour to wake him and then lie that he was talking or grunting in his sleep if foxy couldnt crash out for three hours he was damned if badger would sleep without interruption yes it would be good there would be nods and winks hintsoffered but the secrecy governing where he had been and why would be preserved he would be introduced as the man who had gone into opposition territory who had lain up in circumstances of quite extraordinary privation had witnessed mass murder and delivered had won through he would talk about the skills and disciplines needed to achieve aims and ping targets who did he have with him or was he alone he might be asked that hed had a greenhorn something of a sherpa there basically to hump the gear hed enjoy that and would be feted ellie would be proud and the washing was out on the line and hung limp there was no wind there were more flies than before the flies had been bad the previous evening had disappeared during darkness and been replaced by mosquitoes now in the full glare of the sun the mosquitoes had gone and the flies were back big bastards they droned and probed at the scrim mesh on the camouflage headgear and they were on the mudcaked skin of his hands he thought it remarkable that they didnt wake badger that he could sleep through their persistence in the night badger had taken the shit bags and piss bottles out of the hide wriggled on his stomach into the reed bed dug a little pit on the water line buried the bags and emptied the bottles without the bags the flies should have been less interested didnt work that way theyd come on in swarms and searched for routes through the scrim into his ears mouth and nose settling on his hands he felt the prick as they bit but he couldnt anoint himself with repellent it would provide an alien scent she had the line filled with washing ellie often asked him to empty the washingmachine and put their things on a line when she was in a hurry for work and doing her makeup or running late it was usual for him to iron his shirts and her blouses he had learned to iron after hed gone to london leaving liz in the north with the children and did it well ellie was sometimes too busy with overtime at naval procurement to get home early and iron quite often foxy cooked the dinner he thought shed have been a finelooking woman if the illness hadnt ravaged her she was quite tall not dwarfed by her husband the lenses showed her figure when she moved and the robe was pressed against her body she would have seemed handsome from fifty or seventyfive yards with a strong nose good cheekbones and a chin that gave off authority different when he watched her through ten times magnification harsher lines a greater stoop in the shoulders and the wince at the mouth when she turned or reached up with the clothing or a peg he sensed a steeled determination to complete the basic task he watched her it was what he did well abigail jones had not met len gibbons she imagined because he was old school that he would have moved to a temporary billet a london club or a camp bed wherever he had set up his operations centre and that he paced even chainsmoked while he waited for a telephone call it would have been three years ago just before she was shipped out to iraq when she was coming to the end of her london duty that she had been leaving the canteen area and the older woman with her whom shed known from the balkans had stagewhispered a choice morsel about the man standing seeming elderly and vacant at the counter then moving his tray the telephone would not have rung because she had sent no message there was to be no radio traffic and no satphone communication other than to transmit information categorised critical she had nothing important to report the woman jennifer famed for indiscretion had been in belgrade while abigail worked in the sarajevo embassy and theyd become friends distant when sharing escape weekends on croatian beaches when you get down to baghdad darling dont eff it up like that one did in his youth in this hateful place they like to deal in onechanceonly scenarios a good man a nice man and they said he was really capable he was advanced given responsibilities such a sad story never recovered fully like blight in an apple orchard and it was thirty years ago gossip was forbidden mortal sin abigail had asked what the man had done and where he had done it jennifer had chuckled and declined to expand on her story except to tell her that the man was len gibbons left for ever like a bit of driftwood high and dry when the tide slipped out they had parted gone off in different lifts to different floors and she had forgotten about the tale until six years later she had been told len gibbons would field her reports when there was news worth imparting he was hardly going to want to know that she had lain in the sand swaddled in a mosquito net with her firearm on the ground beside her fastened by a lanyard to her wrist he was hardly going to be concerned that she had barely slept and that corky and harding hamfist and shagger would have slept less that those she proudly called the jones boys had used two flares and a thunder flash and had maintained a perimeter of sorts there hadnt been a charge but a creeping infiltration the creaking of stressed wire as the fences already sagging had been flattened the flares had stopped them had held them in the shadow at the edge of the light pool the thunder flash had scattered them driven them back hamfist was the one who knew most of this sector and hed claimed to read the madan mind you can give the feckers scuse miss a flash and a flare and well be ok if it gets to us chucking about the lead well have to quit the flares and the flash had stabilised it during the night and first light corky had urged her to get the treasury open we cant shoot them all miss or itll be worse than bloody sunday we should try to buy them do it like an auction start small and haggle like its the bazaar theyre all ali babas miss and dont forget it she could picture him shed seen him once in the canteen and a couple more times when hed been near her as shed come off a bus near to the towers entrance there had been a weighted look to him that of a man burdened shed define that as pallor in the complexion straggling hair a shuffle walk clothing that was a little too loose and above all wariness a sense of being left outside any loop that existed jennifer had spoken of one chance only it was where abigail was now the one chance to make it work so she could justify rare interest in len gibbons who waited for her call she had taken twenty fivedollar bills from her money belt which she wore against the skin at her waist and almost taking the notes out and peeling them off the wad she had giggled but to herself it had made a dent in his skin she had not taken off her money belt when she had been over and across him the buckle had gouged his flesh regret nothing he had not seemed to notice that it had pressed into his flat muscled stomach she had gone down to the gate shagger yawning behind her and corky halfway between them and the vehicles hamfist and harding had been near enough to the pajeros to start them and fast she had called forward the twenty men she thought seemed oldest and had put into each of the palms offered her a fivedollar bill her own ancestors a century before might have given out beads or anything shiny shed closed each fist on the note it had humiliated her the crudeness then she had tried to persuade them to head home get back to the huts built of reeds and the floating island shared with the water buffalo that gave them dung to use as their staple fuel for heating and the highdefinition tv five dollars was meagre none of them had shifted it had been len gibbonss turn three decades earlier if jennifers rumour was to be believed to have one chance only and to eff it up she thought she was now presented with a copperbottomed opportunity to join his team the crowd at the gate in the halfday that had passed from her handing out the trifles had doubled the threat when the next belt of darkness came was likely twice as great she couldnt get the boys to drive her back to alqurnah and try to rustle up rooms at the one building in the town beside the big river and adjacent to the dead tree claimed as the tree of life one of the shia zealot movements had control of that building the alternative was to leave the site drive onto a berm or a bund and park there where they were visible for ten miles or more she couldnt call up a friendly uk platoon and have them do their security because the brits were now in afghanistan and the marines the fort bragg guys too had switched wars had quit their last combat with a chorus of fucking good riddance to a motherfucking place there was nowhere else to be it was her one chance only and she assumed that len gibbons far away doodling would understand she asked the boys how much they reckoned she should shell out she went back inside and hitched up her robe did the act of a basra tart offloaded an additional two hundred and fifty american dollars and split the notes ten times twentyfive dollars each and a demand for some action it was a weak hand the worst this time she had corky on her right and hamfist on her left again she called out the oldest men with those who wore clothing of the best material and pleaded for the space they needed to monitor the wildlife successfully corky had said they could not be further back and do their job hamfist had said that any guy at the sharp end had to believe in the honesty of the people in support she handed out money repeated the pleading and went back towards the building she was a tough girl abigail jones conventschool educated redbrick university only took the bus in grim weather and ran to work most days in london along the embankment and home again she could sleep on shitlaced concrete hike and trek and could almost have wept there were more coming and none were leaving and some now had rifles in these parts any man with balls had access to a rifle harding asked how long do you think we have until we lift them out she shrugged shagger asked what do we do miss when this crowd start coming let me think about it and give me some fucking space there were two black hawks on the apron in the sun one of the crews was in an annex where a room offered bunk beds and thick enough window blinds to blot out the ferocity of the suns glare they would be wearing ear baffles so that the roar of the aircon systems wouldnt keep them awake the second crew four personnel was in the annex rest room and sprawled in easy chairs they were in the dog days of the empire and the final evacuation from the onetime colony was mere weeks away so little more than skeleton forces remained the buildings they occupied were tired the paint scuffed and would not receive renovation inevitably they had caught the mood of drawdown and had taped in their lockers at the baghdad base a pencil picture of a snake divided into segments one for each day they would serve on that posting most were now filled in and only part of the tail remained that crew who were awake supposedly ready to kick themselves out of the chairs into the opentop jeep and have the bird airborne within three minutes of the bell going found this assignment littered with unanswered questions the fourblade twinengine helicopter with a lift classified as medium was the workhorse of the american military and carried stores meals ready to eat the chemicals for latrines hometown hacks looking for stories that didnt exist and also flew specialforces units it was reliable flew like a dream caused little hassle and less grief but the american military effort was now scaled down the troops reduced to spitandpolish bullshit in camps so the guys in the two crews were generally just bored shitless each bird each crew could lift an additional eleven troops with full combat gear they were on standby but they didnt know when they would be called out or whom they would pick up they had not been given an exact extraction point new out of the sikorsky factories the black hawk had set their taxpayers back minimally million it was expensive hardware that sat on the tarmacadam outside the annex and the ready crew waited to be told something no one came normally when special forces were involved infiltration and exfiltration herds of liaison men and women hovered their cell phones ringing and their comms busy there were none the pilot eddie read a comic book and his copilot tristram turned the pages of a bible the old testament a side gunner dwayne trained to use a calibre machine gun studied a puzzle book and federico who had the weapon on the starboard side of the cabin was deep in an aviation engineering magazine they were not disturbed any other time they had done the lifts for special forces there had been a presence alongside checking every few minutes that their flight plans were ready and understood that they knew where all the pylons with slack electricity cables were and which they could fly under and that the fire power of hellfires and machinegun belts had been tested theyd even demand a check on the fuel loads in the tanks no one bothered them all they had been told was that a phone call would come through on the green handset and a voice would give coordinates to an area approximately sixty kilometres away that distance going east would put them hard against the iran border they read killed time waited badger had her in his glasses then alerted he swung them round went through a full degree arc with them and picked up the bulldozer the big plant vehicle with a bucket on the front had come from behind the barracks and now powered along the bund line to the right he fancied he understood past midday with the sun at full strength the smell was sweeter more foul and had seemed over the last hour to hang in the air close to him the one they called the goon mansoor hung onto the outer handles of the cab badger had been up and awake most of the night and had allowed the older man to sleep from the time that the house lights had gone out until dawn had let him sleep through for six hours before waking him and starting the routine of three hours on and three hours off he had let him sleep except when the snores came on too fierce in the first light grey and almost chill with the sun not yet peeping up from a horizon of reed tops and water expanses badger had crawled out of the hide taken care to rearrange the cover of dead reeds then had moved away and scouted the bare ground on his stomach he had been in the reeds and had seen where a spur came off the bund line and towards where they had made the hide then he had reached the open water beyond and the little light flecked the bodies in the water already they were swollen gross the smell had been building and had not dissipated in the cool of night now in the middle of the day he imagined the corpses would be even more distended he understood that men had been tasked to retrieve and bury them at dawn he had seen the bodies floating with clouds of insects over them and in the middle of the day he saw the bulldozer he didnt need to see much else in this little corner of the world far from anything he had experienced before men could be shot dead dumped and the evidence buried the bulldozer went from his view and the sound drifted and was fainter it was after a fashion what they did to their own what would they do to those who intruded on their space and affairs broke the boundaries of the borders and spied he had read about spies in the last war spies had been hanged in london electrocuted in the usa marched to the gallows in syria with a placard round the neck denouncing israeli espionage and to an execution chamber at the sugamo prison in tokyo richard sorge communist agent spying against japan on behalf of russian intelligence who denied all knowledge of him denied all knowledge it had a ring to it almost in that heat a shiver convulsed him fear apprehension he put it down to the sweat running in the small of his back where the fingers of alpha juliet had been denied all knowledge up in scotland with the theatre of that house and the bay with the waves crashing the cold the rain and the howl of the pipes denial had seemed unimportant he had the flies and the smell the sun flaring up off the water dazzling him and a mirage haze she came back out his hand hovered ready to shake foxy awake her mother followed her but held back in the shade at the front of the house badger thought her beautiful regal yet doomed through the glasses he could see the effort it took for her to walk from the patio to the waters edge then little flecks of colour on the ground close to her feet a flowerbed badger swore she had made a flowerbed and weeks before there would have been vivid colours in it there was against the house a tap and over the patio a discarded hose pipe he thought it reasonable that the tap had not been turned on and the hosepipe aimed at the flowers maybe his mothers favourite geraniums since her diagnosis an exinfantry soldier he had worked with had once said that shock spread in a life much as a hand grenade rolled bounced and slid erratically across the floor in a bunker or a slit trench it would have been like that when the news was given them he thought it would have seemed a waste of time and energy to continue watering the flowers she captured him she sat alone in front of the water and close to the pier the children were not back from school the mother was inside the house and the goon was with the bulldozer the guards would not approach her badger would have woken foxy given him a hard nudge in the ribcage where it might hurt if anyone had come close to her and talked she watched the birds did she know that men scavenging for artillerypiece casings had been shot he assumed for being inside a restricted sensitive zone then dumped were being retrieved now by a bulldozer to be clawed into a pit did she know that that was the price of keeping security tight around her her work was mine clearance for badger the world played at riddles what would happen to her he had not worked in northern ireland he was too young and the war there had lapsed to a ceasefire by the time he was trained and operational he had come across enough who knew the province a paratrooper off the hills above brecon when badger had been with them on exercise had talked of doing backup protection for handlers when they met with potential provo informers touts in the shadows of pub car parks in the empty darkened spaces of beauty spots it always bloody rained they said when the proposition of betrayal was put the approach made some the paratrooper had said spat it out some hesitated and some came on board bloody ran up the gangplank then this was the rub they had to go back and tell the wife they were changing sides and taking the queens shilling he hadnt forgotten that conversation long into a night if her husband accepted the offer made and she came through surgery they would face a new life and convalescence in an english seaside town or a suburb of any city in the united states first how would the man respond to interdiction approach badger couldnt say couldnt imagine it but he was sure mr gibbons the boss had his finger on the pulse of it there was he decided something totally elegant about the woman something utterly dignified he would have been hard put to explain his thoughts she gazed out over the water he watched her through the glasses ten times magnification and there were moments when he believed she looked straight at him must see him the heat in the suit sapped him and he fought to maintain his concentration he had to make his water last and in his ears were the sounds of the ripples against the piers supports and the scrape of the dinghy against the planks he reckoned couldnt be certain at two hundred metres plus that tears ran down her face badger could not in truth take his eyes from her he didnt know how her husband assuming a surgeon could work a miracle would respond to the approach they had done more war games at the camp through the morning there had been a theoretical headquarterscommand scenario of an american invasion pushing in from iraqi territory on a front south of alqurnah and north of basra the engineers role had been to describe the new generation of explosive formed projectiles their deployment and effect against the enemys armour and the forces of any poodles that the great satan could whip into line they had not stopped for lunch but took a break for coffee when would he be away again he found himself alongside the brigadier who had responsibility for this sector he grimaced he had the suitcase and they awaited final confirmation of the itinerary very soon after the refreshment stop they would move on to the area of counterattack and the engineer had prepared a paper on the value of deflecting armoured convoys to specified roads where the bombs could be more effective and more concentrated he would speak of the value of choke points into which armour would be drawn he would quote the disproportionate success of the defenders of a croatian city two decades before who had ambushed main battle tanks hit the first in the convoy simultaneously with the last and then at leisure destroyed the wallowing beasts that could not manoeuvre he would say this could be done by civilian fighters if they had only rudimentary skills in warfare he would tell his audience of the effect that the explosive devices manufactured under his direction with minimal metal parts instead incorporating plastics ceramics and moulded glass had on units morale and give them as a rallying cry the conclusion that one casualty without a leg or an arm needed four men to bring him back from the explosion and a helicopter to fly him to the rear ultimately when one man hobbled down the main street of his home town and the civilians living there watched him sympathising support for the war would drain away let them come let them face us let them know the smell of defeat he would finish he was not an easy public speaker and he tried to memorise what he would say and how he would deliver it but the brigadier broke into his thoughts did his wife approve of the case she had not looked at it had refused to open it would not discuss with him what clothing she should take whatever destination was chosen for them she had sat in her chair in the kitchen for much of the evening after the children had gone to bed when he had told them more about prince korshid and his brothers the time he had gone to the bottom of the deep well and had found there a girl of unmatched beauty on her lap was the head of a deav a serpent that snored foully the prince would rescue the girl but that was for the next evening he did not say that tension cut the mood in his home or confide that she had thrown back at him the riposte if god says it will happen it will happen do you attempt to obstruct gods will with temporary relief better to die quietly with love and in peace than to chase a few more days of life are we justified in fighting it her mother had watched them silent and he had not answered but had gone to tell the story to the children my wife thought it a very fine case her morale her attitude very positive she is focused on getting treatment she needs for recovery and is most grateful to those who give her the chance of it it was rare for the engineer to talk on personal matters with a senior officer of the revolutionary guard corps he knew this mans importance in areas of military responsibility and also because the papers regarding naghmehs illness would have needed his initialled acceptance just as this officer procured for him the most sophisticated and recent electronic equipment from the usa reaching him via dubais container port so he had the power to arrange the funding of such a journey and subsequent medical attention you are important to us brother others in uniform stood patiently behind the brigadier waiting for an opportunity to speak with him but he waved them away it was a short clipped movement but unmistakable i know much about you brother of course i accept that you live by the water close to the border it was the home my wife chose before the diagnosis and a place of rare beauty near to a command post it is very peaceful and may i offer advice brother of course i would be honoured to receive it which was the truth advice would not be given lightly or be ignored when offered by a man of such seniority blunt words the veneer of concern stripped off you cannot return there i am sorry did i misunderstand you it is where my wife is a searing interruption whether your wife is alive or dead whether she is happy there whether she likes to view the water and count mosquitoes is brother not of importance a man of your value should be better protected you will not go back there this brigadier had been in place for some four months the engineer did not know him well he could not argue remonstrate or dispute if she survived she would be devastated it was unthinkable that he should challenge a decision by so senior an officer of course a wintry smile i would suggest that if the americans invade you go to the deepest hole you can find that a fox has dug and settle in it hide for as long as you can and emerge when you have a new identity if the americans come the shockwave will likely bring down the regime of the islamic republic revolution will rule do you watch cnn brother you do not you are good patriotic and disciplined i watch cnn and i see the demonstrations in tehran isfahan shiraz and mashhad we attack the websites and the mobilephone links but we cannot prevent the images escaping our borders we can hang people abuse them and lock them away but when revolt has taken hold it cannot be reversed there is an expression a house of cards and i fear that is what we will be we conceive martyrs we shoot at unarmed crowds but we do not cow the masses when their time comes when our authority is fractured they will rise up as the crowds did in the last days of the imperial family the officials serving the peacock throne were shot by firing squad butchered with knives or hanged in the evin gaol if our regime collapses and i am still here i imagine i will be led out to the nearest streetlight and a rope will be thrown up i will be hanged as will most of us gathered here today we appear invulnerable but strength is often illusory you brother maybe you would be on the streetlight beside me if the americans come brother how many will face the prospect of a rope over the arm of a streetlamp and will trade information to save their neck from being stretched what better piece of information to give up than the identity of the man who designed the bombs that crippled the great satans war effort inside iraq an american said once of serbs who were hunted and accused of atrocities you can run but you cannot hide it was a popular phrase it frightened men intimidated them you would be named i would be named and most of the men in this room would be named there is of course a solution to the problem of regime collapse and vengeance turned on former influential people i can go abroad i am authorised to fly to damascus under deep cover i can travel to dubai or abu dhabi the american consulate in dubai is in the world trade center and the embassy in abu dhabi is located between airport road and coast street they would not if i walked in cold off the street treat me like a friend but they would show me respect and i would avoid the rope suspended from the streetlamp if you were to take a similar course when you go abroad you also would be safe from the rope could you do that brother to save your neck he saw that a trap yawned in front of him first there had seemed to be sympathy then there had been honesty and last conspiracy he was not one of them he did not wear uniform and was inside no inner circle they were military men and he was a scientist in the field of miniaturised electronics they used him a trip wire might have lain across his path if he had snagged it he would have gone into the prepared pit the engineer said i am completely devoted to the islamic republic its leaders and its future he was rewarded with a smile slow but broadening he went on i am devoted to my god my country and my work i hope your journey is fruitful brother we will be waiting to welcome you home and pray god for the best outcome the brigadier was gone from his side he realised he had been taunted also that he had been warned against making unwise contacts outside iran he could not remember when before he had felt such keen anger towards a senior officer of the revolutionary guard corps they mocked and threatened him while they strutted on parade grounds lined up their men across wide streets then ordered baton charges or the firing of live rounds to disperse crowds who protested that an election had been stolen he the engineer rashid armajan had been creating the weapons that defeated an enemy that was a superpower he could not tell the brigadier to go fuck his own mother because that man had to initial the final authorisation for the journey in search of a consultant he felt blood on his lip and realised how hard he had bitten it how much pain he had absorbed he wiped his mouth with a handkerchief and hoped no stain remained they were called into the next session and the brigadier did not catch his eye as they went back into the operations area badger had rested but not slept he had eaten some biscuit and drunk sparingly had defecated into a bag and urinated into a bottle he had done all of that within six inches of foxy without disturbing the leaves spread over the hide he had thought more about the woman in the plastic chair across the expanse of water than he had about alpha juliet she was still there she might have moved or not in the three hours he had had his eyes squeezed shut while the sun was still crystal bright her children were close to her their toys were out he thought the kids more subdued less raucous than the previous day once the girl fell and screamed and her mother did not move but the old lady came out waddled to the child swept her up and cuddled her the smell hung rancid between them around them with no wind to drift it anything happened anything said a slight shake of foxys head insufficient to rustle the dead stuff over him nothing the slightest nod the flies crowded above them and surged on his hands as badger lifted his binoculars and adjusted the focus so that he could see the mess of reed leaves and stems where the microphone lay then sweep on from the bund line to the barracks and a few of the soldiers playing basketball then across the palm trees he saw the head goon sprawled on a sunbed and picked up the house and the kids then the old lady who banged dust from rugs he went by the flowerbed abandoned and reached the chair it annoyed badger that he had twice asked the question and not been answered annoyed him that he had felt it necessary to make bare semicivilised talk like it was a weakness in him he had ticks on his legs could have been three bites or four if he scratched hard broke the surface and drew blood the itch would be worse they had to be endured he would not fidget give foxy the pleasure of seeing his discomfort he wasnt proud of himself he didnt ask just pulled the headset from under foxys head covering to achieve that he needed to get his fingers across foxys face touch his cheeks then go up to the crown and drag forward the arch linking the earpieces his wrist was gripped on induction courses do they teach wetbehindtheears recruits rookies that courtesies matter he had a hold on the headset if they dont they should run one for beginners in basic manners fucking ask he didnt a standoff moment badger had hold of the headset and foxy had hold of his wrist three seconds five ten badger let go and foxy let go and managed to choreograph it so that neither was the outright winner nor loser he was given the headset and slotted it under his camouflage covering with small slow movements he thought he had lost high ground which seemed hard up against his oppo to matter what also mattered was his own inadequacy he could watch the front of the house across the lagoon and track the movement of the wife her mother the kids the officer and the other guards but if she spoke and he was the one on stag he must break into foxys rest time it hurt him that he was reliant on the older man hurt more than the tick bites bothered him she was very still there were birds on the water in front of her and they fed ducking and diving an otter swam close to the main wall of the reeds the first he had seen that day he knew otters from the islands off the west coast of scotland only a glimpse and then it dipped showing an arched back and a stubby tail he didnt think she watched the birds or had seen the otter on his earlier watch a pair of pigs had crossed in front of him would have swum over the sunk cable from the microphone with just their snouts above the water the light had changed and was no longer on her face but the suns force was now more to her left side and her cheeks were not in its glare badger couldnt say whether there were still tears maybe earlier she had looked too closely into the suns reflection from the lagoon and her eyes had watered a woman who ran a mineclearance campaign might be made of stern material or might weep in private because of what had happened to her to her man and her children he didnt know foxy farted the foul smell hung around them the residue of the last meal ready to eat they had shared beef in some congealed liquid if someone had walked over them he or she might have thought theyd picked up pig shit on a boot he reflected there was no other way to do the job that the boss mr gibbons had set them they had to be there marooned and he watched her she was not the woman of a drugsdealer he had once kept pinged day after day while she lounged in a summer garden close to her pool wearing not much on a rare warm week and she was not one of the women from the tinkers camp who had pegged out washing lounged and smoked while the men planned thieving and she was not the woman with the mousy hair and pale face mistress to the man whose wife was under the patio extension and who would be led away handcuffed as the digger moved in he had pinged many women who were consorts of a target and had not felt any of them were special or worth interest the engineers wife dominated any thoughts of alpha juliet an instructor on the last week before badger had been awarded his blue book certifying his surveillance competence had told the group that thinking of sex stripping down women doing business with them was excellent for holding the concentration needed in a hide when paint drying might have seemed interesting he had said that far and away the best shagging hed had in his life was when hed been lying on his belly enveloped in a gillie suit with nothing happening it would have been good to remember alpha juliet a fine strong girl who didnt blather didnt seem in search of commitment and seemed to have chosen him for better reasons than that she had gone without for a week unfathomable but he couldnt remember alpha juliet now he stared through the glasses at the woman and because he kept the focus on everything familiar about her he knew which crows feet were deepening at her eyes her breathing seemed harder and her mouth would twist when the pain dug youll call me yes because without me youre worse than useless he didnt answer foxy went on and keep watch all round a point of principle he didnt react and kept the glasses on her he didnt take orders from the older man why are you only watching her no response he held the focus her hands were very still and he thought she had a serenity you gone soft on her young un unprofessional if you have badger held his silence if youve gone gentle on her just remember who she is shes the wife of rashid armajan bad bastard bombmaker and enemy she shares his bed and before she went sick used to spread her legs for the guy who spent his days planning the next generation of nasties to kill our boys inside iraq i feel nothing for her she would have kept a nice tidy household for him left him with no worries in his life other than working out the best way to blow up mutilate and kill coalition troops he was pretty good at it forgotten what the man said a small number of clever and innovative men is capable of wrongfooting us so consistently that the bodybags keep going home and the injured with wounds theyll carry to their graves we call an enemy a bravo rashid armajan is a big bad bravo thats what the man said shes that mans woman and what she has in her head is immaterial to me it matters that because of whats in her head hell travel away from here nothing less nothing more in case youve forgotten it young un the ceremonies at wootton bassett when the dead come home didnt start with afghanistan killedinaction troops they started with iraq we couldnt stay in iraq because of the bombs his bombs bombs turned out on a production line to the engineers blueprint my ellie calls them heroes the soldiers brought through that town its fantastic such an honour to those soldiers to have thousands line a street in respect only sad thing they dont see it theyre in the box a good number of them were put there by that man and his talent for bombmaking because of him all that the rest of us can do is stand on the pavement and give them respect which is something but not much a good number of the first heroes who came through were victims of explosions his bloody bombs and maybe by now his gears in afghanistan i dont know so i have no love for him and im not going soft for her my ellie talks about wootton bassett and the heroes are you getting my drift a crisp whisper so much of an enemy that were going to turn him surprise a murmur what the fuck are you talking about its interdiction so its interdiction yes i checked it with the boss its their way spook jargon of describing an approach interdiction is approach they hope to turn him is that what he told you theyre going to turn him mr gibbons said like its a defection foxy muttered time for my sleep wake me when theres something you cant do she had fine features and she sat so still her back was straight in the chair and she gazed ahead almost her eye line was on him nobody came to her she had no one to talk to and foxy slept the wind had gained strength and he heard its rustle in the reeds chapter what the hell are you wake up as normal when badger used his elbow to dig into foxys ribs he held the palm of his hand across the older mans mouth loose but a reminder where am in the hide in the marshes in iran what more do you need to know could give you the coordinates except you bloody dropped the gps the voice whistled back almost shrill between the teeth i was saying before you fucking interrupted where am i looking that was my question you dont have to look anywhere just listen the headset was already off badgers ears he tried to pass it to foxy foxy muttered that he needed a piss always did when he woke up badger told him to wait the cable was caught in the front of badgers gillie suit had fastened itself among the material strips sewn into it and the driedout reeds you couldnt pull a cable tight and hope it would free itself and it was underneath badger they were in darkness hip against hip elbows locked and legs bloody nearly entwined their movements had roused the mosquitoes and there were convulsions under the covering that shielded them the cable wouldnt come free insults were swapped be careful you clumsy bastard use your fingers how did you snag it if you stayed bloody still i could free it badger laid down his nightsight kit it was the hour before dawn his fingers felt for the tangle in the cable foxy had his head down grappled for and found the headset and put it over his ears god alone knew how but the cables snag was near badgers groin and foxys head was halfway there time for a laugh foxys head had moved to a comfort zone below badgers ribcage his fingers were under foxys chin and tugged gently twice foxy gulped then the cable came free he would be told and didnt ask to ask would demonstrate dependence on the older man nor would he get now a running commentary from foxy he settled again as best he could difficult while foxy used the bottle there was no relief from the mosquitoes and when they crossed the moon almost full they seemed dense enough to throw a shadow they had both been out of the hide during the night and badger had buried more plastic bags he had gone as far as the wall of reeds to their right where it bordered the open ground and done exercises there had moved his limbs and stretched his back foxy had gone further almost as far as the mound of mud but had stopped short of the bulldozer tracks he could go further than foxy anytime foxy left the hide the translation of remarks passed at the house was zero it was the time of morning that medics said was when people died and well known to police crime squads as the best time to hit front doors break them down and get up the stairs before weapons narcotics or documents could be hidden the target had emerged from the front door and started to pace she had joined him he would have been well on with his first cigarette a white glow in the dull greened wash of the nightsight lens he wore cotton boxer shorts and a vest and she had a shawl across the shoulders of her nightdress and was barefoot he had put on sandals the guard using the plastic chair by the pier had already scrambled away when hed appeared before shed come and badger had woken foxy it was going to be soon they had logged the carrying into the house of the new suitcase black with no motif that would stand out on a carousel she had greeted him and her voice had been easy clear in his ears he dreaded most that one dawn or evening that day or the next the black mercedes would come the driver would go to the door bring out the case and lift it into the boot the targets would climb into the back seats the engine would rev the goon the officer and the guards would straighten the old lady would wave from the door the kids at her knee and the car would go where which airport connecting with what flight it was what he dreaded most the engineer talked and his wife listened he smoked then threw the stub into the water he walked with his hand under her arm and she had the stick to support her there was no fat on the man and badger could see her contours breasts waist and hips because a light wind was off the water he would have had a better view through the nightsight if the moon had been smaller or had gone down over the horizon he dreaded most that he and foxy would lie in the scrape with the bags and the bottles their food the bergens the ticks mosquitoes and flies and the microphone would not pick up a remark on the destination to have gone through this and not heard it it was more than he could have endured they walked and badger watched he described the man his arrogance and authority and what the brigadier had said to him he explained his confusion he asked her opinion was he teased tested mocked was it possible the islamic republic was a house built of cards and could be blown away he supported her and she followed his slow steps but was heavier on her stick did they regard him with such contempt that he needed threats on the danger to him of defection was the regimes strength so fragile he did not know and there was no other person alive with whom he would have shared thoughts so heretical why had it been said why did they doubt his patriotism and loyalty the faith that governed him why when he had nothing more to say she dug in her bare heels spread her toes in the dirt and twisted him to face her the light came up off the water and bathed her ducks splashes made ripples it is unthinkable you will see this guard corps officer today you will not bow in front of him you will stand your full height and you will tell him his words are fit only for the tip where the citys trash is dumped the thought of you betraying the nation is rubbish and you will tell him so i will tell him to his face it is rubbish because you would not leave me no do they think that i whether i am destined to live or to die would go with you it is inconceivable i shall tell him i would not go with you because i would not abandon my children if i live a week a month a year or go my full span i would not leave them i would leave you before i would leave my children he said also that because of my work i would be hunted down and hanged if the regime should fall is it more important what might happen to you than what will happen to me she had shamed him and he lapsed into silence he sensed that now she felt the chill of the night she was shivering he put his arm around her shoulders and started to lead her back to the house he could feel her bones everything in his life revolved around the regime of the islamic republic that had come to power when he was nine years old he had been to their schools he had listened to their mullahs as a teenager he had walked behind his fathers coffin as a procession wound towards the cemetery his fathers life had been given in a minefield in defence of a child of the regime and his mother had died of wounds received from shrapnel in the air attacks on susangerd he had struggled for the best results at university electrical engineering in ahvaz and for thirteen years had laboured over the workbench in the camp he had made the devices done what was asked of him and now he was teased taunted it was as if the suspicion of treason was laid at his door she had hard bones now and they were angled against his hand the weight seemed each day to drip a little more from her he had only once been outside iran he thought of that journey more often now where he had been and whom he had met his journey had been to the hungarian capital budapest the course at the university of technology and sciences had lasted two years and he had learned areas of electronic engineering that had served him well at his workbench he could remember his fear at the levels of drugtaking and bingedrinking the rampant sexual appetites of the students as a defence against corruption contamination he had wrapped himself in work and there had been a girl she was in his mind more often now because each time he touched his wife naghmeh he felt the sharpness of her bones and believed her life was slipping away he had little faith in a foreign consultant romance was gone lust and love were strained to breaking point there had been a girl in budapest who had never aged because she was locked in his mind as she was then it had been the one time in his life that he had felt weak he had yearned for her and had been a virgin experiencing new longings she was maria from austria studying industrial psychology on some occasions he had sat in great boldness beside her for lunch in the canteen they had been to films on the campus and had held hands and they had gone once to hear a pianist play chopin she had come to his room one evening in april when the days lengthened flowers bloomed and spring burst he knew her as a good catholic and that she drank alcohol her parents were divorced and she would work after her degree she hoped in the swarovski glass factory as part of the workers support programme she had come to his room in the students hostel her blouse had been lowcut her skirt short and he could smell the schnapps on her breath and her perfume she had reached up from his narrow bed caught his arms and tried to pull him down he had slapped her face hard she had left him face pale except where his fingers had met her cheek and a nail had scratched her nose he had never seen maria ohldorf after that day and he had the picture of her face frozen in his mind her shock and bewilderment she had been pretty and he had yearned to hold her but had not dared he thought often of her now as the weight slipped off his wifes bones he saw on the edge of the shadows mansoor watching him they went inside the engineer cursed himself for thinking it but she would not be saved it was the stuff of dreams false dawns sharp in his mind was the defiance the extremes of rudeness that he had hurled at the medical team in tehran almost the implication that they were peasants and illqualified if he had listened then had brought naghmeh back to her children there might have been a calm loving parting not preceded by a journey of desperation but arrangements were made and could not now be cancelled the moon had gone but first light was not yet on the horizon above the far reeds and the water behind them foxy eased off the headset then pushed it across the little space to badger he expected to be asked what he had heard no question came had he been asked he would have whispered airily that he had heard nothing of importance it always threw interrogators waiting for an interpreters translation of a suspects fiftyword statement when a digest of around five words came back he would not have said that the talk was of defection rejected and abandoning family out of the question he could have added that the engineer and his wife spoke quality educated farsi to each other he could have latched onto a discussion brief that the engineer would himself be a target if the regime failed and his association with the revolutionary guards corps became general knowledge he could have finished with an assessment from the engineers voice pitch and the wifes how their morale stood and he would have assessed that her nerves were near breaking point and she was depressed he said none of it it annoyed him that the query did not come annoyed him enough him to hiss not interested dont you want to know if there was anything i needed to know youd have told me i thought youd want to hear their talk only if i need to know it the headset was taken he felt the strength of the young un beside him little bastard eased over and broke wind again the bloody flies were swarming over the scrim of his headgear would they come to blows foxy reckoned there was a chance of it he closed his eyes thought about sleep and more about ellie he wondered where she was and what she was doing he could have drunk a twolitre bottle of water straight down but it was rationed a discipline that couldnt be broken they had the water they had brought in the greatest weight factor in the bergens was water only thinking of ellie could clear his mind of the need for more water than was allowed he rinsed some in his mouth then swallowed it but eked it out he couldnt think when he had last disliked a man loathed or detested one as much as he disliked badger and he thought it mutual it was probably inevitable that they would fight the quiet closed round them it was the last hour before the grey smears appeared on the horizon in the east they were all exhausted and needed sleep none of them would get it it was the crisis time the jones boys had usurped her she didnt give the orders didnt open her mouth and make suggestions she did as she was told the extent of the crisis yawed ahead of her each of them hamfist corky shagger and harding wore their tshirts they had gone into their bags dug them out stripped off what they already had on and had done a fast change the extent of the crisis brought them together made them a team and a team needed a uniform from a uniform came strength they were paid to protect her so they would she had passed control to them she knew them like the callouses on her hands the virtues and weaknesses of each man but she could not have said who among the four would emerge as the leader none had interesting to her because the sharing of their responsibilities showed her opinion stunning trust but they were trained as fighting men when trust was implicit and now they were fighting she thought it medieval abigail jones had childhood memories of traipsing around castles mostly motteand bailey in the welsh marches ludlow caus wigmore some that were shoulderhigh ruins and others that were towering relics and her father the barrister had lectured on battles sieges the storm tactics of attackers and desperate defenders and she had imagined menatarms running from one battlement to another to stem the latest thrust knowing that if the line was broken the wall fell they were gone throats slit shagger had the vehicles harding had the door of the building and abigail tagged along with corky or hamfist they chased shadows caught in the beams of the big torches it was not the ultimate attack but probes and if they found weakness they would come on do it bigtime a mob always knew how to sniff out weakness and she thought a crowd of men from out of the marshes gassed bombed their habitat drained and their buffalo dead would know how to scavenge for weakness would be bloody near goldmedal standard at it at first the shadows had kept back hugged the no mans land between light and dark they were bold now and the crisis had come they must defend the building alongside which the pajeros were parked and try to keep clear the approach ground between them and the broken perimeter fence in front of them was the familiar track to the draggedback gates but behind them inside the compound was darkness the first blow was from harding his weapon was his m armalite rifles stock two had come lightfooted and silent from the shadows and were a moment away from getting inside the building where the gear was the water and rations some of the ammunition and enough of the grenades abigail chasing after corky had seen them and corky had shouted the warning it was the crisis because harding hit one in the testicles with the stock of his rifle then struck the second across the face a doubletap of sorts one movement two casualties the first went down and was retching at hardings feet might have thrown up on his boots and the second was reeling back clutching his mouth blood was easing out between his fingers and she fancied he might have spat away a tooth the first act of physical violence was the start point of the crisis she had ceded control it would have been the grossest impertinence for her to shout dont shoot for fucks sake dont use live rounds a killing would be a disaster a wounding and hospitalisation would be a catastrophe bruising missing teeth abrasions were manageable knives were shown at them when a larger group six or seven ran towards the vehicles from different directions the nearest thing to coordination if the first strike of a knife had hit and one of them had gone down they would have been dead all of them dead meant harding never getting back to see the aunt who had reared him in the trailer camp and never again getting value for money from the russian whores in dubai dead for corky was a telegram to a housing estate in west belfast being opened by old people he had not seen in twenty years and two kids who would not have a father dead in shaggers world was a farm never bought and reoccupied by an elderly couple pedigree sheep never grazing the fields that looked onto mountains dead was hamfists divorced wife getting a large cheque from proeliator security and maybe going as far as digging out a photo of him and putting it on the sideboard for a week and dead was alpha juliet surrogate mother of the jones boys never again looking into the face of badger deciphering nothing learning less and seeing in the eyes a message of selfsufficiency and reliance on no one it had captured her and dead was having the smelly ragheads crawl all over her and likely shag her carcass there were knives in the torch beams that might have been used to gut a goodsize carp or skin a dead buffalo calf or to slash the reeds from which their homes were built the alternative to being dead was to quit if they quit they left behind badger and foxy and a mission that had taken months to put together was aborted she remembered the sergeant who had explained shyly that his work was routine quite boring hed spent three and half hours on his knees while he dismantled a device left in a shallow hole near highway made it safe and gave the forensic people the chance to trace a dna sample and to find the dateseller and the roadsweeper she wouldnt quit hands were on her she smelt sour breath and felt long nails catch the waist of her robe then the pressure pushing her downwards beside her a knife flickered in shaggers beam and might have been about to close on hamfists chest corky came he had an iron bar it might have been used once to support barbedwire defences corky was from an estate where knowledge of street fighting came at about the same time as primary school and first communion he lashed around him there were groans a scream the hands were off abigail there were no faces only hands and some had their own blood on them three knives were lined up they were at the edge of shaggers torch light she recognised it they were together to feed each other the courage to charge forward and the knives were raised boldly if one of her boys was down it was over more had gathered behind the knives they would swamp the boys and her there were so few of them four guys and their maam because the wisdom said that the fewer bodies on the ground the greater the chances of going in and out without being identified she hadnt argued with the wisdom and the knives blades flashed she didnt know which but either corky or harding threw the first gas grenade and it rolled among them the smoke burst from the canister and enveloped them they were pale figures caught in a white cloud and they seemed to dance as they choked another grenade was thrown and the cloud thickened it was harder to see them but easy to hear the choking and the coughs they took their casualties with them five who were helped towards the gate she knew what she had to do her head ached and the gas was in her eyes making them water with needle pains abigail walked away from her boys following the gaggle of men towards the gate she reached it and shouted in good arabic what she wanted she had resumed her role of authority she sat down in the dirt and folded her legs in the middle of the track she waited for them to do as she had instructed it was a gamble as was the whole goddamn thing she waited and soon dawn would come when would he know mansoor asked him and caught him flustered having had to duck back into the house because there were papers he had been reading early that morning and he had forgotten to replace them in his briefcase know what mansoor said it slowly as if he talked with a demented man when would he know the date on which he travelled and when would he know where he travelled to the door of the mercedes was held open for him and he threw the briefcase towards the far side of the seat he said he would know that day he had been promised a radio had been switched on in the house the security officer had fine hearing he realised that the wife naghmeh had not packed the new suitcase he had been roused by a sentry in the night and had gone half dressed from his room alongside the communal dormitory of the barracks he had seen them washed in moonlight walking beside the water he understood that the two were almost crushed he had thought in the night that the wound on his leg was healed and that the muscles and tendons that had been ruptured were knitting well he had pondered watching them walk together that the time would come soon when he could apply for service with the alquds again in lebanon it was an honour to be chosen to protect a man of the engineers prominence and it could not have been said that he was careless with the responsibility but it did not extend him he was asked by the driver what the situation was that morning in central ahvaz a news bulletin came on the radio he could answer his father had telephoned that morning the hanging of the terrorist the previous day had gone well there had been militia and guard corps personnel on the streets no live rounds or gas had been fired the crowds had dispersed quietly after only one charge with batons his father had said that the hanging had been witnessed by the family of a bystander who had died when the bomb the youth had placed had exploded the mother had spat at the condemned as he was lifted trembling onto a chair with the noose round his neck and the hood over his face the father of the bystander would himself have kicked away the chair if he had not been restrained his father loved to watch the hangings his father had said that the streets were calm he said it was safe to take the quicker route through the centre of the city he was surprised the question had shocked him never before had his charge rashid armajan made such a query it had been asked from beside the open rear door of the car as if an afterthought do you believe it possible that the regime governing us is in fact similar to a house built of playing cards that can be blown down destroyed the security officer a true believer gagged and must have betrayed his shock the engineer was sharper could the regime collapse is internal dissent external aggression combined enough to break us he sensed a trap the question was close to treason men and women were hanged for treason did the question test his loyalty was he doubted can the regime be swept away are we merely temporary are we like the fascists and the communists the baathists the apartheid oppression in south africa and the he stuttered it the regime is strong is a rock those who denounce it and look to betray it will fail there are spies everywhere and danger vigilance must be rigorous i tell you should i find myself confronting such an enemy he would know pain the like of which he has never experienced before we are strong thank you you are a good friend the engineer sank heavily into the car swung in his legs and the driver closed the door after him mansoor pondered he could and most probably should report such a conversation who would be believed himself a junior functionary or a man who was feted by the high command of the alquds brigade and who was about to travel abroad on the states funding could he by implication accuse such a man of treason the car turned a corner beside the barracks and disappeared dust billowing behind it always it was necessary if denouncing a man of prominence to be certain he was prepared to dither it would have been the wifes mother who had the radio loud because she was partially deaf had been afflicted since the enemys artillery had pounded ahvaz he went to his chair in the shade and sat down with his binoculars he wondered if this would be the day when the sacred ibis came over the reeds fringing the lagoon and settled on the exposed mud spit foxy whispered brusquely the radio knocked out the long conversation at the car before it was switched on he said he would be told today the when and the where thats about it for me itll be some sleep soon he would start to snore badger felt alone he had lost count of how many hours days and nights it had been since they were scooped from their lives and taken north to the house facing out over the bay the hours days and nights since he had met the girl alpha juliet had merged too he had taken the headset most of what it picked up was the babble of the radio the heat inside his suit climbed the sweat ran and he felt the weakness that lack of exercise produced those people at the house with the ruins of a castle and the pipes wail were too distant he could no longer put faces to them time dripped the images blurred he couldnt bloody remember them the carvery is always good value gibbons said and the fish is usually passable he played host to the cousin the friend and the major it had been sarahs idea she had suggested it that morning had made the phone calls with the invitations had booked the table and appeared to believe he needed respite from sitting in the inner office contemplating the wilting flowers the pictures on the wall and the silence of the telephone it had been sleeting in central london when he had walked from the office to the club a bottle of red was brought a bottle of white and a small jug of water he smiled a little deprecating always the hardest time for us the waiting were all from that neck of the woods i often think that others who are parked at their desks in our place and write those analysis pieces have little idea of the strains placed on us by our work in the front line very little idea sarah had bundled a wad of cash into his hand the implication being that she would lose it somewhere in the budget elastic bands highlighters paper clips in the clubs restaurant rarely used by him because of its expense she had reserved a corner table where they could speak and be free of eavesdropping the cousin remarked there are people in langley who drive up the beltway before its light for half the year look at a screen all day and its dark when theyre back in the car and off home they tell the little woman its been a hell of day sweetie just one hell of a day they have no idea and less concern about the pressures were under when were running sharpend stuff but i take comfort from the feeling in my water that weve gotten close to the serious time ill start with the white len thank you the friend said i dont intend to badmouth my own people but israel has the worlds highest proportion of jealous bastards who think they know better than the man of experience we have awards that would fill a wall for interference and shitchucking what we do is difficult and stressful and you can piss against the wind for all the appreciation youll pick up the red would suit me as a kickoff len and im grateful for the invitation the major grimaced smiled i can remember a day when id been out on those opensewer streets of basra from dawn till dusk and id killed five ieds each was complex and would have been shipped in from that bloody production line across the border and one was for me and complicated there were bad guys on a roof watching to see how i went about it hoping also to see the big flash and hear the bang i went back to the mess believe it please there was a colonel in there using the basra palace saddams old wateringhole for a farewell bash he and his guests had put on their fancydress outfits and their gongs for smart dining flopped in a chair feet on the table beer bought me and this bloody colonel wants to know why i havent washed shaved changed before entering the mess didnt understand there was a life outside the limit of the airconditioning system i told him to fuck off took my brigadier in baghdad a week to smooth the waters people have no idea about the real world ill start with the white and then try the red thanks len they ordered drank and ate another bottle of red was required but the water lasted in a vacuum of information responsibilities were reiterated and guarantees given coffee was accepted but no brandy an indication of work taken seriously the major said i just want to put it on the record in this rather select company people these days are pretty squeamish about what they call extrajudicial interdiction i think it an excellent way of dealing with an extant difficulty identify locate and he slapped a broad hand with chunky fingers that seemed to lack the sensitivity necessary for the dismantling of improvised explosive devices on the table the cups rattled in the saucers the unused cutlery banged against the glasses and hed done a passable imitation of a shot being fired and another then the major wiped his mouth with his napkin and dropped it as though business had been done and procedures agreed the friend used a toothpick we have a mantra that we neither confirm nor deny and are consistent with it it can however be let slip through many channels that the target was in trouble with his own people for fucking the wife of a man more influential or for fabricating his expense accounts that confuses the general public of many nations but not the associates of the target they know they fear the greatest source of the fear is that their small corner that most secretive part of an organisation where they exist will be penetrated but we have to wait he smiled and let slip a small belch then meticulously folded his napkin and smoothed it the cousin gazed around him wistfully as if a small chance existed that in a gentlemans club he might be permitted to smoke a cigar a hellfire if aimed accurately and carrying a punch of eight kilos of metalaugmented charge can do a fair bit of extrajudicial we dont have at this moment a judge and jury sitting in north waziristan in the haraz mountains of yemen or in the sand round kandahar so what we do there has to benefit from lack of contact with a courthouse i hear no great wail of protest go back two decades and a canadian citizen was taken down gerald bull shot by of course persons unknown while earning big moolah for building the gun that was going to fire chemicals and biological out of iraq and into israel did the canadians shout and yell deafening silence the furore of the handwringers lasts a week at maximum and it keeps the motherfuckers looking over their shoulders there is only one law in this business dont get caught its a good one to remember it has legs and has lasted years a grand meal len the major and the friend agreed gibbons raised an arm to motion for the waiter and his bill then reached into an inner pocket for his fattened wallet he said its not the easy time when we have and im confident we will the direction to head in it will all get easier youve met the two men who are up front know pretty much the same as i do about them what i would like to say though the officer we have in support of them is first rate very dedicated yes at the risk of landing hard on my arse im very confident the cousin said and youd know about that len as i hear it youd know about landing hard on your arse the friend said and would have read the filtered reports reaching foreign agencies dogs a man doesnt it when he has to be lifted out of the shit gibbons offered no denials didnt like it but lessons were learned the major not privy to secrets of the trade and historic foulups pushed back his chair and made ready to stand i see looking out onto the street that nothing of the weather improves sleet gone to snow hard to have a decent sight of them in the mind in the heat its merciless the heat is brutal anyway what interests me are your good words on the officer on the ground who directs all this and your confidence on her haunches abigail jones sat alone behind her fifteen yards back was corky he accepted they all did that she had taken control again and would call the moves somewhere under the robe she wore now mudstained and dusty was the holster that hugged her waist the pistol was in it and there was a slit at the side of the garment that her fist could be shoved into if she needed the thing she had tucked her gas mask behind her backside so it was close to hand but not visible she had called for a leader to be sent the ragheads always liked at a time of confrontation to have a meeting a conference then they would hector and bluster give themselves the opportunity to preen and usually to walk out a meeting at a time of substantial dispute was the way they usually went she sat in the dirt in the centre of the gateway and waited for a leader to come corky could see from the tilt of her head that her eyeline was down her focus point would have been about half of the distance between where she sat and the line of men facing her one had a scarf bloodstained across his face and another could only stand with the help of two others one had weeping abrasions on his shin where the bar had been used on him and another tucked his wrist between his shirts buttonholes and had a broken collarbone there were others who might have fractured ribs or dried blood on their scalps but no shots had been fired and that was a miracle he thought they had done well his rifle was slung across his chest and he had two magazines filled taped together his flak vest was over his jones boys shirt and the gas mask was hooked to his waist if any of them had run at her he would have dropped them behind him was shagger harding and hamfist were at the pajeros pretty feckin ridiculous but they still had the tripod up the spotting scope mounted on it the identification pictures were on the ground held in place by a quarter of a mud brick by now corky might have been able to spot a marbled duck he might have known the difference between a ferruginous duck and a whiteheaded duck and definitely he could have said which was a basra reedwarbler and which a blacktailed godwit he had a sunhat on camouflage type while shagger and harding wore the proeliator security caps with the big peaks hamfists was from a pizzadelivery service in the east of scotland she wore nothing on her head other than a wispy scarf her body threw off no shadow because the sun was above her she waited it was all bluff hardings take on it was that had it been american spooks a closesupport airstrike would have been called in during the night and black hawks would have come to lift them out shagger had said that if the mission had been run by any of the other six officers from baghdad theyd have called a taxi and quit she sat very still corky couldnt see her face but thought of her as serene so calm the heat made him wobble on his feet the shimmer came up from the sand and the faces in front of him distorted there was pain in his eyes behind the wraparounds he craved a drink and his concentration was going harding must have seen him rock the drawling voice was in his ear go get yourself a drink what about her go close to her break the mood shes set youll get bawled out i reckon harding murmured shes remarkable corky did it side of mouth no one like her an ace lady you have any idea how long this needs spinning out beginning to think its closing down on us dont reckon up front they have much more time i saw how much water they took and its the heat i dont think they have a heap of time he moved his hand and felt the coil it had been a better morning the engineer had gone the goon the officer had driven his jeep away and might have gone to a village nearby to shop or to a town the wife had not come out and the children had been taken to school by the older woman in uniforms and with heavy rucksacks the head of the guard who sat in the plastic chair with the rifle across his legs was lolling back badger had moved at a slow crawl to the reed beds it was the first time either had moved in daylight and it was incredible like a liberation simply to stand and stretch arch and flex he could move more than he could in darkness and was freer because he could see what his boots landed on there was the rhythm of foxys breathing beside him he was asleep badgers hand had slipped underneath the folds of his gillie suit and rubbed not scratched one of the many tick scabs on his hip the hand had come out and reached for the water bottle and he had felt the smooth cold line of the coil he couldnt drink the water that lapped the bottom of the reed stems but he could scoop it up in his hands strip down to his boots and socks and wash himself he saw the pocked skin of the ticks bites and had prised others off his body working as carefully as the contortion allowed to see that none of the bloody things was close to his backside he was cooler and cleaner a rare joy it was the bottled water that would kill them badger reckoned there was enough for that day and one more but he felt better for the wash almost human he had gone back on his stomach doing the crawl that took him from the line of the reeds across the open ground then he had insinuated himself under the cover of the fronds burrowed forward until his head and his shoulders were level with foxys and taken over the headset he flinched drew his hand sharply back the touch told him this was not wood plastic or rubber the coil might have been six inches across but could have been as much as nine it filled the gap between his body and foxys was level with their hips he thought his touch on it had been merely the gentlest brush foxy slept badger knew what he had touched he had not seen it but the texture against his fingertips was evidence enough foxy had gone into the reeds with the collapsible shovel had defecated urinated and buried the plastic bag and bottle badger had not known whether he had stripped down to his boots and socks or whether he had just wiped water under his armpits and in his groin his breath had stunk when he came back badgers would have too but the smell of their breath would have matched the general stench of the marsh and the trapped water of the lagoon foxy had been careful coming back had taken an age but had smoothed the dirt behind him and scattered more dead stuff leaving it haphazardly put down had done a good job together they had made an inventory of the water remaining three bottles and it should have been seven or eight in that temperature after the exchange of the headset foxy had taken the watch and badger had slept it could only be a snake badger had seen snakes in zoos when he was a kid and there were snakes on the warmest days up in the brecons that he had known about when stalking paratroops on exercise there were also snakes in gaps in the heather and on flat stones which he had seen when edging close to red deer in the scottish hills testing himself against their eyesight hearing and the quality of their nostrils anyone who knew had told him that snakes were most dangerous when disturbed suddenly from deep sleep then they lashed out he twisted his head a considered slow movement and looked down into the darkened gap between his body and foxys they were both in the scraped hole and across the top of it was scrim net camouflaged and lightweight reed fronds were on top of the netting and some light seeped through the snake filled the space between their bodies and it was coiled tight its tail was towards him and he couldnt see the bastards head where the fangs would be it had been another handover with nothing to be said and badger could listen to the breeze in the reed tops and the charges of birds across the lagoon up to the moment when he had slipped his hand down in the hope that his fingers could massage some relief from the irritation of the scabs he had been desperate for water but the rules were that water should only be drunk when both were awake and the watch changed he thought foxy slept easily head averted breathing regular and with a light snoring in the throat it was important to him that foxy slept easily if he was restless he might pitch over roll onto the snake and panic it it would have slithered into the place it now had between their legs and settled itself if foxys arse landed on it it would retaliate it might go right and it might go left it might go for foxys hand or arm or try to bite through the suit and the lightweight trousers or the leg below the suit and above the socks it might launch itself at badger he lay so still barely daring to breathe and reckoned the head with the fangs and poison sacs was against foxy but less than a foot from himself he couldnt remember ever feeling so bollock naked with fear and remembered talk in the pajero not from alpha juliet but from the welsh guy all said with the lazy casualness that veterans use to frighten the guts out of rookies couple of years ago they was overrun with snakes the marshes shrank and there was only a quarter of the water there had been the snakes were disorientated and came into the villages like they were looking for people and beasts you watch out for snakes bad bastards the main one to watch for is the arbid its bigger than our welsh viper goes to about four foot in length if you see it youll know it and i hope you never see it thick body black mostly but with red on it i dont know about an adult but i was told its bite kills a kiddie in around twenty minutes do we have serums sorry no could remember it now word for word there was a knife in his bergen but not on his belt badger tried to work out how much of an effort it would be to wriggle his body to where he could get down into one of the pouches and extract the knife but didnt have a clear view of it his mind seemed closed down not functioning for solutions shagger had talked some more about the mosquito problem the tick problem the footrot problem he had gone through the list of problems as the pajero had driven north and one had seemed much like another until now how to wake foxy not easy how to wake him and not have him thrashing around he checked ahead and there was no movement at the house he imagined the prick of the fangs he would lash at the fucking thing but it would be faster and would hit him again in the wrist where the veins were and the poison would start to flow maybe the morphine they carried would kill him couldnt have him standing up on the clear patch of mud two hundred yards across the water from the target house using what strength he had left to rip off the suit and his underclothing because the pain of the venom was unsustainable and howling he didnt know what to do with his head tilted he could see the coil foxy didnt seem to move but his voice was clear soft conversational is this young un what youre looking for his hand came out and was close to badgers his hips rolled and his arse shifted his legs twisted inside the suit and his body tipped badger tried to stop him to arrest the movement and hissed for him not to move but was ignored foxy rolled onto the snake his weight pitched onto it is this young un what you needed to find chapter there was a low chuckle no humour the clenched hand three or four inches in front of badgers face obliterated his view of the house he couldnt speak he waited in that moment for foxys backside to heave up in the air the gillie suit to convulse a scream and then for the body to heave away and the snakes the chuckle became laughter the fist under his eyes opened the dirt was caked in the palm badger realised that what bound the mud stopped it disintegrating as dust was old blood he thought the head was an inch long the neck a further inch he couldnt have said how long it had been since the snake was decapitated might have been an hour or done in the night the carcass kept for the joke to be played the lustre had gone from the wound at the neck and the tissue had whitened he saw protruding from the snakes mouth open in death the right fang it would have been attempting to defend itself when it had died and it was frozen in that last act of attempted survival he tried to drag his face away from it but the headsets cable trapped him foxy deliberately let it slip the snakes head came to rest on badgers hands where they held the binoculars and he felt his temper go into freefall foxy said you see young un youre so full of cock that you needed pegging down a notch maybe four or five i meet too many kids who reckon theyre special and have achieved fuckall that impresses me i reckon then that its as good a time as any to peg them he had never hit a man or a child when he was at school in the police in the years before he had gone into surveillance he had never operated in a publicorder environment when the order was given to display the batons and break up a crowd people in the section house and those on the team would have called it redmist time but hed despised that type of violence if the psychiatrist who had an overview of them and saw the croppies once a year had known he was liable to the mist the fast breathing and the burn in his brain then likely he would have been pulled out of the job and sent home might have been told to find a dark room lie down and stay there till his head went cold you were right for pegging young un because you have bullshit coming out of your mouth ears and nose when i get back im going to tell my ellie about you and well have a good laugh her me and a bottle ill tell her what i did for a guy who thought he knew every answer to every question would you have wet your pants or shat in them id like to know so i can tell my ellie you went into the reeds down to the waterline and i could see your boot treads when i went where you squatted and where you washed some of the time you were about a yard away from where this creature was it was asleep and ill bet big money you never saw it they did unarmed combat training in the team and there was talk that they might soon be issued with glock pistols arming them was a divisive issue among the croppies but there was anxiety that a jihadist in search of the key to paradise and the beauty pageant of virgins awaiting him might get a strop if he realised he was under observation come after the officer and put him the image fitted in the orange jumpsuit then do the video if there was a chance to go for suicide and the virgins or the central criminal court and thirty years banged up in belmarsh or long lartin it was likely hed go for shortterm freedom at the expense of the officers life but daniel badger baxter was not classified as violent knew little about selfdefence and was more likely to back off sneak away he felt it come to boiling point he had about forgotten what he was there for and the purpose of the headset on his scalp it was there where you bloody nearly stepped on it and thats from footmarks and i had my old man out and was about to pee when i saw it i took the knife out of my pocket made sure my shadow didnt fall on it and did it first time i can tell you it was one hell of a strike the little fellow never knew what hit him one minute hes dreaming of eating a rat and the next hes short of a head one stab straight down a bit of sawing and the heads off you didnt tell me whether you wet your trousers or shat them ive a good mind young un an innovative one and i reckoned the atmosphere in our little love nest was a bit too solemn needed lightening up they said that the two basics of managing building anger were to count to ten or fifty or a hundred and breathe in slowly his fist was clenched he was not certain what sort of blow he could land in the confined space more of a gesture but a good one worth it so get off your high horse young un and stay off it hang around me and learn think yourself lucky and something of a right jab the punch only had some nine inches to travel it would have been if it had landed square on the cheek or on the forehead little more than a slap but it caught the end of foxys nose and had enough force in it to make the older man jolt there was a moment of shock in his eyes the blood came not much a run from the left nostril through the moustache now ragged and untrimmed to the upper lip nothing was said he didnt know what he could have said badgers father sold secondhand cars not topoftherange but the sort that boys bought when they had their first job and that girls shelled out for when they worked at the royal berkshire hospital and there was no bus route to bring them in paul baxter did tight margins bought cheap and sold cheap was nearly honest and kept a couple of good mechanics working for him in the repair shop round the back of the show room there was a warranty of sorts but difficult to enforce most of the cars stayed on the road long enough for his father not to be embarrassed by the sale but a few did not he never apologised and never explained never said how sorry he was that the carburettor had blown up on the motorway and never explained that a nineyearold carburettor in that model of fiat was a driving disaster like father like son badger didnt apologise for hitting joe foxy foulkes across the nose and making it bleed and didnt explain that the heat and the dehydration were wrecking him destroying him and that snakes were bad news for him he had his binoculars up if they had been in england and it had been witnessed there would have been a disciplinary hearing and a kangaroo court foxy would have been censured for the jape with the snake and badger would have been suspended on full pay pending further inquiries for striking a fellow officer it was actually quite a good joke with the snake they settled and the silence nestled on them a good joke yes but he wouldnt say so and foxy wouldnt tell him he was sorry and out of order no offence meant there would be another flashpoint badger did not gamble but he rated it as a banker that they would explode again no voices were on the headset and the thirst scratched his throat they wouldnt allow themselves another drink for an hour minimum the sweat took more moisture from his body and the house seemed to sway in the binocular lenses the lagoon shimmered and his eyes hurt he had to grind his fingernails into his palm to hold some any concentration there was washing barely moving on the line and a guard asleep an otter swam by languidly and time was running out for them he didnt know what would cause the next explosion of temper hamfist had come forward she hadnt moved still sat crosslegged he had brought a bottle of tepid water and put it down beside her hip hed seen that her gaze didnt confront the crowd but was on the ground a little ahead of her the crowd had just done prayers had swung away from the gate and taken a line to the east the standoff began again they reckoned him shagger corky and harding that she had temporarily calmed the crowd for all the broken heads and probably broken bones the men seemed comatose might have been the heat hed had a company commander up highway at alamara who daily blessed the heat of the day and thanked the good lord for any temperature above a hundred degrees fahrenheit because it drained hostile energy out of the young bucks the crowd had no shade neither did she he stood tall if it had not been for the alcohol hed have been promoted above his last substantive rank corporal could have made it up to platoon sergeant the drink did him and there had often enough been that regretful look from officers when theyd busted him down he denied to himself that he had a problem with drink hamfist had heard it said and clung to it leechlike that an alcoholic was a man who couldnt remember the last day on which he hadnt had a drink it was yesterday and the day before if they had charged at her suddenly he was confident of the quick reaction that would have dropped them on the dirt track before they were halfway if the weapon on the strap across his chest had jammed he had grenades gas blast and fragmentation and a pistol if the weapons had jammed and the grenades had malfunctioned he would have used his hands and boots to protect her they would have had to take his life before they reached her the other boys were the same he was thirtyone years old and his thirtysecond birthday would come round in eleven days she knew the date shagger corky and harding didnt she had known the previous year his thirtyfirst and he hadnt broadcast it but it would have been in the file shed have flipped through before hed joined her protection detail god knew where shed bought it it was wrapped up in smart paper and there was a little card on it hamfist happy day best aj and inside was a crumbling cake with fruit and orange rind and sliced almonds in circles on the top the best dundee cake hed ever eaten for all it was damaged in transit there had been nothing from his wife hed not shared the cake but had eked it out and made it last into a seventh week he understood what she had done and how she hoped to extricate them her decision to use the site where there had once been oildrilling exploration teams her decision too that they were close enough to the surveillance boys and inside the golden hour of protection her decision now to sit in the dirt exposed to the sun face the crowd and wait if it came to fighting they wouldnt survive another night hamfist couldnt know whether she had called right or wrong if a leader came she might have called right and if there was no leader and only darkness she had called wrong it was a big call and it would matter for the men up front the hours drifted and time passed the sun had started to tilt and he no longer stood astride his own shadow it had begun to nudge out towards his left side and the soft shape of his body on the dirt was broken by the rifles barrel not for him to say that they walked a line a high wire and that maybe they headed for disaster not for him to say that she didnt drink the water he had brought her she sat and never moved they started up the engines every two hours one black hawk crew would go through the procedures while the other rested and an hour later it would be reversed each had a pair of general electric tge turbo shafts and each manufactured a power of hp while the pilot and his colleague sat up front and did their checks the cabin guys did the lookover on the m machine guns they were ready and each hour a few of the men and women not yet due to return to the states or to be shipped to kabul would stand in little huddles in what shade they could find to watch before the drawdown was well advanced it would have been possible for the black hawks with their unmarked black fuselages that were the signature of specialforces operations the covert stuff to be parked out of sight where only a chosen few maintenance technicians had access times had changed the endofempire days dictated that a hefty chunk of the base was now in the hands of local forces and only an area inside a contracted perimeter remained for the americans clerks typists cooks marines off duty from security rosters would watch the exhausts spew fumes feel the draught of the rotors and dream inside every american compound life was now stultifyingly dull no fire fights no patrols no finds of arms caches and no bodies to be photographed they stayed behind the blast walls and saw nothing of the country but its skies blue and merciless they pumped iron played basketball and smoked what they could find the helicopters broke the monotony and intrigued them on immediate standby prepared for a mission cloaked in secrecy they attracted attention when the cabin doors were pulled right back medical gear and stacked gurneys were visible tristram closed down the engines and eddie did the calls as the switches were flipped dwayne wrapped a tea towel round the breech of his machine gun and the rounds in the belt then secured it with tape federico aped him for those on the ground the rubberneckers the attraction was that they might see a final time the birds take off and fly low over walls and fences then across the desert and go into actual motherfuck combat the suppression fire of the machine guns would be called for and thered be blood on the cabin floor lives at risk and it was a dream and good enough for the voyeurs in drawdown days excitement was sparse they jumped down boots hitting the tarmacadam of the apron a few pocket cameras were pointed at them but their shades were good enough protection tristram said i got the whole lot of charts and the software fed for the iran frontier eddie said up to the frontier not over it i have that the far side of the frontier and theyre on their own not negotiable wherever theyre coming from how far over the frontier they have to get this side of it for us to go over there is classified as an act of war into iran and when we land back im up for court martial bet your life and castration no one will believe the navigation screwed me but it would be good to fly a last time his voice dropped problem is if we get called theyre in deep shit out there at the edge of survival for the sake of those guys i half hope we dont get to fly a last time i dont want state secrets but are you any further forward she had come into central london carrying a plastic bag filled with clean clothing cant say len gibbonss shrug was expressive honestly my love i dont know they were in the same coffee shop across haymarket from his office and she had already shown him the shirts she had brought on the train pity there were no shoes the only pair he had with him were damp from so much rain and sleet and now from the sprinkle of snow just trying to plan audrey said theres a meeting at the garden centre advice on how to protect shrubs in winter its next monday i didnt want to accept her invite if youd just come home that evening is it likely he grimaced in the dark and i havent a candle be on the safe side and go they had been through much had walked those routes together and hed valued her as a crutch when the world had caved around his shoulders her hand had come across the table to rest on his fist her rings were witness to the commitment they had made to each other before marriage and before the career setback he would not have survived it without her and he had often speculated which dreary branch of government he would now figure in if he had allowed himself to walk away from six work and pensions environment farming and rural affairs education and sciences she had a habit of lowering her voice until it dripped conspiracy is it a big one by my standards people on the ground at the sharp end in danger i carry the responsibility she looked far into his eyes is it like the old days when you were young tilting at windmills the world yours and me running to keep up like that they might have been alone on a suffolk beach in a scottish forest or on a welsh hillside and only honesty counted len gibbons said i can hide it pretty well but ive not felt such excitement in thirty years im alive with it ill go to the end of any road in front of me to see this one through and make it work three decades of sneers and titters ive lived with this sort of makes it worthwhile all those bastards who put me down i think im going to walk all over them i feel blessed to be a part of it is it going to happen gods truth i dont know im willing it to just have to believe it will she smiled would have tried to offer encouragement itll be all right len if its not and goes public theyll crucify me at the towers but itll be worse for those at the sharp end on the ground he lifted her hand kissed it passed her another bag the dirty bundle and was gone out of the door the snow had eased but the sleet drove hard they were never out of his mind those for whom he carried responsibility and the man he targeted it was the end of his day the engineer stood in the anteroom outside the brigadiers office and the secretary gave him the fat envelope telling him it contained his travel documents he opened the envelope glanced at the top sheet and said the itinerary would exhaust his wife she shrugged she reached down for the big envelope at her feet and said these were the xray and scan results requested from tehran she unlocked a drawer from another envelope she took two passports both bearing the crest of the czech republic finally from a plastic pouch she took a mass of euro banknotes and ostentatiously counted out a thousand in different denominations he read her attitude were there no better calls for foreign currency was there not a medical framework inside the islamic republic superior to any other why was so much deference shown to him the items went into his briefcase she rang through then indicated cursorily with her hand that he should go inside the office he was greeted did he have everything was he satisfied he did and he was he wondered whether this ranking officer knew of the questions put to him by a colleague and whether a crude trap had been set for him or whether the regime was indeed a house of cards but that early evening he was not to be tested and tricked come back to us soon and safe with the best news of naghmeh i would like you to consider who you are and therefore understand the esteem in which we hold you you are to us our nobel or our kalashnikov even our oppenheimer you are the father of the bomb in the road do you know of a town in england rashid that stops when the coffins come through or of the crowds that line the bridges of the highway of heroes in canada do you know of the communities in the united states that come to a silent halt when a local soldier is brought back you sapped their will to fight rashid you broke their commitment when the time is judged correct your devices will be shipped to afghanistan and the sophistication of the war raised afghanistan will be fertile ground for you we will not tolerate the great satans military or the little satans against our borders our prayers go with you he was kissed on each cheek and went out of the door he hurried to the parking area and looked for his driver he could not telephone her never did so he could not tell her what was in place until he was back at his home stomach runs had arrived one of the many strains of basra belly it was early evening and the air was cooler but without a wind so the smell in the hide was foul it had come on fast bowel movements were not a chosen subject for conversation among croppies nor likely to be foxy would have said among astronauts how moonwalkers or surveillance men did their business was not big on the talk agenda among colleagues one minute badger had been lying beside him on his rest time and the next he had been squirming to turn over and the top of the hides camouflage above the scrim net had jumped he had scrabbled for the plastic bags not a smell for living with foxy relief writ large was more constipated than the other way there was nothing he could have done had he wanted to help diarrhoea was part and parcel of a croppies job foxy did not know how much was in badgers trousers how much in the bag and how much had spilled onto the earth of the hide badger was wiping hard almost furiously they had with them tubes of sanitary jelly that cleaned hands and that was next on badgers list then the pills they hadnt spoken since the punch was thrown on the headset there was only the crackled voice of a radio announcer and music he watched the front of the house and waited for the car to come for the children to run out and the target the tango to get home strange old life he lived because of ripa regulation of investigatory powers act the trade of lawenforcement surveillance was watched eagleeyed for abuses couldnt call a bad guy a target in a briefing because it might come up in the legal process and to name the accused in court as a target was likely to be prejudicial he watched for the target and the targets wife and wondered whether she was resting or filling the suitcase that had been brought for her the goon the officer had been on his chair as the sun had started to dip hed had the binoculars on his chest and seemed to use them to watch birds maybe birds were his turnon there was nothing for him to listen to but his nose was filled with the smell badger did not apologise perhaps it was not appropriate to apologise for diarrhoea maybe foxy would have done if hed had any other oppo no apology and no wind to freshen the air possible to go in reasonable secrecy from the hide after darkness came but that was more than an hour away badger had swallowed imodium which would sort of plug him probably taken enough to stop niagara in full flow he hadnt asked what the correct dose should be foxy watched the goon and couldnt get the stink out of his nose when darkness dropped badger could move with his bags whatever was soiled and the collapsible entrenching shovel to dig the pit the pig came the sow he knew stories about pigs had heard them from the base medic an orthopaedic specialist who had talked about them after hed put an interpreter back together the man had been out in the marshes with a patrol when he was charged a thigh bone had been broken and a knee smashed when the big beast came out of the reed bed to the right of him and badger and moved purposefully over the open ground grunting foxy thought they faced a problem the problem worsened the boar followed the sow badger swore the sow led old teats hung slack from her underbelly and the mud glistened on her was caught among the whiskers at her mouth the boar had big bollocks and more important tusks jutting from the lower jaw badger thought the sow looked dumb hungry inquisitive but that the boar was menacing he could see why at each side of his mouth where the cheeks were there were twin welts the skin was broken and there were weepy patches badger realised that the tusks were ingrowing and pierced the flesh which would have been enough to make the brute mean they came closer were within twenty feet they stopped now they were wary badger thought the sow might be the more cautious the little eyes gleamed bright tracking towards them in the last years badger had had birds come and perch on him little songbirds blackbirds and pigeons and once a snipe had walked on elegant legs across his hands rabbits had played a few feet in front of him and a fox had been over his back jumping to clear it as if his spine was a fallen log mice and rats had used his gillie suit for warmth his ability to blend into nature made him good at what he did as good as any better than the old idiot beside him a rat heavy with the young it was carrying had made a friend of him enough for him to worry that he might be playing midwife when its time came he could be still and didnt know how still foxy could stay there were flies round him badger could accept rats mice and birds sharing his space but the flies fazed him during the day and the mosquitoes were worse in the evenings all irrelevant the sow mattered most badger thought that if she backed away or lost interest the boar would tuck along her interest was aroused but she did not yet seem to feel threatened the boars size was intimidating he would have been more than a yard to the shoulder and the tusks were four or five inches long the creature must live with perpetual discomfort foxy had wriggled a little making enough noise to raise the sows ears he murmured ive a pepper spray badger thought he read it better he had four plastic bags all partially filled one pair of fetid underpants and a body that stank he flicked his eyes away the kids had come out of the house with the old lady and the goon was out of his chair there was far away dust rising between the trees where the road was and guards were coming out of the barracks rifles loose on straps across their backs and chests the wife came leaning on her stick foxy passed badger the pepper spray then clasped the headset tighter against his skull tiny movements he would have been straining to hear any remark made badgers own movement was to take the penknife from his belt and unclasp it the blade was only two inches long but he thought it enough and preferred it to the spray he saw the car the mercedes saloon it was driven past the barracks and veered towards the house at that distance the cries of the children were faint but clear their excitement carried he might as well have laid a trail of aniseed grain or swill the sow came forward badger could not stand up clear away the scrim and the camouflage get hold of the plastic bags chuck them out and wave a deodorant spray to replace the smell of his shit with lemon fragrance he thought now the pig knew he was there she was beside the edge of the scrape where the scrim and the dead leaves covered his bergen she was two feet perhaps a few inches more from him she pawed the ground the boar followed the target came out of the car and his driver carried his briefcase the children were around him and he lifted the little girl the goon faced out across the water and the open space that flanked the reed bed would have been in his view it was the wife who saw the pigs and pointed at them the boar was pushing at the shoulder of the sow trying to come close badger saw the eyes and each whisker each bristle the sharp broken end of a tusk the boar panted now the boar led he had pushed aside the sow he drove down with his nose the scrim snagged on a tusk the snout pushed the beast might weigh a hundred kilos a hundred and fifty it routed in the scrim for the bags and badger had the knife the boars weight pressed down on him and he used his left hand to hold the scrim tight then jabbed the knife blade upwards and hit what felt like thick rubber or a leather wad blood spurted from the space between the nostrils the pig reared back the scrim ripped the foliage fell away and he let out a scream of pain loud and shrill parading that he was hurt maybe the boar didnt know what had made the pain who had hurt him he ran across the mud of the open ground heading for the lagoon the sow followed seeming reluctant and confused they hit the water in front of the house everyone watched the sow and the boar lumbered at speed towards deep water until only their heads remained visible they seemed to make for the end of the mud spit where badger had built the platform with foliage washed away from the reed bed where the microphone was mounted in front of the house they turned away as if the spectacle was over and badger chose that moment to congratulate himself the pigs swam towards the spit foxys head jerked forward his turn to swear the cable to the headset had tautened the boar broke the surface close to the mud spit kicked rolled and tried to throw off an impediment the cable was pulled up from the mud in front of the hide badger saw it rise in the water there was a final convulsion and the cable from foxys headset went slack there were gravel pits out to the west of reading and alongside the motorway the teenage danny baxter had known them as well as any heron did it was to one of them that he had taken his dads accountant and brought him close to an otters holt the man had never seen the creature up close and was thrilled enough to become a referee of status when danny had gone for the police job anglers patronised the gravel pits once from the hide hed made for himself he had watched a bent straining rod a tight line and huge swirls from the depths it had gone on for twenty minutes or more until the line had floated back loose nothing to hold it the guy hadnt known he was watched had sworn kicked out and sent his stool and a rucksack into the water it would have been a big pike that had snapped his line danny had seen it now the line was exposed on the mud spit and floated on the waters surface he saw where it ran up the spit and went into the mess of foliage where the microphone was it hurt to speak to foxy but he had to know it was like he took a backward step one question does it work a nod as if he were an interruption to concentration therefore a goddamn nuisance then yes but couldnt you have done a halfdecent job with the cable bit bloody obvious young un because you didnt bury it properly it was the cable was a dark line across yellow mud then a black thread over the water if the goon the officer went back to his chair and used his binoculars to look again for the birds the otters or the pigs he must see had to the cable on the mud and where it floated he thought hed done well in concealing it and better than that in getting rid of the pigs but his efforts had been ignored everyone except the security man was now inside the house and the light was failing they had nothing his throat hurt from lack of water the irritation of the tick scabs and mosquito bites was acute and the plastic bags were by his knees the quiet came and almost forgotten because of the sow and the boar the smell returned time was running out their covert rural observation post was near to compromised and they had nothing to report there had been a reevaluation he was told when he had been called to the units offices he had brought his bag he was taken by one of their drivers to the airport it had been decided gabbi should fly that evening to europe a neurosurgeon at tel avivs assuta hospital the most expensive and discreet in the country had been asked late to advise the medical opinion was that several european capitals had capacity beyond the best in tehran that a consultation at any one of a dozen locations might take little longer than the time needed for an examination consideration and the decision to operate or not it was explained that the couple could within a dozen hours twentyfour at most be back at whichever airport they had flown into and looking for a flight home the unit planned on the basis that information on a destination would be fed to them and any who were privy to the surveillance mission mounted from the southeastern iraqi marshlands and harboured doubts did not share them he did not know whether leah had worked on this last stage of preparation she had been normal in bed the previous night and over a light breakfast then had left on the bus he had planned a gym workout and the phone had rung the call to come in and the instruction that he should bring a bag she might have known she might not he would go to rome he had collected his passport the republic of ireland was the flavour of that month the days of big operations he had been told were over there would never again be deployed as many as had gone down to the gulf with tennis recquets and wigs nor did they look for the spectacular of the exploding headrest on a car seat the detonating mobile phone when held against an enemys face or the poison squirting into an ear one bullet two maximum was the days order on arrival in rome he would be booked into an airport hotel within sight of the terminals and the call would come to send him forward or bring him home he was not one to complain about the vagueness of the plans he accepted what was put before him if leah had known her kiss that morning as she went to work would have been no different they would not hold the el al flight for him if he was late to delay takeoff could only draw attention to him the car went fast on the airport road a poem was in his mind breathes there the man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said this is my own my native land he was the servant of the state and did not doubt what the state asked of him whose heart hath neer within him burnd as home his footsteps he hath turnd from wandering on a foreign strand he would not challenge what was asked of him and did not believe he could look into a face see life and humanity and hesitate he liked the poetry of walter scott but most of all he loved patriotism and he had faith he did not query where the road took him when hed boarded he would have forgotten the poem and would be engrossed in a business magazine the arrangements were in place it was a blacktie evening the consultant had used his authority to make the booking for scan facilities and xray without the usual requirement of a patients name it had predictably been queried he had snapped back that there was more to medicine than filling in forms and had seen a longserving assistant wilt he did not feel able to tell his staff that an unidentified iranian with the cooperation of the berlin embassy and the likely support of an intelligence agency suffering potentially terminal illness was to be inflicted on them so he had blustered and been unnaturally rude his status at the university medical school was such that no complaint would be lodged her parents would mind magda for the evening the blacktie occasion was a celebration of a local politicians birthday an influential woman from the ruling party with the ability to dispense patronage he and lili would be with the great and the good of the city in such company his given name was steffen and his family name was that of his wife he was steffen weber and soon there would be a prefix to his name the title professor he changed in the bedroom lili was at her dressingtable and sat in her underwear to apply her cosmetics he could have said that until the last week he had been successfully absorbed into the german dream the downturn in the economy seemed not to affect him but he had brought the mood home if he had talked to her it would have been a burden shared he had not he carried it alone easiest would be to look the patient in the face he did it often enough assume a look of principled sympathy and say it straight i am so sorry there is nothing i can do i regret that the question of surgery does not arise those patients hurried away and he had a cup of coffee then carried on with his day that evening in the rathaus there would be good food fine wine and a string quintet he would be among the elite and accepted he sensed a shadow hung over him dust trailed behind the big car abigail jones had heard all four of her boys arm their weapons it was a defining moment the crowd ahead parted the car was driven through it and came to stop in front of her had to or the bmw series would have gone right over her squashing the life from her body the driver braked with a certain flamboyance and the tyres scattered dirt some falling on her it was about appearances and postures and she took her time she did not stand until the man had emerged from the darkened interior it was a start a good one she had demanded that a leader come and he had he was gross at the waist wore a bulging thobe long but cut like a white nightshirt a ghutra on his head chequered cloth with woven ropes to hold it in place and sandals he carried a mobile phone in one hand his beads in the other an assault rifle hung from a shoulder and over the shirt he had a wellcut and discreetly patterned sports jacket that would have come from a london tailor or from paris what else for abigail to learn he used a potent eaudecologne he had brought a youth with him perhaps a son or nephew who carried a briefcase and two men for security along with the driver as he approached her she stood did it easily did not betray exhaustion dehydration or stiffness it was corky who had read it the irishman scurried forward with two old packing cases from the buildings he put them down as if they were goodquality chairs and used his sleeve to wipe them the defining moment she knew it and her boys it was down to her skills as to whether they stayed or whether they were hoofed and in the process lost the mass of their gear if they were hoofed the guys up ahead were beyond reach she smiled always did that well seemed to show frankness and honesty she called him sheikh and invited him to sit it was over water youve had a drink only the quality of the microphone and its cable link were more important to them than water i havent the light was sinking badger had been out of the hide and had gathered more dead fronds from inside the reed beds he had waited until a rare cloud was over the last of the suns brilliance then had scattered pieces over the cable he could not affect without going far out into the water the part of the cable that floated why not wade out too knackered badger had never known such tiredness he could hike in bad weather trek on moss and bog and lose sleep he didnt have the strength hed needed those hours before when hed scraped out the hide moved the surplus earth into the reed bed then gone out into the lagoon his gillie suit absorbing water weighing enough almost to drag him down and built up the flotsam on the mud spit to hide the microphone were not due to have a drink for threequarters of an hour fortythree minutes actually dont make accusations young un that you cant prove he came back groped his way into the hide and the cloud was now off the sun one last beam of gold light penetrated the scrim and hed seen the glisten at foxys mouth the dribble on his cheek the diarrhoea had weakened badger he had come back to the hide crawling feeling faint worse shape than hed known and the job of hiding the cable only half complete the exchange was in cutting whispers neither voice raised youve been at the water its on your bloody face you cant prove it weve enough for today enough for tomorrow were supposed in this heat to drink seven or eight litres a day each if we have a litre and a half each were lucky its despicable to steal water shut your mouth young un before i shut it for you he did so but intended it to be temporary he went into his bergen and brought out the bottle he held it up and squinted at the level it was about halfway down he hadnt marked it there was no indent on the plastic where his thumbnail had gouged a line had it been spit on foxys cheek he reckoned not his own throat was too dry for saliva and he was dehydrated enough for there to be no sweat coming off him if hed tried to spit he would have scarred the skin in a parched mouth badger was sure he pushed the bottle at foxy right up to his face you want to drink help yourself dont bloody play with me young un go on drink it all have yours and mine watch it finish this bottle and start the last swig your way through that too youre pushing me young un and when its all gone we can fuck off out of it if thats what you want the scrim netting that held together the head covering he wore was gripped youre shit young un when this is over ill tell the world what shit you were here tell all gibbonss crowd tell them everywhere i get to take a seminar ill wreck you badger thought he was right but the light had gone and he wouldnt know apologise no might he have been wrong no and there was no worse crime than taking rationed water the security lights came on outside the house the goon paced and the children came out to kick a ball foxy said my misfortune was to be teamed with a kiddie who was so ignorant and had so little comprehension of the english language as to be at moron level know what moron is young un or is that too big a word for you again he couldnt help himself badger did the shortarm jab the head was twisted so the blow cracked into the right side of the headset it fell apart foxy said not just a moron but an ignorant one the woman came out and badger saw her through the glasses a misted figure against the background lights the children still played with the ball she looked proud he thought and brave she had dignity he watched and admired her she stood alone leaned on her stick and didnt speak to the goon he wondered how it would be for her a sea change in her life when it hung in the balance was in a medical mans hands he couldnt say how it would be for her if the approach was made and her man was turned and he couldnt shift further from foxy it was as if he were anchored to the man chapter they had drunk water two mouthfuls each and it had been foxys turn to finish the bottle he had held it longingly to his mouth and sucked the final drops one bottle remained the silence wouldnt last through the night the moon climbed foxy badger realised was exhausted and close to breaking point he couldnt sleep not until the house lights were put out and conversations were stilled would foxy pass over the headset and close his eyes the anger each felt for the other was raw of course badger was labelled a moron and ignorant and foxy was accused of being the cheat who stole water the light had gone the moon was on the climb the target the engineer was out smoked and walked but he was alone there were birds in the water ahead splashing and badger thought that once he heard the convulsion of a pig and wondered if the wound he had made in the nostril was infected he sensed foxy would break the silence first felt him to be increasingly restless it was worse to be branded a cheat than to be called an idiot without education was he certain that the water level had been lower than it should have been certain a big word foxy could not move from the hide and go into the reed bed to crap or piss it was two full days since the new suitcase had gone inside the main door it would not have been bought to be shoved into a corner but because travel was imminent there would be if fortune favoured them one remark half a sentence or a throwaway comment he didnt think foxy could last much more than the night and another halfday and didnt reckon he himself had the strength to go on past the end of the following day he hadnt seen foxys skin he assumed it would be the same as his own mottled with tick scabs and mosquito bites not possible to lie still because the itching was so great and the flies came for their ears noses and mouths could burrow under the scrim net never again would badger complain about a welsh hillside rain a low mist night frost a view of a farmhouse with a field for campers would be paradise if there ever was an again he had twice punched a fellow officer another croppie and had allowed himself to be niggled by rank and personality if it were ever revealed by his oppo that twice he had thrown punches and had accused a colleague of cheating and stealing there would not be an again the thought jagged his mind what did a croppie do with himself after he was booted out for gross misconduct for assault for screwing up in the field and going unprofessional hed go to work for a local authority tailing disabilitybenefit guys who did halfmarathons and played golf twice a week after limping down to collect the handout dosh hed be on the phone burning the ears of former policemen who ran pi firms and found evidence of marital infidelity or did inhouse security on companies that were leaking petty cash and equipment he would have nowhere to go that was anything like satisfactory to him would he jack it in he wouldnt grovel hed lose his job before foxy broke there was a trace of a whine there was no call to hit me badger gave him nothing and no call to make that accusation badger thought foxy had broken because having barely moved since the hide was made he would not be able to get out and do the legging back to the extraction point ive tried to do a good job in extraordinarily difficult conditions and worth thinking about the retreat from the hide because the mission was fucked and the target had been driven away or was complete because the information had been radioed out was well worth consideration a repetition in his mind of what he dreaded most the car came the new suitcase was loaded and there might be a label on it they could not with a scope or binoculars read and the engineer and his wife the goon the wifes mother and the kids didnt say where they were going to have done this for nothing would be the humiliation of his life and he would stand accused of misconduct and professional failure because foxy would nail him badger would make no apology would not help in going to the extraction point in exchange for two punches being forgotten and a cheating call being wiped off a slate and ive had no cooperation from you no support no comradeship badger watched the engineer could have been his fourth cigarette he was still alone and walking no longer in silhouette from the lights behind him thrown from the house but moving away from the little pier where the dinghy was tied he passed an old iron crane that in daylight seemed rustcoated it was beside the water and might have dated back to a time when the water was the main highway and went on towards the duller lights that fringed the area round the barracks he was heading for the bund line to the right of course i shouldnt have expected more from you too easy for you newcomers and too easy makes for arrogance and arrogance makes a kid useless what did i say you were badger raked the shore with the binoculars which were good for watching the house but had the nightsight ready for when the engineer was walking towards the raised track of the bund line he could have scripted the line that would follow it did i said you were moronic and ignorant i had that right double time hours of building resentment were over a dike had been breached foxy had the verbal shits badger thought he himself felt calmer and was not about to hit him again it was likely that the water had been drunk out of hours did i say without good cause that youre moronic and ignorant are you fool enough to think that his head was nine inches from foxys their shoulders touched and their hips their smell mingled the compulsion to scratch the scabs on his stomach was worse now and the mosquitoes swarmed if they made it out reached the extraction point loaded up the pajeros and foxy foulkes pompous oldworld did not put in a careerkiller report on him his life would resume alongside ged in hides sodden ditches and damp hedgerows he would tell the stories with relish he followed the engineer with his binoculars then laid them down and took up the nightsight the moon climbed higher and the birds were noisier on the water how much of a moron enough of a moron to buy the shit they gave you the goon the officer was out of the barracks and walking towards the house the flash of a cigarette lighter burned out the nightvision image he watched the security officer used the binoculars he felt tension coming in his shoulders a tightening in his gut and was confused you bought it and believed it they must have pissed themselves gibbons the yank and the jew laughing at you because of your ignorance back of the classroom were you put your hand up did you please sir whats interdiction they gave you a bucket of shit and you swallowed it want to know what interdiction means want to know that it doesnt mean an approach and turning an enemy want to know what youve signed up for young un all the muscles had stiffened and his stomach had knotted cold had settled on the back of his neck and he held his breath you volunteered for a spooksponsored stakeout on what is bloody near enemy territory without the finesse of a war declaration the target for surveillance is the man who makes the bombs that kill our boys and hes right for interdiction and you think that means some sort of cosy approach a butteringup in the hope the bastard will fall into our arms youve all this shit about sitting in the countryside wildlife around you joys of bloody nature and maybe you get to have a little cry because a deers snagged on barbed wire a rabbits choking in a snare or a fucking rat has a thorn in its pad a wanking dreamer thats what you are the military use of the word interdiction is about taking down with the use of fire power its the destruction of the enemys potential to fight how does it relate to this guy the engineer builder of bombs interdiction for him means that hes killed its why im here and why you re here difficult when youre ignorant maybe a moron to know whats real hes for killing taking down and youre a part of the process a big part it was as though he had been hit in the stomach but he held onto the binoculars and could see the goon near to the house speaking to a guard an arm pointed away towards the bund line in your education the little of it you had did they tell you about killing we use fancy words we harvest fish cull deer when we bomb a village and get the wrong target thats not a screwup but collateral damage its bollocks intended to soften actuality hes going to be killed didnt you know that smartarse the officer was striding out of the light going at pace he could have been sick it was that sort of blow that hed taken the one that made a man double up then heaved the puke into his throat he didnt know now how he could have swallowed what hed been told he almost cringed foxy warmed would have sensed hed hit home its deniable we finger the man they move in a hit team because weve told them where to look hes stabbed or strangled poisoned or shot and youre a part of it does that put you young un outside your comfort zone he had the binoculars down and held the nightsight hard at his face his eyeline took his head away from foxys mouth but the voice dripped on and there was triumph in it dont think it bothers me young un because im an old bastard and theres not much can happen to me different for you your age that stage in a career when you reckon youre the dogs bollocks instead you might just be in shit an integral part in an extrajudicial killing which is at least accessory to murder youre a part of it and your defence is that you didnt know what interdiction meant reckon theyll be queuing up to believe you extrajudicial is what youre into he came level with him for mansoor with the muscle wastage in his leg from the wound it was a struggle to catch the engineer it should not have happened he had hurried as best he could from the house and past the barracks then onwards until he saw the silhouetted figure in the moonlight high on the elevated bund line the struggle to get the breath into his lungs the pain from his leg and anger fuelled his aggression you should not be here defiance from the engineer lit by mansoors torch i walk where i care to walk my responsibility is to protect you you ask me where you walk and when said softly and with no trace of resentment you forget yourself mansoor i do not you forget who you are and who i am i do not forget that it is my duty to protect you i do my duty as best i can i cannot protect you if you walk far from your home in the night and i am not warned here at my home there is a threat there are thieves there could be smugglers bringing drugs there are the marsh people who would slit your throat for a packet of cigarettes or the coins in your pocket you are dutiful and i am grateful do such imaginary threats equate with the threat to my wifes life call it a matter of perspective it is my duty and tomorrow for how long i cannot say you are relieved of that duty it is wrong that i will not be there i should go with you security i think is the smallest problem that faces naghmeh and me i wanted to walk and think now to please you mansoor we will walk back together they did the engineer had lit another cigarette and mansoor stayed a halfpace behind him the moonlight was on the reeds and reflected in silver lines off the water birds splashed and there were ripples from an otters hunting he apologised it could go badly for him if the engineer reported his rudeness it was accepted and hand slapped his shoulder it irritated him that he was not permitted on the ground of cost he had been told to travel with them and when we are gone tomorrow mansoor what will you do be certain that the old lady does not want for help and i will watch for the ibis i hope to see it and my prayers will be with you i will look for that bird what else it was thought harding a master class from her in avoidance and evasion he was the only one of the boys close enough to hear he didnt understand everything because they flitted between english and local arabic the rest were back relaxed now and would have let their weapons hang loose across their legs it was a strange way to do business he used english and most of her answers were in arabic but it helped harding that he repeated most of what shed said translated it in the business she represented a charity from europe of ecofreaks who wanted nothing more or less from their money than to have the most complete survey of flora and fauna in the marshes with particular emphasis on the bird life he did not contradict her but pointed out that the area of the marshes she had chosen for her valuable welcome research was not inside the triangle that had as its apex the confluence of the tigris and euphrates rivers and was the widest most accessible part of the wetlands but was hard up against the iranian border she spoke of the importance of the habitat he spoke of the sensitivity of the frontier zone she told him of the value placed on the wildlife of the marshes its uniqueness and also its vulnerability he told her of the suspicion if her presence were known of the revolutionary guards who patrolled a few kilometres down the bund line she said she carried references and letters of introduction from people who were in the elite of government he said it was interesting that none had accompanied her on her research journey she held her line harding reckoned and he held his she said she was trained in the preservation of wildlife he did not accuse her of being in the employ of britains intelligence service she sparkled and flattered he had mischief in his eyes and humour she remarked that the charity backing her could be generous to those who smoothed paths he responded that the marsh people would always be grateful to those who showed meaningful generosity it was to harding obvious that her cover story wasnt believed nothing of it they liked each other the sheikh let her know he had a brother who sold real estate in california and that another brother had been hanged by order of the old regime in the abu ghraib gaol that he himself had been imprisoned then released and allowed to return to lead his people but of course had never willingly served saddam hussein and the baathists harding watched the dance played out the sheikh could drive away head for the army camp at alamara report her presence and earn credit for future favours also he could send someone across the border to the first roadblock on the ahvaz road and tell the men manning it that he had brought a message for an officer of the revolutionary guard corps that would earn him money and hed be repaid also with safe passage for smugglers bringing him opiate paste for onward selling harding seven years with proeliator security and fourteen with the american marines did not play cards for money never had the aunt who had raised him regarded any form of gambling as the devils work card games he assumed were about bluff and trickery who now tricked whom who could depend on a bluff not being called he watched listened and his mind flitted from the sheikh sitting on the crate and his jones lady now crosslegged in the dirt his thoughts had moved on strange guys neither to his liking he didnt think that the older man or the younger one would have joined him on the whore hunt in dubai or would have been with him when he shivered at night on street corners or shared the lie he lived neither would have made him laugh or drunk with him until they were unable to stand but he would go to his maker defending them why loyalty was the creed he lived by as loyal as the men from a marine platoon had been whod fought their way through towards four of them holed up in a house as crowds gathered and cut off a retreat route loyalty was a duty whether they could stay in place and exercise the loyalty owed to the two men who were forward depended on her ability to negotiate the radio stayed silent and the guys up ahead had nothing to report hours ticked by and little time was left he could imagine a scrape the weight of the camouflage gear the flies ticks and mosquitoes the smells hunger and thirst the sheikh might sell them to his own military or to the iranians across the border and be well rewarded by either she might buy them time they negotiated a local leader of education and authority over a swarm of peasants and an officer of an intelligence agency they were equals he didnt play card games but had watched others she had only a fistful of dollar bills and a sweet girlish charm he couldnt say how the game would play out he thought hard on the guys up ahead and the moon had risen high and the mosquitoes had gathered in droning clouds if the sheikh reckoned a better deal lay elsewhere pushed himself up off the crate and walked back towards his car then it was over for all of them and loyalty to the guys far forward was well fucked and bust it is deniable because it is deniable because it is illegal who sanctioned it from high up someone sitting on the top of the mountain but dont look for a written minute young un youll not find an electronic trail and dont imagine theres schedules of meetings look back at it what am i looking back at start with the people you met the transport there and the place then focus on the people the transport was unmarked and you can lay good money or bad that somehow the flight records have been mislaid and no flight path was filed or can be found for the chopper and the big house takes guests but nobody signed a register anyone goes back to that house and tries to prove we were there in the face of bland denials it wont be provable their grandson was killed by one of those bombs sideoftheroad ieds and theyd rather like the bastard who built it to be killed put on a flat slab of granite in a wilderness left as carrion for the birds are you getting the picture what about the people was there anybody of seniority anybody who cut the mustard had authority was natural with power expected to be listened to if this had been a police operation there would have been a commander perhaps an assistant chief constable they werent there nobody of rank was had one of them been allocated he would have called in sick any bastard with a career worth preserving a pension to look after and the hope of a gong would have stayed away and they did you called him gibbons and i called him boss what was he a journeyman theyre stacked shoulder to shoulder that type at the box and six theyve reached a plateau of promotion going no higher and too bloody frightened to quit walk out and find a job in the marketplace they hang about do what theyre told they thank god theyre still coming up to london on a commuter cattle truck allowed to have a bloody briefcase with eiir in old gold on it and still just about belong maybe in his time forgiven not forgotten held in the files there was one of those messy little matters that he could be reminded of when they wanted someone to go down into the sewers the american was agency would provide the cash and be looking for one last hurrah before heading to florida and condominium life then there was the israeli humourless little bastard the liaison for the hit its subcontracted out and the israelis are happy to slot iranians of sufficient sensitivity likely queue up for the chance the major is exactly that not a general or brigadier but a man who will have dirtied his hands in the sand defusing those bombs what im saying young un is that these are the people who fight wars not the ones who start or finish them then theres us what are we were deniable we never existed and never came here and theres no record of us and then theres only the lovely alpha juliet i wouldnt hold your breath hold my breath for what for the belief shes different from any of the rest explain its her shout miss alpha juliets the instigator put it together give you a good ride did she young un none of your business my business that she handled the recovery of a device from which dna could be extracted and put assets on the ground to verify that this target matched the sample why not have those same folk keep hanging round there and listening for the gossip whatever because theyre dead and because the likes of them have fast burnout luckily dead because they were thieved from could have been worse theres a security apparatus in ahvaz down the road from here where theyre skilled at doing things to fingernails and testicles they know where the body shows up most for pain in case you listened to the rubbish talked at home about torture truth is that it works locals dont have fieldcraft they dont have the backbone of training and skills so they bring in you and me im vain and like to be asked and youre an idiot who doesnt know what questions to put the whole operation is down to pretty miss alpha juliet whos hard as pig metal and would lie through her teeth for the cause whats the cause we came to iraq looking for flower petals thrown under the tracks of the tanks we were liberators the politicians basked in it and it lasted a few weeks but we hung around a few years we destabilised and put a new kid on the block as far as power went we handed influence to iran they the good mullahs didnt want caucasian troops right up close and personal on their borders and set their clever people to work on shifting us out their bombs did it they reduced us to regiments of men and women cowering in barracks and our military operations ended up as force protection which is army jargon for looking after your own arse and your own base and searching for an exit strategy with a whiff of respectability but when thats inflicted on you its predictable that youll hate hate who hate the bastard that tweaked the old lions tail the lion now is motheaten has bad teeth and fleas crawl over him the target had a hold of the tail and abused it the lion wants to show it still has some useful claws nothing to do with turning a scientist bringing him over getting him to switch sides and provide intelligence nothing about revenge an act of vengeance some caution against and others revel in it but were not young un in the hands of the cautious the ones whove won the day would talk of the long arm and making the bastards look over their shoulder most of all they talk about sending a message and the israelis like sending them and thats why theyre on board you know all this because foxy growled because im smart enough to listen and while youre chatting her up in the vehicle then screwing her im talking to her guards rather sad guys who are growing old but dont know how to whove gone out of the military family and cant replace it they like to talk i dont suppose you did much talking or listening while you were screwing her its illegal of course it is under international law under international law and likely under the law practised on the high street in wolverhampton warrington or weymouth that wasnt explained badger said flat you seemed up for it a chirpy volunteer i was sow the seed and reap the whirlwind yes thank you foxy pity you never had an education young un and ended up so ignorant it was time to open the last water bottle he packed the case she sat on the end of the bed there was little talk between them she spoke only when she needed to indicate to him which clothing he should take from the wardrobe and which underwear from the chest earlier she had asked him what she should take and he had replied that it would be better if she did not parade her faith she should be modest but within limits she had allowed him to choose what was appropriate it was the only time in their married life that he had decided what she should wear he was concerned that she had lost the will her last decision had been concerning the children he was quiet as he moved about the room and his voice was subdued the children jahandar and abbas were in his and naghmehs bed he and his wife would sleep that night till dawn when the car would come with their children between them it had been her decision he had not argued the blinds were up and some of the glow from the security lights played through the open windows she should have had the windows closed the airconditioning switched on the flies and mosquitoes kept out she would have slept better he had not challenged her a mosquito flickered close to jahandars face but she did not swat it away he had suggested naghmeh undress and get into bed but she had shaken her head it was because he in the consulting room at the hospital in tehran had demanded more expert attention perhaps he refused to accept the inevitable perhaps he denied dignity to her and heaped stress on her it was past midnight he closed the suitcase and applied the small padlock he carried it outside the bedroom and put it by the front door he looked out there was purity in the silver strips of the moonlight and crudeness in the bellowing of the frogs it was said that the marshes the waters and the reed beds were the cradle of civilisation he felt humbled and unworthy it was the place of great artists and great scholars great scientists and great leaders he was the maker of bombs that killed young men he went back into their room she asked how will it be in that town it is where they make the sweet that is marzipan with the almond taste they have been making it there for two hundred years i saw it on the net it is very famous the marzipan they make there we will bring some back for the children he could say no more he would have choked on his sobs he turned from her so that she should not see tears on his face and she held him it should have been a night of triumph but with the food barely eaten conversations hardly started introductions not completed the consultant had pleaded a headache he could not have said that his wife lili elegant in a gown of understated expense showed any sympathy he said he wanted to go home to the villa on roeckstrasse there was no headache it did not concern him that she had entered this reception in her social diary some four months earlier that friends and peers were there and that it was an opportunity for her to show off her husband in an atmosphere of wealth and privilege he held her hand tightly said that the headache destroyed his enjoyment of the occasion and demanded that she accompany him home she stood her ground dug her stilettos into the rathaus floor he did not belong never would and never could in the afternoon or early evening of the following day it would be demonstrated to him that his life was not berthed in the pretty affluent city of lubeck capital of the historic hanseatic league of celebrated traders home of the writer thomas mann given the accolade by unesco of a world heritage site it was not his home it was where he lived courtesy of marriage and where his name had been altered to make it more acceptable his ancestry disowned the next afternoon he was to be called back as if a long unused door had been opened again his home was not lubeck the restaurants the beer the river trips the quaint passageways and homes so lovingly restored from war damage the boutiques and the university but was across continents the man who had come from the embassy in berlin his cheeks encrusted with stubble had dragged him back from the dream he had no place here he was from tehran his father and mother were martyrs of the war with iraq had given their lives to the islamic republic killed in the front line while helping the wounded he had been educated in tehran the state had trained him a professor of oncology at the university of medical sciences had given him love and a family he had shown his devotion to the state by working in the slums of south tehran he thought that a rope was tied around his ankle and he had been allowed a degree of freedom as a horse was allowed to graze then the rope had been jerked and he was dragged back into a compound his wife lili had started a strident conversation with the wife of a property developer who had big sites and big contracts for holiday homes up the river and at travemunde on the coast his headache mattered little he could forget it manufacture a smile and return to her shoulder or he could walk out on her he went to his car he had turned a last time in the hope that she would be hurrying after him but her back was turned and her laughter rang out he drove towards home and did not know how if ever he would regain his liberty he did not even know the name of the fucking patient and there was no headache only anger the ring of the telephone would sign a warrant on a mans life condemn him gibbons yearned for it to ring as if he was pleading for permission to kill the man himself there were a few still left at vauxhall bridge cross a little rheumatic in the joints from a longgone age who would have understood his feelings not many they were the unreconstructed warriors of the cold war and saw the bloody mess that was the middle east as a selfinflicted wound that had bred many uncertainties this band of brothers was left in the shadows of the corridors at the towers and a younger generation dressed down more often than not in jeans or chinos shirts without ties or revealing blouses preached an ethical manifesto as if such a thing were appropriate in the new world order gibbons doubted it some shared his view many did not the arrangement for the communications was complex but that was to hide them behind smoke a message from the forward surveillance men would be sent on shortwave radio brief transmission because to linger was to leave a footprint to abigail jones and her backup location she would communicate with an agency cell in baghdad who would onpass to the nato base at vicenza in the foothills of the italian alps from there the message would go to technicians answerable to the cousin in his service apartment behind grosvernor square he would taste the message a negative report would be transmitted electronically but an affirmative enough to kickstart the operation would come through on the telephone complicated but necessary for the process of denial he watched the telephone she had argued but he had insisted len gibbons had ordered sarah to take his room key at the club and use the bed booked there he had felt increasingly that day a point was about to be reached of success or failure and he wanted to be present when the dice rolled rattled came to rest he was now fiftynine his wife catherine would have been disarmed to know that her bed partner soulmate craved for a telephone to ring and therefore to consign a man to his death not a fancy one in hospital with painrelief drugs available but in a street spluttering blood as passersby hurried on their way she would not have believed it of him that he tried to achieve anything so intrinsically vulgar as statesponsored murder she didnt know him which was as well if his children at college had known their father plotted a killing they might have disowned him and slunk away ashamed the neighbours in a quiet road of semidetached mocktudor homes on a suburban estate in motspur park on the epsom to waterloo line would have winced had they known what was done in their name as would the members of the gardening club and the choir he hoped to join at some future date he willed the phone to ring he had a sandwich to eat and a coke to drink he sat at his desk and his universe was the telephone in front of him and its silence it had been a dream but was unfulfilled he would have liked to visit ancient historic rome he dreamed of walking on the old stones and being among the floodlit temples and squares it would have been a pilgrims journey for gabbi he could not some of those attached to the unit who were sent abroad would have slipped out and taken a fast taxi into the centre of the old city then walked to the tourist trail he would not the magnificence of a great civilisation was a fortyfive minute ride down the road a wonder of the world but he was a mere functionary so he did not leave his room go to the lobby and shout for a taxi a message had been put under his door he had not seen the courier neither had the courier seen gabbi from midnight because time drifted fast an executive jet aircraft was on standby if it were needed he would be told he sat in the darkness of his room on the unmade bed and waited she had said with the light of the fire in her face its very important for the integrity of the survey and its science that we are able to work here undisturbed for three more days maybe two certainly one he had said the brightness of the flames bouncing on his jacket what is undisturbed how is that important abigail jones said the arrival here of a military unit would disturb the wildlife were observing and would obstruct our efforts at serious study the leader of a marsh tribe the sheikh said and your proximity to the border with the islamic republic of iran your work close to the border does that require the cooperation of our iranian friends better that cooperation is not requested and better that information on your presence as you seek the integrity of the survey is not passed better so many of my people here are confused by your presence some who came innocently close have been injured and some resent strangers near to their villages these are difficult times for them times of great hardship i try to give leadership but there will be some younger than myself with hot tempers who will say that the military will pay for information about this expedition that surveys our wildlife and others will believe that the iranian authorities would also pay handsomely for knowledge of armed men coming close to their border for the purpose of evaluating the flora and fauna of the marshes i have to lead and i cannot lead if i am an obstruction to the young harding came past her with more wood from broken packing cases for the fire she heard the bleating of sheep the animals were behind the wall of men waiting close to the sheikh there would be a signal from their leader a knife waited in the hands of a man near to the front abigail jones thought the operation hung now on a sheeps throat if the signal were made that it be butchered according to halal methods negotiations had been concluded satisfactorily if the sheep was led away throat intact and the knife was sheathed the negotiations had failed and she doubted they would last there through the night she was not about to back off and there was in abigail jones a powerful sense of the value of retribution she had served in amman and abu dhabi but also in sarajevo as the second officer on the station she knew the stories of the siege of sarajevo and the atrocities inflicted the massacre at srebrenica and the closerun thing that had been the holding of the muslim lines at gorazde she had been involved with the teams of special forces who hunted down the war criminals there was familiar to her a small serb town named foc a shed operated there openly and searched for the meanminded bastards who had done the bulk of the killings two had been arrested not important enough to go to the hague but convicted in local courts she thought it good that they whiled away their days and nights in cold damp cells there had been a fling with a bosniak artist down in mostar who had thought she was an aid worker he had painted well but she no longer had any of his work the last had gone to the christian aid shop down the road from her maisonette retribution did not cause her any difficulty he was a man who made bombs that was enough she asked what is the cost the cost of what she slapped her hands together as if the playacting was over and business was to be settled she thought the change of mood necessary how much for allowing us to complete our survey without interference from the military at alamara and alqurnah and without the knowledge of the revolutionary guard corps across the border what will that cost me the sheikh wetted his lips and the sheep bleated harshly she reckoned they had bloody good cause to she might then have killed for a beer not much more to say so neither had said anything foxy slept now badger lay beside him and the other mans light snoring was soothing little more than the wind on the reeds if he grunted he made less noise than when the birds splashed best to think about anything else about the scabs on his hip the back of his thigh and his stomach under which the wounds oozed and might be infected about the long and earnestseeming talk between the engineer and the goon which had been too far away to be picked up a little had and when we are gone tomorrow mansoor what will you do gone where not said foxy had typed it onto the small screen he carried his notebook and pushed it towards badger for him to read and under it was written look for a sacred ibis whoever that is whatever the suitcase had been packed in the front bedroom and a lamp had been on beside the big bed badger could see the children asleep in it the gear was good but it wasnt magic and they had no merlin the parents had kept their voices down so as not to wake their children nothing went onto the screen of foxys notebook twice badger was passed the headset and was able to listen through the earpiece where hed broken the plastic coating but he couldnt make out the voices the parents whispered murmured and the children slept it was the saddest thing badger had ever seen nothing in his life compared with it the parents had packed their case and made ready to fly somewhere in the morning and she was dying and the children were being left behind they had decided the mother and father to have the kids in their bed with them this last night he could look through his life like a drowning man was supposed to and he could not recall anything as gutwrenching as what he saw in the lit bedroom his mother and father paul and debbie baxter had good health except that hed had a hernia operation four years ago and she had pain in a knee if she walked more than a couple of miles a grandfather had died on one side and a grandmother on the other but theyd had good years good lives and it had been welcome at the end to both no car accidents in the family and no cancers he had no best friend so no one he was close to with a crisis to face and ged his best oppo was fit and fran whom hed lived with was in good nick and her father worked out at the gym three days a week he had been out of general uniform duties too long to remember how it was when hed been sent blue lights and sirens to an rta and found a guys head splattered across the windscreen or a woman thrown off a bicycle what was different when he had been at the roadside was that he hadnt seen the victim before hadnt witnessed the man kiss his woman on the step hug his kids and drop down into his car he hadnt had the ringside seat when the woman came dripping out of the shower and her man was giggling tickling and flicking at the knot that held up the towel he hadnt seen them wolf breakfast or make sure that the bills were out of sight and not spoiling their precious time together they the bombmaker and the bombmakers woman were the saddest couple he had ever watched he could see the hands of his watch if the case was packed they were going early when they had gone it was over nothing to stay for failure if they went and there was no destination it was down the pan and had failed the message would be sent he would retrieve the microphone and draw in the cable the bergens would be packed and he would likely carry foxy half the fucking way to the extraction point what would he remember of her maybe when shed sat on the bed the kiddies slept and the case was filled or when the committee of deminers had come to the house sat in the shade to say farewell and some had cried or when shed stood alone in the light by the pier and the dinghy leaning on the stick and watching the birds perhaps she saw an otter or followed the pigs with her eyes and enjoyed the peace it was illegal danny badger banks had put up his hand volunteered had signed up and it was deniable outside the law not about harvesting and not about culling and not about the blank images unseen between the animals in the market pens and the meat hanging from hooks in a butchers shop about an illegal murder they had talked of the bombs in the shit beside the road and the mutilations the major had said the improvised explosive device is the weapon that has snatched victory from the coalition and replaced it with a very fair imitation of defeat there is a small number of clever innovative men capable of wrongfooting us so consistently that the bodybags keep coming home and the injured with wounds theyll carry to their graves we call an enemy a bravo rashid armajan is a big bad bravo and we should take every opportunity to locate him and it would be murder and those helping in the killing would be charged as accessories the night was quiet around him the lights inside the house were out and the curtains were drawn at that bedroom window he had not seen her undress didnt know with what intimacy her husband might have helped her with straps and fastenings the man was not a jihadist who would explode himself in a carriage in an underground tunnel and he was not a smuggler of classa stuff polluting streets and youngsters and breeding addicts he was not a breakoff from a splintered irish republican team the man the engineer did not threaten danny badger baxter or anyone he knew they had talked about the town the coffins came through the military wing of the selly oak hospital of the place in surrey where the prosthetics were fitted and mobility was taught again it was not his agenda badger reckoned he walked at others beck and call like he was a dog and a whistle blew foxy had told him he was deniable and an accessory that it was illegal and he had answered thank you what to do his mind churned and his eyes hurt from exhaustion the scabs hurt worse and the last water bottle was dry the mosquito bites itched and his guts were full but he couldnt empty them he didnt know where to find answers it was the last morning he had the headset on and waited for the first light to be switched on in the house then he would wake foxy whom he had thanked he saw the flash of a cigarette lighter to the right and the goon came out of the barracks there was a slight smear on the horizon and the day started chapter when it had the light to see where it flew the bird left its perch on a broken tree its place a favourite for two years was now dried out and the mud under it had become a wizened mosaic so it could no longer wade there and hunt it had not fed for three days but the bird was a creature of closegoverned habits and its instincts preserved its loyalty to that place hunger drove it to abandon its perch it laboured into the air weakened by lack of food it was up before the dawn light had spread and before the eagles had soared high to search for prey it worked hard to get elevation and to feel the draught of wind under its broad wings it went over areas of sunbaked mud once covered with a film of water and over what were now narrow drains and had once been deep waterways and skirted a collection of huts that would have been in danger of annual flooding when the bird was young but now were marooned below it a few skinny undernourished water buffalo meandered in search of lakes and lagoons the ibis flew towards water to the east where it would find food small fish frogs mice or immature rats beetles spiders butterflies and moths the bird was female the last year her eggs had addled hunger had driven her from the stick nest in the tree and she had spent too many hours away looking for the food that would sustain her the ground had been arid and without life and the village where in previous years she had scavenged was now deserted once she had seen the carcass of her mate but she had not fluttered down to feed off it had left the mess of bones and feathers for the crows to peck at she had broad wings white with blacktipped feathers as she flew climbed a rhythm returned to the flaps that took her forward it tired her to fly any distance but she would go as far as her strength permitted in her search a column of smoke spiralled near to some buildings and she saw people there swung away and did a halfcircle around them she had no love of people when the sun edged over the horizon she felt the first of the days warmth on her wings and back whitefeathered and on her neck and head blackfeathered and with a black beak the sun encouraged her to beat her wings harder and soon she found a rivulet to follow then it became a stream and a different smell seemed to come from the ground there were reed banks she flew lower beyond the reed banks there were expanses of water not clear and dark as it would have been if the level was deep beyond the length of her wading legs she looked for water that reflected the skies and in which she could see the mud bottom not thick weed she saw a building that had small lights around it the green of the reeds and a bare space of dried dirt on which debris had accumulated and she saw a little promontory just above the water and at the end a mass of dried leaves she made a clumsy landing because of the time she had been flying she settled had barely steadied herself then readied to strike she was listed as a bird deserving the status of conservation concern and threatened in the last survey of the marshlands while warfare raged around the dedicated lovers of the ibis it was estimated that only twentysix adults lived in this habitat she hit with her beak the strike was brutal fast she had a frog it was a fat frog and it struggled but its existence was already forfeit it was put down on the reed fronds and held by the beak until the claws at the foot of the birds left leg could pinion it down it was eaten swallowed whole and alive digestion would take time and the water level around the place where she settled was good for her wading she squatted preened herself pecked at insects real and imagined she gazed around her and felt comfortable badger watched he had had the glasses on the bird as it circled the landing place twice each time lower on the circuit he wondered what species it was but thought it pretty and effective in the art of killing the bird hunched down lancing its body feather with its beak was welcome a relief to badger from the options from breaking disciplines and scratching bites the mosquitoes had gone now the flies were gathering and the wind coming from foxy was foul twice hed elbowed the mans ribcage to stop the snoring but then the options had been uppermost a man of ethics a police officer bred on morality badger didnt know if he was or not he believed in getting a job done and not much more he had never fabricated evidence had never claimed not to have seen another constable strike a man with a baton and had never fiddled expenses he had never done anything he would be ashamed of had never risked his career with a criminal action the ripoff culture at the police station in bristol where he had started out had passed him by almost in fact he had been bollocked for insufficient arrests relying on cautions and verbal warnings rather than hoicking the arrest statistics for the division he had a moral code not flaunted when he was in uniform or out of it not based on any religious teaching and not worn on his sleeve the code gave him he recognised it now a sort of naivete maybe the naivete had come on heavier since he had gone into rural surveillance and after hed nagged human resources for the chance to go on the crop course options they had nagged at him through the night while foxy slept and the one factor making the matter bearable was that nothing had materialised for him to report he was watching the bird scrabble with its big feet for better grip on the reed fronds he had put there more serious than options it was kicking at the camouflage hed made the bird hacked hard thrust dried stuff back and seemed anxious to work down to a hard surface the glasses showed him the slim long body of the microphone and once the drive of the right foot lifted the cable if the bird kept going the microphone would be pushed into the water down to options that mattered out of his mind went i was sir only following orders that i believed to be legitimate no more baggage about im not prepared to be involved foxy in extrajudicial murder im not some fucking israeli i will not allow any message that contributes to the targets killing to be transmitted pushed down the agenda was im walking out now and having no further part in this and at the bottom of the heap was im a moron and ignorant and i didnt understand more important top of the pile was how to stop a pretty bird a bloody nuisance bird kicking out the microphone and drowning it couldnt stand up and shout couldnt go walkabout to look for a stone and lob it once more it scratched the shape of the microphone was clear now and the cable was well visible and it stopped seemed to compress itself down the door opened the front door the goon was walking from the barracks towards the house lights had been switched on inside and faintly a radio played the door was wide open and the kids spilled through it then the case was lifted out maybe it was the engineer who brought it maybe the older woman the case didnt bulge it had a green ribbon tied to its handle badger saw that the small girl was crying and the boy went to the waters edge threw in a pebble from the track watched it bounce the bird was hunkered low on what was left of the foliage maybe it thought this was a place to stay where frogs were available on order maybe it was not about to shift out he jabbed foxy him and foxy between them now a sort of tolerance existed like a ceasefire not peace and not war when the car came the suitcase was loaded and they drove away the mission was done whether they had anything to radio or not he doubted he and foxy would speak much on the way back to extraction or while they were driven to the base and not at all when they were helicoptered to kuwait city likely theyd be in different rows on the flight which foxy might demand and he himself might insist on there might be a handshake at the terminal but it would be transitory and neither would go on the others christmascard list theyd never meet again one jab was enough he passed him the headset when the bird had kicked noise explosions had been in his ears but the birds chest small mercy did not cover the microphone tip and he could hear the little girl crying there was more wind then a murmur about needing to piss then the question how much water was left none then the statement without water they were screwed the headset went on foxys ears and badger whispered about the bird and cant do much about it the goon has it in his glasses looks excited enough to do a jerkoff what is it not anything ive ever seen its called an african sacred ibis pretty rare big in egyptian mythology do me a favour just shut up foxy looked wan weak about played out a day wouldnt have gone by in the last ten years without him shaving and examining his moustache in a mirror without him putting on a clean shirt and polished shoes he looked sad and a frown cut his forehead then he grappled in his pocket for the notepad and flicked the switch to light the screen the wife came and the children ran to her the engineer peered up the track and past the barracks then looked down savage at his wristwatch the goon gazed at the bird she had the children against her knees and bent awkwardly held them tight and tried to comfort them what comfort badger wondered could she offer the car would come and the bird would fly the noise of the car and the crying of the boy would be too much for it many weeks several months mansoor had dreamed of seeing the bird threskiornis aethiopicus merely fly low over the reeds and be in the lenses for a few seconds half a minute but it was down and he had a fine view of it and could not believe that the moment would last but she comforted the child he heard her he had no children he did not know if it was his fault that his wife was barren or hers she said in their bedroom at the back of the house that was owned by his father in a low voice so she should not be overheard that he was responsible for her inability to become pregnant he could not believe that he refused of course to go to a doctor and have tests done on his wife safar and himself so with no child to look after she went each morning on a shuttle bus from their home in ahvaz to the crate camp garrison on the road to mahshar came back each evening and helped his mother to prepare a meal then did cleaning and went to bed they had sex every weekend quietly so as not to disturb his parents but her period never missed he saw how naghmeh wife of the engineer comforted the children he had looked away from the bird that was on what seemed to be flood debris that had snagged at the end of a mud spit you should not be frightened she held tight to the children there is nothing for you to be frightened of he thought she did not cry because it would have frightened the children we go to see a very clever doctor and he will make me better he looked up but the bird had not moved he did not know if he would ever see her again we will bring you back sweets because you will be very good when your grandmother cares for you if she died in germany the children would go to her mother and their father would be found an austere room in the crate camp garrison he would visit them only at the end of the week and on public holidays and would bury himself in the papers and circuit boards on his workbench the reward for being good and brave is very special sweets then mansoor would be recalled to the ranks of the alquds brigade and most likely a desk would be found for him papers to process and a keyboard to hit he might be in tehran or tabriz or in the mountains on the afghanistan border if she did not come back she had quietened and calmed them the car was late it reflected on him it should by now have been at the house we are going to a faraway country to germany there is a town in germany where they make wonderful marzipan the sun edged higher and he saw that naghmeh no longer shivered its first warmth fell on him and on the bird it was a clear two hundred metres from him but he could sneak the binoculars to his eyes and see its markings it had been venerated in ancient egypt had been thought so valuable that it was sacrificed to appease gods and in one archaeological site the mummified remains of a million and a half ibises had been uncovered he believed himself blessed and turned away from it the weapon hanging from his neck clattered against the magazines in the pouches of his tunic which is made from almonds and sugar she looked up at him sharply he had not seen it before she seemed to despise him it might have been the weapon that caught her attention or the magazines into which the bullets were pressed or the two grenades at the webbing on his waist or the flash of the alquds shield sewn on his olive sleeves it might have been because she knew his father helped to hang men or because his wound crippled him or because he had produced no children he wanted them gone but the car had not come the best marzipan is made in the town we go to lubeck and there we will go to the shops and buy marzipan sweets for you because you will be good and you will look after your grandmother your father says lubeck is a very pretty town and is famous for the marzipan we are going to bring home you will be very good he walked away from her and the children and went to the engineer he shrugged and said that the car was not late for its departure time but should by now have arrived if a few minutes more passed without it coming he would get on the radio and demand an answer the engineer looked at him as if he was dogs mess on a shoe heel the sun rose carrying the days warmth with it and the bird was still on the mess of leaves he thought he heard a car far away it was repeated by foxy the third time i heard it i dont doubt what i heard the best marzipan is made in the town we go to lubeck she said that also she said your father says lubeck is a very pretty town and is famous for the marzipan we are going to bring home about as clear as it could be you going to send it of course im fucking well going to send it it was like a new man had materialised beside badger a bloody kid had scored a goal foxy had learned where a targeted man could be killed and badger wondered if that counted for more than scoring the goal illegality deniability extrajudicial killing dismissively do me a favour young un and pass the kit his hands burrowed into the bergen beside him and foxy was flicking his fingers in front of his face as if time was not to be wasted badger felt dazed a moment of truth had come missile speed from the clear blue skies above the scrim net there were the seconds when a crisis developed armed police had told him when anticipation and training were overtaken by actuality one thing to think about it talk about it or practise it another when it happened it had been badgers job to look after the communications the comms should have been ready kept in place for immediate transmission only needing the battery to be activated they were not foxys snapped fingers and the irritation said they were there flying high and his voice had been quiet but he had made no effort to hide his elation i heard it i dont doubt what i heard of course im fucking well going to send it badger had the comms gear in his hand and was levering it out of the bergen whats the matter young un just shift it he had to push aside a bottle half filled with urine and two sheets of the tinfoil that was there in case the imodium wore off he brought the kit up under his stomach and then his chest badger could have done it himself could have thrown the button let it warm made the link sent the stuff like passing down a death sentence the kit would have been snatched from his hands foxy would not give up the glory moment he could see the man another cigarette another glance at his watch another spin on his heel to show anger that the car hadnt come the goon was on a radio or a mobile had it clamped to his face his weapon and binoculars bumping on his chest as he bent some poor bastards ear about the car being late she stood with her mother and the kids were calm the bird was still in place emotion melded with the professionalism dinned into him his eyes flitted from the distance view of the woman and her husband to the near ground where the bird squatted part covering the microphone the length of cable that was exposed before it went into the water snaked out from under its tail feathers there was a soft whine in his ear as the comms kit gathered power a red light glowed and he sensed foxys exhilaration he felt a sort of flatness they had the link foxy murmured his call sign foxtrot and something badger didnt catch a query on alpha juliet a pause badger sensed that foxy was at bursting point and it flushed out of him the town was named it was spelt out lima uniform bravo echo charlie kilo they were leaving any time now route unknown badger turned his head away from the house the family its guards and the bird and stole a look at foxys face something almost manic something of achievement not reached in a lifetime before and he could see a clenched fist the knuckles whitened then an afterthought foxy said something brief about recovery of kit a further transmission about extraction and cut it the car came it was the mercedes the goon bawled at the driver who pointed to a tyre and bawled back the case was carried to the car and the boot was sprung open the kids had started to cry again the bird was sitting on the microphone he could imagine that pandemonium had broken out on receipt of their report and he had done nothing about agendas had failed to scour the options he and foxy had done something huge and the response would be awesome he knew it foxy might have forgotten himself an arm had snaked out and was around badgers shoulders we did it against everything every count of the odds we did it we scored there was a photograph the frame was expensive enough to have a hallmark stamped in it which guaranteed its pedigree it was on a table beside the bed the photograph had a message handwritten in heavy black ink ellie with love to my darling girl foxy the picture in the frame was of joe foxy foulkes with camouflage cream daubed on his face and wearing a gillie suit but not headgear he was grinning it was a portrait of a man of action neither of them in the bed were embarrassed or distracted by its presence it was face down im not having him giving me a cold eye the old bugger piers had said about all hes capable of these days is watching ellie had said hed arrived late at night and his car was parked down the side of the garage well inside the gate it was pretty much hidden from a casual glance shed thought that a bottle of wine on the carpet in front of the fire in the sitting room foxys chair pushed back to make more room would ease them into what was a momentous time in the relationship it was the first time he had been there theyd been at his place and in the pubs there where she was anonymous on the far side of the motorway beyond bassett it hadnt worked out as shed planned time had not been wasted on foxys rug in front of a fire blazing with logs that foxy had cut and none of the wine had been drunk from the bottle that foxy prized straight up the stairs past the collection of cartoons police stuff that foxy had collected into the bedroom and onto foxys bed theyd stripped and the light had been on and he had crawled over her and looked up into foxys face his hand had come from between ellies legs reached for the frame and flipped it her hand had come off the small of his back and given it a shove now it was mostly hidden by the clock radio that had woken foxy when he was at home it had been ellies decision that piers come to the house where was he she didnt know what was he doing shed only had a text what had she been told pretty much nothing and the guys whod brought the car back had just been peasants would he just turn up always rang first something about getting the wine to room temperature or decently chilled theyd slept knackered and the dawn had come and shed woken him rain beat on the mullions it was a grey dawn a miserable one not to worry ellie said youre back here tonight am i you sure too bloody right it was eleventhhour stuff and she had jackknifed up when the chimes had gone shed had to rummage in the robe to get the receiver would have shown a mass of leg and didnt care the haggling pure bazaar had gone on through the night and into the small hours she had nothing in her hand except money probably they could have ignored the bartering and come and taken the money by force and would have lost a few or several in the fight she and her guys if still upright would have been unable to prevent it so money had been on the table and the sheep had gone quiet they might have thought as the night wore on that their throats were safe and had been wrong there had been a bare apology first light and a grey mist over the desert dirt and she had been listening to the fucking thing and then had run to the front pajero and her laptop the sheep had been skinned then skewered and cooked over the fire bowls of rice were passed round and bread brought from a village the sheep had been slaughtered when the deal had been closed not an easy one for her no chance of getting on a satphone and calling up her station chief in the baghdad compound and asking him what ceiling she could reach to he was outside the loop and would want to stay there it was her decision alone and she had pledged the lot her bundle of dosh each last dollar would go into the sheikhs pocket it carried no guarantee of honesty he could trouser what she gave him then drive away call his friend who would be a full colonel and pass on information about jones and her boys to another colonel on the far side of the frontier no guarantees except she had the laptop out and it was powering up she had dropped in an aside ground troops of the coalition no longer did grunt work in the field but the firepower of the air force was still available she might be able to call out an f fighting falcon with a load of missiles and maybe a pair of cbu bombs she had power up and the satellite signal was locked it would have been in her eyes lit by the fire she had coordinates of where the sheikh lived and where his extended family were gathered and the implication would have been that a bomb could go astray and she would give not a flying fuck if it did abigail jones opened a link to the agency in the communications area of the station in the fortified sanitised sector of the capital she was answered could she identify herself she was alpha juliet she gave her message spelled it out again but with a codified alteration kilo tango alpha delta bravo juliet she added one word enroute then the cutout process had begun she didnt know to whom she spoke and a technician didnt know who had sent him that brief message or the identity of the receiver at the vicenza base cutouts bred deniability and fogged a trail she turned off the laptop and walked back towards the fire abigail jones might have welcomed the thought that word of this would seep through the firewalls of needtoknow inside the towers it would be the same for her as for old len gibbons whispers nods and no complete picture she would be noticed in the atrium hall the canteens and corridors she felt a little whiff of pride shagger broke the indulgence he asked when do they come out they have to retrieve the gear then shout and start moving i dont have a time yet now lets get these bastards on the road and whats left of that mutton the big parts done and we know where hes headed its a fantastic result he came into their darkened bedroom hoping she was still asleep but lilis voice was sharp steffen how is your headache when he had come home from the rathaus alone her parents were already in bed he had gone to the remaining guest room where he had tossed and turned he had heard the crunch of tyres long after midnight on his drive then laughter hers and a mans talking and finally the key in the door the car had driven off perhaps a man she had known from childhood had brought her home the bedside light came on and she sat up her back against the pillows the sheet tight to her throat she wore nothing he had been nine when his father and mother had been killed in the battle for khorramshahr they had died in the liberation of the city after nearly a year of iraqi occupation he had been told they could rejoice in martyrs deaths he struggled to remember them to picture their faces and hear their voices his father had told him once that there was never a good or bad time for confession it had involved him taking a handful of piastres from his mothers purse to buy sweets from another kid at school his father had told him that confession was a fine purging agent he had gone to his mother interrupted her work on medical case histories and seen her brow furrow with annoyance he had said he had taken some money and bought sweets she had shrugged and returned to her work now he said there was no headache what in gods name were you up to i did not want to be there that is pathetic it was important we talked about it something of his pain would have been in his face he was wrapped in a bathrobe had come to their bedroom to find clothing for the day he wore a suit shirt tie and polished shoes when he saw patients he dressed down only for days with his students he sat on the side of the bed he took a deep breath he was not steffen but soheil he was not from lubeck and german but from tehran and iranian he spoke the truth bared himself he spoke of a phone call from berlin a meeting with an iranian who might have been an intelligence officer of the vevak he said he had cleared facilities for a patient to come for consultation and had been rude to his staff who had queried why he had agreed to see a nameless patient with no medical history he said he was trapped that his past and origins had claimed him the sheet dropped her hands reached out and gripped his shoulders you are german you do not have to wrong you are german you are steffen weber i was but am not now i am soheil i am my father and mothers child you do not know who you are treating you do not know who their secret police are bringing i do not her back arched and he saw the upper curve of her chest which had been on show at the rathaus it would have been covered only with a loose wrap on the ride home she shook him call the police or the security people this is not a banana country you cannot allow thugs to manipulate you i she flared are you married to me yes are you their servant he could not answer her he pushed himself up from the bed and went to the wardrobe he took out a suit and a folded shirt fresh socks and laundered underwear a quiet tie and shoes that glinted with the polish the maid had applied he closed the wardrobe turned and knew what he would see his wife lili held the sheet high covering herself he thought that a woman would always cover her body if confronted by a stranger he went to dress he faced a long day in hamburg before he returned to the medical school at lubeck for his evening appointment with a patient whose name he had not been told he did not think then that her marriage to a stranger could be saved he reached the door and said they would hunt me track me find me if i refused they will have chosen me because of my birthright i assume that the patient is someone of military importance or in intelligence gathering if you wish lili to condemn me you could lift the telephone and speak to the police or the security apparatus i ask you not to they have a long arm and a long reach and i would spend the rest of my life searching the shadows at my back he closed the door after him sarah knew the telephone on the desk had rung he had been sitting on his desk feet dangling when it had screamed for his attention he had picked it up she knew the story his face had seemed to contort as hed listened a greyness came to his skin followed by pallor and gibbonss tongue had flipped over his lips she understood that a location had been given then gibbons shook as if throwing off an unwanted skin a burden and his back straightened his only question which airport were they going out from city heathrow or military it was as if by the time he hung up he had regained control she was in the outer office and it was not her place to pressure him for the information so shed kept her head down he called to her that the town named as the targets destination was lubeck she asked if the transport was taken care of and he nodded but without excitement well perhaps anticipation of excitement was unrealistic she thought as she looked through the open door at len gibbons whose office and professional life she ran she knew why the name of lubeck had stopped him dead in his tracks she knew the story the story held in the towers archive was titled the schlutup fuckup and not many knew it but she did when sarah had gone to work for gibbons her friend jennifer had quietly let her know about the schlutup fuckup and its effect on his career the struggle the man had put in to shift it off his shoulders a veteran in the archive and able to ferret in restricted areas jennifer had unearthed the story to sarahs knowledge len gibbons had never been back to that northern corner of germany up by the baltic coast and close to the trave river small wonder the poor wretch had blanched the pain of the fuckup would have been acidetched in his mind she disguised her privileged knowledge with apparent indifference will you be wanting me to come with you mr gibbons i dont think so sarah but thank you a pretty ordinary place lubeck and unlikely to present problems not a place to be mobhanded on the ground she wondered how he would be in a modern world of supposed integrity when he was there in lubeck and deniability might be hard to rustle up and she wondered all those years ago how much tittering there had been behind hands in the previous home of the service and how much a fuckup of dynamic proportions would harden a man a man such as len gibbons he had not mentioned the men in iraq not expressed praise or admiration for their work nor sympathised with the conditions they would have operated under nor referred to the backup team she could do jargon with the best of them sarah considered the lack of praise admiration of any acknowledgement for what others had achieved to be part of the collateral of the schlutup fuckup and the scars it had left whatever you say i asked good of you pretty straightforward stuff and an experienced team around me it was a cold morning in the city but the early sun gave beauty to the skies the blue was cut by the exhaust fumes spewed from the engines of a boeing bound for the swedish ferryport city of malmo gabbi did not query whether the most effective route had been chosen for him or the quickest or the one that would provide greatest security he would land by noon would be met and driven to the departure point layers of people worked on the problems and came up with answers that he would not secondguess it gave gabbi satisfaction to reflect that so many laboured behind him he was launched and had no thought for those who had gained the information that had set him on his way the car had taken them there had been a further delay when mansoor had looked down at the nearside rear tyre of the mercedes and thought it too smooth barely within legal limits not fit for carrying passengers of such status he had queried the tyres safety he had almost accused the driver of taking a good tyre to the market in ahvaz selling it and replacing it with an inferior one then pocketing money they had argued until the engineer had clapped his hands and demanded that he and his wife left the dust cloud thrown up behind the car had thinned and the children had left cheerfully enough with their grandmother for school the bird had stayed he had as good a view of it as he could have hoped for he did not tire of watching it his father would not have understood or his wife or his mother himself until he had been allocated to the security of the engineer he would not have believed that a man could watch a bird that sat across a hundred and fifty metres of water from him and pray that the moment would not pass the focus of the glasses was on the feathers of the wings and neck the clean lines of the beak and on the expanse of mud behind it that was broken only by the debris of dead reeds whats special about that bird its endangered rare his obsession were screwed we cant move while hes there state the obvious young un we cant leave it but we cant go to get it he couldnt leave the scrape and move in the gillie suit across bare ground to the reed beds then go into the water wade to the mud spit and give the bloody bird a shove while binoculars were on him he couldnt tug out the microphone because the cable would be out of the water and visible he couldnt leave it there either because that would break the disciplines it would be the equivalent of leaving a semaphore sign that uk was here when the microphone was found as it would be then we stay put night follows day right we go at dusk thats a whole day to kill so sleep a bit think of water we havent got any you ever get tired of stating the obvious young un apparently not i have to go forward and collect the stuff i have to get badger didnt finish foxy had grunted sighed turned his back on him maybe it was nine hours before he could move out to collect the kit he could reflect and evaluate he could count the flies that swarmed above the scrim net he could watch the goon in the plastic chair and wonder how a grown man had such an empty skull that he needed to sit with a rifle across his knees and watch a bird that was not much different from the herons badger had seen in wales and half as interesting as the eagles he knew from scotland he could think of alpha juliet and holding her of sending the callsign code back for a meeting at the extraction point and time for interrogation badger asked what was our justification for coming here he answered himself they said it was a rogue state and reckoned there were weapons that could nuke us gas us poison us were we surprised that they wanted us out so shot at us and blew us up he answered himself gobsmacked did no one question the inevitable bit that clever bombs might be provided by a neighbour and laid by a local he asked did no one reckon it might be none of our business he answered plenty did but they were ignored out of step with policy us coming here was it done in my name badger asked he answered and his words rang in his mind who needed the opinion of a moron the big people knew what was in your best interest the big people were they right to say that the man i fingered was our enemy irrelevant its done cant be undone badger asked do i take pride in what i did getting here surviving here fulfilling the mission or am i ashamed he paused then answered a luxury and an indulgence a waste of space and breath done and impossible to undo you are danny baxter the little fellow who is told what to do and does it a man will have his head blown off and a good woman who clears minefields who is dying will be widowed you are a part of it and its done in your name perhaps theyll give you a fucking medal to polish the sun was higher and his need for water was cruel his stomach was distended by the imodium tablets and the sores were suppurating their mission was complete except that the bird sat on the microphone there was nothing else for badger to look at he could see the birds back and fancied that a small loop of the cable had hitched up and was near to its folded legs the goon sat in his chair a guard had brought him coffee and a plate of sandwiches hours to kill before he went into the water they had done their work and should by now have been with the guys in the pajeros and alpha juliet congratulations should have been gruffly conferred and he might have had cream on the scabs and sores he worked out which route he would take and considered how dark it should be before he moved the time dragged and foxy slept then the pigs came and an otter passed by ducks were there and coots and the hours crawled badgers body was racked with pain he knew each step he would take when he went into the water chapter the sun had dipped and started its slide badger moved when he shifted it was better for some of the sores and worse for others the flies still swarmed and it was not yet dark enough for the mosquitoes he could see the face of his wristwatch not long thank god he murmured what i said not long when he was out of this hell hole badger reckoned hed want to shout he would need maybe at the airfield at basra or at kuwait airport to get up on a table in the spooks office or in a coffee lounge and bawl the roof off yell scream shake the walls hed shout in the shower and louder in the surgery when the medic examined the wounds that the biting creatures had given him he craved to shout now at the goon who sat in the chair facing the lagoon and the still water another thing hed do when he was back at any imitation of civilisation was take the gillie suit and the vest he wore under it the pants and the socks maybe even the boots and chuck it all into one of those oil drums used as an incinerator spill some fuel in and throw into it a lit roll of newspaper theyd burn the lice and fleas ticks ants and little red spiders it would be sheer pleasure to watch them through the day the thought of stripping off that gear and of the flames leaping in the drum had been companionship for badger he envied little about foxy but his ability to sleep wherever and whenever he squirmed a little any movement seemed to set off the irritation of the insect bites the next evening those that werent lodged in the gillie suit would turn up and find the meal ticket had moved on his mind jostled between reality and fantasy as it had done to kill the hours fleas ticks and ants who found the empty hide should consider themselves lucky not to have been in the suit when it went into the drum maybe hed gone a little mad maybe a whiff of insanity was part of a croppies job description but it was good to let the madness take hold because then anxieties about its in your name and its done cant be undone were pushed back he stretched his legs to the limit and his left thigh cramped about another hour then ill be moving that so young un the birds awake seems its getting some life back should be hungry itll need to go and feed the further away the bloody better and him with it the goon the officer had finally stood he took a last cigarette and tossed the empty pack onto the ground beside the quay he stretched and walked to the far end of the short pier but hardly looked right or left his eye line stayed with the bird now it was upright and seemed to test the ground and the debris under its feet it stamped a little and eased the weight from one leg to the other then its head lifted its neck straightened and it croaked a harsh sound the wings opened and flapped go on you bastard get yourself up and away it subsided again whether hes there or not badger muttered i reckon in an hour i can go and get it you got eyes young un yes see anything with them or are they crap badger bridled i can see better than you there was a silence and selfsatisfaction on foxys face the silence meant there was something he should have seen but had not badger backed off he was not prepared to beg for an explanation he bit his lip and looked again the bird hopped twice then came down heavily the goon was most of the way through the last cigarette and kicked the packet along the edge of the quay for the first time in that long day he did not seem totally engrossed in the bird the woman the mother of the engineers wife came out through the front door with a glass in her hand went to the goon and gave it to him they talked the children might have had a meal or a story might have watched the tv they had been lively when they had come home from school in the middle of the day one had played with a ball the other a skippingrope the shadows lengthened the heat of the day dissipated his throat was dry foxy was now fully alert and used his glasses to rake over the bird the house and the goon his view slid between the pier where the dinghy was tied and the barracks and the bund line beyond where all this began i said that in an hour itll be dark enough for me to get forward and bring back the microphone and the wire are we arguing heard you the first time foxy said many hours dead one more to kill then the journey to the extraction point he was breathing hard he threw down the cigarette stamped on it there had been months of boredom in mansoors recent life weeks of tedium that had seemed to drift on with neither high spots nor low moments merely ordinariness he had to stifle the panting tension gripped him he could not show it his back turned now to the lagoon as the light fell and shadows stretched far behind him he walked with a clipped slow step as if he had no further interest in what he had turned away from towards the door of the house he took the mother back her glass then called to the kids one was playing football with two of the guards and the other had a toy pram he took them inside and tried to suppress any hint of authority in his voice that might frighten them he gave no appearance of uttering an order with the children inside he told their grandmother to keep them there to wait two or three minutes and then to close the door he thought her a strong woman anyone of her age would have lived through the battles in either susangerd ahvaz or khorramshahr and would not have survived if prone to panic they had been vicious battles with few prisoners taken women had been killed women had been raped she should close the door bolt it move the children to the back of the house but leave the radio or tv on in the front and not draw those curtains he walked now across the dirt saw the cigarette packet picked it up and headed for the barracks he did not speak to the two guards who were still sitting in the shade of the trees he would not have trusted either to act out the relaxed and typical scene its tedium if he had spoken to them of a security alert they would have run round like headless chickens he kept to the tree line where the shadows were thickest and would go to the barracks by the side entrance he would not be seen and would give no warning to a watcher the bird had moved had stood the cable had been pulled up and had made a loop he would not have seen it unless his glasses had been on the bird the loop had raised a length of blackcoated metal which he estimated at between thirty and forty centimetres long mansoor had been in iraq he had been there during the difficult days when the troops of the great satan had attempted to load maximum pressure on the resistance and on the alquds teams sent to guide and advise he and his colleagues had been lectured that they must always be vigilant against surveillance no use of mobile telephones no meetings with sensitive personnel outside buildings where they could be identified by the drones in the skies the precaution of changing meeting points so that patterns were not established and bugs installed and he did not think his eyes had deceived him he had seen a loop of wire and a length of tube and they were among the dead leaves on the mud spit how long had the debris been wedged there two or three days no more had there been three or four days before a sufficient storm to flush out those leaves and dump them high and dry there had not he went into the barracks and woke the men who were sleeping tossed those who played cards from their chairs and switched off the television he told the armourer what he wanted and how many rounds of ammunition should be issued to each man the light was slipping and the high lamp on the post by the barracks where it ran alongside the far end to the quay had lit evening was coming and he had only glimpsed the loop and the tube he did not feel confident enough to demand reinforcements from ahvaz and did not wish to hand over the matter to a more senior officer he could hear down the corridor the chains rattling as the rifles type assault weapons made in the peoples republic of china were freed from the armourys racks do i take a glock you wont need one itll be out of your weapons range i wont be behind you badger spat wont be behind you great i seem to remember i half carried you here calm authority a voice used to being heard not contradicted you wont need a glock and i wont be behind you i dont understand what shit you are coming with its about the quality of the eyes mine are as good as any all the tests show it its what you didnt see young un when the bird moved the bird moved didnt take off settled perhaps last light itll get a frog and you saw nothing you dont need the glock and im not behind you youre not as good as you thought you were which means im going forward and ill decide when and ill retrieve the microphone and the cable clear its my job the calm fazed badger made him uncomfortable always difficult to argue when a man refused to be riled he wondered if the older man was capable of getting across the clear ground through the reed beds then wading fifty yards and doing the reverse trip badger reckoned when they came out he would be carrying two bergens and likely have foxy hooked on his back im going i make that decision no i do that sort of thing its for me to do im going to tell you two things and do me the courtesy of closing your mouth and listening if i could square it with any last vestige of professionalism that i have id get you to load up the bergens now and wed sneak out wed leave in place the microphone and the cable theyre found and the balloon goes up the effect of that is that calls are made and they end up in lubeck having been processed through every floor of the ministry of information and security he will be pulled out meaning that everything we did was for fuckall of nothing and he can make some more of his little toys hearing me that theyll find the gear within the next twentyfour hours a big ask you dont know what to look for and youre blind its already been found he might have been punched in the crotch badger folded he could still see the bird and it could not have been famished sufficiently to go hunt another frog for itself and the feathers on its back were pink from the last of the sun that would be down buried in the next fifteen minutes changeover time coming the flies would have been exhausted after bombing the scrim net for all the daylight hours and the mosquitoes would have rested and would be hungry for flesh and would be coming out hunting he stank his stomach was bloated from the tablets could hardly make wind and precious little of his body was free of the bites and the scabs had bloody grown and the sores oozed he looked for the goon and couldnt see him then for the cable and couldnt find it are you sure he asked if i wasnt i wouldnt have said it if they know about it why you why is it your job the shadows were on them and he couldnt see foxys face he thought he heard a sob not a choke but something softer sadder foxy said itll take me a while young un to think through what i want to tell you im the one whos supposed to have all the answers abigail jones said corky was beside her why havent they come that it miss itll do they have kit in front of them and cant retrieve it till dark would that fit snugly corky hard though isnt it more than us they want out we want it badly they want it more a whole day to wait it was unusual for her to muse in public wear frustration on her sleeve normally she bottled such feelings which might have been partly why she lived alone when based in london in her twobedroomed maisonette it cost her a fortune and it would have been useful to have a guy living there on her terms to chip in with the expenses she didnt know one she could allow to copy her frontdoor key and have access to her space a man who had been a senior clerk in the old bank of iraq now looked after the incidental finances of the station in the green zone he had supplied her with the dollar bills she had given to the sheikh he also did invoices for food fuel clothing and could switch handwriting patterns effortlessly at the end of the tour she would take a bucketload of cash to a respected dealer in gold and precious stones and buy items of quality but not enough to attract the attention of a customs nerd shed be wearing them looking expensive when she came back through heathrow and would sell the stuff on in london that way abigail jones could afford a maisonette with a view over the river shed learned the methods on her first trip to the gulf and on the posting to bosnia it was coming up on her fast the bugout from baghdad soon enough there would be the round of parties her people agency staffers the embassy handchosen iraqi army officers and intelligence men and a general melee of multinational spooks the best part would be the knowledge shared in a tight circle of the taking down of an engineer it would be a pleasure to know he was dead and that she had played her part in it there would be an office car from heathrow to her home and she would sign the docket and have the driver lift the bags to the front door then fish out her keys and step inside her home alone she wondered if that evening when they hit the basra road highway there might be a swap of mobile numbers done in the lead pajero if he would be there giggles about where it had been last time and corky said because their gear is forward they need darkness to get it back shouldnt be long i have to say it corky id have been tempted to ditch the stuff and wed have been out of here seven or eight hours ago if theyd made good time the crowd had gone drifting away in the wake of the dust cloud from the big bmw in which the sheikh rode there would have been what corky called dickers who watched them but for now the wads of banknotes had bought emptiness round the perimeter the light on her communications kit hadnt flashed no message from london no acknowledgement and nothing to tell her that a hit was on course nothing from ahead from beyond a horizon of dirt and softcoloured reeds they had spent their day cleansing the building theyd used now it was as they had found it every fag end picked up and bagged the vehicles were loaded with the sleeping bags and mosquito nets the spotter scope for birdwatching the spare weaponry and ammunition she had done the rounds and was satisfied she had paused in the doorway of the room where he had slept and seen a smooth part of the concrete flooring where the dust had been swept away by the motion of his hips she regretted nothing only thing miss thats worse than ditching gear and leaving it behind is doing that to a comrade your mate i think i understand that corky you dont young un interrupt or contradict me badger reckoned he was composed now ready heard you youll watch my back and ill retrieve the stuff badger didnt interrupt or contradict ill go in about fifteen minutes when the lights gone its not acceptable to leave the gear so we wont we get the stuff and leave the hide covered we have to hope itll stay that way long enough the goons watched the bird all day hell have seen the cable and now hes gone back to where his guys are his own people are poor quality but i doubt he is you saw the limp which means hes been injured id imagine it was a combat wound he may act with his own people or more likely hell have sent for decent backup from down the road when its dark im going badger lay on his stomach and listened the sun tipped the tops of the reed beds in the west and the skies over the palm trees across the lagoon and the house where nothing moved and few lights showed when i come back to you i may be coming fast and we dont fuck about young un were going for speed and distance and im thinking that the first quarter of a mile is the critical bit we manage that and use the comms we try to find without bloody drowning the extraction point thats whats going to happen still no contradiction no interruption ill go forward to retrieve the stuff because i dont know whatll be waiting there when i dont know i wont ask anyone else to do what i should be doing in case there are any misunderstandings between us young un dont ever forget that im in charge i lead and i decide you dont before you ask my memory of the plug from the cable into the microphone is that its a straight socket not robust giving the cable a yank will do the business and theyll come apart surprised the pigs didnt manage it im going and youll have everything the bergens and the rest ready for a fast breakout youre not capable of it im going forward its the burden of leading because getting a cable and a microphone back from fifty yards is dangerous thats rubbish its dangerous which youd know if you had eyes and and what there was a pause its better that i do it for christs sake foxy youve got a wife a home respect love wrong my homes police quarters a dump im a squatter i dont have a woman you have alpha juliet and something might just you have a wife a wife a home and a wife why try this proverb by john heywood he wrote it in which was the last year in the life of henry the eighth an old fool is the worst kind of fool as in hes marrying a woman fifty years his junior actually only eighteen years but im the worst kind of fool whatre you saying foxy badger cursed himself he knew what foxy meant and should have buttoned his lip a quaver in the voice theres an expoliceman who transferred a few years back to ministry of defence security at bath he told me the guy shes with is in accounts all of naval procurement knows and probably most of accounts but i was one of the last shes shagging him you want some more young un my wife isnt likely to be at home sitting in front of the tv with a supermarket meal for one yearning for me to be home shes more likely to be in my bed drinking my cellar dry with her legs spread it hurts more than anything ive known i pretend i talk about her and its all lies you didnt have to tell me foxy they watch me at work people who know im married to her and whove seen her picture i know im drawn pale and they snigger that its because im getting it night after night but theyre not from naval procurement they know itll be their daily soapopera episode she goes to bassett you know what i mean wootton bassett she sees them bring the soldiers back from afghanistan up the high street and uses it to taunt me these are heroes and im the old fool who gives lectures and is half buried in the bloody past i think they have sex when shes claiming to be sick and doesnt go to work she goes through bassett on the way home its like she thinks youre not worthwhile unless youve earned a bassett job for yourself dont ever forget it no fool like an old fool i think thats enough young un you didnt have to im grateful to you for listening the light had slipped some more the binoculars no longer showed him the bird and the dim lights on the far side of the lagoon only outlined the walls of the house the big lamp the high one in front of the barracks had come on but there seemed to be no movement badger wondered if that indicated the guards mealtime he didnt know whether he had missed things he should have noted or whether foxy had lost his marbles through heat and dehydration no one before had confided in him like that he felt uncomfortable they would get to kuwait city together then split and be in different rows in the aircraft theyd head for the green channel separately and cars would take them in opposite directions he thought also there was an evens chance that hed be going into the water to get foxy back no one before had ever talked to him with such raw unhappiness he wriggled over to lie on his side his back to foxy and started to search in the bergen beside him for what he might need when foxy went to get the microphone and the cable they had reached frankfurt there was fog over hamburg and the airport there was closed temporarily but would reopen within two hours she was exhausted they sat on the silent stationary aircraft with a full cabin of other passengers and waited for the announcement that the pilot would soon be starting up the engines they were now on their fourth leg ahvaz to tehran tehran to vienna with the national carrier vienna to munich with the austrian airline munich to hamburg she was tense and quiet there was little the engineer could do to comfort her and old inhibitions died hard in him he thought it would be unseemly if he held her hand with every seat occupied and a feeling that he was watched paranoia what else she was dressed as he had never seen her before she had been given in the toilets off the vip lounge at tehrans imam khomeini international different clothes to wear which she had protested she had never seen before now she sat in a skirt that reached a little below her knee a thick cotton blouse and a solid jacket of deep green silk it had been suggested that she no longer needed to wear a headscarf they had czech passports she had whispered hoarsely do i have to renounce my nationality of which i am proud and my religion to which i am devoted he had said hesitantly that concerned officials in the ministry considered she would attract less attention if she was not an obvious iranian citizen is attracting attention so important are we ashamed of ourselves now her breathing was forced he rang the bell above his seat and when the stewardess came he asked for water for his wife it was brought without grace through the porthole windows the engineer saw that lights glistened on the apron and that rain spattered down he looked at his wristwatch and made the calculations he said that by now at home it would be dark she swallowed hard and said she hoped the children were in bed and would sleep well and there was little to talk of that could be in any way appropriate his only previous flight abroad had been as the student who went to budapest she held on her lap a briefcase that contained a full digest of her medical history with xrays and printouts of scans abruptly the music cut and a womans voice boomed to ribald cheering the plane shook as the engines ignited i think it is an hour to hamburg we take the local train to the centre of the city then the faster one to lubeck they were good boys peasants but not trained like the men of the alquds brigade he had drilled into them three times what they should do where each would be they were from the ranks of the basij and they looked at him with the sort of awe that was predictable in simple youths who found themselves under the command of a war veteran of an elite force they sat on the floor of the main communal area in the barracks and asked no questions but seemed to absorb what he told them it was always the duty of the defenders of the states frontiers to be on constant alert to prevent incursions from spies terrorists criminals anyone who sought to undermine and betray the revolution of the imam perhaps tonight such a risk exists from our enemies but we are ready he dropped his voice a trick he had learned many years earlier when he had been attached to hezbollah in the lebanese bekaa valley from a syrian intelligence officer i could delay do nothing send for help from ahvaz and the senior men there would know i had no faith in you that i did not think the basij capable of confronting the spies the terrorists the criminals if the threat is there we will destroy it and in the morning we will send for help from ahvaz he had made a plan on the table using sand from a fire bucket and coloured sheets of cardboard that showed the house the quayside and the pier the lagoon the barracks and the bund line that ran along the southern edge of the water he used grass where the reeds should be and blue card for the water he had been through the plan three times he thought his wife working on the computer at the alquds camp would hear him praised it was a simple plan and he thought it a good one the boys listened intently and held tight to their rifles the landfall was lost behind them taken into the mist the ferry carried longdistance lorries and their trailers and was enroute from the swedish port of trelleborg to the south of malmo it would reach its destination travemunde after a departure to sail across the baltic at hours it had been a closerun thing but a representative in the swedish capital had achieved in eight hours what had been asked of him a passport had come from an embassy safe and gabbis photograph put in place he was greek cypriot living in norway and working in the haulage industry he was a drivers mate for a shipment of bulk timber to have created the passport the biography and gained the necessary seat in the cab was a triumph for the representative and the drivers mate had a footpassenger ticket to return on the ferry the following morning or on the additional sailing in the late afternoon he would not have said it himself but the representative who had met him at malmos airport sturup international had told him that no other intelligencegathering agency in the world could have put together such a package so quickly they liked cargo ferries from which cars and holidaymakers passengers not connected with longdistance business were barred customs and immigration checks and those for embarkation were bare formalities and the representative had said it was a perfect route gulls wheeled over him he stood at the rail in fading light and watched the long straight line of the boats wake he shivered sucked in air and used his tradecraft he wore a longpeaked baseball cap a scarf covering his mouth and gloves and would spend the entire sailing on deck not inside where it would be noticed if he kept on the cap scarf and gloves and on deck no cameras would record him the wind was brutal and there was sleet in the air but he stayed at the rail the men were in place where he had positioned them he was ready mansoors last action was to take out from a shed behind the barracks a small inflatable dinghy capable of carrying four men he did not have nightvision such equipment was kept by combat forces but he had good eyes and the moon would be up soon he had good ears too he watched and listened he did not know what he might see or hear but he felt confident if he saw and heard nothing if he had imagined the loop of wire and the tubing on which the bird sat then he had not called out a platoon from ahvaz and could not be ridiculed the dark had come and sounds rippled from the lagoon from the birds and frogs and the pair of pigs and he believed concentrating his gaze into the darkness that the sacred ibis a bird revered for three millennia had not moved it was the key he stood in the middle of the road and gave his memories full rein the road once the northern trunk route from old west german territory to the german democratic republic ran between lubeck and schwerin east and west had met here separated by a white line that had been painted across the tarmac it was natural that len gibbons should come to the village that straddled the road and was called schlutup he stared into the middle distance the dusk was coming slowly and the wind whipped him he saw only desolate heathland where no trees grew dead ground it had been his place his territory he had been gibbo then and considered bright enough in his twentyninth year to be sent from london to join the bonn station and be given responsibility to run assets in the northern sector not as exciting as berlin but good work that would have been the envy of the peers who had joined the service with him the man had been codenamed antelope where he looked now there had then been the customs post and the base from which the grenztruppen and the staatssicherheit had been deployed it had been a complex of buildings reached by a corridor between high wire fencing a minefield dogs watchtowers all the paraphernalia that awful state had needed to keep its citizens from flight and now was levelled the barracks of the border guards from which they deployed to the watchtowers and patrols in the killing zones had been flattened the cells and interrogation rooms of the stasi had been bulldozed it had been gibbos ground when he had run antelope he accepted that a bewildering coincidence had brought him back to lubeck extraordinary and unpredictable he thought that the fates had dealt him a fine hand the chance to obliterate old memories and wounds a successful killing would wipe clean the slate of the schlutup fuckup they had travelled himself the cousin and the friend on separate flights his had taken him via brussels and then a connection to hamburg the cousin had also gone to brussels but had had a fixedwing charter bring him on to the smaller airfield outside lubeck the friend would have travelled in his own mysterious way by his own routes and channels another hired aircraft most likely and documentation that would fool most experts and certainly would have been accepted by local officials they had met by the canal in lubeck near to the gardens between the muhlen and dankwarts bridges and sat on a bench the israeli had smoked cigarettes and the american a small cigar gibbons had yearned to ditch his abstinence the pieces of the jigsaw had come together it was where the story of antelope had been launched by a pastor the young gibbons freshfaced and revelling in a job that brought him to the cusp of cold war action had been standing almost at the point where he was now and had been staring up that road past the barriers dogs had been leaping on their leashes at him and he would have been under the gaze of half a dozen pairs of binoculars three or four zeiss and praktica cameras would have been focused on him he had known then so little of the east he had once been on an autobahn drive direct to west berlin and on the military train that ran across communist territory to berlin from helmstedt in the west there was little to learn from watching the empty road the ground where no cattle grazed and the expressionless faces of the guards so he had turned and walked down the hill the pastor had approached him sidled to his shoulder the pastor had a friend who was trapped in the east there was a cafe down the road from which the old border had run and they had gone there the pastor had refused alcohol and drunk tea he had talked more of his friend where did the friend work at the telephone exchange in wismar where else trumpets had blasted excitement had gone rampant soviet military formations were close naval forces had moorings on the mecklenburgerbucht to the north and at rerik and warnemunde to the east and the telephone exchange had the potential to offer up the pouches of gold dust so coveted by the service he had filed his report of the meeting for consideration in bonn and london with reservations and instructions for due care on gibbonss part antelope had come alive he stood in the road and was oblivious of the traffic the dusk had arrived sharply enough for the oncoming lights to dazzle him cars vans and lorries swept past the slipstreams buffeting him he stood his ground the jigsaws pieces had slotted together well he had remarked without apparent humour that the marzipan factor had clinched the location lubeck the americans had the database and were able to name an iranianborn neurosurgeon resident in lubeck who practised there he performed complicated surgery either in the citys medical schools or in hamburg there was a home address on roeckstrasse the israeli said that a man would come from berlin and would have with him necessary equipment the facilitator was in transit and would reach the city late in the evening but had not volunteered details of the mans travel plans they had gone their ways and would meet again in the late evening hands had been shaken a course of action had been launched and would not now be revoked they had stood and the cousin had remarked offhand i say this len with real pleasure your boys who went forward that old guy and the youngster they did us proud my sincere congratulations to them hed answered that they were unable to beat it straight out because there was kit to recover but about now they would be on the move and yes it had been a firstclass effort he had not thought about them before or since the cousin had spoken of them it was in a sense a pilgrimage that gibbons had made to schlutup straight from that bench in his hired vw there was a small centre deserted but dominated by the church where the pastor retired now had stood in while the incumbent was away then there were residential streets of bungalows with a sprinkling in the gardens of the winters first snow he had parked and walked past a lake ducks had scattered off it he had remembered the lake and there were concrete bunkers that british military engineers had put in place when the borders were defined and the barriers had gone up the structures were now collapsed and overgrown there was a paddock with horses one was old a skewbald and had had its head down with tiredness there was a trace in his memory of a young horse roan on grey possibly he had walked onto the death strip where there would have been smoothed sand firing devices and patrols and the bankruptcy of the regime was on show he had found an apple tree a few rotten fruits had survived the autumn and he imagined the bored young guard a conscript far from home who had tossed down a core and bred the tree the death strip was now in the possession of hikers and dogwalkers and he had met children out with a teacher a man with schnauzers and a woman with a yellow labrador he had walked along the strip where the fences and towers had been dismantled two decades earlier where few signs survived to corroborate his past and the schlutup fuckup the place and antelope had governed his life fashioned and shaped it and had made him the man he was so much had been expected based on recommendations from young gibbo of a traitor working inside the wismar telephone exchange few escaped their past and actions of many years ago and len gibbons was not among those who did the pastor had introduced him tantalisingly brief to a man in the cafe and had murmured that he was indeed from the exchange allowed across the frontier to watch a football match between dresden and hamburg bundles of phone dockets were passed with red crosses on them if they were between military units and spools of tape he had been with the man no more than fifteen minutes and had thought him brave committed and almost a hero he had seen him walk to the pastors car outside the cafe and be driven away the pastor then had access to the east and became a regular and reliable courier until his health was said to have failed the question was raised did the service have potential couriers in the east men and women who could be trusted the question had been answered and the schlutup fuckup was born they were old wounds but had not healed it was an indulgence for len gibbons to have come here he knew all the escape stories from this section of the inner german border homemade balloons gliders built in garden sheds tranquilliser pills buried in meat and thrown to the dogs then payment to the traffickers who would attempt to hide a client under the back seat of a car with sedatives for a child and bluff a way past the border troops and the stasi one appealed to him hugely the next day while the hitman worked and while his own presence on the streets was unnecessary he would go a little to the north to where he had walked for comfort and peace thirty years earlier and he would think of axel mitbauer of the east german national swimming team he would be there the next morning because it was unnecessary for him to witness a killing merely to have a role in its organisation he turned away a car blasted its horn at him but he ignored it and began to walk to schlutups church dedicated to st andrew he had spent much time there and thought that being there had sculpted him made him the man he was whom some hated some despised and few admired you didnt have to badger whispered low but almost brusque from foxy didnt have to about you and her you didnt have to tell me dont remember telling you anything please yourself i usually do it was enough and couldnt be put off longer did he regret the agonyaunt session now they hadnt spoken in the last quarter of an hour and the light had failed badger would have gone out loosed the cable then faffed about until he found the microphone he would have come back reeled in the cable and not thought too much about it foxy had made it a big deal he had talked about danger and the wire and suggested the goon had seen and noted gods truth badger had observed nothing that rang alarm bells and hed thought he had a good nose for them and you dont have to dont have to you dont have to go i can do it far as im concerned you can barely wipe your arse what i told you to do do it and be ready then we shift straight out its done and checked well check it again foxy started the slow wriggle backwards using his elbows and knees to move himself and his head went past badgers chest badger ducked shouldnt have spoken but did anyway is it her badmouthing you sneering about heroes and bassett letting you know youre secondrate that hurts youre out of order young un and taking a liberty i dont remember telling you anything reckon ill be about fifteen minutes he was gone and badger was alone the space beside him gaped he began to clear out the inside of the scrape and shove their rubbish into his bergen he took out the glock and could do the business by touch he checked the magazine and felt that the safety was in place he heard very faintly foxys crawl towards the reed beds he pulled their kit out of the hide lay in silence on his stomach and waited chapter foxy went forward no call for farewells no last handshakes no clenched fists punching against shoulders he crawled to his right leaving the mass of dried fronds behind him and used his fingertips to guide him he reached ahead to check for obstructions anything that would break as he went over it the moon would be up later now it was not much more than a silvery wedge behind the mist that came up off the lagoon it was the best time to be on the move and the creatures in the water helped him the frogs the birds and the pigs that had moved on and were almost up against the raised bund line that divided the lagoon beyond the beds croaks splashes and grunts broke the quiet and he felt good with the noises around him not that the goon or the guards who were more than two hundred yards away could have heard the crack of a twig breaking he went into the reeds and wriggled on elbows stomach and knees he felt a great stiffness in every joint he had assumed it would be hard to get his muscles supple again after the hours in the hide but hadnt imagined it would be this bad he had never done such a long stint in a cramped lieup before it would make good copy in a lecture hall with the same old curtains drawn as before sorry and all that guys but im not at liberty to tell you which corner of the world i was in enough to say it was hot and the donkey shit smelt recent enough i hadnt moved more than a handful of yards before every muscle had seized and couldnt say where but his audience would be total pillocks if they didnt understand hed been behind enemy lines alone and going forward ellie was forgotten and badger as was a monologue that had demeaned him he thought about faces in grey light stretching away from him in an auditorium a spotlight was on him and the men and women in the audience from an infantry unit a logistics regiment the cavalry or the intelligence family would listen to what he had to say there would be no when or why but they would finish up with a good idea of what it was like to lie in a hide in the thick fabric of a gillie suit at the end there might be a little hint of what it had all been for you wont of course expect me to break the official secrets act but out in that dismal wasteland where the sun shines and weve had few thanks for the sacrifices made we lived with the curse of the ied that wretched little package at the side of the road in the body of a dead dog behind a kerbstone and always cleverly made lets just say that one man who made the damn things is now pushing up the daisies thank you all for your attention hed smile a little and take a step back from the lectern and theyd have learned about the privations of being a croppie he would expect a brief moment of stunned silence then a colonel or a brigadier would stand and lead an ovation he was where the reeds thinned and there was open water ahead he didnt know hadnt asked badger how deep the water was or how far he had to get from the hide to the mud spit most of the time he had held the binoculars in front of his face and the magnification had foreshortened the distance to the concealed microphone the water lapped in his boots and saturated his socks so damn tired because they had finished the drinking water some twentytwo hours before and his body had no more moisture to lose in sweat his mouth and throat felt like sandpaper and his muscles were slow unresponsive he was wading he made each step forward with huge effort which became greater with each step he took he could see the back of the bird ahead a slight blob of soft colour if then foxy could have found the cable he would have yanked it he would have ditched the old discipline that said all gear should be brought out he would have dragged at the cable broken the connection and abandoned the microphone the bird would have flown spooked by the commotion he would too have made some excuse about having the microphone on the way back stumbling and dropping it but he didnt have the cable in his hand foxy would not turn around retrace his steps through the glue that the mud made and return to the hide acknowledge failure exhaustion fragility and ask badger to do the job he couldnt he had opened his mouth and blurted stuff made a fool bigtime of himself he struggled to get the boots moving again and the water level was past his waist his stomach growled for food and his throat choked for water he had weakened enough to spill the story of his marriage then weakened further and done a volunteer now the mud was above his ankles and the gillie suit was a lead weight the smell of the mud was in his face and he thought he was making more noise than the pigs when they had stampeded coots ran from him on the water surface and took flight screaming far in front of him past the outline of the mud spit his target was the house with its security lamps and away from it the old lamppost on the quayside in front of the barracks when he rested and was quiet he could hear a radio playing softly in the barracks it had been folly to say he would do it he was bloody near marooned unable to move he took another step abruptly he was in open water and the reed beds were behind him foxy realised he should have discussed with badger how best to approach the spit where the microphone was he should have worked his way further to the right and nearer to the bund line where he would have avoided the deeper water but he hadnt he had been too proud another step and he lost his left boot he could have screamed but took another step the church was a fine building of weathered red brick len gibbons had walked down the hill from the old bordercrossing point past homes with gardens scoured by frost and a snow shower he had hugged shadows and felt that the journey to schlutup was a demonstration of indulgence and weakness he remembered it so clearly sometimes len gibbons would meet the parttime pastor status never quite defined inside the church and sometimes outside they would talk close to the old lifeboat preserved and mounted on wood blocks above gravel and the renovated clock with goldplated hour symbols and hands would chime the church of st andrew had seemed a safe reliable trustworthy place to meet and the pastor had seemed a man of integrity the young len gibbons had seen an opportunity for advancement and had wanted to trust he went into the churchyard and passed ancient headstones there were lights inside a final blaze of organ music he had wanted to believe and urged his seniors to accept his judgements many said later that it was against their better judgement that they had acquiesced and had shifted the blame for the catastrophe to the slight shoulders of the young len gibbons but an asset in the telephone exchange at wismar was of prime importance an old lesson had been learned great danger hounded intelligence officers if they believed only what they wished to believe the clock struck the hour the doors opened and light flooded out the music was finished but voices came through the doorway clear and bright he could not have said why he was there why he had driven out from lubeck to the place that had altered his working life and reconstructed his values at first the pastor had been able to travel into and out of the german democratic republic stories had been planted of elderly parents living behind the curtain and to the south of schwerin and passes being issued by an official who was a longstanding friend of the family the pastor had brought back printouts of the numbers called by units of the soviet army air force and navy useful it had hardly mattered the presence of the agent antelope in such a sensitive position was important he watched the doorway and the first of that evenings congregation emerged and stood for a moment on the step their breath vivid in the cold they shivered but did not break off their conversations there had not been sufficient rigour applied to the asset and the story he had told the pastor had announced one may day that he would no longer be able to travel back and forth into the east as the official had been transferred was it possible that the asset antelope could deliver his stolen material to a courier regarded as honest and reliable by the spy masters over the following five months three couriers were identified then names and addresses given for the pastor to pass them to the asset the man came out of the church in a small group talking earnestly gibbons stayed back let no light fall on his face the silhouette of his body was masked by the trunks of the plane trees then the man had always shaved closely and his hair had been cropped short now he wore an old coat against the evening chill and his hair was in a ponytail held by an elastic band his beard grew randomly across his face the last he had heard of the man still recognisable was that he had started a sentence of six years imprisonment at hamburgs fuhlsbuttel gaol the end of the first week of october was republic day in the east on that day the decision to arrest a pastor had been taken after joint consultation between british and german intelligence officers the british in bonn had gone cap in hand to their ally and grovelled on the failure of an operation that had cost the freedom perhaps the lives of four couriers the information had been unwillingly accepted that antelope was a sting operation conducted by the stasi from berlin that a treacherous telephone operator in wismar had never existed maybe the gullibility of gibbonss seniors had saved his own skin others would have gone with him to the guillotine had he been too heavily punished for the capital crime of naivete he had survived by a thread but was an altered man he did not spring forward to greet the man how the devil are you looking well considering in work or dependent on handouts do you still believe in the clappedout empire that faded to dust overnight was it all worth mens lives the ones you condemned to years in cells or for hanging he watched the man once a pastor go out through the gate and those around him laughed at something he said all so long ago but relevant to len gibbons that night he had met the man had walked away with a package in his hand then lit a cigarette which was the signal german police plain clothes had come forward and snapped on the handcuffs he had killed in his soul any last trace of humanity he no longer believed in mercy now a servant of the service he obeyed orders it was why he had been chosen all agencies in this field of work needed men like len gibbons he turned on his heel and went back to the car park where he had left the vw foxy reached the mud spit he had fallen once the booted foot had tripped against the one that wore only a sock and hed gone down into the water where it was shallow his head would have gone under if his hands hadnt found the bottom but water foultasting splashed onto his face he was there foxy sucked in air there was a flap in his face desperate the birds wings beat but it failed to launch itself there was no one for foxy to ask what the fuck was happening he had no idea why the bird just flapped its wings hopelessly he might have figured it out if his mind had been clearer it gave a croak like a death rattle and he had his hand up protecting his eyes from the wings the cable whipped against his cheek his fingers found it and ran along its length then collided with the birds body it went into spasms of action then was still the beak hit him the african sacred ibis was snagged by the cable he let go of it and the bird rose a foot off its perch the cable tautened the ibis croaked and the claws on its feet came against foxys hands and ripped at them the flesh tore the beak came back at him was used as a spear he grasped the cable again and the bird hung from his arm foxy lashed out with his free hand it didnt matter to him that the bird was endangered that its presence was a jewel in the ecosystem of the marshes he struck out used full force he couldnt see it beyond the vague shapes of the wings as they beat at him but he recalled a long slender neck he had seen it when the bird had flown in and while it had cleaned the feathers on its chest he knew that his target was the neck and the blow was hard he was joe foxy foulkes he had taken on the full might of an african sacred ibis worshipped as a deity in the civilisation of the pyramids and pharaohs and had broken its neck it hung from his hand there were no reflexes no shuddering death throes foxy had killed it it hung from the entanglement of the cable it had seemed large when the wings had beaten the feet slashed and the beak stabbed but now it was shrivelled he heard only the lapping of water maybe against the reeds behind him or away to his right he heard rippling maybe the wind had risen with the darkness he tried to pull the cable free but it gouged against his palm and the limp carcass prevented him tugging it free foxy knelt on the mud spit he could hear his heart his breathing and the rippling of water but could see nothing except the patch of white the wing feathers and the back of the bird he started to disentangle the corpse from the cable it would have realised it couldnt lift off and had sat still hoping that the approaching beast would somehow avoid it only at the last when the cable around its left leg and body had tightened squeezing air out of it had it reacted foxy didnt know how long it had been since he had left the hide not even how long he had been on his knees on the mud spit a degree of tenderness held him as he slackened the cable and started to free the birds body he found the microphone wedged among the reeds and branches badger had used to give it stability when he had freed the bird he laid it down and put reed fronds over it he took a deep breath and slipped the microphone into the poachers pouch inside the gillie suit then he began to coil the loose cable he didnt know why then the frogs croaking was silenced but he could hear the water rippling did you think it would be like this i did not the engineer answered a shuttle bus had brought them from hamburg airport and they had been dumped with their bags on the pavement outside the hauptbahnhof the rushhour crowds surged past and towards them his experience of a european mainline terminus had been in budapest as a student in his early twenties he knew crowds from tehran but there he had command of language and the status of chauffeurdriven transport naghmeh flinched away from the press of people around her he had seen her gaze mouth slack and eyes wide at the prostitutes outside the station and under the streetlights waists exposed in the cold skirts barely covering their upper thighs their faces painted he had said nothing neither had she they had come inside the high arched building and loud music had greeted them he had known it was beethoven she had asked why they played it so loudly in the station it keeps away the drug addicts i read that users of heroin do not like such music he had said why do they allow those people on the streets in a public place he had studied the board searched for the train going to lubeck she leaned on his arm needing its support he said it was the way matters were handled in germany france spain and britain she had snorted had he known it would be like this he did not lie he had not do they have no respect for us i cannot argue with them we are here we will take the train to lubeck at lubeck we will go to the hotel i can do no more would you have me rant at the embassy call the ministry or the commanding officer of the alquds would you have me complain she looked into his face but could not meet his eyes which were locked on the departures board we should not have come he said what platform the train would leave from and started towards the steps going down to it pulling their bag did you hear me we should have stayed where our own god is he told her how long it would be before the train left for lubeck it was heresy to suggest they might turn back and they went slowly down the steps he had started on the return impossible to go quietly now each stride forward taxed him to his limits he gathered in the cable and looped it on an arm badger would maybe have to pull him the last few yards into the depths of the reed bed and he might need there to flop and rest before he accepted any help or rest though he would get there he had a stubborn pride the light came on he was too exhausted his mind dulled to realise in the first seconds what the light that trapped him meant no panic not in the first moments after the beam caught him for foxy it was a time of innocence to him it lasted an age but it would not have been longer than five seconds then the panic broke and he started to thrash he was up to his groin in water and the weight of the gillie suit tugged him down he had one boot for a good grip in the mud and one foot with a sock that slithered and gave no purchase he flailed his arms as if that would help him to go forward but the mud had trapped him as effectively as the beam there was shouting from close by near to the source of the light and answering calls from away to the right where the bund line was the beam closed on him and he heard the splash of paddles then the guttural cough of an outboard foxy understood a craft had been paddled towards him then allowed to drift closer if he could reach the reed beds there was a chance he dragged his knees up one after the other tried to stamp but the water held him the gillie suit dragging and the mud oozed deep beneath his feet foxy had done time in the province had been on attachment to brigade armagh city in the ditches the winter hides and camouflaged in thick summer scrub sometimes with an oppo beside him sometimes reliant for his safety on backup that would be down the road there was fatalism in all of those who did the work that the guys supposedly watching their backs would never react in time if they showed out he wrestled with the suit hitched it high and was able to get his fist into the poacher pouch his hand locked on the microphone he dragged it clear and dropped it he felt it knock lightly against his knee then his ankle the bootless foot trod it into the slime the beam of the light was off him he splashed heaved charged and thought each step the last he was capable of the light raked the reed beds then passed over the open ground and the hide nothing there he didnt see badger crouched holding the glock locked in both fists for a steady aim neither did he see badger in the throwing position to arc smoke or gas in his direction and towards the boat he saw only a scurrying pair of coots then a drake stampeding clear he dropped the cable his feet tangled with it then he was beyond it one more step the light swept off the open space and across where the hide was tracked over the water and locked on him two shots were fired in the province it had been taken as read that a croppie who had shown out to pira would be captured tortured for information on his work callsigns and targets then trussed blindfolded and put in the back of a van it was assumed that the last sound theyd hear would be the scrape of metal on metal when a handgun was cocked and that death would be a bit of a bloody relief after what had gone before that had been drunk talk subdued and slurred no bastard would find the microphone and the cable had gone down hed lost sight of it where was badger and where was the fucking cavalry two more shots fired could have been from a rifle or carbine but not a pistol the light lit him well the bullets were aimed close enough to him for a spatter of the lagoon water to come up and into his face the engine had power and the light surged closer he heard the shouting more clearly he should keep still the voice was shrill and he sensed that adrenalin surged it would be the goon the fucking officer who sat in the chair and watched the birds wrong watched one bird he took a deep breath and flopped down into the water it came over his stomach then his shoulders his head went under and the foul stuff was in his nose mouth and ears he tried to push himself away and the light was over him foxy used his hands on the mud and pushed the cable aside he felt the air forcing itself free of his chest it was lodged in his throat and he knew he couldnt hold it longer and didnt have to a hand clenched hard into the gillie suit it had been pathetic he would have been when he reckoned he had dived no more than a foot below the waters surface moving at the pace of a bloody great slug and kicking off a trail of mud the hands had him heaved him up and his head was clear of the water he heard laughter not of humour but of contempt and the breath spurted from his mouth then he cried out because he couldnt replace it fast enough and panted the light blinded him he couldnt see who held him who laughed at him the laughter was killed and the shout was of real anger as if he had inflicted pain the reprisal a blow to the side of his head he didnt know what had aroused the anger and stifled the laughter a rope was looped under his arms and across his chest then drawn tight with a jerk that squeezed more breath from his lungs the pain pinched and another hand had caught at the neck of the suit the engine pitch rose and the boat gathered speed he was dragged through the water if his head had not been held up by the fist he would have been swamped and gone under he wondered where badger was what he had seen the engine noise softened he felt his feet one in the boot and one in the sock scrape over the mud the engine was cut and the big light went out but a torch was in his face and he squeezed his eyes shut he didnt know how much time was needed but thought it would be many hours the rope was used to pull foxy over the quayside and onto the ground he was on his stomach but a boot went into his ribcage and pushed him over he rolled on his side and came to rest on his back like a fish hauled by anglers into a boat then left to gasp on the deck there was a jabber of voices around him and rifle barrels close to his face many hours were needed and foxy didnt know if he could give them in lubeck enough time he sat in his office to those around him who worked late in the treatment rooms at the universitys medical school he was steffen weber to himself he was soheil in farsi the star he did not need to ask he had seen three patients that day and conducted lengthy examinations of their conditions one he could help with surgery but two had conditions beyond his skill he would deliver verdicts positive and negative the next afternoon he had seen the patients been in and out of the office and had gone past the desk his secretary used she had left no note on his own desk to tell him your wife rang and requested you call her she will be at home he had not telephoned her he could have she could have neither had what should he do he did nothing he did not call his home and tell her he was sorry for their argument that he loved her and their daughter that nothing should be allowed to come between them he did not ask her if she had had a good day did not apologise for being late that evening the consultant a man revered in his circles did not lift the telephone on his desk she could have rung spoken of her love for him and her gratitude for him working his fingers to the bone to buy their home that kitchen that life for her and she might have said she accepted his judgement on what he could do and what he could not avoid she too had done nothing around him he felt a growing tension among his assistants as if they believed him responsible for a situation in which an unidentified patient had obtained an appointment without the prior submission of xrays and scans it insulted them he could not respond as the hours of the day had gone by his temper had shortened the last of his patients the fortynineyearold senior officer from the fire station in one of the baltic coast towns north of the city had been clearly beyond help but the visit to the consultant with his wife would have marked a closure point from which the patient could prepare for death the man should have been treated with courtesy sympathy and understanding the examination had been short almost brusque and the patient had been told that the consultant could offer a final verdict the next day but he should not hold his breath he had noted that a nurse had stared into his face as the couple had left showing rank hostility the distrust proved widespread among his staff the next target for a vicious response was a mildmannered clerk from the fees office there was a hesitant rap on his door he waved the man in yes you have a patient visiting you tonight doctor yes facilities were originally booked for next monday morning but have now changed how does this concern your office the patient as yet has no name address or correct we have no record doctor of how the account will be settled we have no debitcard number no bankers order no please doctor how will the account be settled i have no idea we will wait and see now fuck off out of my room the clerk did so he saw foxy on the quay and the guns pointing down at him there were torches and a flashlight on foxy and the picture in the viewfinder of the imageintensifier was pale green washed out at the fringes and burned through on the focus point badger watched what could he have done could he have intervened might he have saved foxy he slapped it from his mind badger thought it indulgence to consider what he might could should have done he had done nothing it would have been dishonest to claim hed liked foxy been fond of him even that hed acquired a degree of respect for him he was not dishonest never had been to a fault badger spoke it like it was he couldnt have said it was anything other than gutwrenching to see through the lenss soft focus the man hed shared the hide with had slept alongside had eaten defecated and urinated next to and from whom hed been given the big confession of life with a woman who shagged around on the quay they were searching foxy had the suit pulled up his legs arms and chest exposed then hands seemed to go down into foxys underpants and scrabble there for anything hidden the boots came at him to pitch him over and they did his backside searched in there he couldnt have done anything because he had seen little of foxy being taken hed been on the far edge of the clear ground away from the hide and had the bergens beside the small craft with the air cylinder used to inflate it hed reckoned that hed pull and foxy would ride he hadnt seen the light come on and had become aware of the crisis only after the shots were fired then he had scrambled leopard crawl and seen the scale of it there had been a light on the boat and more lights along the raised bund line out to the right they would have had automatic weapons assault rifles with an accurate killing range of four hundred yards and hed had a glock with an effective hit chance of thirty yards he had seen with the imageintensifier foxy ditch the microphone and the cable badger thought they were like kids up early on christmas morning the goon strutted around his prisoner and the older woman had come out of the house he went to work the cable came easily he drew it out of the hide and pulled it up from the slight trench in which it was buried the main length came sparkling from the lagoon water and made a little wave which was sufficient to draw in the birds carcass it was dead and he didnt know how it had died the old woman came close to foxy who was near naked now on his back and exposed she gave a keening cry and lashed out with a foot badger saw foxys head jolt she managed one more kick before she was pulled off him two guards escorted her back to the house he felt sick he went on with the work he coiled the cable walked across the open space and down a shallow slope hidden from the lagoon and stowed it in the bergen that was in the inflatable from the other badger took out his own glock and the spare magazines the gas and flash grenades he didnt know what he would do with them if foxy had had a glock grenades and the gas it was unlikely hed have made it back from the mud spit when there was no more to be done he sat down with the imageintensifier he had a poor view of the quay the buildings along it the lights and the cluster of men standing over the stretchedout shape he reflected on the scale of the catastrophe a word kept coming into his mind deniable he saw a bruised face bloodied one or both eyes closed the broken look of a man without hope and a voice in monotone denounced a mission of espionage hardly not at all deniable time to tell the news he had the communications made the link said it like it was didnt expect a coherent answer from alpha juliet and didnt get one silence hung after a few seconds he thought the connection had already been open too long her voice strained what did he intend to do badger said hang around while i have darkness cover see what happens what shows not come out till i have to they would be on standby for an extraction but on their side of the border the shit was in the fan she told him grimly unnecessarily plenty of it badger said and cut the link they read their stuff when the door of the readyroom opened the copilot tristram did not look up from the old testament dwayne allowed his puzzle book to drop into his lap and chewed his pencil stub the side gunner federico was deep in aerospace amp engineering magazine but shifted his feet without taking his eyes off the pages to allow the pilot to go to the door where a communications technician handed him the scrambled receivertransmitter when he came back in no more than a minute later federico again swung his legs to give the pilot eddie space to pass dwayne and tristram did not look up but waited the pilot said we can go at any time from now if we go itll be into a hostile environment and close up against the border there are two guys up there and right now its a bad time for them itll be us that goes in for extraction if thats the call and the others do top cover it wont be a night for sleeping the pilot his sidekick and the gunners looked up from their reading matter and sat taller in their chairs they peered through the open window and could see the helicopters floodlit on the apron fuelled and armed the old woman the mother of the engineers wife had shown them the way when foxy was dragged off the quayside kicks were aimed at him he was cursed and spat at all his senses reacted he could feel pain from the kicks and the wetness of spit he could smell the sweat on their bodies and the food they had eaten on their breath and he could hear them not easy to understand because they used the vernacular of country people from the south and he thought theyd have been recruited from farms and villages not a major town he was dragged they had stripped the gillie suit off him and he was left with his underpants socks and his one boot the rope was still below his armpits and across his chest burning the skin he was on his back and more of the flesh was stripped raw on his buttocks and the back of his thighs he reckoned the heel without the boot bled from the sharp stones embedded in the ground they thought he was a spy they didnt know if he was alone some said he was because no attempt had been made to rescue him or to shoot at them as the boat had closed on him they argued about it he could measure the excitement of those who had taken him was he american british or a paleskinned iraqi a sunni bastard from baghdad or a kurd from the north that was also an area of debate the goon mansoor strutted beside him foxy was bumped along the dirt track away from the house and he saw the old crow woman in her black framed in the window watching his eyes met hers and he read hatred he felt a growing numbness to the pain it wouldnt last he had seen men who had been taken the rope was tight on his chest and seared him he had seen men taken in the province had stayed on in the hide and used his encrypted communications to guide in the arrest team he had had imageintensifiers if it was dark and early on a winters morning or binoculars if it was summer and already dawn all of those taken had been experienced men well practised in the techniques of resistance all would have regained composure within a halfminute of the door being flattened the kids starting to bawl the dog kicked into the kitchen by troops and the woman scratching at the faces under the helmets all by the time they were brought out of the door into the fresh air frosted or already warm were calm and their composure came from the knowledge that they might endure a kicking or a slapping but not much worse then go into the cages at the maze and mark time until freedom came he had not seen one provo plead and weep theyd had no cause to they were not about to be killed or to undergo severe torture they might have done at the start in the old days when the war was coming up to speed and when robust methods had brought pira to its knees but a halt had been called long before foxys time and he had watched once from a distant ditch in the somerset hills west of taunton the quantocks when an animalrights activist had been taken from a cottage at dawn he had burned a laboratory to the ground and driven the scientists working there close to suicide but he had seemed to think little of going into custody he had not been about to go through any hoop and had known it it would be the goons finest hour what every security man dreamed of foxys head bobbed rolled and the back of his skull found stones to bounce off some of the chips were razoredged and slashed him he could be thankful that the pain for now was numbed he had done time with the interrogation unit at the basra base he had seen iraqis brought in from the cells of the joint forward intelligence team a separate camp within a camp not answerable to local commanders those men had known fear and had cowered they had had the scars to show what had been done to them foxy had sat at bare tables alongside the men and women who organised the inflicting of pain he had been opposite prisoners who shivered and mumbled answers that he had had to strain to hear then dutifully translated it could of course be justified the men under interrogation knew the inner secrets of the enemys principal campaign weapon the improvised explosive device they might know who made them who trafficked them who laid them and their answers could a big word could often used by the team save the life of a nineteenyearold rifleman a teenage drivers limb or a lance corporals sight people said from far away in the safety of london that torture did not provide truth foxy would have said they were wrong he would have claimed that delivered as an art form and from manuals it made a man cough he was not given the freedom of the teams mess but they couldnt operate without his language skills so he had been tolerated given an occasional beer and told that information extracted and translated had led to the finding and defusing of a weapon or a raid on a safehouse or the interception of a courier he knew that pain worked miracles so foxy understood what was coming to him when his head twisted lolled he could see the barracks and the light shone down from the streetlamp and fell on the door the rope went loose and the goon called for a rag to be brought a guard ran inside foxy kept his eyes closed there were escape and evasion people at the base and they said eye contact was bad that being a sack of potatoes was best they did the sere courses and talked of survival evasion resistance and escape few people listened closely because the lectures seemed to add to a nightmare as they had when men talked in the canteens about what to do if pira took them foxys head was lifted and a hand tried to get into his hair for grip but could not so grasped his ear lifted and the cloth covered his eyes it was yanked tight and the knot hurt at the back his ear was let go and his head hit the dirt then the rope bit again under his arms and he was dragged some more they went onto concrete he rocked on a step after the top of his head had cannoned into the raised bit that provoked laughter there were no more kicks and he thought that already he was less cause for amusement there was a fucking cat that lived two doors down from his home and it liked to come into his garden pull down songbirds and disable them then it would walk away interest waned he was pulled down a corridor then to the left a door was unlocked predictable that theyd have a lockup for a criminal a miscreant on a discipline charge or a foreignborn agent who was deniable he lay on the floor and the concrete was cool he waited for the pain to start and wondered how long in lubeck they would need him to resist and how long he could last a match was scraped and he smelt cigarette smoke it came close to him closer past his head and over his chest the agony was on his stomach as the lit cigarette touched foxy screamed hes switched the damn thing off she said well he would miss corky said it was the fourth time she had tried the fourth time she had been answered by a crackle of static the weight lay on her shoulders she would carry the glory of success and bear the burden of failure it was a problem with these wretched deniables that the responsibilities were not shared there was much that abigail jones now regretted she had agreed that he should stay in place watch and learn and not come out not shared because there was no bank of bureaucrats in an openplan office who all owned a piece of the operation she had it on her own she could talk only with her bodyguards not her mentors or her thinktank none of them had a degree from warwick in politics economics and modern history or sixs training on grappling with the consequences of actions or cutting and running on the iraniraq border had the problem concerned singleparent fatherhood from a distance hamfist might have contributed and corky if it had been regeneration of provo heartlands west belfast shagger was big on the economics of hill farming and harding on trailerpark life it had been sharp of corky close to insolence she was curt as if her control was ebbing what does that mean exactly what they could play dumb be on the edge he would switch off wouldnt he miss why its hardly professional they had a fire in the scorched oil drum and there was enough timber from the buildings to keep it burning they were sitting around it and she reckoned that the crowd would be back at the gate in the morning and that the bribe chucked at the sheikh hadnt a long life there was a grunt almost derision and she reckoned it was shaggers was any of it professional any of it she said its unprofessional to switch off communications is that an area of debate hamfist was quiet reflective his partners been taken miss and if hed left the radio on the chance is youd have ordered him out shagger had a good voice might have been to the standard a choir wanted hell go when theres nothing else he can do wont be before he has to hed think miss the most unprofessional thing he could do is to turn his back on a mate go before its time from hamfist hed have to live with it the rest of his days and it would track him every hour of every night she snapped with bitterness but theres nothing he can do from harding its like keeping a vigil and its what a man owes to another first light maam hell come forget about badger think about foxy badgerll be good but foxyll have it bad how much time is needed in that german town how much is that time going to cost him the time foxy buysll come expensive you with me maam she felt small shrunken theyd swamped her irritation at a radio being switched off and turned her attention foursquare to the man with the trimmed moustache and the clipped voice who was beyond reach and in need of prayers the flames played on her face and she shuddered chapter he said nothing the questions came in farsi and arabic in halting english and pashto english was always the last of the series he answered to none who was he what was his name when the bedlam of languages had been used and hed answered none he was beaten the goon did not use any special weapon there was no hardwood truncheon no leadtipped baton no leathercoated whip the instrument was a length of builders wood nothing refined his underpants had been taken off him they stank he thought they would be soiled his boot also had been dragged off but his socks had been left they too stank and were sodden and tight on his feet he could see the blindfold had been removed the room had no window and a light burned in a ceiling recess covered by a wiremesh grille that soaked up some of the bulbs power so the room was in shadow two guards stood by the door he reckoned theyd have been basij conscripted parttime warriors and the lowest of the low home guard stuff they had automatic rifles that they held warily there was a ring on the wall and a rope was tied to it the far end was lashed to his right ankle he was no threat to them and had no chance of escape he couldnt have risen to his feet bullocked past the goon incapacitated or disarmed the two guards opened the door and charged off down the corridor even so the guards were tense and armed he couldnt have done anything because his arms had been pulled behind his back and his wrists were bound together with farmers twine the knot tight enough to restrict blood flow he didnt answer and couldnt protect himself when he was beaten if he tried to wriggle away get onto his side face the wall and present his spine his head or his upper arm was grabbed he was pulled back and turned with a boot onto his back his privates and lower stomach targets for the wood twice more he had been burned who was he what was his name there was blood on his face from the cuts on his cheeks below the eye sockets and from his nose already broken he thought and from the split on his upper lip he didnt answer although he could have done i am a detective sergeant of the metropolitan police service and currently attached to box his name was joseph foulkes born april married first to liz and second to ellie two kids the first time round it would have been hard to answer though bits of his teeth lay on the concrete floor and his tongue had swollen to double its size had he given his name it was likely that more of his teeth pieces would have worked loose and had to be spat clear he said nothing defiance was natural to him so far cigarettes stubbed on his stomach blows from the wood and kicks he could absorb it bloody pain was manageable it wouldnt last long the defiance was melded with sheer obstinacy he was of the age when kids had gone to see blackandwhite films had read closeprint books and knew of odette hallowes and yeothomas who was the white rabbit and of violette szabo he was of the age when he had passed judgement on naval personnel captured in the shatt alarab waterway who had seemed to thank the bastards of the revolutionary guard corps for the humiliations and mockexecutions and had almost apologised for navigation cockups the stories of childhood had stayed with him the memory of news bulletins and older mens disgust was sharp he told the goon nothing there was a table in the room there had been a moment when the blindfold had been stripped off and he had seen a clean notepad on the table with two pencils the top page was blank the bastard expected to fill it when he foxy did the canary bit the page stayed blank it was his target to keep it so the goon did not know who he was the goon moved on what was his mission he was asked in farsi arabic and english then again in farsi and finally in pashto the wood was raised as he was given a second to show willingness to answer he could see the wood but his eyes were misted and narrowed from the blows he could have said a colleague and i are on a deniable mission to observe the home of rashid armajan bombmaker and using techniques of surveillance as practised in covert rural observation post procedures with a shotgun mike we learned that armajan and his wife were headed for lubeck where she has a medical consultation and he has an appointment with it was about time drifting and he didnt know how much was needed what was his mission maybe already the engineer had reached germany maybe the following morning afternoon or evening he would be targeted if foxy answered the question what is your mission telephone or radio calls text messages or emails would fly and a shield would be placed in front of the man he would be inside a security bubble and the chance would be gone a shiteface would say that foxy foulkes had not delivered and thered be a cocksucker on hand to agree pig obstinate and knew it because liz first wife had told him so the wood came down the goon bastard swung it with full force foxys problem there were many but the one topping the list he didnt know where the blow would land and couldnt wriggle to avoid its impact it was on the shins no flesh there just skin on bone done with the flat of the wood to inflict pain not the edge which might have broken the tibia he might not say anything but he was near to screaming the wood was lifted again foxy looked up at the face he didnt see hate only frustration and the wood came down he jackknifed because it was in the groin on the shrivelled little thing that ellie two months back had laughed at when hed walked naked into the bedroom from the bathroom shed turned her back on him and gone back to her book great waves of heaving wanting to vomit convulsed foxy the wood went up again and he couldnt help himself he no longer had the strength to cross his legs he was humiliated helpless and the pain sources competed from his feet to the crown of his skull he didnt know how much time they needed he was hit there again the questions came in a babble of languages he didnt answer he used the tactic he had been told of he hit the prisoner again with the wood he couldnt see the mans privates but he could aim for the stomach and was rewarded with a grunt the breath bubbled blood in the mouth when he had been in the north of iraq before the injury men had been taken by the resistance under supervision of the alquds and denounced as collaborators those who served the great satan were condemned but first they were encouraged with planks boots lit cigarettes and fingernail extraction to tell of their contacts the safehouses where they met intelligence officers and the targets they spied on some died prematurely under questioning others talked in hoarse whispers and had to be carried outside to be shot a few surrendered what information was wanted at the sight of the match lighting the first cigarette and walked to the killing place sometimes electricity was used but not often or a man was hooded and made to kneel then would hear a pistol being armed he would feel the muzzle against the back of his head then hear the click as the hammer came down there was no bullet in the chamber but he would foul his trousers and wet himself they did that as much for amusement as to break a man he sweated no window the door shut no fan he had started with blows that had not exerted him and had won nothing now he hit with all the strength he could muster they had been very few the collaborators who had not bent under a beating his father had told mansoor of what was done in the gaol at ahvaz the bombers and assassins ahvaz arabs suffered heavily as the interrogators built pictures of the networks controlling them and were not pretty to view before they went to the gallows mansoor had no doubt that pain loosened tongues and broke resolve the frustration he did not know who he had mansoor had assumed that the man now stripped and spreadeagled in front of him unable to protect himself would talk after a brief display of defiance the message sent by radio to the security section of the irgc had not identified him as an alquds brigade officer although his name was on it and his location at the border post on the sector that faced the iraqi town of alqurnah there an intruder has been apprehended investigations are ongoing and an officer with an escort should be sent tomorrow morning to take the prisoner into custody in ahvaz all deliberately vague the frustration grew with each blow he struck and the silence that followed it twice he had crouched beside the bloodied face and put his ear near to where the front teeth had been battered out because he was certain the man would answer him he had heard coughing and groans he did not know the identity of the man or the purpose of his mission it would have helped mansoor had he gone outside into the evening air taken a chair close to a fire that would disperse the mosquitoes and not allowed anyone close to him had he sat sipped some juice and calmed matters now clouded would have clarified he stayed in the room used the wood again and yelled the questions who was the man what was his mission no answer came it had been a dream of glory in the dream men came from ahvaz in the morning a prisoner would be brought from the cell at the back of the barracks and given to them with the prisoner there would be an envelope containing a full confession listing his name his operation his controller the light would be coming up his men would be armed ready and he would tell the senior investigators who had travelled from ahvaz that he had no more time to talk with them as he would now be making a complex search of the area and would conduct a thorough followup in the dream he was congratulated for his diligence and shown deference in the dream later further praise came from his own unit he had dreamed of the praise had even recited in silence the words of congratulation showering down on him he hit the man again and again and again drew more blood and darkened more bruises the control had gone from mansoors voice and the questions were no longer softspoken but shouted highpitched he lit another cigarette he started again at the beginning and asked the first question who was he as he had at the beginning he dragged on the cigarette let the tip glow then bent over the stomach his hand crossed the skin and went towards the hair the urine ran he pressed the cigarette down the man screamed badger heard him the scream foxys was a knife cut in the darkness before there had been the dulled sounds of the frogs the coots and the ducks and of the pair of pigs that still rooted in the edges of the reed bed there were sprints by water birds and territory scuffles but foxys scream was a slicing wire and another followed it he sat very still and very tense badger would go when he had to then he would switch on his communications and make a last staccato call he would give an expected time of arrival at the extraction point but not yet he expected that the dawn would come the sun would poke up announcing one more stinking hot day and he would see in the magnification of his binoculars the arrival of military transport lorries and jeeps soldiers not these crap guys but trained men would spill out and the search would begin with cordon lines and others sent forward at the sides to give cover fire then it would be right for him to quit he might also see before he slipped into the water behind him and the forest thickness of the reeds them taking foxy away he might be on a stretcher or might be dragged if he was upright his head would be slumped and a cloth bound around it the blood the cuts and bruises would be easy to see even at that distance he would have done what he could stayed to the limits of obligation and he would track back towards the extraction point he was confident he would be ahead of the followup force and two things were certain two just two first no bright young spark from the prudential insurance sales team was going to write a life policy for foxy a slow smile played on badgers face there had been a funeral for a crop technique instructor young killed by stomach cancer before badgers time but still talked of when the coffin had been carried out of a packed church to go to the crematorium a crackly recording of gracie fields doing her hit song wish me luck as you wave me goodbye had played and the whole congregation had begun to clap many were weeping buckets and theyd kept the nearby pub open till past midnight it was said to have been the best funeral moment ever badger always smiled when he thought of it he wondered if foxy had been there second an operation was unravelling and its security had been breached there would be cancel flashes and abort instructions humour was good for squaddies and croppies fire teams and ambulance people but outsiders other than the psychiatrists reckoned it offensive and loutish they understood fuckall the scream came once more fainter with a blunter cutting edge that would not mean that the pain was less it was a sign that his strength was down and the fight was draining he had no protection now from the mosquitoes the clear ground where the hide had been made was around four foot above the water level badgers place now was on the reverse slope from where the hide had been and his boots were just clear of the water his body was on the incline and only his head covered in camouflage scrim net broke the top line he had the binoculars with him and the nightsight one of the bergens was against his boots and the thin rope holding the small inflatable with the second bergen in it was round his ankle he was ready to go but not before the time came badger remembered when hed been a young police officer and theyd escorted ambulances into accident and emergency with knife and gun victims he would see men and women sitting on plastic chairs in the corridors and know that behind doors or screens a life was ebbing they were there to express solidarity a sort of love and friendship he would stay as long as he could badger could picture them now they had politeness and dignity and seemed grateful to him for his concern there was often a bit of a choke in his throat when he slipped away to resume his duty and went out of their lives it was an obligation to stay here and at the royal bristol infirmary or the royal united in bath when he left the location of the hide would have been cleansed he had used reed fronds to brush around where the hide had been smoothing out boot and handprints then scattered the reeds theyd used for cover hed gone over the footfall into the reed beds the clear ground that led over the rim where he was now and down to the water the microphone was buried in mud and the length of the cable had been retrieved the birds carcass was beached in front of him there was nothing more he could do it had gone well well enough for the spats between himself and foxy to have been dismissed and now it was worse than anything imaginable foxy taken he would talk of course he would the screams he had heard said that foxy would talk in a weeks time or two weeks badger would be in his room at the police hostel and the tv would be on in the corner half hidden behind a hillock of kit and he would hear the voice and look up and foxys face would be on the screen he would hear foxys confession in a flat rehearsed voice and would remember the screams the screams said he would talk didnt like him did he never had not that now it mattered much foxy could barely see the swelling under and above his eyes had almost closed off his vision difficult for him to hear anything because his ears had been beaten and sound was dulled but he was lucid and could analyse the pain the cigarettes were worst the beatings were repetitive and taking their toll of him what had made him scream was when the cigarettes scorched his skin each time it was done he had wet himself they were the worst because his eyes could pick up the flash of the match and his nose could smell the smoke and he could make out the descent of the hand that held the cigarette he had started to scream before the fags tip had touched him an image came into his mind was clear then hazed and faded it was of a small crampedup guy who had been brought to speak to them in the base outside basra he had been an expert on sere american he wore us combat fatigues and had a flash on his left arm it showed a shield and a doublebladed military knife vertical that cut two lengths of barbed wire the man said in a deliberate far south accent that the symbol was of survival evasion resistance and escape through the wire barricades of the enemys gaols and territory he had gestured towards the shield and his right lower arm and hand had been missing replaced with a multipurpose hook none of the brits had come into the lecture hall if they were offduty the only ones there were happy enough to have a minor diversion from their work the others who were resting or in the canteen hadnt thought it worth their time foxy had been at the back of the small lecture hall and had listened half awake like most of them he had not rated it likely that he would face a situation where he needed to know how to survive evade resist and escape the start was clear the man the shield insignia the hook and the introduction by a british officer and the story of how a man now in his midfifties and therefore a veteran had lost an arm three decades earlier and learned enough lessons from it to have been kept on in the military well past all normal retirement dates the next part of the memory was hazy something about being the numbertwo flier in an f phantom and hit by surfacetoair near hanoi limping back and getting close to the dmz then having to bale out and being captured with a broken arm and escaping before the local medics had fixed the damage hed been with the airforce pilot walking and getting gangrene then the pilot using a sliver of glass from a broken bottle washed in a stream had amputated at the wrist they had come through the guy was a primary expert in his field but an audience had been pressed into attending and had thought what he said irrelevant to life in the base what had faded was what the guy with the hook had said foxy struggled for recall and watched for the fucking cigarette packet to be dragged out of the pocket the goon would lurch towards him drag up his head get a handhold on his hair or ear then use the fist on his face foxy struggled to remember what the sere guy had said but the memories were gone the goon mansoor limped he could give no indication that he understood a word of farsi nor could he give any hint that he had watched the house and listened to conversations he was in the business of buying time the time between each cigarette seemed the most important measure not the hands of a clock or watchface but the time between the last cough on the cigarette then it being dropped and stamped on and the next brought out from the pack put in the mouth the match scraping the box sometimes failing to ignite and the delay while another was pulled out for fucks sake foxy not a fucking laugh get out of this fucking place and apply for the franchise to build a decent factory in these parts for the manufacture of goodquality matches by appointment to the ayatollah a business opportunity for fucks sake foxy the goon had a bad chest and had had also a bad wound much had been lost but not the logic the view foxy had of him was difficult through swollen eyelids the goon leaned on the table and gazed down at his prey seeming to consider how next to inflict pain and win answers the pages in the pad stayed clean the pencils unused logic told foxy that a military casualty was posted away and out of sight no army unit wanted disabled men hobbling about the garrison one had ended up with the work of overseeing the security of a bombmaker was posted in nowheresville off the map and forgotten good name for him backwater boy the backwater boy wasnt stupid was switched on enough to pick up whatever signs had been left for him he had made the trap and left it on a hair trigger foxy had gone into it led by his bloody chin logic said also that mansoor the backwater boy had been tardy in calling for backup and the big fellows from headquarters he wanted to book into the limelight courtesy of a prisoner and pages filled with confession he might have allowed vanity to cloud good sense but they would come in the morning theyd be there hed bought a little time but didnt see how he could buy enough needed a sackload of it questions who was he the struggling english with a pupils accent what was his name temper rising what was his mission and logic said because the big fellows were not already there that he would be sweating on his failure it didnt help him it achieved confusion and scrambled clarity foxy clung to his silence there didnt seem to be an alternative he couldnt believe that any crap about being a birdfancier an anthropologist or an ecoscientist would carry weight hed been caught floundering in darkness close to the home of a security target wearing a camouflage gillie suit designed for a sniper or for rural surveillance he didnt know for how long he could bottle the admissions not long he was naked except for his socks his arms were knotted behind his back a rope shackled an ankle to a wall ring he had wet himself and lay in a pool of it mucous stuff dribbled from his backside and among the mosquito bites and tick sores there were the new burn marks from the cigarettes the packet came out was shaken the filter ends bouncing up foxy cringed away and hugged the wall twisting his stomach to keep his privates from the goon he tried to remember what the man with the insignia on his arm the knife and the split barbed wire had said of resistance he could not and struggled and the filter went between the lips the matchbox was out foxy felt the scream welling he was pressed hard against the wall which gave him no sanctuary the match flared and the cigarette was lit the glow came the smoke billowed and foxy saw that the man panted with anger tiredness and frustration he came forward and the bad leg trailed on the floor there was rage in the eyes the man mansoor crouched there was no pity a big drag on the cigarette and the tip burned foxy didnt have the strength to fight couldnt worm clear the hand came low foxy screamed before the pain and the scream still had a voice when the pain flushed in him he didnt think the scream was heard and didnt care hed come late bad traffic on the road and a meeting that had overrun the rain had been sluicing on the path ellie had shrugged explained and he did what was asked of him shed told him where foxy had stacked the logs when theyd been delivered last august behind the garage and shed given him the basket to fill when hed done that shed told piers to fill the coal bucket from the bunker foxy had spent an afternoon putting together on the far side of the garage shed explained she would have done it herself but the rain had been so fierce the fire burned what had changed that evening was that his car was not down the side of the garage near the coal and out of sight from the lane hed told her hed have been half drowned if he parked where he had last night shed said it didnt really matter there was a meal for two from the supermarket on the table foxy didnt like precooked packaged meals and bitched if they were offered him and she hadnt cooked his supper the bottle had come from the wine store foxy kept topped up a pair of candles had been lit it didnt really matter if the noakes woman from down the lane walked her dog last thing saw the extra car and only a light on upstairs or if the davies man went out with his saw pierss car and knew she was being screwed it didnt matter ellie wasnt staying would she be going with piers setting up home with him maybe maybe not it was a decent chilean wine foxy rated chilean vineyards and said they were sensibly priced they ate and drank their tongues loosened the storm brewed and rain lashed twigs from the leafless trees were blown onto the slates and rattled as they fell to the paved path she said where she would be in the morning and that shed already phoned them at work pleaded the throat infection that was her most used excuse and hed asked whether they still bought it shed shrugged like it wasnt important piers asked you going to pack it in the job i might if you wanted out you could transfer internally i could end up at the same place like where edinburgh preston plymouth two wages wouldnt be a place this size youd be shot of him worth thinking about you could tell him whats he going to do bite your head off just tell him when she gazed at the front door and the wind rattled it for a moment she listened hard as if expecting the crunch of tyres on the gravel i might and i might not when when he comes back do you know how long itll be until dont know when hes back or where he is or why are we going to talk about him all night that what you want her eyes danced the candle flames lit them and she held her glass across the table he filled it and she raised it as if in a toast it seemed a waste to have lit the fire then abandon it she left the plates on the table and led him by the hand to the stairs she might stay with piers and she might not what was certain for ellie she would be on the pavement tomorrow mourning the homecoming of a hero it seemed important to be there each time as if it was a drug she was not ready to wean herself off it she took him up the stairs and he was pushing her they almost ran the last few strides into foxys bedroom had there been a fly on the wall it might have noted that len gibbons at a corner table of a restaurant down by the holsterhafen one bottle killed another damaged len gibbons said i just cannot credit it we set up a most successful operation and the whole thing is put at jeopardy because one of them is idiotic enough to go back to collect a microphone and some cabling im almost apoplectic we get back garbled an interpretation that says it would be unprofessional and against regular procedures to leave the gear behind does it bother the iranians if their dna is on the bombs that mutilate our soldiers today and have done for the last eight years of course not they couldnt give a toss one would have thought given a modicum of common sense that theyd have upped sticks and done the fastest possible runner but thats not the case result disaster the other is hanging about there cant do anything and should have hightailed it hours back i tell you whoever gets back from this is going to have their arse kicked the length of whitehall how could they do it to us and ill you something else my friends it wont be len gibbons faithful dog in her majestys darker affairs who takes the rap for it sorry to rant but i just cannot comprehend how such imbecilic things can happen well its what comes of using increments getting in casual labour so much work done and all of it wasted had there been a bug in the socket beside the table it would have been able to pick up and pass on the quieter tone of the cousin i would hesitate of course len to gainsay you but forgive me i will where are we were in lubeck also in the town or soon to be are herr armajan the bomb boffin and his frau now halfway to the other side of the world its the middle of the night and in some bog a group of peasant militia have their hands on a highimportance target they get on the phone are connected to some idiot manning the switchboard who knows his commander will kick his balls in if hes disturbed what im saying is that the local man will fail during the night to raise anyone of real import thats the way those places work some time tomorrow morning theres a possibility that it might land on the desk of a man who knows who armajan is where he is who is responsible for him very few in vevak will know and perhaps only one man in the embassy in berlin my analysis if we get close tomorrow well have a clear run in had there been a waitress who hovered at a table further out in the restaurant and who was blessed with sharp hearing she would have eavesdropped on the quiet voice of the man called the friend who said im more inclined towards the optimist than the pessimist the glass half full rather than half empty i think well have him tomorrow morning we go gentlemen and stake out were old men but a bad evening in lubeck is a good enough opportunity for old skills to be dusted off im confident well locate him and then the opportunity will present itself for the strike the morning tomorrow would be best i would like to say that its been a real pleasure to be a colleague of both of you if we travel tomorrow early there will be no chance of farewells i do it now gentlemen they went out into a bitter night one to go to roeckstrasse one to the medical school on the university campus and one to meet the ferry from telleborg to greet a man considered expert at his work they came to lubeck it had been a slow train with stops and the carriage had been crowded for part of the journey he had stood and she had sat for the first twentyfive minutes out of hamburg she had been sandwiched between a blackskinned girl who ate pastries scattering crumbs and managed to talk continuously on a mobile phone and a youth with orangedyed hair in a standing strip over the crown of his head the sides shaven metal rings in his ears and eyelids when theyd left the carriage the girl had brushed the remainder of the crumbs off her lap but the boy had said something politely that she did not understand as he had stepped over her feet she was exhausted he had looked for a lift to take her from the platform to the concourse but there was none and it had been a laborious effort for her to climb the steps the engineer had sufficient english to ask for the hotel at an information kiosk he said that the hotel into which he was booked with his wife was on lindenstrasse the woman had been filing her nails and looked at him as if he were an interruption she had pointed out where they should go and passed him a small map with the street heavily underlined his wife asked if they could take a taxi and he said it was on the map only a hundred metres or so they should have used a taxi she leaned more heavily now on his arm and the case squealed on its wheels there was sleet in the air and a thin film had settled on her shoulders and in her hair they passed a bench where a bearded old man sat with an opened bottle beside him then statues to wilhelm i and otto von bismarck he did not know who they were or why they were commemorated he looked again at the map and realised he had gone too far along the street and must turn to the right she sighed heavily blamed him they had to cross a major road but went with other pedestrians and then they were in lindenstrasse the hotel was an old whitepainted building he had expected something modern glass and steel he helped her up the steps and bounced the case after him they were at reception a girl was there young and blonde she wore a lowcut blouse and leaned towards him across her desk he sensed naghmehs recoil she queried his business there and he answered that he had a reservation she asked of course in what name in what name he turned away from her he felt a fool he had to reach inside his jacket pocket produce the czech passports flick one open and look at the name he should have memorised it on the first flight the second or third or on the train he grinned played the idiot and displayed the page of the passport that carried a name and his photograph both were taken photocopied handed back registration forms were given to them he said in his difficult english that his wife was not well he made a meaningless scribble on his form in the signature box and asked for the key it was given him with a sealed envelope they took the lift went along a corridor and heard tvs he unlocked the door it was an ordinary room with a double bed and a wardrobe a small desk and a television on the wall a door led to a bathroom with a walkin shower she looked around her and sagged in the hotel in tehran there had been a bowl of fruit and a vase of flowers because of who they were not here he opened the envelope as she sat heavily on the bed it was handwritten not signed on the hotels paper and said at what time they would be collected he checked his watch they had an hour and ten minutes to pass was she hungry she shook her head she lay down eyes closed pain seemed to cramp her he had created her exhaustion her loss of dignity because he could not face life without her her breathing was ragged the engineer found a magazine and read about lubeck what an old hanseatic trading city offered the visitor and where marzipan could be bought how long could he hold out two more cigarettes had been lit but he had seen at least another six in the packet he might hold his silence for the next and perhaps the one after that foxy didnt know how long his body would allow further resistance pain travelled from the burn points the cuts the bruising the splits and the wrecked gums to his brain the goon foxy realised was not trained he had no experience of the dark interrogation arts he understood only physical force and the infliction of pain but men would come elbow him out they would have the same skills as the interrogators from the joint forward intelligence team in basra whom he had sat alongside and done terp work for all the basics were used by the brit interrogators sleep deprivation stress postures hours under the hood that was a thick hessian sack made for sandbags slaps kicks and shrieking in the ears big proud men were broken by them as he would be foxy would be broken lose the resolve so what had all the pain been for might he not at the start have coughed who he was his name and mission he had bought time he didnt know how much more he could buy the man across the room from him exhausted breathed heavily his eyes were wide and bloodshot his fingers trembled and the wood shivered in his hand frustration obvious built in the goons head the next spate of violence would be uncontrolled aggression and foxy would suffer knew it but didnt know how long it mattered that his silence held when he had been the interpreter for the jfit people in basra he had never seen one of them show anger lose their cool he knew the routine questions silence beating and kicking silence burning knew it and waited for it how long did they need more than an hour more than one more beating and two cigarettes foxy couldnt remember what the gaunt little american with the hook for a hand had said or what was called a code of conduct with a prisoner he lay on the cell floor trussed roped to the wall and knew it was coming soon a bad beating and kicking and a burning a decision that only mansoor could make to give up on him and wait for the senior officers to come or to try one more time he had been exhausted and had spent time leaning against the table not sitting he had been brought a glass of juice by one of the basij peasants the guard had had no stomach for what he had seen the prisoner on the concrete floor and had vomited his last meal he had drunk the juice which had refreshed him given clarity to his thoughts the two guards inside the cell minding the door had not spoken during the long hours he thought they were terrified by what they had seen he knew they looked away when he used a cigarette to burn they did not interrupt the growing understanding he had when his mind cleared it was as if he had slapped his own face hard he was himself exposed he could have been naked lain alongside the man on the floor he could have been beaten and accused it was about the man he was tasked to protect clarity came in a burst a puzzle that had been obstinate slid into place so simple some who examined his actions might find it hard to credit that mere enthusiasm and vanity had led him to create circumstances where the prisoner remained in his custody and not in that of officers with experience and rank he was tasked to protect rashid armajan a man of great sensitivity he had pulled from the water an agent in a camouflage suit who offered no explanation and he imagined that the couple now travelled anonymously without a cordon of guards he thought he had put them at hazard perhaps killed them some would say suspicious men with the cold eyes of investigators that the denial of information about the capture was itself an act of treason he could go from the cell down the corridor and into his office slap on the lights and telephone to the crate camp garrison he could demand to speak first with the duty officer and then that the commanding officer from the alquds brigade be woken and brought to the telephone he would tell of an arrest made five and threequarter hours earlier a failed questioning and no message of such an important matter passed up any chain and a great sigh almost a sob of desperation he dropped the cigarettes onto the table pushed back the flap of the packet flicked the box of matches and reached for the wood mansoor believed that salvation for him lay with a confession from his prisoner then he would telephone the crate camp garrison and get the connection to the duty officer he steeled himself took rambling steps across the cell away from the table and towards the man on the floor the scream went to the marrow of badgers bones he looked again to the east away into the blackness of the night and did not see the dawns first softening he would not go until that early light signalled the days start until his death he would hear foxys screams never be free of them there would be even in a deniable world an inquiry like a fucking inquest and the questions would be asked by those who had never been in a shallow scrape covered with scrim net and watching the movements of the guard detail around the home of a target who made the bombs that killed the guys brought back through the wiltshire town likely the questions would be asked by those who had never gone without water when the thermometer hit degrees plus had never lain in a scrape and pissed into a bottle they would not know of a meeting of a landmine clearance group with a terminally ill woman who stood tall with courage and did not see small kids kick footballs and ride tricycles unaware that their mother would soon be dead but that their father would beat her to the grave they would know nothing but would demand answers to their questions wasnt your job constable to get sergeant foulkes into position then support him in every way possible and do the donkey work of extracting him you were aware constable that sergeant foulkes was nearly twice your age how was it constable that you permitted sergeant foulkes an older and less fit man than yourself to go forward to retrieve the cable and microphone did you not feel retrieval was your job did you constable pull your weight on this mission the shout came from deep in his chest rose in his throat burst from his mouth was silent and hurled towards the coots the ducks the marauding otter and the browsing pigs on the edge of the reed bed you werent fucking there if you werent there you dont know he would stay until dawn but there was no light yet no smear to the east chapter it was like an afterthought the goon mansoor paced a path back and forth in front of where foxy lay and lashed the wood against the wall once a guard had flinched away but had been belted on the shoulder and cried out the pacing had gone on the blows had been struck and paint chipped off the concrete then had come no warning the assault and a new level of violence different the lashing with the wood first not the questions he tried logic scrambled and confused to anticipate where the next show would strike him what part of his body foxy no longer had the ability to plot the patterns and he couldnt wriggle curl himself into the foetal position because the blows were random there was more blood and another tooth had dropped from his mouth the wood had to lash through the swarm of flies that now flew over him between each blow they came in to settle each time bolder on the newest wound how long he was hit across the cheek how long needed to be bought the little air in his lungs was knocked out he was bent and winded he remembered he was hit on his right kneecap then on the left ankle the beating had reached a frenzy and the goon grunted he saw light on the hook the hook had caught the sunlight that filtered through the windows and spread across the auditorium and foxy remembered the words of a code and no one in the room had taken seriously what was said there had been an almost audible titter laughter behind hands when the american had spoken of the code an awkwardness because each time the sere man had talked of the united states of america there had been a pause and then the sentence had been remade with united kingdom inserted where there had been american there was british it was resurrected he could focus on a sentence that survived the beating and the pain had it sharp i am british fighting in the forces that guard my country and our way of life i am prepared to give my life in their defence i will never forget that i am british responsible for my actions and dedicated to the principles that made my country free i will trust in my god and in the united kingdom some had said the man was naff others that he spoke crap one had stated the little guy had the relevance of a disney cartoon cutout more blows landed none of those who had sniggered were here and hurt not knowing how much time needed to be bought he had gone through too much to lose now the questions came different questions shouted what did he know about the engineer and his travel yelled did he know the destination of the engineer shrieked was he with mossad or the cia or the british agencies hoarse what had he learned of the engineer what had he reported they dinned into foxys head then there was quiet and he could hear the goon panting the two men by the door fidgeted barely breathed and the hush settled foxy couldnt say where in his body there was no pain he heard the strike of the match and it was repeated as if the first strike had not ignited the cigarette there was the rustle of the foil being loosened then the noise of the pack dropping back onto the table foxy knew there were more than two cigarettes in the pack and knew he couldnt survive and hold to the code if he were to be burned more than twice he cringed the men and women who had used him as a terp in the jfit team at basra had liked to say there was a certain way of breaking the strongest man the one most determined to fight the environment was where no hope of rescue existed or liberation but most important was that no sympathiser was on hand to witness and give comfort the degradation of aloneness broke men and women foxy couldnt feed off another prisoner no name necessary no prior contact required in an adjacent cell who went through similar hell he had no clothes to cover himself so his shrivelled penis and shrunken testicles couldnt be hidden he could scream with the pain of the cigarettes and no one would come so alone he remembered the little man who had told the guys how they should behave respond and had been there done it and survived and could recall the flash of light on the hook hear again the titters it was as if foxy reached out to the stunted guy hoped the hook would close on his hand and grip it the whiff of the burning cigarette was closer again and he awaited the pain there was blackness in the blackness no noise in his ears no cigarette smoke in his nostrils he couldnt see the glowing end coming closer to his stomach and the sense of time bought at such a price was lost you are iranian that is such a comfort to us we need comfort at home it is now past midnight and we were awake at five this morning had hardly slept three flights a train journey we are so tired it is a great comfort to know that we are with an iranian speaking our own language and meeting a man who has the support of important people are you from tehran or shiraz or perhaps isfahan we packed so quickly that i never thought to bring you something from home some cake or so that there is no misunderstanding i am now german i live in germany my wife is german i do not expect ever to return to iran but if you are born iranian you are always iranian and not one of the traitors the monarchists or we would not be here i do not understand what you should understand is that i too have had a long day i am tired as your wife is tired i do not want to sit here and gossip about life today in iran and how many demonstrations have been broken up this week by the basij how much tear gas has been fired by the guard corps in tehran this month and how many have been arrested on the university campus why are you seeing us because threats were issued and i feared for my family because the regime in which you no doubt have a senior position with influence is known in europe for its brutality and its long arm we do not whatever the blood connection of nationality have any bond other than that i am a man of medicine and your wife is to be examined by me you will guarantee the remuneration that is necessary under german practices the consultant turned to the wife he thought her an attractive woman but bowed with exhaustion and illness he reckoned her to be around forty he smiled and asked her quietly is there a name i can use i am naghmeh the man interrupted we have been forbidden to travel under our own names he said the smile hardening i could ask what is the nature of your work that prohibits the use of your own name but it would shame me you are not the patient your wife is naghmeh you have brought documents xrays yes his wife was about to answer but the mans intervention was faster we have the xrays from tehran from the university hospital and the most recent haemoglobin checks from the laboratory the name has been cut off but they are ours an envelope was passed the consultant did not open it but laid it aside on his desk they are giving you steroids to combat the headaches they increased the dose for her last month but last week when we went again to tehran they confessed they were not expert enough to offer further treatment and have they told you naghmeh what condition they believe you suffer from they have not told her they did a biopsy then told us that new procedures were not possible and he said would you the anonymous man wish to be afflicted with a brain tumour its about the size i imagine of a pigeons egg would you care for it to be inside your skull if not please allow your wife to answer when i address her you insult me in germany women are entitled to speak for themselves please naghmeh the procedure is this you show me no respect i speak to my patients with great respect and with little respect to those too frightened to give me their names the consultant feeling he was now steffen and not soheil was conscious of victory a cheap one he said naghmeh we will need to do more xrays and also an mri scan that is magnetic resonance imaging it identifies the hydrogen atoms that lie in soft tissue and will show what is there for that you go into a scanner and lie full length you do not move very important and will have removed all jewellery and metal objects we are told then what we need to know naghmeh i am being frank we will look and see i know my skills and what is beyond them there are two stages on the basis of what i find tonight i will know whether i can operate i may believe i can but i offer no guarantee of success if i decide to do so if i do not feel i have anything to give you i will tell you so with honesty they are waiting for you maria will escort you i assume naghmeh that you do not speak english or german she shook her head he tried to smile and reassure her why they came through his consulting rooms at the university in lubeck every week people who were frightened defiant clinging to some small hope and trusting in him why it was about the dignity of her face about courage and there was something of the madonna in her features as depicted in the statue that his wife and daughter knelt before each sunday during services at the marienkirche there was depth in her eyes and majesty he had no mother or anything of her to treasure beyond vague memories from when he was a small child a few photographs had been left behind in tehran and would now be lost he thought naghmeh was how he would have wanted his mother to be the nurse came took the wifes arm and led her out of the room the husband began to follow but was brusquely turned away by the nurse the door closed he said with aggression what work do you do in iran that warrants such secrecy or am i not to be told already he knew part of the answer the man did not have the stature of a soldier he was not old enough for high rank in the revolutionary guard corps and did not possess the chill in the eyes that the consultant presumed would be evidence of work in intelligence when he himself had spoken of mri scans and hydrogen atoms there had been no confusion on the mans forehead he was a scientist or an engineer my work is to ensure the successful defence of my country of our country the patient would be gone for threequarters of an hour the consultant sensed he kicked an open door nuclear work are you a builder of a nuclear weapon not nuclear chemical microbiological do you work with gases diseases no what is left what is so sensitive that you travel across europe with false papers and have no name with embassy people running errands for you what else is there my wife is a good woman obvious she heads the committee responsible for clearing minefields in the sectors of ahvaz and susangerd fine work he had not expected to confide was drawn to it the farsi bred confidence and suspicion ebbed my father and mother were killed during the recapture of khorramshahr they were together both doctors treating frontline casualties they were martyrs your wife does noble work and you the man hesitated the consultant had noted his fingers the stains he asked the man if he wanted to smoke accepted the nod there were days when he himself yearned for the scent of fresh tobacco smoke and led him out of the office past the empty desks of the support staff he took him to the back fire escape and let him out onto a steelplate platform a cigarette was lit and smoked sleet spattered their shoulders and ran on their faces what do you do a simple and unemotional answer i make the bombs that are put beside the road good bombs clever bombs i am told the countermeasures electronics are difficult that i am ahead of the american scientists and the british i am told i am the best i understand why you travel in secrecy then and have no identity to what purpose to be the best while my wife is dying you are right to go in secrecy without a name iraq and afghanistan more sophisticated in iraq but we teach the afghan resistance about basic devices there they do not need such advanced devices as i made for the iraq theatre my best work but i have influence on what is used in afghanistan and we see on the television many funerals in nato countries because of the bombs beside the road if they knew of you they would kill you do i approve disapprove of what you do i do not interfere in matters i cannot influence you should have no fear that i will allow any feelings to dictate my decisions concerning your wife thank you for allowing me to breathe the smoke the moon was at its height and there was good light over the clear ground badger caught two rats on the periphery of his vision extreme right side of the degree arc he was capable of when the moon went down past the horizon badger would take the two bergens and leave nothing to show he had been present a witness to the place the rats came from the reed beds to his right and straight towards him there were people who did not like rats and people who were scared shitless by them there were people who saw rats as vermin to be slaughtered badger did not feel strongly about them they scurried towards him and the one behind gave slight squeaking sounds he couldnt have said if it was twenty minutes half an hour longer or shorter since he had last heard the scream it had been weaker the last time the lights in the house were out but the security ones were lit there was no movement beyond the pacing of the two guards who watched the singlestorey building and another guard uniform and assault rifle who sat under a tree one more leaned against the outer door of the barracks he could see the guard at the door clearest because he was in the range of the most powerful light which beamed down from the lamppost they came towards him the smaller one greyer than the other came to badgers side skipped onto the small of his back and was over him and gone without a backward glance he had barely felt its weight the other had a more russet coat and a longer tail well scaled and as long as its body it was down to training that badger could observe and note every moment of an event that seemed at the time insignificant they said that in the world of the jihadists and of the highvalue targets in organised crime the little moments that seemed to hold no significance were those that might put a puzzle piece in place unlikely that there would be importance in the movement of a rat across his body but he noted it it came on a slightly altered track and had veered towards his shoulders it came onto badgers arm went over his armpit with a brief sniffing stop was on his right shoulder then the nape of his neck it paused there was close to his ear and there were the sounds faint of its breathing it went forward crossed the crown of badgers head and a claw seemed to catch in the netting of his headpiece it came down onto his forearms then his hands covered with camouflage cream which held the binoculars it stopped there he saw the glint of its eyes a yellowed amber perhaps it was aware at that moment of larger eyes watching it or felt the beat of badgers heart but it was not fazed it moved off him and went by the imageintensifier laid on the ground and was gone he had had many such encounters and the scream came it didnt matter to badger that the sound was even fainter than before he clutched the binoculars had nothing else to hold on to the rats together again were exposed on the open ground in front of him and the moonlight was on them the difference in colour was lost their size seemed to merge and the length of their tails badger could have sworn that both rats stiffened at the scream like it was a sound alien in their world he listened for the scream to come again shared the pain a little and he saw the faraway lights across the lagoon then his attention was taken by the rats they had found the carcass of the bird it was tugged between them and feathers flew he watched them maul and mangle it but another scream did not come he understood that he had fainted he had no sense of time gone his first image was of the bucket the goon held it swung it and the water doused him it would have been the second or third bucket because water cascaded off him towards a growing pool in the corner it was aimed at his head and came in a wall towards him splashing hard it went up his nose into his mouth and some forced a passage into his eyes which were slitted with the swelling foxy must have lifted his head an automatic reflex gesture not one he controlled his vision was distorted and although he looked up into the face of the goon he couldnt see the expression anger frustration panic that his prisoner might have croaked on him there was laughter foxy didnt know whether it was humour or manic a barrage of questions was thrown at him none new he didnt know how long his fainting had protected him the questions bludgeoned him but he had no chance to reply he thought the goon as weak as himself and the cigarette was on the table laid across the packet a match was out of the box and on the piece of wood he had been clubbed with he would have fainted as the cigarette was about to be lit as if he had been granted a stay because the pain was not worth inflicting if he was unconscious questions and their answers i am sergeant joseph foulkes of the metropolitan police service i am on a deniable mission put together by the secret intelligence service of great britain as an expert in covert rural surveillance i was tasked to observe rashid armajan the engineer i have a good working knowledge of farsi and deployed a microphone directed at armajans home i heard it said that armajan the engineer travelled to the german city of lubeck with his sick wife i relayed that information to my backup team who are across the frontier in iraq i do not have a schedule but in the next few hours an operation will be launched to kill armajan in lubeck i am told that the killing is justified because of armajans talent in constructing the electronics of roadside bombs they were the answers he had not given would give there was a threshold he saw the cigarette picked up the filter lodged in the goons mouth a match was raised and the box was lifted he had been to the threshold of pain and could not go there again through the swollen lids tears ran they would be in an officers mess after dinner had been served with drinks what i heard not for repeating we had their stellar ied boffin in our sights in europe after a clandestine operation on the iran border and that guy foulkes selfstyled surveillance wizard was captured interrogated only had to hang on a few hours keep his mouth shut but spilled the lot we didnt get the boffin which would have been worth popping corks for a variety of the theme would have passed between beds and cubicles in a ward at selly oak where the military casualties were cared for what i was told the bastard was damn near in the gun sight but this guy talked and in a gymnasium at the place south of london where they taught the amputees a degree of mobility he talked a good talk about himself but he spat it out and didnt give our people the time they needed that was what they would say and where they would say it the match flashed and the cigarette was lit the goon had taken a handkerchief from his pocket stained and foxy knew it would be used to wipe a place on his privates make it dry so that the cigarette was not extinguished by the water that had been thrown at him foxy did not cringe and didnt attempt to bury himself in the angle between the concrete of the floor and the cement blocks of the wall he knew the threshold would be crossed when he was burned everything he would say when the pain scorched his skin was in his mind the goon came close limp prominent and bent over him foxys arms were tied behind his back and his right ankle was fastened by rope to a ring in the wall he was very calm foxy was on his back and seemed to spread out his left leg it was as if he exposed himself further was more naked could not defend himself and was close to the cracking point the threshold and denial of the codes principles he needed only to be tipped the goon was over him damn little strength left and all of it so precious the bruising the cuts the burns the insect bites now infected and raw seemed less alive he flexed the muscles of his left leg the goon mansoor crouched and the handkerchief came down towards a place an inch or so above the hair at the pit of foxys stomach his skin was rubbed hard dried and smoke poured from the goons mouth the handkerchief went back into the pocket the cigarette was taken from the lips and went down towards the skin it touched foxy reacted didnt feel the pain not that time it took all of his strength and more from reservoirs he hadnt known existed any longer his leg came up straight then he swivelled as best he could on his backside the leg bent sharply at the knee and the impact pitched the goon over his weight would have gone onto the damaged leg and he stumbled the cigarette dropped he lost his balance and sprawled foxy locked him with his leg he had no weapon his arms were behind his back so he couldnt punch his ankle was roped so he couldnt kick he couldnt grapple with the goons belt or get to his throat he did the headbutt a young policeman called to closingtime fights in pubs and latenight brawls in the streets had learned that backstreet combat was with a broken bottle or the bone at the front of the skull he had seen it done and known of the pain it inflicted on hard men he held the goon close with his legs around the mans waist and slammed his head into his face he heard the squeal the pub and street fighters he had seen as a young policeman went for the nose foxy hit again and again the guards had come from the door and his ears were gripped the small of his back was unprotected and boots lashed the bottom of his spine for a moment the goons ear was close to foxys mouth it was hard for foxy to speak through the split lips swollen gums and the gaps where teeth had been he spoke in good correct farsi into the ear who is fucking your mother tonight mansoor who is riding her is there a queue round the block waiting to fuck your mother what do you do mansoor while your mother is fucking the street do you get kids to suck you off vile language learned well he was dragged clear and his face was hit his leg was bent back so that the goon could be pulled off him he knew those sentences in farsi by heart and had often spoken them it was under instruction by the interrogators of the joint force intelligence team when hed done terping that he had mastered the lines guaranteed to make an arab prisoner or captured iranian lose any vestige of cool the interrogators knew their work and foxy had seen its success many times the goon was on his feet he flailed his arms to drive back the guards his chest heaved and blood flowed from his distorted nostrils his feet stamped and the bar of wood was in his hand the first blow struck him foxy would have been at the threshold if there had been another cigarette and more deluged down on him he saw nothing in the cell the table was gone and the cigarette packet the matchbox the chair the guards at the door and the light in the ceiling there was darkness foxy no longer fought the beating he was overwhelmed and his strength had gone he saw at the last a man in a darkened street he wore a black frock coat and carried a top hat in one hand a cane in the other and walked proudly it was the last thing foxy saw and the mans head was lowered in respect still a good turn out is there doug he was asked they were lucky in his village to have their own british legion branch and the building was adequate in need of repairs but the fabric was sound doug bentley always came for a drink or three on the evening before a repatriation there were four beers in his round all lowstrength which reflected the ages of his friends he was standing and collecting the glasses to take them back to the bar they couldnt afford a paid steward any longer and it was accepted that glasses were reused not clean ones for when each drink was poured still plenty there its held up well third in a fortnight right doug from an old pioneer corps man he paused thats right the third its five have come through anyone want any crisps or peanuts my annie wont watch it from a paratrooper who had done cyprus and aden upsets her i used to watch regular but i dont now its bad enough seeing it on tv but it must be pretty difficult doug week in and week out for you i mean yes nuts thanks it wasnt talked about much in the bar it was in the early days but it had been running for three years now doug bentley had carried their standard for all of that time and no one else had jostled him for the job he didnt talk about it unless another raised the subject of bassett and the hearses coming up the high street he would have liked to share it more often not just with beryl and the opportunity yawned he took it its a damn sight less upsetting for us than for the parents and the grannies the brothers the nephews all the kids from the family one last week a woman cried her heart out all quiet except for her sobbing it went right through to your guts she was weeping her eyes out in the road we all felt it all of us in our line what i remember the week before was all the hands that were just laid on the glass of the hearse the nearest they could get to the coffin with the flag on it and that same one a big family and friends group had come over from the east of england an older man shouted well done boys for the two of them going through and others picked it up well done boys and they were all clapping it gets in your bones like rheumatism does i wouldnt miss it i say that in honesty im the crisps the bacon ones doug he was a veteran of suez artillery do they really like it being out there and having the world watching them nothing like that in our day were popped down out there seems unnatural to me like its a spectacle im not criticising you doug fair enough i was chatting with a sergeant from a unit last month and he said the military and the families appreciate people being there like its recognition could be called appreciation its whats said i tell you when they finish coming through bassett i dont know what ill do with myself right four pints one crisps and well have two nuts he went to the bar his neighbours thought it was morbid and had told beryl so him and her going off so regular on the first bus to swindon the second bus to wootton bassett and the long reverse journey while he was down at the legion the night before a repatriation she would be running the iron over his charcoal slacks to get a decent crease and brushing the shoulders of his blazer the one with the pay corps badge if shed time shed polish his three medals and before hed come out hed do his shoes so that they gleamed and put the whitener on his formal gloves last thing shed check there were no crumples in the black ribbon she tied with a flourished bow at the top of the standard pole his neighbours had empty vacant lives and nothing to lift them doug bentley thought himself blessed and also that a hole wide enough for a volcano to spew from would be left in his remaining years when the repatriations stopped coming into the lyneham base and the hearses no longer drove up the hill into the town he brought the drinks back to their table with the crisps and the nuts and the artillery veteran asked if there was time for a cribbage game and the paratrooper who had last jumped thirtynine years before said there was the pioneer corps man who had spent two years digging latrines on tank ranges in germany agreed then theyd all three looked at doug bentley for his opinion time for a cribbage game they had to nudge him hed been far away just down the high street from the cross keys waiting for the command to raise the standards and he said hed enjoy that len gibbons watched too many years since hed been in a long raincoat and a trilby hugging shadows in a doorway and listening it was enough to make a new man of him he saw the target the targets wife and the medical man they paused on the step and the sleet had eased he saw also the car across the width of the pavement close to the kerb the driver reached back and flicked open the rear passenger door the car had been there on a restrictedparking line all the time gibbons had been in place but the opening of the door and the flooding of the interior with light enabled him to see the driver hardly a taxing identification darkhaired swarthy stubble and a shirt buttoned to the throat without a collar the car an opel saloon and granite grey did not have corps diplomatique plates but gibbons reckoned it was an embassy vehicle he had of course done his discreet walk round the block the cafe across the campus street the car was all the security offered to the target and his wife he used a little of a veterans tradecraft he had good ears could hear catherine said every cat that came into the garden to scratch up the new bedding plants he wore a hearing aid it was a tip hed picked up from the provos they had worn them when their hit teams advanced on potential attack sites and needed to know if they were covered by military or police guns with an aid they could hear better when a weapon was cocked gibbons had borrowed one from the technical people in the basement annex it fitted comfortably and was good value it was said first in german as if the consultant made his point in that language then repeated in english but not in farsi the consultant had personally escorted them to the doorway and said i shall look at the mri and the xrays overnight tomorrow i can tell you what is possible and what is not please your appointment with me is at eight thirty you understand that i can promise nothing he was gone the target supported his wife down the one step and across the pavement then helped her into the car gibbons saw her face haggard and saw the targets numbed the door slammed the light was cut and the car drove away no ceremony incredible the lack of security the absence of a full escort astonished gibbons it told him that as yet the authorities had not reacted to a capture in the marshes extraordinary he didnt follow the car and had no need to know where the target would sleep that night he didnt want to test the professionalism of the driver and give him the opportunity to recognise a tail in place but it had been a satisfactory evening that nothing had blighted he had gained the knowledge that would facilitate a killing its location and time his step was almost jaunty as he walked to his own vehicle the cousin was across the street and low in his car it was near to the bus stop where parents were waiting for their youngsters to get back to roeckstrasse he attracted no attention he saw the big car symbol of an individuals triumph in his chosen field sweep off the road into the driveway the tyres scattering gravel the house was dark obviously empty and offered no welcome the car door was swung shut the breadwinner was home and no one greeted him that stirred a chord with an old warrior from the agency he was now most of the time out to grass and would only be dragged back not of course inside the langley complex when deniable work was called for in his own life before shed finally quit there had been times enough when he had come home late tired to find shed decamped to her mother her best girl friend her worst girl friend any fucking place he understood woman trouble couldnt live with them and couldnt live without them he saw the consultant who hadnt drawn the curtains or dropped a blind pace in a room on the ground floor and eat what looked like a slice of cold pizza he had no more there to learn the friend took the young man into the city parked near to the cathedral then invited him to walk had he had a good journey on the ferry he had had the weather been bad in the baltic not a problem how had he passed the long hours on the deck reading what had he read just a magazine that had settled the friends opinion that the spearcarriers of the state were best left to themselves and that banal conversation was meaningless both wore caps with deep peaks and both had scarves over their faces but that was natural in the cold cloaking the city that night with the threat of the first severe snowfall they went past the cathedral with its massive floodlit sharptipped spire the streets were narrow and old houses pressed close to them little side turnings went into brief culdesacs with small homes that might have dated back four centuries when his own country had been sand camels and migrant bedouin he did not tell the man that the apparent age of the streets they walked was bogus that the british bombers had come at the start of an easter feast and destroyed the city with incendiaries that lubeck had been rebuilt with care for its history they went by the modernised church of st anne a franciscan building and he stopped to gaze for a moment through an ironbarred gate that was unlocked and slightly ajar at the end of a paved path was the door to a brick building and above it a dull light burned he said it was the synagogue of lubeck and led the way at the door he rapped the knocker then pressed the bell feet padded noisily towards the door a bolt was drawn back a key turned sparse light fell on them and they were admitted to a wide hall the friend said anyone you see here is russian there are no german jews in lubeck only russians yeltsin sold the jews to the german government they are here and few speak german they have made another ghetto where we are the few who know you are coming believe you are a political activist of the jewish faith hunted by extremists and needing refuge a man will arrive from berlin later tonight and bring well he will bring what you need i will collect you in the morning what you do and how is for you to decide then we get the fuck out i shall be here at seven sleep well the caretaker an old man had directed them to an office where a camp bed had been left with two folded blankets and a pillow the friend touched the young mans shoulder it might have been a gesture of encouragement of support but that was so obviously unnecessary he had met in his life with the unit many men and women who killed for the state some talked incessantly others were silent as if their tongues had been torn out some were restless and fidgeting others coldly still all were touched by what they did altered not this young man there was a nod a murmur of thanks hebrew spoken then the back was turned as if an audience was completed the friend let himself out walked away down the street towards konigstrasse and the pension where he would sleep if it were possible he did not doubt the killer would sleep well on the collapsible bed with the wire frame and the wafer mattress harding said theyre back again maam and the numbers are building she answered with irritation ive eyes i can see in truth abigail jones could see little beyond the broken gate shadows flitted forward there was thin moonlight which gave the shadows a wash of pale colour the american had the best eyesight of them all and probably knew how many were armed with rifles or shotguns and how many had come back with clubs or the spears they used for fishing where the lagoons werent drained she should have apologised for her tone did not he did not seem to take offence maybe he understood how the tension swarmed in her head we could be getting into problems when the time comes to get out of here maam obvious at that time past midnight and well into another day she alone carried responsibility in this little corner of the world her sphere of influence she had responsibility for herself and the four men paid to protect her and for the situation further forward a black hole of information cut off from contact she had helicopters on standby that could be utilised once only she couldnt call up the station in baghdad and request guidance sorry abigail dont know what youre talking about thats nothing thats flown across my desk what to do the best you can and neither could she make a sat link with london and the towers call her home desk im just the lowly minion the night duty officer and im not permitted to contact your hdo before local anything i can help with or will it keep for the next seven hours and she could hardly raise len gibbons likely in germany and leading the charge on a target no way i can contribute abigail because youre there and im not which means your judgement will be the one that counts im sure whatever decision you take will be the right one and will stand up to scrutiny if she asked for the advice of corky or shagger or went to hamfist and dropped the matter in his lap if she looked up into hardings face and asked what she should do she would lose authority if theyre in the way when we need to get out well go over or through them whichever he shrugged acceptance these men were happiest when told what to do and when they would drive hard and shoot straight and it would be for her abigail jones to face the wrath of the aftermath fuck it the problem was that the money had been handed over and had bought a few hours but not enough the radio stayed silent and she had no word from forward the other side of the border she could rail stamp blaspheme and swear but the radio stayed quiet the number of men from the marshes now outside the gate had increased through the night and by the morning they would again be boxed in and the dollar bills were exhausted it had been a short window and they hadnt used it fuck it was about the best answer she could muster if thats what you want to do maam thats what well do she smiled grim settled then harding one of your rangers told me when i first came here that his father had been with a paratroop unit of the south vietnamese army and had done time as an adviser in the central highlands the old guy had told his son that what made the early days there comfortable was the certain guarantee that if he had been wounded or killed heaven and earth would be moved to lift him out on a stretcher or in a bag might take the services of a platoon that needed reinforcing with a company that then had to call on a battalion to be moved and a flight of helicopters with a wing of air support whatever it took it was available and the guys on the ground knew it so they were comfortable i cant go and get foxy and cant go as far as badger likely is but ill sit on the extraction point for him and well move before dawn whether ive heard from him or not like i said over or through them a coffee would go down well it was fraying might already be unravelling ill get you a coffee maam and we can he interrupted her almost kindly like he tried to share but could not packed and ready to burn some rubber well go when you say maam hang him up like a pig hang him high the officer gave his order he thought his men barely recognised him not long before he had led the killing of the arabs who had crossed the frontier in search of abandoned military material and his men from the ranks of the basij had shown no hesitation or emotion in shooting then digging the pits they were frightened of him now he was down on his haunches and his back was against the wall the prisoner was on the far side of the table and chair he realised that so much would have confused them why were senior men from ahvaz not here why had they not been given custody of the man why had the man been beaten so savagely that he lay prone unmoving why was the top sheet on the notepad clean and the pencil laid neatly beside it why did they not know who they had captured and why had they not been praised for the success of their efforts why did their officer hug the floor and the wall his head bowed he was panting in spurts and he clasped his hands together but could not stop them trembling why the enormity of what he had done engulfed the officer mansoor he did not turn towards the men who crowded in the doorway get him out hang him up they hesitated all of them not merely those who had guarded the doorway would have heard the prisoners screams and his own shouted questions the thudded blows with the wood and the water splashed from the bucket the basij were the arm of the regime they broke up demonstrations against the authority of the state they made the cordons on arrest operations they kept back the crowds at executions they enforced the edicts on dress and music they hesitated to go close to the man mansoor did not know who he was the man wore no chains no rings his one boot had no label and the one in his underpants had been cut out only at the end had he spoken and then with such insults that his head was on his knees and he recognised the enormity of disaster brought on him by his loss of temper the man prone terrified them his hands scratched at the wall his fingernails gouged the plaster over the concrete blocks and he pulled himself upright he went past the table and kicked the chair from his path he stepped over his prisoner and did not know if the chest moved but he saw no bubbling in the blood at the mouth he could not look into the mans eyes because the swelling above and below had closed them as he bent to reach past the man and loose the rope from the ring on the wall he saw the wounds and bruises he had inflicted the scars of the insect bites and the sores that ticks had caused the man had destroyed him he felt almost wonderment a confusion his face was very close to the mans and he murmured the question he needed answering more than any other why did you come to this place which is nothing why were you here why was it worth it for you he freed the rope dragged on it and the man slid across the floor through the blood urine and water on his back and buttocks his other leg was bent but he did not cry out mansoor threw the end of the rope into the doorway where it was caught by a guard and gave his order again the body was heaved past him and jammed in the door it was freed and then had gone down the corridor he slumped again and his hands held his head badger watched perhaps the coots did too the frogs and the pigs he hadnt slept eaten or drunk he had been without sleep food and water for more hours than he could calculate he was close to delirium on an edge they brought foxy out there were two on the rope and they went at a good pace foxy bouncing along behind them they had come out of the main door into the barracks and had turned towards the water they went into the pool of light thrown from the high lamp when a stone caught at foxys shoulder or hips and he got stuck he was kicked free by those who flanked him if his trailing leg snagged he was kicked again badger saw it through his binoculars so he lived with each jolt of foxys head one of those who followed kicked at foxy whether he was caught or not another bent every three of four paces to scoop up dirt and pebbles then threw them hard at foxys face badger with his lenses could see the wounds the cuts and the drying blood he could also make out among the scabs the red marks where the skin had been burned now he knew why foxy had tortured the dark with his screams of agony he looked for the goon for mansoor he didnt understand why he too had not come outside but badger on the edge of control understood little the rope was thrown up and looped over the arm of the lamp a strip of ironwork welded to the main pole its free end was caught tugged down and a gang of them took the strain foxys head bounced a last time in the dirt then the body was up and clear the light shone on the ropes knot around his ankle and onto the leg that took the weight the other hung angled and crazily the arms were loose in the shoulder sockets and the wrists brushed the ground he turned slowly gently badger watched he watched for more than a minute and saw some of the guards punch the body or kick at the head he waited until their tiredness took over and they drifted back towards the barracks the shadow under foxy turned slowly then went back on itself badger went to the bergens and took from them what he would need it did not seem to be a matter for debate chapter he had sent the message then again switched off the kit he had no wish to be burdened with an inquest he went into the water the gillie suit billowed out and the cool settled on his legs and stomach he had done what he hoped was sufficient to protect the glock and the four magazines he had taken from the bergens and had sealed them in the plastic bags that the mealsreadytoeat had been packaged in the gas grenades and smoke were in other bags and all were knotted tight the moon did not now have far to fall and sent a spear of light across the lagoon there was a place near the far quay where it merged with another duller strip the silver and lustreless gold met and sliced through each other near to the quay and about midway between the house and the barracks the moonlight was stronger and uninterrupted but the high lamps was broken by the shadow always spiralling of the shape suspended from a rope badger left behind him on the far side of the clear ground the bergens and the craft ready and inflated he went into the water beside the wrecked carcass of the bird the rats had left nothing worth returning for he waded the first few paces and was soon up to his chest in water the weapons ammunition and grenades under the surface and deep in the suits poachers pouches he had tried to evaluate what was ahead of him wasted effort it mattered little there might be a company of infantry equipped with modern gear all fed watered rested and alert dug in with slit trenches and sandbagged sangars between the quay and the high lamp from which foxy was suspended he was on the move because he was obligated it was no big decision for him to retire do nothing to turn his back on foxy rotating in the light breeze from the rope he didnt consider it he came to the mud spit lay on his stomach and used his elbows and knees to propel himself over the open ground past the small mess of leaves branches and dirt that he had used as the hiding place for the microphone he allowed himself a brief thought that it had been well done the arrival of the bird the beautiful leggy creature that had so entranced the goon officer had probably fucked them if the goons attention had not been on it where he must have seen something a flash of light off the gear or a kink in the cable they would have been out clear and gone he went down again into the water ducks came from the dark to his left were spooked by him and stampeded across the water struggling for liftoff the noise seemed loud enough to rouse the dead but they were up away the ripples subsided and the dented silver and old gold lines of the reflections calmed the bed of the lagoon seemed firmer it might have been an old waterway and the bottom was settled weathered down while he was within his depth he made good progress badger had no idea whether he would be able to wade or have to swim the natural light was good and he could see well of course he could also be seen he moved steadily and left a wake behind him badger would have appeared had he been seen while he waded or swam as detritus that floated on gentle currents he kept away from the lines of light thrown by the moon and the lamp through the scrim netting of the headpiece he looked hard for the guards their positions their readiness one was near the house close to the front entrance and illuminated by the security lights in his view was the short pier to which the dinghy was tied another was sitting on a plastic chair by the entrance to the barracks rigid and upright his head was still as if in shock and he was heavybuilt badger thought he was the one who had kicked foxys head as theyd pulled him across the dirt he hadnt seen the goon emerge from the building another guard was further to the right from the barracks close to the raised bund line that bordered the lagoon police lectures on surveillance in siege situations emphasised that the numbers of hostagetakers must be logged why because the germans had screwed up big during the munich olympics and a lesson learned from mistakes of thirtynine years before were still valid the point was that german police on the walkway in front of the israeli team house in the athletes village had seen the palestinians in doorways and windows and politicians had gone inside the house but no proper count had been made of how many guys were there with their assault rifles the rescue plan was based on the premise that there were four armed men but when the helicopters brought the athletes and their arab captors to the military airbase where the shootout would happen it was realised that there werent four targets to neutralise but eight a recipe for a screwup badger had counted three guards outside which meant there were five more inside and the goon important strategies played in his mind the first dawn light would come soon an otter swam alongside him ten or a dozen feet away for a halfminute and showed no fear of him but then dived and he saw it once more fifty or sixty yards away after it dived the second time he didnt see it again coots skirted him but didnt bluster away it was good that he could walk on the bottom badger imagined there had been trade through here a century before and a crossing point at the frontier for pilgrims and traders smugglers and traffickers that was why the quay had been built but then the waterline would have been a yard higher lapping near the top of the structure the light on the water was brighter the silver and gold mixed he moved more slowly he now tested each step so that he didnt slip and splash if the level was up to his lower chest he crouched in the water and only his headgear would have been visible he could see foxy clearly the free leg was bent at the knee askew at the hip and seemed to wobble as if with spasms of life and the blood had dried on the wounds it was what he might have called like the retrieval of the microphone and the cable the rules of the trade it was not about emotion he would never have said he was fond of the old bastard that he had enjoyed foxys company he went under no warning took a step and plunged the water was in his nose his throat and his ears he couldnt thrash darent darkness was around him and the cool of the water was on his face he went down further the weight of the suit dragging him pain built in his chest and he tried to come up there was light he gasped and trod water none of the guards had moved or shouted foxy turned on the rope when miss when we have some light abigail jones answered shagger it was the third time he had asked the question and been rewarded with the same answer it was with increasing concern that harding hamfist corky and he had watched the crowd of young men growing at the gate five minutes before corky had revved up the lead pajero and gone onto full beam the headlights had lit the crowd it was predetermined that corky would drive the front vehicle hamfist the second both had plotted how they would get through because there seemed to be junk wood pallets an old refrigerator some rusted oil drums blocking in the road thank you miss were ready when you want it nice to know she said evenly brutally they had no more cash to shell out they didnt have a hundred dollars between them and might have needed a thousand to get shot of the place not yet but soon she swivelled turned away she thought it was too early here they were boxed in but had the freedom to go for a breakout could drive hard and straight to hell with what they hit a barricade or a host of shouting men but if they were too early at the extraction point they would be stuck on a raised road with nowhere to go except back because in front was the border a bleep on the machine in her inside pocket it was repeated she hauled up her robe flashing ankles knees and thighs had a hand in the pocket and the machine out more bleeps and she was all thumbs and almost cut the connection the screen showed the message gone forward to get foxy then pushing for home nothing else she had gone back to transmit had powered in the necessary codes that did the scrambling and been rewarded with the ongoing whine that said the recipient of her call had switched off she had stood in the darkness and howled in frustration like a hyena or a wolf was she any more of a lunatic for howling than her jones boys unlikely theyd have understood they wore their tshirts with the bands logo and were a brotherhood theyd have known why badger had sent the message then refused to accept any call that might query it theyd be rooting for him and abigail there had been a depth in the eyes a sort of abyss and going far she said she hoped they would go come hell or high water in an hour and it would be a few minutes before dawn shagger left her she would be under the gun and care of corky while he went back to the pajeros to tell harding and hamfist that they wouldnt move for at least an hour if they made it out if they would disperse that evening dawn the next morning at the latest she doubted that ever in her life again would she recapture moments such as being with badger fighting off the marsh people at the oilexploration compound negotiating with the sheikh running agents across a frontier knowing them to be condemned by their greed and seeing the two figures move off towards a hostile frontier to have been responsible and to have waited too long outside the golden hour for their return it wouldnt happen again there would be a junior at basra sent down from baghdad who would collect the gear and spill out the advances on salaries for spending money another guy would be there from the security outfit and the jones boys tshirts would go into a bin as first stop on a journey to the incinerator then theyd split she had lived with them for many months most of a year and there would be a brisk embarrassed handshake a little formal then shed be gone it didnt matter if it were with badger and foxy or if she was alone theyd be on another flight to qatar and then a shuttle to the gulf hamfist would go to his room with sixpacks and drink himself insensible in private corky would shop for rubbish and send parcels costing a fortune in postal charges to the woman in colchester with the elevenyearold son and the woman in darlington with the fiveyearold daughter shagger would walk on the beach and look at the sea ring his bank to check out what he was worth eat fast food and spend as little as he could harding would be in a sixstar hotel in a room with the curtains drawn against the sun he would sit on the carpet in a corner and shiver they did not any of them do ethics they did the job she would miss them would never fill the hole theyd leave for her in common they were all rootless playing at soldiers refusing the advance of age they were counterfeit she loved all of them shagger was back all done miss in an hour go for a broke and find what we can whatever you say miss its a shit world shagger same as before miss whatever you say they would have to fight their way out to get to the extraction point she made a further call had the connection and voiced fears they sat fully dressed on the bed the engineer said he seemed an honest man his wife said a decent man a man to be trusted without arrogance he did not treat us merely as customers i was rude to him and will apologise tomorrow will be the start of the future and we may believe again how will we sleep waiting for a verdict we are in gods hands always it is a long night a smile rueful and almost brave for the children it is tomorrow and soon for them it will be the time we go to see him to be told you should eat the man from the embassy had brought them back to the hotel in lindenstrasse near to the hauptbahnhof he had seen them to their room his eyes had roved over the interior and hed glanced dismissively at their luggage at what she had unpacked then he had gone to the window flicked back the curtains examined the vista and drawn the curtains again he had remarked that they should not stand there with a light on behind them and look out the engineers wife knew nothing of security matters why she asked he had rolled his eyes at the engineer as if he expected him to educate his wife they should not leave the hotel during the night should not be out of the room unless a matter of urgency demanded it a fire alarm ringing they should not answer the telephone or make any calls then he had left them he would have been the engineer believed from vevak a man used to exercising authority most would have been fearful of him the engineer dealt with such men most weeks of his working year he was called the kalashnikov the nobel and doubted that a bureaucrat from vevak had ever been so praised he said i will make a proposition naghmeh if you will listen to it we will go home she said we will finish this and go home you will not listen not now not ever if the physician tomorrow tells us he is not a miracle worker we start for home in the afternoon should he be blessed with the skills we will stay for the operation i will convalesce and we will go home the first day he allows me to travel i will hear nothing else yes of course we will go home whatever time is left to me to our children our family our work yes i will not listen to any proposition other than that i can go home tomorrow or when it is permitted a church clock chimed the sound muffled by the double glazing of the window and the drawn curtain he was sure he could have picked up the telephone and in his halting english asked the reception desk to patch him through to the american consulate likely to be in hamburg or the british he could have made his pitch but he lacked the courage facing her across the bed to make the proposition he smoothed the bed and saw her wince he switched off the bedside light lay back on the bed and held her neither would sleep that night he was at the side of the quay it had been hard not to splutter and cough up water the rope sang almost a moan as it twisted under the strain of the weight the dousing under the water and the struggle to regain the surface had cleared badgers head purging the exhaustion he was alive to what he would do first he had moved slow steps on the bed of the channel which was littered with stones broken concrete and ironwork to the outer end of the pier he had ducked his head keeping his mouth and nostrils above the water and had loosened the knot that held the dinghy to a prop supporting the piers planks he had laid the bag with the glock and the magazines on the single wood seat he had worked his way along the length of the pier under it then had been against the side wall made of rotting timbers and concrete blocks he had allowed himself brief glimpses over the edge had raised his head high enough to catch snapshots the three guards hadnt moved foxy hung from the lamppost and turned in the slight breeze he did not see the goon or any more guns ahead there was silence behind him he heard the night sounds of the birds their splashes in the water and the incessant frogs croak he coiled himself his hands went down into the pouches and took out the plastic bags he prayed that the water had not saturated the grenades a post held the timbers in place and had been sawn off some inches above the top of the quay the high lamp left a small space of dense shadow beside the post he stacked them there the grenades and the shortblade knife he coiled himself tighter his hands on the top of the quay he would be fifteen or twenty feet from where foxy hung fortyfive or fifty from the guard who sat by the door into the barracks that would be the closest weapon to him and there were two others within two hundred feet that had a killing range of more than a thousand feet behind the entrance to the barracks men would have rifles close by badger recalled what military people had told him on the brecon mountains in wales he had been with paratroops in the heather gorse and bracken of woodbury common south devon he had been with marine commandos he had done surveillance on them to challenge his own skills he had won their respect and they had talked to him late at night in their bivouacs they were attack troops and he was a croppie a voyeur who should not get involved the message paras and marines preached rare for them to agree on something was that an assault would always achieve shortterm aims if launched at ruthless speed with the devastating factor of surprise it had hardly seemed appropriate to a guy who made his living by moving with a stealth that did not disturb wild creatures attuned to danger what are you badger murmured foxy youre a stupid bastard he loosed the spring he had bent his knees straightened them and in the same movement had heaved himself up with his arms his knees landed hard on the quay water cascaded off him and more sloshed in his boots he tried to run fast straight but his movement would have been that of a shambling bear and he was huge and widebodied in the gillie suit he threw the first of the grenades the flash and bang which did the stun job and saw it fly forward as the guard fell back in his tilted chair then pitched sideways he had dropped his weapon there was bright light white and with it came the deafening noise that ripped through his headpiece under the scrim he reached the door and the guard was on his side clutching his head badger threw two more flashandbangs into the hallway and followed them with two gas ones if theyd done their job they would have deafened blinded induced vomiting and put up a smokescreen that men would hardly want to charge through another gas went towards the guard who had sat close to the house he hurled two more flashandbangs in the direction of the man beyond the barracks towards the elevated bund line he himself had some protection from the scrim that dripped water and covered his face enough he didnt know would find out soon he kicked the weapon away from the guard at his feet who was trembling and heard volleys of screaming in terror from inside the barracks he turned his back and ran shambled towards the lamp you know what you are foxy ill tell you an idiot the hands hung a foot or a foot and a half off the ground the head level with badgers waist foxy was a bigger man than himself not even on tiptoe could badger reach the rope knotted to foxys ankle nothing to step on so he jumped he caught the leg he had the knife in his hand and sawed hard at the rope he didnt know how long he had seconds not minutes the gas inside the barracks would be good but the one he had thrown towards the guard by the house would drift and thin and the blindness from the flash would be shortlived seconds left and he had no free hand to throw more grenades he saw the rope fray there was shouting might have been the goon the officer or one of the older guards they fell he was on top of foxy and foxys body took the weight of his fall but the wind went from his lungs and he had to gasp bloody idiot you are nothing else almost slapped foxys face badger tossed the last grenades a smoke one towards the barracks one flashandbang in the direction of the house and the other towards the last guard who had been outside he hoisted foxy onto his shoulder in the firemans lift and staggered badger couldnt run he managed a crabbed trot but not in the straight line that would have gone direct to the pier it seemed to him that he went slowly and his back was exposed he didnt weave because he sought to break a riflemans aim but because of the weight of the man the idiot and foxy was a stupid bastard he expected to hear the drawl put him down counter him with contempt but heard only the shouting behind he went down the pier he dumped foxy he dropped his shoulder and let foxy fall into the dinghy the impact shook the craft and water splashed into it as it rolled he pushed it away from the pier and went into the water which was at his waist reached across snatched the glock that was under foxys back and pulled it out he had the twine at the front end of the dinghy in his hand and struck out best foot forward he couldnt have said how long it was till he was beyond the flood of light from the high lamp when the first shots were fired at him not aimed but a wild volley on automatic then he was out of his depth and used the side of the dinghy to support himself kicking with his legs and paddling with his hand a fine bloody mess youve put us into foxy idiot there were more shots and two came near water spouted in front of the dinghy badger groped behind him didnt turn he found foxys hand took hold of it squeezed the glock into the palm and told foxy he could help he could either shoot back or he could use his hands to propel them they had reached a fair speed now and there must have been a suspicion in badgers mind of hope he thought his aim would take them close to the mud spit where the bird had been and across or around it then theyd hit the shallow water and wade through it get over the open ground and reach the inflatable and the bergens andthat was a lifetime ahead there were no shots from behind him in the dinghy but that didnt bother badger and he thought foxy would have enough nous experience to shoot when required to he knew it would not be long before organisation was regained behind him he stamped his feet to get a better grip but the water was up to his chest and the bed below him was mud itll be bad bloody foxy when they get it together how did you get me into this dont sulk on me he could see the spit and it wouldnt be long before they were organised with boots fists and the butt of his rifle mansoor drove his basij peasants out of the barracks and onto the quay it mocked him he was an officer of the alquds brigade a veteran of undercover operations in occupied iraq he had been wounded in the service of the islamic republic and bore the scars of it neither his rank nor his experience could alter the enormity of what he saw it laughed at him it was a length of rope with untidily cut strands that hung from the lamppost it was well lit and the wind stirred it a metre above his head there was more than a slashed rope to mock him the pier away to the side where the dinghy should have been moored jeered at him too lashing furiously around him mansoor created a fear of himself that was greater than the fear brought by the grenades he beat his authority into them and broke off only once he had gone into the communications room made the link sucked in the air to give himself courage and reported that a prisoner had escaped that his barracks was under attack from a specialforces unit that had now retreated towards the iraqi frontier he and his men had beaten off the assault but the prisoner believed a casualty had been taken he had cut the link and gone back outside his eyes wept and his hearing was damaged but the scale of the catastrophe inflicted on him ensured that mansoor regained control it could not have been otherwise if he sank into a corner and shivered he would be hanged as a traitor he punched hard kicked hard hit his men hard with the rifle butt his voice was hoarse from bellowing and he rasped instructions the jeep had come forward and he had to swing the wheel because the driver cowered from him when the vehicle faced out into the lagoon and the headlights were on full beam he could see the low outline of the dinghy and a slight wake drifting from it the outline was visible on the extreme edge of the light thrown by the vehicle the shooting was ragged the basij as mansoor knew could not have hit a factory door with rifle fire at a hundred paces there were the austrianmade steyr sniper rifles which had been purchased by the irgc and the copy of the chinese longrange weapon that was in turn a copy of the russian dragunov the iranian military called it the nakhjir but mansoor had no marksmans weapon in the small armoury he had only the shortrange assault rifles they emptied a magazine each in the direction of the dinghy he snatched at one took it from a guard he had seen how the resistance inside iraq fired when at the edge of accuracy he wedged himself against the lamppost there was no optical aid to the rifle sight only the forward needle and the rear v for him to aim through he did a calculation and set the sights range at two hundred metres squinting mansoor could see the dinghy he thought a naked arm was draped over the side and made furrows in the water adding to the wake but he couldnt see the man who propelled it away he twisted the lever went from automatic fire to single shots it would have been a difficult shot with a steyr or a nakhjir with an assault rifle it would be worse than difficult he had not fired seriously on a range watched by an expert instructor since before he had been sent to iraq he struggled to remember old lessons of grip and posture the settling of weight his breathing slowed and he began to squeeze the trigger bar old memories died hard he could recapture with extreme concentration everything he had been taught on the range used by the alquds elite outside ahvaz but mansoor was no longer a member of that elite the special forces his body was damaged he had not slept and his temper was torn single shots three the first was short the second wide no more than two metres wide and two metres short and the target was a dark low hazed shape he had to squint to see it with any clarity he believed that the third shot bucked the shape of the dinghy and that it reared a little more orders more blows and kicks he put his men into the two jeeps their lights speared off past the barracks as they headed down the track towards the elevated path of the bund line flanking the lagoon he reckoned he had scored a hit that the jeeps would take him past their flight line that he would block them it was the town that had shaped len gibbons made him the man he was not the man the neighbours saw on a weekend morning when they walked their dogs pushed prams or promenaded on the culdesac off the railway line between motspur park and epsom he sat in his pension room on alfstrasse with the lights off and the curtains open he had worked the small easy chair close to the window the drunks had dispersed and the lateevening stallholders had cleared up and gone he had used this lodging house on recommendation from a secretary in bonn when he had travelled north to the town on the business of antelope and had usually been in this room with the same pictures hung over new but similar wallpaper the same chest and wardrobe but a more modern chair he would have looked out over the same view the same towers on the great church to the neighbours in the culdesac all of whom knew catherine well and expected to speak to her if she was out at the front gardening or unloading the ecobags she took to the supermarket he would have seemed a remote sort of man distant with little conversation but harmless he might have been washing an unspectacular japanese car using an electricpowered mower on the small patch of grass beside the path or retouching the paintwork he passed the time of day with them and would smile at their dogs or their children his conversation would range over the state of the weather the reliability of the trains into london and the price of fuel what did he do they were accountants salesmen teachers hospital staff widows who stayed at home and retail workers him some dreary job in london it was never quite explained whether that meant work and pensions or environment food and rural affairs but that was enough to satisfy them and reason for him to be away on an early train on monday and back late on friday most would have thought it sad that old gibbons slaved away at the expense of leisure and entertainment and most would have felt sympathy for catherine who existed alongside such a dull man with so limited a horizon his suits were grey unremarkable and bought from a chain and his ties were those given him at christmas what did they know the neighbours and the casual friends of his wife they knew nothing neither did the mass of those going to work each day in the towers have a more comprehensive profile of him some had made hobbies of archaeology or bellringing or whist or did convoluted jigsaw puzzles and thought themselves fulfilled len gibbons successfully lived a local lie well hidden from view there was a restless energy in him that a few recognised and some utilised now it contemplated without qualm the killing of an enemy the schlutup fuckup in this town had marked moulded and fashioned him he was a man in the shadows but possessed of a ruthless determination he sat in the chair listened to the great clocks of lubeck he did not think of the prevailing weather or commuter train timetables the cost of petrol or holidays he did not think of how catherine would be that evening or whether his son and daughter prospered at their different colleges he considered instead all that had been done to guarantee the death of a man he thought enough was in place had they known the work of len gibbons his neighbours might have wondered if conscience afflicted him if that night in the certain knowledge of what would happen later in the morning at his own hand removed but culpable he would find sleep hard to come by the neighbours did not know the man living at the mocktudor semidetached home in a safe corner of suburban south london any thought of conscience had been gouged out of him when he had worked in this town listened to the chimes and handled antelope no second thoughts hesitation what mattered was not the snuffing out of a life but the effectiveness of his work and the satisfaction that would come from a job well done there had been brave words in the damp heap overlooking a scottish sea loch but they had been for the benefit of the outsiders the big picture was wiped and the little picture was paramount it showed a man with his wife coming across a pavement on the campus of the universitys medical school and another man closed on him it was the limit of the picture and he was not troubled by it he could have slept had he cared to the marienkirche was a principal church in lubeck rebuilt with extraordinary dedication and skill after the war the great bells shattered and lit by a single candle that had plummeted down from the spires were off the main body of the nave they had been there when he had come to lubeck thirty years before and they would still be there they were supposed to grip the visitor by the throat and condemn the atrocity of violence gibbons didnt care what would happen later that morning neither would the crews of the wellington and stirling bombers who had made the firestorm brought down the bells and filled mass graves have been troubled he sat alone and watched the skyline and his phone with the encryption software bleeped not sarah asleep no doubt on a foldaway bed but the cousin he glanced at the little screen something about exfiltration in hand he cleared it infiltration and exfiltration were history the job had moved on for a moment gibbons tried to remember the faces of the two men but could not and gave up they were from the past not the present and did not affect the future he smiled to himself he had decided where he would be in the morning when the strike went home low voices alerted him he didnt understand the speech but thought it was russian there was a light knock on the door he came off the bed slipped on his trousers went to the door and opened it the synagogues caretaker shuffled away framed in the doorway a man gave a warm smile and had a large old leather bag hanging from his shoulder a hand was offered he took it he had never met the man and offered a formal greeting that betrayed nothing the man spoke in their own tongue used the word that in their language meant engineer and smiled again he had a light tuneful voice the transport would be outside at seven that morning in four hours gabbi nodded there would be the two of them for the wheels and the hit not five not ten or twentyfive a sneer curled the mans lip it told gabbi that this one from berlin station had had no dealings with the unit in the dubai business he was shown a photograph taken in poor light and it was explained that the woman was the engineers wife the shirtsleeved man was the neuroconsultant in the foreground of the picture there was a car with a rear door open he was told the registration number and make that only one security man was used for the escort he looked hard at the photograph and saw the face eyes the shape of the spectacles the cut of the hair and the clothing and memorised it his hand never touched the photograph and when the mans fingers held it gabbi made out the fine texture of the latex gloves he wore it was assumed that the entry of the engineer his back to the street would be a difficult interception but when he left it would be an easier shot into the face and stomach then the man shrugged as if he had realised he should not presume to lecture an expert in techniques on the likely schedule he would be on the return sailing of the ferry in late morning he had faith in the arrangements woven around him and did not query them gabbi was asked if he was comfortable he said he was did he need to know more about the target why the target was identified he did not was he satisfied with the arrangements in place he was anything he needed would be brought to him gabbi said he had found a book of drawings by a girl who had been a witness inside the camp at theresienstadt and had survived he said he had had family there who had not lived he did not say it was his wifes grandparents who had been incarcerated in the camp and had died of starvation the bag was opened a package in greaseproof paper held together with thick elastic bands was handed to him with similar gloves he knew the beretta s and a little grin flicked at his mouth when he was told that this particular weapon and the ammunition it was loaded with had been sold to the egyptian armed forces a small matter but likely to cause confusion in an investigation there were two magazines eighteen bullets in all and he would use two it was wrapped again and put on the table beside the bed the man reached forward gripped gabbis shoulders and gave him a light brush kiss on each cheek then he was gone and the door closed on him gabbi heard the slither of the caretakers slippers then the thud of the outer door being shut he went back to bed and hoped to catch more sleep his shoulder was shaken gently the pilot eddie jackknifed up on the cot bed his copilot hovered above him thought youd like to know that were fuelled armed all the checks done ready to press the tit and lift and likely we may be lifting why didnt you wake me you were sleeping like a baby would have been a crime fuck you the pilot rubbed the sleep from his eyes what we got could go around first light as we thought a covert team up on the frontier and maybe theres casualties coming with them the other bird is getting herself to speed we go together he could hear the rotors of both birds turning over and the groundcrew people would be crawling over the black hawks it would likely be the last mission of interest that eddie flew before the drawdown sucked him in then he might go home or might be packed off with his guys and his machine to afghanistan hed like to finish well he tightened his boots oh and eddie what we dont exist and any flight we make is classified as never happening its likely the mullahmen will be powerfully angry if we do get called out and are up close on their ground fuck them the birds engines sounded sweet and the windows shook if an exfiltration needed a helicopter liftout theyd be in trouble deep stuff and it would be close run it was good of the guys to let him sleep and recharge might have been their own survival instincts that had allowed it spooks the pilot reckoned were mad not people youd take home to your mother and hed go as far as he could to save them badger hissed how you put yourself in this place foxy i dont know the dinghy was holed a bullet had pierced the metal hull about an inch below the waterline it went down a few yards short of the mud spit where the water was up to badgers waist he had time to hoist foxy onto his shoulder as he had before the skin against the stubble on his own face was wet clammy and seemed white in the darkness as if there were nightlights under it like the ones used in nurseries and hospital wards he went over the spit and past the heap he had made of dead foliage then slipped back into the water dont ask me how im doing actually im doing fine just dont bother to ask he could hear the jeeps engines on the bund line away from him but he would have been masked by the reed beds it was as well that he was he could stand upright which was best with the weight he carried the level dropped and lapped at his knees the birds thrashed for takeoff and he plodded on the mud under his boots clinging to them he was taking deep breaths struggling to suck the air deeper into his lungs his legs were leaden he had not begun badger was only at his start line he came out of the water and was on the open ground he went by the carcass of the bird unrecognisable now as a creature of beauty badger didnt do birdwatching he wasnt ecoobsessed but he had learned to respect nature when he was in hides and when he hiked testing himself in scotland or in the brecons of wales he knew the range of the small songbirds that would come from the heather and bracken to filch crumbs and the predator hobbies peregrines and eagles he knew also the divers on the lochs there had been a poem drilled into them by a teacher about a bird a seaman had shot with a bolt he was cursed for it his mates too that was what foxy had done he had killed the ibis made it into rats food shouldnt have done it foxy look what its done to us with you killing it you could say something foxy not play bloody miserable he went as fast as he could and his boots went into the side of the scrape where the hide had been he lurched out of it and foxys weight shifted on his shoulder badger gasped and swore softly it had been a sizeable piece of his life important and might be memorable a bit of ground two yards square that had held them both and the bergens for hours days and nights he would remember it badger couldnt have said then how long his life expectancy was but the image of the scrape the net and the camouflage the smell of the bags the piss bottles foxys body and breath and badgers own would stay with him until the last that might be when a firing squad was given the order or in a far distant bed in whatever home was then his he went by the scrape and it was behind him he would never see it again but he wouldnt forget it ever good riddance foxy eh how you doing were getting there he staggered a bit going down the slight slope he came to the bergens and the little inflatable for a moment he considered whether to tip foxy into the inflatable along with the bergens only a moment there were reeds off to his left and behind them the clear space used to bury the poor bastards who had come scavenging and then across more water the elevated track he could see the lights of the two jeeps they were going slowly but making progress and there would be a place ahead of them where they could swing to their right and either drive over mud or trudge to get across the route badger intended to take to the extraction point i reckon youre better with me foxy the bergens can get the ride he didnt hear agreement or criticism it was best to have foxy on his shoulder if there was a crisis anything near to catastrophe badger didnt want to be crouched over the inflatable heaving his man onto his shoulder he cantered into the water which splashed up round his ankles into his boots and up the hem of the gillie suit the weight was fierce on his shoulder there was a string at the front end of the inflatable and he had it in his free hand the other steadied foxy was on his buttocks and had a grip there foxys head bounced on the back of badgers hip and his knees were over badgers heart the feet kicked his stomach with each step not going to be fun foxy the next bit and itd be good if you helped yourself a bit know what i mean he went deeper into the water the level rose he realised that foxys head upsidedown would go under he didnt break his step and the mud gave him a useful grip he twisted foxy a bit so that his head lay on the side of the inflatable they went further out and he could follow the path of the two jeeps lights bouncing he thought they were now on a rough track that maybe hadnt been used for many years the longer the better and was crumbling they were moving slowly if he was ahead of them for all his burdens when they swung and came after him he reckoned he had a chance slim but a chance of reaching the extraction point if they were in front blocking him and the dawn light came up he didnt feel inclined to make any bets on himself coming through not the chance of a cat in hell he had seen foxys body and had heard his screams and the two encouraged him to keep going forward his breath sang from his mouth and each step was harder the burden heavier dont get it into your head foxy that im doing this for love of you he was out of his depth his feet flapped and had nothing to grip against the weight of the bergens steadied the inflatable which had to take most of his own weight and foxys it didnt seem possible to badger that he should tip the bergens into the water and rid himself of them instructors always talked about the requirement of bringing back kit and in stores they grumbled if it wasnt accounted for it was an obligation to return it after an operation requirements and obligations were part of the bible he worked to the lights of the jeeps were harder to see important yes it told him that dawn was coming not there yet but not far away if they blocked him when the dawn had spread its light it had all been for nothing he thrashed his feet and attempted to paddle with his free hand and they went forward if they were blocked who was listening maybe some pigs were an otter the birds but the men in the jeeps wouldnt hear him badger said sharply not for love of you foxy no i dont even like you and youre a fucking passenger hitching a ride twice they went under twice he choked and cleared his throat then spat out the marsh water but he kept the pace had to chapter a wind had risen it came from the south perhaps the southwest and ruffled the water badger waded through it was a warm vigorous wind it flapped the tips of the reeds off to his left the bed below him was uneven sometimes his boots found a grip and then he was able to lurch forward faster with the inflatable and the weight over his shoulder he used the crafts rim for buoyancy when the bed fell away under him the wind helped to drive him on little white crests were now whipped up and water splashed over the sides he fancied that the bergens shifted because they were floating in the bilge the wind brought the sounds closer of the two jeeps engines if the wind steadily strengthening had been from the north or the northeast he might not have heard them straining in low gear on the the bund line that was little more than loosepacked sand had he not heard them and been able to plot their position he might have slowed and clung to the rim of the inflatable let his legs dangle in the water the engine noise drove him forward if the jeeps could get past him then swing to their right and come from his left his route to the extraction point was blocked rest was not possible badger could not have said when if ever he had felt so tired so hungry and thirsty he thought once very briefly of pictures he had seen on television screens refugees on the move pushing prams laden with possessions or carrying little suitcases or the skeletal figures of men gazing at an eyewitness from the far side of a barbedwire fence mostly his mind was blank as if the screen had been switched off and the matter of the moment was getting the next secure hold for his right boot on the mud then following it with the left crisis was when the right boot or the left slipped and pitched him forward foxys weight dragging him down triumph was when the left boot or the right had good grip and he seemed to surge it was like the flight of a wild animal maybe a deer isolated on bodmin moor with hounds closing would have understood what drove badger on he wasted breath on speaking aloud dont help me dont do anything youre foxy the big man leave it to me im the boy there to do fetching and carrying the one who has to graft youre the top beggar foxy right please yourself leave it to the boy it might have been clever of badger to strip off the gillie suit and go on in his pants socks and boots but he could not it was about his culture he had to bring back two bergens a gillie suit headgear and foxy badger no more considered ditching the suit than leaving either bergen to float on the water or dropping foxy in the hope of increasing the possibility of his own survival do i like you foxy no what did i get i had the short straw i was in the wrong place at the wrong time and some shitface had written the wrong stuff in my file and the computer chucked me up you dont deserve me foxy there are some godawful people who do my job guys i wouldnt take water off or a biscuit guys who are crap theyre the ones who should have been here watching over you see if any of them would have lifted you up and kept going with you youre a lucky bastard say it foxy say im a lucky bastard better shout it foxy shout im a lucky bastard to have badger with me i didnt hear you the whipped reeds sang in his ears and he heard the splash of the small waves he breasted the little thuds when the inflatable bounced on the crests and clearest the jeep engines he fell he tumbled forward and was buried below the surface for a moment the great weight kept him down he struggled to draw in his knees bend them then raise his body his head broke the surface water fell off him algae and weed were in his face he understood the bed sloped upwards he had tripped because it was no longer flat the water was at his knees not his waist or chest he was in the shallows he still had foxy on his back and he was left with one free arm to drag the inflatable it grounded then came free again when it grounded the second time it took a greater effort to free it he could see the headlights and hear the engines better he could also see ahead the first minutes of dawn made grey and indistinct shapes might have been raised ground another bund line or another bed of high reeds he had gone before on instinct taken the direction he thought was the most direct path to the extraction point the light had washed through pastel shades and no clarity the jeeps were ahead of him and they swung the headlights didnt reach him but if they kept their course they would stay ahead he crested a slight slope in the last minutes of the old night badger would have seen nothing ahead of him the first minutes of the dawn and the new day showed him an outline of the ground ahead he tried to remember and failed he couldnt remember the ground between the hide in front of the house and the halfsunken strand of barbed wire that was the border close to it was the toppled watchtower he could recall the burnedout tank and its broken tracks could picture where the trucks had gone down off a bund line and into the water contaminating it with old engine oil he could remember and picture what was on the far side of the border between the line marked by the rusted wire strand and where the pajeros had brought them but couldnt recall what they had crossed skirted waded through to get close to the target location he went over barearsed ground no cover and broke the laws that were carved on the tablets of the croppies he did shape silhouette and sound because the inflatable scraped on the dried mud and broke across reed stumps and space because he was bunched with the inflatable which was more of a sledge than a water craft he didnt do shine hed broken every other law but they hadnt been teaching flight for life when they had made the laws of covert surveillance he went on badger thought that within a few minutes three or four they would be across his route out and a line of them would be confronting him they would have the first of the low sunshine on him easy shooting clear didnt think of that did you foxy didnt reckon on the trouble id have getting you clear did you all right for you up there but im bloody nearly on my knees im suffering foxy have you nothing anything to say moments returned filtered in his memory there had been buffalo in the water and a settlement too small for a village with concreteblock buildings and tv dishes they had made a wide detour but that had been daylight and this was dawn different noises engines revved it was the sound there had been on the roads north of bristol during the winter before last ice on the roads snowdrifts on the verges too much for the gritting trucks to cope with badger was in the southeast of iraq in the marshlands where the temperature would soon top degrees fahrenheit and he remembered the ice and windchill of a west country winter tyres spinning no traction the racing and shrieking of the engines the snow ice and refrozen slush spitting out behind the wheels badger understood the headlights to his left were static no snow no ice but drifts of fine sand that would have come in on the winds and caught the top of a bund line they were loose enough and deep enough to block the axles and spin the wheels the light grew so little time was left to him they would abandon their jeeps and run the inflatable split and air hissed from it badger had foxy on his shoulder he heaved on the thin rope and went forward pulling the bergens the raised area he had gone over would have blocked off the ground from the water and might have given in a longago war tanks the chance to manoeuvre in battle formation over what had been marshland he had no cover and the light was coming badger did not know whether he would be ahead of them and their line or too far in front of them for rifle fire to be accurate dead in the mind now only a wild creatures demand to survive but the weight on his shoulder and what he was pulling meant he couldnt raise his speed away to his right the east the sky lightened fuck you foxy the jeeps would go no further mansoor yelled lifting his voice over the screaming of the engines at first he could not be heard and the men sat tight the sand spewing back to coat the windscreen of the second jeep he hammered the butt of his rifle on the dashboard and was heard he yelled to them to kill the engines silence fell the officer of the alquds brigade could not have said when he had last slept or eaten his recall of the night went back no further than the frenzy with which he had struck his prisoner he had hit kicked used his fists and had not backed off fear overwhelmed him now he could look into the darkness and towards where he believed the fugitive was beyond the black of the night with the moonlight long gone and away to the east he saw a sliver of morning light lines of subtle colours that ranged through deep grey and soft gunmetal to silver and the narrowest strip of gold he had his men out of the jeeps he strained to see movement in front and cursed there would be on the road between the small settlement and ahvaz reached through villages of farmers and minefield amputees a convoy of at least one black saloon filled with intelligence officers of the brigade and two trucks of fighting men he could not consider how it would be for him if the car and the trucks arrived and he had no prisoner he strained and saw nothing he gazed at the darkness blasphemed and was alone why were you here why did you come to this place why could you not have gone to another sector why here why mine he thought himself destroyed he could imagine the faces of the men who would have sat in the car at the front of the convoy they would show him no sympathy no understanding his father in the gallows shed at the gaol showed no sympathy or understanding when a condemned man was led in to stand beside the stool on which he would be perched neither did he show it when a man was brought out through the gates and placed under the cranes arm he did not know of one officer in the brigade who would offer understanding despair washed around him and the shout was in his ear a guard from the basij pointed all of them followed his finger and saw nothing the guard was a peasant one of a line of subsistence farmers perhaps he had been sent out to sit on the hillsides north of ahvaz and watch the sheep be certain the lambs did not stray the guard called that he could see a man carrying another and dragging a load they ran towards the dawn in a chaotic stampede but mansoor with his damaged leg could not keep pace with the younger fitter men and bellowed that they should slow go only at his speed he sucked in air filled his lungs went as fast as his leg would carry him they were off the bund line and on flat baked ground the strip of gold widened below the silver he saw the man why had he come he was alone carrying the body on his shoulder and dragging what seemed like a khaki litter behind him he moved at snail speed for a moment mansoor believed fortune favoured him then he looked ahead of the man and saw the reed bed that stretched in front of him he saw also that the first light of day had made a mist shimmer in it the distance to the target was some three hundred yards and the light was poor and he demanded rapidfire bursts on automatic but they were men of the basij not of the brigade he had no cover his goal was the reed bed where perhaps an old watercourse had run and enough seepage had survived the drainage programme badger couldnt see beyond it didnt know how wide it was but was aware of the mist it crept towards him and meandered among the clumps of reeds some thick others collapsed it was a refuge and a goal he heard the crack of bullets going above him they thudded into the hard mud and made dirt puffs two shook him they would have struck the bergens on the holed inflatable some were close but more were high and wide or short and no threat to him they gave him incentive a paratrooper a sergeant had said to him on the brecons i tell you kiddo nothing gets you moving better than live rounds when theyre headed at you they clear the bowels and get you up to pace he seemed now with the whine overhead and the patter into the mud not to feel foxys weight over his shoulder or the pain of his palm which was raw where the rope attached to the inflatable chafed with the light came the flies but the shooting kept badger going and there were distant shouts he remembered nothing of this place he could have been here before or not he had no recall of the berm he had come across and the bund line to his left or the driedout plateau and scant reeds in front of him all croppies hoovered information from anywhere and any source information was gold dust it might come from a lecture hall or a chance encounter but all of it had value and should be squirrelled into storage a driver had taken a team of them in a police wagon out onto the pennine moors for a crop on what might have been a jihadist training camp hed talked of his time in the united nations police force in croatia there had been a story of a breakout from a besieged town and the likely result of failure was being massacred by their enemy those croats had tried to go across country the fifteen or so miles to the nearest haven and some had been captured slaughtered because they had ended up going in circles all sense of direction lost they were so weak from lack of sleep and food that they had doubled back on themselves and two days later had been where theyd started out not a story that was easy to forget badger remembered the trite laughter among his fellow croppies now he had no compass but he had the growing light in the east he too was clapped out from exhaustion and hunger he would get to the cover of the reeds and the low mist and would push through he wouldnt see the pajeros in front of him but the house the kids playing with a football the barracks and the lamppost from which a fraying rope hung it was a nightmare he shouted we going right foxy youll tell me if were wrong least you can do stuck up there is tell me if im off course there seemed to be an answering yell but not from foxy badger twisted his head he could see over the skin of foxys buttocks the officer limped among his guys ranting at them the shooting stopped and he made a line of them then brought them forward foxy is there any excuse for dumping the inflatable and one of the bergens the line of guys with their officer was around two hundred yards from him and more shots were fired but wide he had fifty yards to go until he reached the reeds but the mist came towards him might last thirty minutes but every other morning it had burned off quickly might be too quick for him theres the one with mostly clothing not that weve used it some of the kit and the last of the grenades the others where communications is theres not much in it either what you reckon foxy more yelling from the officer and they veered away from the direct line turned a sharp angle and went into the reeds nine men with their officer the foliage swallowed them they would have seen from where their jeeps had stopped in loose sand and they had elevation how far the reeds went and would have judged they could make their cordon line on the far side im going to dump both bergens foxy goes against the grain hurts but at least its all sanitised dont bloody critise me badger hit the reeds they lacked the life of the beds beside the hide and were diseased stunted he could hear to his left shouts and dried stems breaking he thought so far that a fragile curtain of morning mist might have saved him useless things now played in his mind there had been big estates above the thames outside reading and kids he had known had earned cash from beating they had been paid to drive reared birds most of which could barely fly into the cordon where the guns were when they came out of the cover they were blasted he was down on his knees and still carried foxy didnt allow him to slide off his shoulder he dragged at some broken reeds and made a shallow pile of them over the two bergens he had now only the pistol the magazine already in it and one more and he had shortrange communications that would link with alpha juliet everything else that should have been brought home and returned to stores was in the two bergens it hurt him to abandon them badger pushed himself up and turned his back on them he began to thread through the stems the light was growing worst thing ive ever done foxy is dumping that kit what i do reckon though is that shell be at the extraction place we have to get there she wont ditch us like i ditched the bergens shes the sort of girl wholl be there shes great foxy all that shit you told me about your woman about your ellie ive forgotten it im going to get you to where alpha juliet is foxy that all right he went carefully and the light grew he could do a better pace without the backpacks to pull but he knew the cordon line would be in front of him and the guns who knew where he was no bastard did who cared where he was alpha juliet might no other bastard would he was deniable no reason for any bastard to know or care gonework a cryptic text to len gibbons had shown up on his mobile it was as if one of the last pieces of the jigsaw had slotted together not the final one but one of the most important he was not a grandstander he didnt expect a seat where he could sit and watch the deed done it was still dark on a late november morning at the leisure resort of travemunde up the river and north of lubeck facing into the baltic the text had been sent by the cousin the message told gibbons that the consultant had left home had arrived at the university and gone into the block where his offices were good enough it seemed to indicate that no security alert had been launched further up the floodlit quay out towards the groyne on which the lighthouse flashed there were piers on wood piles and cormorants gathered on the hand rails black with long necks big beaks and the lungs to give them diving time when they hunted they had been perched on those hand rails when he had been here thirtysomething years before then there had been a winter morning when he had waited for the first ferry to return across the river from the village of priwall and bring with it the workers who had jobs at travemunde or lubeck he had last been here a few weeks before the collapse of the antelope operation it was for len gibbons almost a pilgrimage and he might have brought flowers with him if a kiosk had been open had he done so it would have been because he cared to remember the lives that had been lost because of his trust in a man he had met once and so briefly and seen once from a distance to make this journey come here and wait in the bonepiercing cold with the wind snapping off the sea was of greater significance to him than when he had loitered outside the church of st andrew and watched the man who had been a pastor the ferry came towards him as he remembered it there was a cafe on the far side of the river he would buy himself a hot breakfast eggs sausage a heated pastry and coffee he was savouring the thought when the phone bleeped again both arrived all in place warm congrats your favourite cousin he read it twice then deleted it not quite the final piece but so close he had believed in confusion and a complex chain of command had dared to hope that the terse message passed through many links in a chain reporting the capture of foulkes did not mean that a protective net would be tossed over the target the engineer and his wife were now at the consulting rooms and the building was not flooded with detectives and armed uniforms by a miracle word from that distant corner of iran had not seeped out a cargo ship monstrous in the dark passed in front of the ferry he shivered from the cold nerves he could absorb the baltics november chill len gibbons had done time as maternity cover in estonias capital city tallinn and a decade earlier he had been the second man in stockholm had it not been for the schlutup fuckup he would never have been sent as a fillin to the former soviet satellite and if he had gone to sweden it would have been as the station officer the boat laden with containers had passed the ferry had come in and the ramp was down he walked on board as he had done three decades before then he had left the pastor on the quay now he stood with a few hardy spirits on the deck the ramp was raised and he felt the shudder of the engines below his feet his mobile bleeped again his friend was in place len gibbons switched off the phone opened its back section and removed the chip he dropped the phone first into the white wake of the water that was pushed aside by the ferrys passage then the chip it floated for a fraction of a second then was swamped he had broken all contact with the conspiracy in a minute they were at the priwall ramp he felt calm comfortable and satisfied with a job well done he had brought them together and they would face each other within the hour he had no doubt that the assassin in the pay of a semifriendly government would show the necessary skills and take the life of an engineer who served a semihostile state late that afternoon he would drop off his hire car fly from hamburg to brussels take the last eurostar connection into london then a bus to the haymarket he would climb the stairs of what would be probably a deserted building but sarah would be there and hed give her the present he would buy before leaving lubeck perhaps shed blush a little and murmur something about his thoughtfulness the office would be cleared and ready for them to move out she would have known the outcome of the operation by listening to any news bulletin and he might invite her for sherry in his clubs bar then they would go their separate ways the following morning he would leave his train at vauxhall and walk to the towers it would be well known that a prominent iranian weapons scientist had been taken down in the german city of lubeck the previous day it would have been broadcast widely and reported in the newspapers a minimal minority would find the opportunity out of sight to press his hand only later would rumour and gossip spread he would then be a noted man respected he chuckled he came off the ferry at the side of the ramp the cars sped past and threw up the puddles water he went to the cafe for his hot breakfast it was right that he had made the pilgrimage the cousin too had no more use for a mobile phone the main part not the inner brain was tossed casually into the back of a corporation rubbish cart as it cleaned streets before the rushhour began the brain was wrapped in the paper bag that had contained the pastry he had bought from a stall by the muhlenbrucke he dropped it into a bin in the park off the wallstrasse he felt bullish like gibbons and their friend the cousin expected to stay in the city for the next hour no longer there was nothing he could do in that time and his connections were now broken he would then drive south fast to hannover he would leave his hire car there and pay his bill false name and cards and a military driver would take him far to the southwest towards kaiserslautern by late evening he would be on a military flight out of the ramstein usaf base those who disapproved of extrajudicial killing would not know about it and those who did not would pump his hand and slap his back he was in the park and shared a bench with a derelict guy he bought the man coffee from a stall and a pastry with a custard centre the derelict had few teeth and bobbed his head in gratitude the cousin felt no need to communicate any more than his general sense of wellbeing it was not every day there was a chance to waste the bastards who had done the damage in iraq and were in the process of getting devices into afghanistan christmas was coming early the images in his mind were of bombs detonating in those faroff places he had forgotten them since he had left the rendezvous city of london as if why they were in lubeck and what they were doing had no relation to the deserts and mountains where the young guys were sent as if he the friend and gibbons had lost sight of the reasons and been buried in the detail of it he laughed and the derelict cackled with him the agency man came from smalltown alabama where there were good fireandbrimstone preachers ten years earlier he had visited an elderly uncle it had been the fourth sunday after the planes had been flown into the twin towers he could not remember where the text had come from which old testament chapter but the preacher that morning had said if i whet my glittering sword and my hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance on my enemies and will reward them that hate me fine stuff allelujahs to go with it and plenty the rain had started to patter on his shoulders there were of course the two guys who had gone forward identified the destination and hit trouble but an alarm had not been raised and the hit was in place the target faced judgment was adjacent to vengeance the two guys were blanked out of his mind deniable and he laughed again then walked away leaving the derelict with the last of his pastry he would have time for a quick walk around lubeck the renovated historic buildings before driving away he laughed because he thought vengeance a fine rich dish best served as a surprise he sat in the van and did not smoke or drink takeout coffee instead he read gabbis choice was to be among favourites just as his driver who had brought him the weapon during the night did not know his name so gabbi would have been kept in ignorance of the drivers except that his wallet had been flipped open a euro note extracted and he had seen the plasticfronted pouch inside it with the id that would take the man in the name of amnon katz into the car park of the embassy of israel berlin little escaped gabbi probably when he was back in tel aviv tomorrow and had his debriefing the day after tomorrow he would mention that the embassys man had not satisfactorily hidden his identity or troubled to disguise his workplace he thought the man with him amnon katz squirmed too often in his seat maybe the people who should have escorted him were on holiday or had made excuses after the chaotic affair of the emirates killing intelligencegathering officers had sought to distance themselves from the work of his unit he had amnon katz who had been calmer in the night and had spoken coherently perhaps he had not slept perhaps he had a knotted stomach perhaps he had doubts now that he was up against the place where a man would be killed they had a view of the steps leading up to the main door of the block and of the lit windows on the first floor a saloon car was parked at the kerb the top of a mans scalp showed above the drivers seat headrest there was no other security in sight he coughed hard cleared his throat he had not drunk any coffee because it would be unprofessional to be stuck outside on a cold pavement and need to piss he could feel the weapon lodged in his trouser belt under the overalls he reached to open the vans passenger door the man amnon katz gave him his hand for encouragement gabbi ignored it he closed the door quietly behind him and went to the back of the van he took out a roadcleaning brush and a couple of bin liners and smiled ruefully he would be fucked if there were no leaves to collect and no rubbish to sweep up he had a shovel and thick industrial gloves he did not look behind him but walked towards the parked car and the steps the wind blew harshly down the road in the centre of the teachinghospital complex and buffeted his face his baseball cap was well down over his eyes and a scarf closely wrapped at his mouth the cameras would be rewarded with little and the van he heard its engine start it reversed and would be driven away somewhere behind him watching him was the stubbily built man with the old face the bright eyes of youth and the coldness at the mouth who had met him off the ferry gabbi trusted that man and regarded him as a friend he was the one who would take him away when it was done he began to sweep the gutter slush from the salt put down a few leaves some soil washed off the frozen shrub beds he went slowly had no wish to be close to the saloon car in front of him he had seen his target go inside with his arm around his wifes shoulders but the targets back had been to him and he had seen little of the face the condition of the wife and the verdict she would be given did not concern him each time gabbi pushed the broom he could feel against his belly the stock of the pistol and now his mind was closed they sat very still and close the engineer did not speak and neither did his wife naghmeh they were in the waiting room the door to the office was shut but they heard his voice and thought he made telephone calls men in loosefitting unbuttoned white coats crossed the waiting room knocked and went inside then nurses in starched white trousers and figurehugging white jackets there was a woman at a desk close to the door a gatekeeper she did not make eye contact with either of them but kept her face bent over her screen soft music played from high speakers there were magazines but they did not read them they had nothing to talk about his wife would not have wished to hear about the progress he was making in extending the range of electronics that could transmit the signal to the receiver fitted in the device and do it from further outside the bubble that protected the enemys convoys from remote detonations he had no interest now in which block of land beside which length of raised road leading to which village would be granted the necessary funding for a mineclearance team to begin work their lives were on hold and they barely dared to breathe neither could read the faces of those who went into the consultants room or left it he could not be pessimistic or optimistic and she could do no more than hold his hand it was sudden the door opened he was shirtsleeved but with a tie in his collar well shaven and looked to have slept his face gave no clue the engineer had heard it said that an accused could always tell from the moment he was brought back into the courtroom and confronted the judge whether he would hang or take the bus home to rejoin his family he felt his wifes hand stiffen in his she clung to him and their fingers locked there were xrays in a pouch in the consultants hand and he spoke quietly to the gatekeeper who nodded neither gave evidence of what was said and he waved for them to follow him inside they crossed the waiting room shakily did not know what awaited them presence and courage radiated from her as they had on the previous evening in his experience talking to patients was more difficult than performing complicated surgery on them and he had been told that his manner was not always satisfactory he should curb brusqueness when the news was bad and elation when it was good he was tired and had slept poorly lili would have fled to her mother taken their daughter with her would have poured into her parents ear a litany of his craven acceptance of a call to old loyalties she might come back to him might see that his affluence would not easily be replaced on a divorcees circuit if he made a call and grovelled he accepted that their lives were altered that a crack had appeared that would not easily be repaired she might not come back they intruded into his life if they had not come to lubeck he would have slept well and been against the warmth of his wifes body he would have been woken by his daughter climbing across him but he had woken cold she looked into his face he indicated the chairs but they stood in front of him silently demanding his answer he said there is much to talk of and i ask you not to interrupt me but to listen carefully to what i say i have identified a glioblastoma grade two which is confirmation of what you have already been told by your consultants at home the tumour is close to what we call an eloquent area having intruded into his life they had derailed it he held up the scan images i want to show you what we have learned time to go hit the road guys she thought she sounded authoritative and that her voice had a crisp bite the light was up dawn slipped into day abigail joness last birthday had been her thirtythird which should have marked her out as being at the peak of her powers she did not believe the crap about veterans experience outweighing youths innovations all she had worked at now hung precariously on that days events she couldnt escape it the sun was low bright on her face it threw grotesque shadows those shadows were edging nearer to her she couldnt say how fast they advanced with each minute but at first light they had started to form nudging through the broken gate to the compound they were now well up the track towards her and if she didnt take control get the show on the road they would be tripping against her feet hard for her to see the men because the sun was behind them but there would be a hundred perhaps more nor could she see what weapons they carried some of the money she had paid out to the old bastard the sheikh would have been distributed but more would have gone into his own biscuit tin and a suggestion would have been made that thered be more where it had come from she heard the sound of the big engines behind her it would be about bluff always was either the sea would part or it would not if it did they would be fine dandy and on their way if it did not theyd be swamped and drowned the boys would have sorted it out for themselves corky in the first pajero with harding riding shotgun and she would be with hamfist close behind like up against the fender shagger would be alongside hamfist and theyd try to do it with gas and if not it would have to be live rounds and if it was live rounds her career was mired and she would be gone shed had no communication with badger had tried enough times for a link he was not switched on maybe had not the time or inclination to talk maybe hed been taken and was dead her obligation was to be at the extraction location if she held her hand above her eyes down almost to the bridge of her nose where her freckles were thickest and squinted hard she could see a wall of men not soldiers or police but marsh men the madan from the cradle of civilisation ninety years before she had read it in the digests preparing her for service in iraq they had been described by the british military as treacherous and deceitful they lived in the shelter of the marshes from which they looted and murdered indiscriminately and the last invader to have taught them a degree of discipline had been hulagu grandson of genghis khan eight centuries back they would be formidable but bluff an appearance of unshakeable will and unstoppable force might win through she did no more pep talks if they went into the crowd and broke legs tossed bodies crushed teenagers and fired gas but did not break through they would be torn limb from limb like the security people trapped by a mob in fallujah they were all good at the wheel her boys but she was happy in difficult times to have hamfist driving the first pajero was level with her she couldnt speak to harding because his head was encased in his gas mask and he had canisters across his lap corkys gas mask was on his forehead and the engine was revved she hitched her loose skirt climbed up and into the back seat of the second pajero hamfists whatever the outcome she would have diplomatic immunity but they would not the immunity once enjoyed by men working for private security contractors had long since been withdrawn they might face big problems not her had she said then that the issue was ridiculous and given an instruction for a route across the sand onto highway and the road south to basra and safety she would have been ignored abigail would have lost her credibility she sat in the back with hardware around her and had her pistol on her lap cocked she hooked the straps of the mask into place they surged would the waters part would the fucking israelites stay dry or get soaked time to get an answer corky threw some and shagger did then zapped up the windows harding and hamfist had thumbs down hard on the horns inside the armour plate and the blastresistant glass she could hear the thud of the grenades letting out the gas clouds the thundercrack of the flashandblast ones the banshee bellow of the horns she held the pistol tight some scattered in front of harding but others were thrown sideways hamfists went over something that might have been a leg a stomach or backbone if harding stopped or hamfist they would be ripped apart cut into small pieces and the men would lose their balls fuck alone knew what they would do to her her own people lived among the lancashire county set where they hunted shot and regarded themselves as affluent country heroes they always preached that a driver should never swerve to avoid wildlife on the road or for a domestic cat or dog but should go straight through it and so retain control harding did and hamfist they were through the gas clouds the crowd was thinner and they hit the barricade it would have been built during the night old wire rusted and sharp good for getting up against the axles and snagging them some collapsed fencing and a couple of oil drums that was the first the road was raised and the banks fell away and the local clausewitz would have thought it good for blocking the milchcow run they went through it the wire sprang up and thrashed the windows hamfist nearly stalled which gave the young bloods the chance to get close and their fists were against the windows abigail saw the faces and the hate she knew what would be done to the boys and didnt care to think what would be done to her they were through the first block the second was more of an art form the first would slow them but the second would stop them and then they were fucked she hung on to the back of the seat in front a gang of twenty or thirty were either side of the second block and had axes hammers spades and firearms maybe the worst thing would be fire they could be burned out if they were stopped and the engine was lit they would have to come out as rats did when smoke was pumped down their hole harding swerved in the lead pajero he would have used all his strength to swing the wheel the vehicle swayed made like it would overturn and went down the bank about six foot down abigail reckoned she thought they were going over when hamfist followed went down on two wheels then crunched back onto four and the boys were shrieking as if it was a victory moment they bounced on the dirt below the road and went through what would have been a disused irrigation channel the wheels took traction again she had no idea how many injured they had left behind they bumped back onto the road where the bank was less steep and stripped off the masks she didnt like triumphalism but it was as if shed loosed her dogs a halfmile down the track astride it was the sheikhs big car the man himself was sitting on a collapsible chair beside the road the kid with him held an umbrella above his head to shade him from the sun corky went straight on did not swerve out of the impact he hit the bmw series a full power blow in front of the left side wheel and sent it off the road the track ahead was clear she wondered where they stood as regards the time and the golden hour she uncocked the pistol put it back into her inner pocket quiet a little stunned at the violence she had unleashed abigail said that was burning bridges and no going back over them hamfist answered it was called for miss they drove hard and she didnt know what they would find she made a link with the operations people at the basra air base and promised coordinates it had been necessary but ugly and it might be that everything she had started had turned to ugly they went trailing sand towards the extraction point could go nowhere else it was ground he could handle and badger made good progress through the reeds the stems were close set but he had the skills to insinuate himself and foxy between them he took each step carefully tested the weight and kept his boots off the dry brittle fronds it was an illusion of success and he knew it ahead already light filtered through not from above but from the front following this line he would come within the next several minutes to the edge of the reeds they thinned fast and the sunlight came into them it was the same when he looked to the sides the reed beds and the soggy mud in which they thrived were a fools sanctuary badger knew he could hear them around and in front of him he thought they had boxed him two at each side and the officer mansoor and the others behind him there were shouts from the officer he had regained control and had them organised as he wanted more were out ahead he heard the answering calls from the guards and the orders from the officer badger was at the limits of his endurance on the edge of what he was capable of doing bent by a burden and exhausted but his mind worked he realised he was being herded towards the guns same as the pheasants he went on he told foxy why he pushed forward towards the ever sparser reeds where the light shone brighter better that way foxy on our feet and going towards where we belong better to be moving than on our backs when they close round us us looking up at them scared and them pissing on us better going forward foxy he heard other noises clumsier and heavier and couldnt place them he was bent low found it easier to get a right boot in front of a left boot if his spine was tilted forward it seemed to spread the weight better they were closer behind and the reeds were thinner ahead and the sun came on brighter and the near dark of the thickest part of the beds was gone he couldnt control the depth of his tread and the mud between the stalks of the reeds left perfect indentations as good as any scenesofcrime officer would want the mud was uniform he couldnt find wider stretches of deeper water to his knees or his thighs where he could go to hide the trail neither was there a way through where the ground had dried out screwed yes they had his trail now their calls to one another were growing in excitement and he thought them louder to give each other confidence the shouts of the officer were more frequent as if he too sensed an end game was near twice more he had heard louder sounds of surging movement and had heard also a snort of breath he thought that among the guards there must be one perhaps more obese than the others winded from his efforts and he heard the men coming nearer to him driving him towards the voices at the front they would have their best marksmen at the front badger wouldnt be able when he was flushed out of the reed beds to run weave and duck with the bergens dumped he could manage a crabbed trot barely faster than when the paras did forced speed marches on the brecons with eighty pounds of kit on their backs foxy what do you weigh must be a hundred and fifty pounds dont worry im not dumping you important to say it foxy wondering whether he was going to be ditched and left to face them again were going out through the front of these reeds foxy and itll be breaking cover i dont know what well find except theres guys out there in a cordon line waiting for us ive got the glock and a full magazine in it but i dont know how far well be from the extraction place and whether well get any help from them the borders ahead but i dont know how far he couldnt hide and they had his bootprints to follow the camouflage of the gillie suit was wrong for the reeds good for sand and dried dirt they were close to coming out of the cover and the light around him was more brilliant maybe it was that time the squaddies talked about when they said they thought of their mothers and fathers the girls theyd been with and babies they might have made the bloody flies had found him and were striving to break into the headpiece maybe it was the time when squaddies decided whether they wanted led zeppelin or the rolling stones to play them into church and maybe it was the time when squaddies became angry and wouldnt accept the obvious in half a dozen paces he would be out of the reeds and guns would face him there may be good ground for us and there may not i just dont know im saying foxy that we arent taken not prisoners no you up for that whatever i shoot therell be two rounds left he heard the crashing and breaking of stems and didnt understand it thats one for you and one for me you know what foxy we could get a bassett job for this be good wouldnt it but im not lying down and rolling over yet were going to give it a go you up for it the scream was close a man cried out first in fear then in terror then in shock and last in pain badger was at the edge of the reeds the scream cut his ears louder and shriller than any of foxys had been he saw the boar break from the reed bed blood on its tusks the men in front of him who had had their rifles ready and had seemed alert to their main prey were now running to the edge of the reeds and badgers right he understood a huge thing maybe twenty stone of it maybe more as big as the one that had sniffed him in the hide and had had a short blade up its nostril he understood that the guards at the back behind him had driven the beast before them as theyd driven badger but a guy on the flank of the box had been in the way of the boars flight not a clever option he might have had his bowels and intestines ripped out of his stomach wall by the tusks he screamed again and likely they had no morphine it ran and shots were fired at it would have been well wide the guy kept screaming and the boys he slept with served with went to him it gave badger a chance he went where the boar had on dried dirt towards the next raised berm chapter badger had changed the outline of his body there was open ground ahead of him once there had been lagoons and channels but the water flow had been blocked off and the sun had baked the mud during four or five years of drought the ecosystem in place since the marshlands had been claimed as civilisations cradle was wrecked if a river source or a filled canal was left untouched the marshes survived if they were all dammed the reeds died and the water evaporated the ground dried and life failed behind him the reed bed had taken a last hold in what would have been once a wide deep channel now he faced a gradual incline that stretched to the far distance where there had once been channels that must have been far outside badgers depth there was now a tacky damp surface below a fragile crust he couldnt see where they had come in but off to the side too far away to be of help there was a shimmer that might have been water he thought himself near the approach route but not close enough to recognise its landmarks he had no cover other than the low wisps of mist that were being steadily burned off there were indentations in the ground little scratched paths where water had once run and stumps of reeds broken off six inches above the mud the stems and leaves were long rotted and there was the ribcage of a boat overturned and half buried not protruding more than a few inches there were too slight tumps where silt had once gathered and perhaps the current had been forced to gouge a way to the right or left the sun was higher clear of the horizon and the heat built he knew in which direction he must go and remembered a single strand of old wire he must reach on his own he might have used his skills to cross the open ground he would have reached the horizon and found the wire part buried badger had changed the outline of his body in doing so he could no longer hug the ground make it his friend with the screaming of the guard gored by the pig the yells of the others and the shouts of the officer bringing chaos badger had taken foxy off his shoulder but had not rested the beast had gone had careered away and found sanctuary from its enemy in the wafting blocks of ground mist badger had not taken the time to rest his shoulder but had hitched the suit up and heaved foxys body onto his back then drawn the arms forward until they fell over his stomach and the head rested on his neck he had let the gillie suit drop over two of them its going to be hot in there for you foxy a steam bath but its the way it is nothing i can do about it he was bringing foxy back he had said he would and there had been no complaint from the old bastard he couldnt see behind him and to twist his head might dislodge foxy in front of him was a short horizon much less distance visible than when he had stood at the edge of the reeds he knew he must trust in his ability he could hear shouts still but the screams were fainter he would crawl for the time it took him to count to a hundred he would stay statue still for the time it took to count to another hundred he was on his stomach legs splayed his knees took some of the weight as he edged forward but his elbows took more the problem foxy is that i dont know whether one of them has us whether the rifles up whether its a game theyre playing i dont know whats behind and ive not much idea whats in front i just have to go forward you up for it he thought it right to tell foxy what he was doing and why they could have a gun sight on your arse foxy and mine and we wont know it badger went on as best he could his knees and elbows scraping the ground he moved and counted then lay barely daring to breathe and counted again and he thought foxy stayed quiet and still and badger could not have asked more of him and when the next problem came in his mind a realisation he did not share it like foxy deserved a reward the next problem was their feet and their boots badgers boots and foxys feet he did not know whether they stuck out from under the hem of the gillie suit might just be that a heap of mud or an accumulation of silt whatever the appearance his gillie suit left for the searching eye was spoiled blasted apart by the sight of a pair of boots and a pair of feet stuck out from under it and not possible for him to know the answer he reckoned he had done a hundred yards from the reed bed out onto the open ground and reckoned there might be a thousand to cover then hed have to hope he found the single strand of rusty barbed wire his skills would count for something but luck might count for more they said smug complacent beggars that luck had to be earned men with towering selfesteem didnt accept that luck played a part in success he was going forward again and he didnt know how much of a trail he had left where it was wet or where it had dried out and didnt know whether his camouflage was good or useless or how many were looking for him he had gone past the boat and was level with a buffalos white ribs immediately in front of him there was a small raised patch of sand that might offer slight cover the sun climbed above him and the heat grew he didnt know if a rifle was aimed whether the adjustment to the sights had been made whether a safety was off whether a trigger was squeezed whether a bullet would kill or wound he went forward he could have treated it as mutiny if it was mutiny he was entitled as an officer of the alquds brigade to shoot them then the proper course of action if his orders were repeatedly disobeyed was to report it to his superiors and the guards would face military courts and punishment but mansoor did not treat it as mutiny three times he had demanded that these basij kids peasants from the fields and the back streets of ahvaz where there was no education should form the line and advance with him three times not one had moved it was their nco who had been gored raked from groin to upper chest by a tusk had it been one of them a teenager the nco might have known how to talk to them used a language they understood and they would have followed him mansoor an officer from an elite unit they feared did not possess such skills they were crouched around their man none would leave him it would not be possible to carry him back to where the jeeps had stalled the wound was too deep they held his hands and there were sobs his screams had sunk to the moan of the dying mansoor had left them first he had walked along the edge of the reeds he had found easily the clovenhoofed tracks of the boar it had run away at its maximum speed throwing up mud he had found after a more thorough search the route the man had taken from the reeds and forward across open ground he had seen him going like a stack of hay towards the reeds upright carrying the man mansoor had interrogated and killed and dragging the little blownup boat with the military backpacks he could see where there was still a sheen of damp on the ground the marks where elbows knees or boots had pushed the man forward there were places beyond the mud where he could find no trace of a track then there would be brittle crusts of baked dirt where the surface had been broken and he could pick it up again how the body was carried he didnt know in his mind mansoor was certain that it had not been left in the reed beds the man in the camouflage clothing would not have come through the water of the lagoon to the barracks then thrown flash and gas grenades and taken down his comrade only to leave him when pursuit closed on them to the rats and pigs the man carried his comrade and was in front of him he watched he had an impression that the man was using what tactics of evasion were open to him not going in a straight line but cutting from one side to another breaking any pattern of movement mansoor tried to imagine what he would have done he went back to the days before the shrapnel injury had crippled him thought of how he would have attempted flight across open ground with the positive of a snipers costume and the negative of a burden he had come away from the reeds and the anger had left him with the tiredness and the sense of abject failure it was as if a new contest had started new and fresh without past history the game would be played out to the death he did not know if his thoughts had logic he had taken himself away from his job as security man to the engineer away from his father and from his wife he thought he walked alone that the slate was clean he searched the dirt ahead for the fugitive he no longer cared whether success would absolve past failure near mosul he had been shown a parcel of desert without features and had been told that an american sniper and his spotter were there and had killed an hour before he and many others had raked the sand with their eyes and the aid of lenses and had not found him the marksman had killed again as the dusk settled but then there had been no track to follow mansoor went warily roved backwards and forwards found a trail lost it and found it again he was distracted as the heat built the haze grew and the mist went a bird flew across him went from his left to his right he stopped moved not a muscle a smile softened him the ibis went far to his right towards where there was still water an old irrigation canal with a bund line beyond it he knew this territory had made it his business to learn it since his posting to the engineers home he knew where trucks that had gone off the bund had slid down where there was a burned t main battle tank and where a border watchtower was toppled the bird headed for the water and his eyeline followed it small splashes of white caught his eye and he lost the bird where the ground was highest three or four metres above where he stood almost a kilometre away there were two white vehicles fourwheel drive he knew where the man with his comrade his brother headed to he remembered the bird its grace and its death where he was the ground was dried dust and it was easy for him to hold the mans line but then it petered out he lost it beside a buffalos bones he started again to search for it if the man reached the white vehicles mansoor had lost did you see the fucking bird she had her binoculars locked over her eyes yes maam harding said what is it its the african sacred ibis miss corky told her logged of course for our ecostudy of flora and fauna its pretty she said then lapsed back into quiet she could hardly stand the boys were a few paces behind her at the pajeros the track petered out here and the only way they could go was back they didnt like it when she swore she thought it interfered with their image of themselves as protecting a maid in peril that sort of shit when she was tired or a fair bit pissed off she swore and blasphemed trying to break the image they had of her it usually screwed up theyre endangered the ibis we used to see them down by basra shagger told her abigail jones thought it wrong that she should slouch or lean against a wheel hub and out of the question that she should climb inside and get comfortable ask to be woken if anything showed anything did show a single man was out of a reed bed a wavering line of soft green in the light and heat he wore combat fatigues and when her eyes could get decent focus she fancied there were rank flashes on his shoulders and dark stains on the front of his tunic what am i watching she asked hamfist said when i was with the battalion we used to patrol up past alamara then go east to the border because it was a ratrun for arms shipments as important as the one down here theres a revolutionary guard camp at mehran a big training site and a transit for hardware resupply if we were close to the border theyd come out and eye us we might wave and shout something to spark a contact but they never responded thats their uniform iranian revolutionary guard corps and theyre serious they dont do fun on a friday night hes looking for him she turned her head away swallowed hard shagger said its down to you miss what are our rules of engagement she attempted authority didnt know how good a fist she made of it we can fire in defence of our own persons we can fire also in defence of those working with us assuming that the threat comes from inside the territory we are currently operating in what we cannot do is to fire live rounds into iranian ground under no circumstances do we shoot to kill or wound across the border what im saying is that he has first to reach wherever we establish the border to be and if they in hot pursuit cross that line real or imaginary we can blast the shit out of them conclusion there can be no iranian casualties at our hand on iranian territory understood she thought she would crumple in the heat she could have found some shade by the body of either pajero but then she could not have watched the ground where the man came careful following a zigzag path she could not have been inside with the engine and the aircon on because she would have ceded control they nodded no enthusiasm she might have lost them the one you say is an officer coming forward talk me through it hamfist towering over her hes following badgers trail miss like a tracking hound does when it has a scent where is badger shagger out in front of the officer miss and coming she saw nothing nothing with her own eyes and nothing with the aid of the binoculars the haze seemed to ripple on the ground and it hurt her to look she saw nothing except the man who advanced taking his time patient i cant see anything harding if hes as good as hes talked up to be you wont corky if you see him from here miss hes as good as dead around him there were occasional stunted heaps of dirt and he hoped he made another of them he saw a broadwinged shadow pass lazily in front of him and lifted his eyes not his head an eagle turned on a wide circle he knew eagles from scotland and kites and buzzards big birds of prey but slighter than eagles from wales he didnt think its vision would be impaired by the haze coming off the mud now that the mist was gone he thought the birds sight would be perfect and that it would have noted him and therefore had made a pass above him it had in effect checked him out and moved on if the man following him had had an eagles eye and its vantagepoint it would have been over long before badger kept to the routine hed set and stayed motionless for the count to a hundred moved for the next hundred and tried to merge with the heaps and humps he found more often now that he lost track of how far he had counted and had to start again the weight of foxy grew as if the man had weights fastened to him i reckon i have to see where we are foxy if i dont way i feel i could go off course he had worked himself around one of the heaps and stopped when it was behind him there was another to his left level with his hip he had foxy across his back his legs were slack between badgers and his head was draped on his shoulder his arms were tucked down over badgers chest and wedged there he thought the two heaps augmented by the bulging gillie suit would appear to be one larger hump that had been dumped by storms erosion and once by a water channel he started very slowly to turn his head were we right foxy dont they say in combat you have to believe in the cause and that god walks alongside you just war and all that what dyou think foxy is he alongside us dont you understand that i need an answer and youre the only fucker right now that can give me one he shifted his head changed his eyeline halfinch by halfinch a small bird pretty plumage pecked in the mud not a foot from his face the sun beat down and the heat chiselled him his eyes ached from the brightness the man tracked him the officer mansoor came slow and steady after him the rifle was in his hands and could go quickly to the shoulder for badger to grab for the glock would make a convulsion of movement and the game would be over shes a goodlooking woman and shes a lump in her brain likely itll be today she hears whether anything can happen or shes being sent home to tick off the days also likely thisll be the day her husbands hit what they called interdiction and i was too ignorant to understand were we right foxy to widow her and kill him are you going to tell me foxy the man was still about a hundred yards behind badger he had veered off to the right straightened then taken another halfdozen short paces now he had stopped he searched the ground unhurried and traversed the rifle was raised the officer mansoor took a stance with his legs a little apart his boots steady he aimed and peered through the v sight he had the needle steady on a target and fired one shot and the songbird fled badger understood its us that did it we take responsibility its not those people up in the north not the boss the cousin the friend or the major and not the jones woman and the guys with her we did it like we were faithful servants did as we were told touched forelocks didnt bitch couldnt have happened without me putting the audio in place and without you hearing their talk can we live with that foxy a second shot was fired the impact the dirt spatter was further from badger two shots fired and two heaps of earth hit perhaps the man had similar torments of exhaustion the injury in his leg ached and he wanted out anger built in him and frustration that was good for badger because a coldminded man was a more formidable opponent he talked softly and foxys ear was an inch from his mouth different when you look into their faces right when you see them playing with the kids doing everyday life if he had been alone badger would have backed his chance of crossing the open ground as better than even odds but it was not only himself there was a quaver in his voice now annoyance what are we doing here foxy what are we doing on their ground what were we ever doing in this godforsaken fucking place please foxy i have to be told another shot was fired he saw the flash as the cartridge case was ejected the report echoed away from him he didnt think the man would turn head away lose all heart but he did believe that the firing of three shots showed frustration and anger which would destroy concentration badger moved his head lost sight of the man he saw two white shapes on a horizon they were minimally small he wondered if it was there that the wire strand lay and if the burned tank was to his right and the trucks that had skidded off the bund line into stagnant water and the fallen watchtower he needed an answer from foxy but was denied it he started to move again and the silence was back no wind blew and no cloud protected him the heat haze was his friend us coming here it wasnt in my name us walking in here tanks bombs guns that wasnt in my name up in the north should i have thrown it back in their faces im a policeman foxy not a fucking soldier give me an answer that works please he thought he heard foxy thought the clipped nasal voice told him about casualties and rehabilitation clinics about the coffins coming in shiny hearses up a high street in the blazing sun or when there was snow piled at the kerbs or when rain drizzled to reflect the misery it told him about the national interest he could only hope that the haze would hide him theyre waiting for us foxy the girl and the guys are corky gestured ahead past the expanse of open ground and past the solitary man who tracked his target she refocused the lenses the binoculars found them abigail jones saw a jeep and two lorries they were short of where the first two vehicles had lost traction in the sand she wouldnt have seen it with the naked eye but the glasses pulled the scene into her face a cluster of men stood around a casualty but the new troops who had reached that point didnt stop to help merely paused long enough to be given the general direction of the flight and pursuit she could pick out different uniforms good camouflage patterns and a different scale of weaponry she recognised three rpg launchers and a machine gun she turned to corky raised an eyebrow thats irgc miss revolutionary guards not the riffraff but you knew that miss her name was called shaggers voice behind her she swung on her feet he pointed away down the track they had used in the far distance the sunlight blazed off the windscreen of the bmw saloon they had tipped off the track into shallow water dust billowed there were three or four pickups crudely painted in olive green and a land rover among them two of the pickups had machine guns fastened to crossbars behind the drivers cabs her lips must have pursed and maybe she cursed quietly shagger had an answer for her thats iraqi army likely from alqurnah and thats heavy firepower theyre carrying were between a rock and a hard place miss or a lump hammer and an anvil she said that the black hawks were in the air which meant little she was shivering couldnt halt the tremors and no longer had certainties a truth had come to mansoor the quiet allowed his thoughts to collect truth won through against his exhaustion and hunger the heat of the high sun and he realised the enormity of his failure he saw the engineer whom he had been ordered to protect leave home with his wife to go abroad in secrecy and on a journey where if his arrangements were known he would be vulnerable to attack he saw also the man in camouflage who had been dragged from the water and had resisted interrogation he could not justify his failure to alert senior officials immediately after the capture who would understand his motives he doubted that in the length and breadth of ahvaz or from one end to the other of the garrison camp he could have rooted out one man prepared to say that his actions had been reasonable given the pressures he faced he was like the dog that searched for a rabbits scent had it held it lost it and searched again for it he could not see him the fierce light mocked him often he would have sworn an oath on the book that he saw movement in the heaps and humps of dirt that stretched away from him three more times he fired and heard only the report of the bullet the man he hunted had destroyed him he might as well have exposed himself and urinated on mansoors boots the heat of the day had come and the shimmer of the ground made a greater confusion he sank to his knees for a minute no more than two he had lost the trail here the ground was dry dust and he had to search for a place no larger than a piastre where the crust was broken he followed a new line and went closer imperceptibly to a raised spur on which two heavy white vehicles waited he saw a woman there whose skirt moved in the wind and men all with the same tshirt decoration stood around her they pointed beyond him and when he turned and saw the extended cordon line approaching he knew little time was left him you have been most patient the consultant leaned forward his elbows on the desk and peered into the face of his patient a few of those who consult me are able to match your patience but not many i have explained in detail the size of the tumour where it is located what it is adjacent to and the importance of those areas in terms of speech mobility and quality of life you have listened and not interrupted for that i am grateful you will appreciate that it is my duty to take you through these matters now i can conclude he smiled it was the first time he had allowed any signal of his professional opinion to be on display he saw her jaw drop i would use what we call the gamma knife more simply that is surgical radiotherapy to extract the problem area under general anaesthetic it is a technique that we have used with good results in germany her husband had caught her arm and seemed to crumple in the shoulders nothing is foolproof and nothing is guaranteed success is based on skill and experience enough to say that we feel optimistic of a good outcome when i was called out of here while i was explaining our diagnosis it was to hear the opinions of others to whom i had given access to the scans their opinions broadly matched mine we can do the operation the alternative is that you will be dead within two months why did he persist easier by far to say that surgery was no longer an option and tell the patient to go home and spend her remaining days with her family he could not have been gainsaid but there was about her something magnificent that had captivated him he had thought her husband a ratfaced bastard and a regime man but the mans face was wet with tears we would start the necessary preoperative examinations tomorrow and i believe i could have access to surgery time at the university medical centre in hamburgeppendorf within a week had this been a german woman she would probably have reached out her hands held his cheeks and kissed him it happened often this womans expression remained stoic and her fingers stayed clasped on her lap he thought her beautiful she might have been the price of his marriage and have cost him a place in the upper echelon of lubeck society others now would be sitting in his waiting room showing perhaps less fortitude if you ring my receptionist this afternoon she will advise you of a schedule we will need details of how the account will be settled and will give you a breakdown of costs in the meantime you should hope the weather clears so that you can enjoy the old quarter of the city but do not tax yourself too greatly i will see you to your car he stood the man an engineer who made bombs that killed and mutilated troops far from their homes blubbered like a child but she was composed the tide was sliding away and the beach showed a damp ribbon of sand he stood where it was dry and could see miles along the coast line as he had that day it was where the border had run from alongside the dassower see and its shore then cut across the peninsula at its narrow point leaving priwall in the west rosenhagen and potenitz in the east it had come down from the sand dunes now a nature reserve naturschutzgebiet betreten verboten then the wire the minefields and barricades had crossed the beach and gone far out into the waters of the lubeckerbucht it had been an earlysummer day with a brisk wind but clean sunshine the pastor had brought him the lutheran priest had worn jeans an opennecked checked shirt and heavy sandals while the youthful len gibbons had dressed in grey slacks lightweight brogues and a sports jacket of quiet herringbone it had been the pastors invitation he wants to see you once more see the man he works for whom he trusts his friends cousin is a border guard and it is arranged but you must give no signal and you will see him only very briefly but it will be for him as if you touched hands they had walked on the beach and had gone towards the fence where it dropped down into the dirty baltic water a watchtower overlooked that section and a patrol boat was out in the bight it had been a naturists beach and they had gone among the flapping bosoms and shrivelled members of elderly males and had seen the guards behind the fence or up in the towers clicking their cameras there had been a joke about porn stocks in the guards camp being low they were the only clothed people on their side of the wire on the far side every man was uniformed and armed big dogs had howled at them and gibbons had seen him maybe for a halfminute and at a distance of some three hundred yards a young slightbuilt figure had come from the gorse behind the dunes and walked towards the sea with a guard antelope had stopped close to the waterline and gazed towards the barriers then turned away gibbons and the pastor had gone back through the naturists and the young sis officer had felt bonded with his asset more trusting two months later the message had come through that new courier arrangements were required and gibbons to his desk chief had spoken up on behalf of the assets request contacts had been supplied three at least because of gibbonss naivete and his superiors lack of due diligence were dead and their lives would have ended unpleasantly the experience had made len gibbons surviving by fingernail grip fight as he had been fought he had been taught in a frontoftheclass seat the value of ruthless application of his governments policy no sentiment intruded into his professional life no qualms were permitted morality he wouldnt have known how to spell it so cold near his feet there was an old pockmarked railway sleeper with heavy chains nailed to it it would have been a tiny part of the underwater system with which the east german state had sought to defend itself pathetic people wiped from history eleven summers before len gibbons had come here a teenage international swimmer from the east axel mitbauer metres freestyle had gone into the water up the coast having anointed his body with petroleum jelly and had swum fifteen and a half miles before reaching a bobbing buoy in the lubeck bight gibbons always took that story as proof of the superiority of his country his creed his calling he still felt it as strongly as he had when he had last been on this beach those years before he had never worn patriotism on his sleeve but it was warming to be on a winners team the wind whipped him pretty shells crunched under his feet he looked at his wristwatch it might already have happened or would be about to happen he thought it time to start the journey home he had done well it was a triumph and would be recognised as such by the few inside the loop good to have been at this place of failure when a success was acted out deutsche presseagentur lubeck police report fatal shooting on the campus of the university medical school the cousin heard it on a news flash on the local station he had tuned in on his car radio for that purpose thats my boy he murmured he ignored the no smoking sign in the car lit a cigarillo and drove a little faster down the wide highway he felt good like after the best sex or a decent dinner and hed stay with the station for updated news deutsche presseagentur lubeck eyewitnesses at the university medical school of the unesco heritage city of lubeck report two dead and one injured in a gun attack outside the neurosurgery unit of the teaching hospital a confirmed fatality is steffen weber a consultant at the hospital who was shot on the buildings steps an unidentified gunman fled from the scene of the attack police have now cordoned off the hospital grounds the swap had been done vehicles switched the clothing and the weapon would go back to berlin for disposal and the friend drove carefully within the speed limit towards the ferry port on the road to travemunde he knew these people had had experience of them for more than thirty years of his working life he had been on the periphery of the teams that had gone into beirut for the revenge killings after the munich olympiad and those hitting targets in north africa rome paris london and damascus he would have said he could read the feelings of the trigger men whether they fired pistols at close range or detonated bombs remotely this one was extraordinary the man beside him was quiet relaxed and had yawned a couple of times he showed no sign of having spent a bad night on a cot bed in an outer office at a local synagogue it was on the radio made a news flash and interrupted an item about the preparations for the christmas fair and the hope of a boost to the citys economy they have not spoken of him yet they will give them time deutsche presseagentur lubeck a lubeck police spokesperson said that steffen weber consultant in neurosurgery was pronounced dead at the scene after being shot on the steps into the building where he had his office also killed she said was a foreign national as yet unnamed and a driver from the iranian embassy in berlin was wounded but with no lifethreatening injuries the unidentified gunman is believed to have escaped from the hospital grounds in a commercial black nissan van driven by an accomplice she sat on a hard chair in a corridor her husbands body and that of the consultant were beyond swing doors twice she had tried to breach them and twice she had been gently but firmly refused entry no one spoke to her if she spoke to them her language was not understood many hurried past and the swing doors flapped open for them but not for her there were policemen doctors in gowns nurses she was not offered tea coffee or water she was forgotten a woman came past her escorted by uniformed men and bureaucrats in suits she was blonde expensive and bootfaced naghmeh assumed her to be the wife of the man who had tried and failed to shield her husband her head hurt where her hair had been wrenched and there was blood on her face and hands but no one seemed to see it deutsche presseagentur lubeck a police spokesperson has confirmed that the fatalities following a shooting in the grounds of the university medical school were a neurosurgery expert steffen weber married with one child and a foreign national believed to be an iranian male who was escorting his wife from the building following a consultation with dr weber an iranian embassy driver was shot twice as he attempted to block the gunmans escape across the street at the time of the shooting was twentythreeyearold manfred hartung a student the two men and the woman came down the steps from the doors they were smiling and radiant laughing the driver of the waiting car opened the back door for the lady and a short man young wearing workmans overalls laid a shovel on the pavement and stepped forward i saw he held a handgun he aimed at the man who held the womans arm but the other attempted to put his body in the line of fire the gunman shot four times two bullets hit the one i now know to have been a doctor and when he fell two more were fired at the man who was with the woman the first put that man onto the steps and the woman fell over him but the gunman pulled back her hair with one hand placed his weapon against the mans forehead and fired again the driver put himself in the way of the gunman and was shot at close range it was very fast like a film and i doubt it lasted more than fifteen seconds it was an assassination the gunman did not run but walked at a brisk pace up the road and a van drove him away the talk was of cuts small neat slashes to the budget on which his empire depended the director general had human resources finance overseas stations and purchasing in his office and they nitpicked around costs and outgoings fiefdoms were defended and he had the text on the television screen that was on the wall behind his department managers the politicians demanded savings but were wary of the power he exercised if he were to leak that the nations security was threatened by pennypinching the westminster crowd would capitulate he played the game went through the processes something would be offered but not much they were on the matter of foreign travel business class or cattle truck and he read the text reporting an incident in a distant town in northern germany it was enough for him to collate the sums three plus three made six take the bastard down len he had said and the head had ducked in understanding gibbons always described as a safe pair of hands had delivered and might get a minor gong out of it for long service but not much more and there would be no meeting in this office with congratulations bouncing off the walls and no pumped handshake it was deniable and would be kept that way but he felt a frisson of excitement and his blood flowed faster matter closed business completed he switched off the television screen a good outcome miss are we fucked not a question that abigail jones needed to answer pretty bloody clear she strained to hear better sounds filtered in her ears there was the light wind that ruffled her hair the fullness of her skirt the scarf at her throat and sang a little against the radio antennae on the pajeros harding had a hacking cough hamfist had the habit when tension rose of slapping the palm of his hand across the stock of his weapon and making a rhythm of it corky kicked stones he found on the bund line some went off in ricochets and a few cannoned against the bulletproofed sides of the pajeros shagger sang a hymn barely audible it would have been one hed learned as a kid in chapel in welsh hamfist asked again are we fucked miss if we are what can we do about it put it this way miss im not going into the hands of the crowd in front or the crowd behind no chance miss abigail jones thought of all the women in the sis those who did powerwalking up and down the corridors jogged in the midday break were shagged by line managers and desk chiefs to get up the ladder faster contributed at seminars and thinktanks and wanted responsibility they would sweat for it and spread their legs to be given it she hadnt sought it and it had landed in her lap where are you girls when youre needed to share the load more important where was badger prime importance where was the chopper nearly fucked but still a little slack to wind in she listened for the black hawk but didnt hear it she knew it was coming was airborne and had the coordinates she knew also that the crew would have flown special forces done difficult stuff was experienced in extraction but it had not yet showed minimal slack but a bit you meant that hamfist about not going into a cage she didnt know where he was how far forward didnt know how far he had to come the iranians described by her guys as irgc were in a cordon line and coming through they were some four hundred yards from her her boys and the two pajeros they had good firepower her team couldnt match the hardware and came steadily towards the single man in the olive green with the officers flashes who tracked badger of badger there was neither sight nor sound she had powerful binoculars and the boys did they also had trained eyes for watching ground and the subtle changes movement made abigail had not seen him neither had shagger corky hamfist nor harding who had the best eyes of them all it was as though he had disappeared burrowed into the ground and gone the cordon line came to the officer she couldnt know what was said but saw the little cameo played out authority gone rank lost humiliation on show he was spoken to the line had stopped and his head didnt lift he might have mumbled an answer a more senior officers hand thrashed across his face and there would have been a drawn pistol in it her lenses showed the grey or white flashes of teeth falling then the blood drops he was hit again was on his knees and kicked how would it have been in her own crowd if she failed to bring badger home and foxy if they were paraded on state television dead or alive and if a government had to squirm out apologies how would it be not kicked not losing teeth not pistolwhipped but out on her neck erased from memory shed be to those who knew a cult figure of ridicule and hate perhaps better to be kicked miss their cage isnt for me hamfist said it distantly as if each minute her importance counted a little less she looked into their faces hardings was impassive told her nothing corky wouldnt meet her gaze shagger murmured that goddamn hymn could we go across country it wasnt rhetorical she didnt know the answer there was a chorus but clearest was harding we cant maam go down get round the firepower in front of us and trek into iranian territory go right or left and we hit water we wouldnt do a halfmile and theyd take the vehicles out with the weaponry they have it would be a shooting war and not on ground of our choosing and it does nothing for the reason were here for the guys badger and foxy if youve looked behind you maam the outlook is worse behind was the hard place the anvil the elevated track on which they had come was blocked by the iraqi vehicles the mounted machine guns had men behind them and she could see the layers of belt ammunition lit by sunlight they were calibre weapons and the pajeros would not be able to go down into the dirt and survive that sort of attack they were around two hundred yards behind her and the boys local people local troops loathed the private security contractors they might have had a decent relationship with their mentors in the american or british army but the private soldiers not answerable to civilian or military law were detested a single shot was fired from a rifle she ducked then focused an officer in a swagger pose legs apart and barrel chest pushed forward stood in front of the land rovers bonnet held an ak and had it pointed to the sun a warning near to the officer gesticulating was the sheik who had lost a bmw topoftherange saloon she turned looked the other way to the front the irgc men and their officer were closer now and the beaten kicked man lay in the mud far in their rear the first shot was answered she heard the crack of a bullet going high between a rock and a hard place a lump hammer and an anvil she searched the ground and couldnt see him two forces and two shots she had nothing sensible to say and left her boys hanging on her silence if they were taken she would have a fair chance of not growing old in either the evin gaol of tehran or the abu ghraib lockup in baghdad the boys might have a poor chance of ever smelling fresh air again particularly if an engineer had gone into a gutter and bled his life away and especially if tribesmen from a marsh village had been killed in the breakout with the pajeros she searched again every damn stone every rotted reed stalk a buffalos white bones and a frame for a boat encased in mud she saw a movement and thought it was a rabbit the lump hammer and the anvil came closer maybe less than a hundred metres to each side of them she heard the scrape as one of her boys armed his weapon for fucks sake miss what now it was because they had come back for him for badger it was because badger had gone to get foxy she could have screamed it all bloody sentiment the crap about going the extra yard to retrieve a colleague obligations in a world she didnt inhabit she sucked in her breath and would scream that the bloody hole they found themselves in was their fault blame should not be levelled at her she bit it down clamped her teeth on her tongue felt blood on her lips and heard them the big blades were spinning pretty circles and the two came dark and fast with the profile of killer dogs over the last of the bund lines there were no pylons here and no phone wires slung from poles the black hawks could have been twenty feet above the ground could not have been more than forty she had no more strength and her knees buckled she could see when the black hawks were above them the faces of the cockpit crew then the hatch gunners they slowed and banked a little then hovered and she saw that one had taken a position towards the anvil and the other faced the lump hammer in addition to the firepower from the hatches there were rockets on pods slung forward below the stubbed wings the rock had stopped and the hard place stayed static abigail jones was trembling and could barely stand upright under the downdraughts she cupped her hands and screamed his name futile the boys took a cue from her they all screamed five feeble voices against the thunder of the engines she had no link to the pilot but she could see him clearly through the shield of the cockpit he pointed to his wristwatch and tapped it hard like this was no fairground joyride and time was precious the rotors kicked up dust the dirt and sand swirled round them and it was in her mouth and nose flattening her loose clothing against her torso and legs the boys were spewing coughing and there was a curtain round them of sand dirt debris stones that scoured their faces the curtain was dense enough for her not to see any longer the lump hammer or the anvil she lost her view of the rock and the hard place she was choking and her screams had died he came through the curtain she didnt know where from he was low bent and shuffled the downblast of the blades rocked him it was shagger who reached him first ten paces from her and now clear of the curtain then harding who dragged off the headpiece he was huge in the gillie suit and seemed to understand little his eyes were glazed and without recognition first abigail jones saw the bare white feet trailing from the bottom of the suit then the head that lolled on badgers chest corky had her no ceremony and one black hawk came down the skids bounced once and the other flew cover above corky had hold of her collar and his other hand was between her legs and she felt herself airborne thrown high and forward the gunners gloved hand yanked her into the interior badger came next and it was a struggle for the crew to get him up he neither helped nor resisted them hamfist followed then the rest and they climbed steeply her guts dropped lower than her knees before they pulled away flew for safety the two gunners had a moment of fun they shot up the pajeros until the flames started and black smoke spiralled they went out fast shagger shouted in her ear competed with the engine power he wont let go of him he has foxy harding yelled in her other ear cold dead been gone for hours but hes not loosing him she said with a wonderment all that time through all that carrying him already dead with what was chasing him its incredible a miracle a gunner had the name dwayne schultz stamped on his jacket passed her a headset and she heard the pilot they were to overfly basra and go direct to kuwait city she shrugged not her decision she twisted in the seat and could see back up the fuselage and past the gunners squatting body badger wore the suit and his hands were wrapped across his chest through the open flap she could see foxys head and arms a little of his shoulders she could see also some of the wounds on his body the responsibility weighed on her and the cost good to have you back with us badger to have both of you chapter he was early and confused it was pretty much like being a national serviceman new to his corps not daring to be late on parade and standing by his made bed with the folded blankets on it waiting for the sergeant to pitch them onto the drill yard doug bentley was early because he hadnt known how long it would take him to get to the town at that time of night he was confused because no one hed met or spoken to had seemed to know the form just best bib and tucker doug and all the gear it was past eleven and other than on a british legion night that was way past doug bentleys bedtime most of the pubs had closed the chinese was only doing slack trade and the last bus had gone through he stood outside the cross keys and it was cold properly cold with no moon to speak of a clear sky and a hard frost forecast hed taken the precaution of wearing a wool pullover under his white shirt which made his blazer tight but better a little discomfort than being seen to shiver there had been a phone call taken by beryl and passed to him from their local organiser around the time they were having their tea that was all the warning hed had and of course doug completely up to you as to whether you turn out but others will be there dont ask me any more because i dont know anything the big decision was made to go even if it meant a taxi fare to get home others came looked as lost as himself men from bath melksham frome and chippenham two from swindon and the hungerford fellow whod been cavalry they all wore their polished shoes the usual slacks and blazers and had their white gloves and their standards in the leatherette cases well obvious that a hearse was coming through but no one knew the name on the box or where hed bought it he was glad of the company and them being there made it real they formed a casual line as they always did a little down the street from the big pub and opposite the war memorial he didnt like to show off his ignorance so didnt quiz his colleagues but he realised they were all in the same boat when questions were put to him answers were in short supply so be it he followed the actions of others and put his pole together letting the standard hang free he checked that the black bow at the top wasnt creased and started to hear voices if he tilted his head a little and looked back to the arched entrance of the cross keys he could see people emerging a man in a striped suit with an open camel overcoat and a trilby low on his forehead said bit of a dump dont you think bob probably all right on a spring morning certainly not a november evening i suppose if thats what was wanted it was right to do it itll bring closure it was a good result and achieved at a rather low cost cant ask more than that the thickset man with him might have been doug bentley thought a bodyguard he nodded his head on which the hair was almost shorn and might have murmured yes director they crossed the road had to wait for an old saloon speakers thumping a young woman with fine golden hair hanging loose and bright under a streetlamp parked up the high street and came at a jog towards the cross keys she met a man another suit but creased and with shapeless trousers its len isnt it and youre abigail good to meet funny old place this but a funny old occasion dont get me wrong im not against it only that its a bit leftside irregular sort of off the beaten track what is it a week since you were back a long week and the colleague bizarre out on his feet when he went into the chopper and wouldnt let go of foxy you remember they were badger and foxy and was talking to him soft and quiet all the way to kuwait a lengthy flight even in a black hawk when we landed badger had to be separated from the body it was stark bollock naked weird it took two of my escort to get him to free it the corpse went into the care of the ambassador formalities to be gone through we had to quit sharpish and did we were out on the first london flight straight after hed had a medical what did i expect that he might sit with me put his business seat flat and sleep he went into economy and i never saw him until heathrow frankly len i might have enjoyed a drink with him at the airport and we might have shared a ride to god we went through tough times in a tough place and in a sense were together dont quote me or ill throttle you but he walked past me in the concourse and said not a word like i didnt exist the last i saw of badger he was at a bus stop waiting for the shuttle creepy it all went well i had time for a quick shop on the way out for some marzipan useful as a present for home and my office then it was a cloud of dust and gone i assume he knows how it all turned out i dont know who told him if anyone did we sent a message to the opposition sent it in clear and loud will it be listened to what matters is that we sent it and itll hurt them and bloody their nose i value that as justification good where should we be standing is this right or should we be on the other side where he is i suppose but can you believe it that big bastard cut me dead in the bar didnt know me we stand near to the director but on pain of death we dont speak to him we dont show the world we know him did i get a glass of sherry did i hell did i get a nod and recognition not yet i think it was something to be proud of ill catch you the one shed called len crossed the road now empty and took a place a dozen steps from the director doug bentleys eyes darted she had a pretty face with frankness in the eyes and a jut at her chin her cheeks were red and the freckles alive she wore old jeans and a quilted anorak and every few seconds she swept the hair off her face he realised she needed a moment of privacy from view and lit up a cigarette he looked the other way up the high street not down it and saw the woman he recognised gagged for a moment saw her and wondered about her blouse the buttons on the front another woman was hurrying down the high street with two girls skinny teenagers in tow so much for doug bentley to absorb and a guy was hovering behind ellie ellie wore black and her blouse was white but not buttoned high he could see the ornament she wore and wanted to stare had to force himself not to he was uncertain whether the buttons were out of order the other woman caught up youre ellie thats right and you are liz and these are my daughters it wasnt a pretty divorce but i was told this afternoon what was happening wasnt told much else wasnt really told anything except that i might want to be here i took the girls straight out of college and we hit the road ive moved on but that doesnt mean i dont remember the good times with him and i respect him you have my deep sympathy thank you liz thats really kind i dont have any answers and i dont even know where to go to get them im utterly devastated he was such a wonderful man so caring and kind all i feel is emptiness this is piers from the office where i work defence and hes being very supportive foxy was such a generous man and so much loved whats happening here tells me he died a hero and this is the least he can be given what he deserved so much to tell beryl might keep her up half the night smug little sod piers he was standing too close to ellie the bell sounded dougs line shuffled straightened and the bottom piece of the pole went into the leather slot above his privates his hands immaculate in the gloves took the strain of the standard a policeman had walked out into the high street and was waving brusquely at a car to go through and leave the road clear like they always did he could see across the high street the women the top man and his minder bikers had joined them and they cupped cigarettes which glowed in the near darkness lights were coming on in the upper rooms above doug bentleys line of colleagues and the war memorial further up the pavement a man was in a heavy tartan dressinggown with his pyjama trousers and bedroom slippers a woman on the other side of the street had put on a quilted dressinggown but a nightdress hem peeped free the bell tolled from the tower of st bartholomew and all saints and more came out the town seemed to wake the pavement was well lined opposite him could have been two deep and plenty more on his side but no reporters no cameras and none of the satellite trucks the television brought the blue lights came up the hill flashing garishly it would have passed the pheonix bar and the methodist church the entrance to the rope yard and the front of the dental clinic it would now be level with the wagon and horses the lights were on a police motorcycle they had the standards high doug bentley was next to a canal zoner and beyond him was a para from their association a man slipped into place beside him he gave him a glance fast scruffily dressed what doug bentley would have called out of place in old cord trousers that had smooth bits above the knees a tshirt a windcheater and a casual acrylic beanie hat he hadnt shaved the police motorcycle came level with the standards and crawled he looked again to the side it was wrong that a man should stand close to their line and be turned out like a vagrant the blue lights went slowly and lit the face he blanched and the standard rocked the face was burned might have had a blowtorch at it there were big circles where the flesh was raw and the skin was broken and they were coated in a cream that glistened he thought the man had been under attack by mosquitoes or flies the face was gaunt the hearse came a funeral director walked ahead of it he had a good stride and swung his stick with practised ease doug bentley recognised him from some of the daylight repatriations the escort was not what he was used to no police car no military range rover no backup hearse but in essence it was the same and the legion people gave it reality with the gathering opposite the crowds whod abandoned their beds or the latenight stuff on television and the bars they dipped the standards he should have hung his head and looked at the pavement but he could tilt a little and it would not be noticed he knew who it was would have been an idiot not to have known the face was ravaged as if the man had starved and the pocked cheeks were sunken he wondered where it came from the name badger his neck had the scrawniness of an old mans and the coat hung loose the man badger had his hands in his pockets and kept them there while on both sides of the street men stiffened and stood erect doug bentley did not feel the hands in the pockets showed disrespect likely they had been so close that respect was proven he could see into the hearse but only a little of the box was visible normal times there was a tightpinned union flag on it it was shapeless and camouflaged there seemed to be a thousand tags of green and black soft brown and sandcoloured tabs of material woven into it the dirt was obvious and the mud stains and the woman liz first wife held her daughters close to her all weeping and ellie had stepped off the pavement into the road and put the palm of her hand on the glass abigail had her face turned away as if she couldnt halt the tears and didnt want it known len stood tall and the director was at attention stiff his man had slipped on an old military beret and saluted doug bentleys arm was dragged down and his standard shook he realised he had the weight of badger to support and did it he thought the man so wrecked that he should have been in a hospital bed not cold on the street of wootton bassett the stick was swung the feet pivoted the top hat went again onto the funeral directors head and he walked the hearse followed him there were little shouts could have been from the bikers well done well done mate well done my boy well done a few clapped the voice beside him was soft little more than a murmur not in your name foxy and not in mine the standards were raised and the order was given for them to fall out he could take the pole from the slot without toppling the man but the weight slackened he separated the pole into its sections furled the standard and stowed it he heard little bursts of talk the blue lights were down the street and moving away and while he watched them they seemed to speed the pavements were clearing fast and there was the roar of harleys bmws and triumphs as the bikers went the women were arm in arm coming back to the cross keys and the bar and hed lost the others abigail and len the director and the bodyguard that an important man warranted and the policeman who had done the traffic control the one he had supported badger threaded his way through the thinning crowds and walked badly as if he had big blisters he seemed to sway and the light lessened on his back doug bentley watched him as far as he could then headed for the car park behind the big supermarket and the library where his taxi would be waiting he felt he had been there wherever it was and that he had lived through it whatever had happened there and was humbled to have been a part of it he imagined sand and dirt and burning heat the clock on the tower struck midnight a new day had started the man was gone like it was a job done and the high street was empty the night closed on him
