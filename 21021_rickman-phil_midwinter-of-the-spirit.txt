midwinter of the spirit phil rickman part one imprint it this is where it walks washing her hands merrily looked up and became very still convinced in this grey lingering moment that she was seeing the imprint what she saw in the cracked and liverspotted mirror was a smudgy outline hovering beyond her left shoulder in the womens lavatory with its stone walls and flagged floor through the bubbleglass in the door a bleary ochre glow seeped from the oil lamp in the passageway where for some reason there was no electricity this was where it walked huw had explained in his soft matflat yorkshire voice david hockney on downers it rumoured apparently to be the shade of a preacher named griffith who heaped sermons like hot coals on hapless hillfarming folk towards the end of the nineteenth century but also known as the grey monk because this was what it most resembled and this was where it walked where it walked merrily focused on her own drained face in the mirror was this where madness began are they often caught short then the exarmy chaplain charlie headland had asked a few minutes earlier while merrily was thinking why do they always walk why dont they run like hell in desperation looking for a way out of this dismal routine the course tutor huw owen had blinked a crumpled old hippy in a discoloured dogcollar no im serious charlie insisted do any of them still feel a need to pee or do they leave all that behind charles huw being patient not rising to it there hasnt always been a lavatory at the end of that passage not smiling either huw would laugh sometimes wildly in the pub at night but in the stonewalled lecture room he never lost his focus it was about setting an example outside of all this huw said you should always strive to live a full free life but in deliverance remain watchful and analytical and careful not to overreact to something as innocuous as an imprint this whole grey monk thing had arisen because of huw needing an example of what he meant by imprints as distinct from visitors who usually were parents or close friends appearing at your bedside or in a favourite chair on the night of their deaths often a onceonly apparition to say everything is ok or volatiles loosecannon energy forms dislodging plates and table lamps and commonly but sometimes inaccurately called poltergeists when this place was a nonconformist chapel huw had told them the present womens toilet had been some kind of vestry which was where griffith the preacher apparently helpless with lust for a married woman in sennybridge had been drinking hard into the night was subsequently seen striding white and naked on the hill at dawn and then had been found dead back here his head cracked on a flagstone the room stinking of brandy sure these things happened in lonely parishes merrily pulled down a paper towel and began to dry her hands not hurrying resisting the urge to whirl suddenly around and catch griffith crazed and naked forming out of the dampness in the wall she would not be bloodywell scared she would observe with detachment imprints were invariably harmless they appeared vanished occasionally messed with the atmosphere but they never accosted you they were in fact unaware of you having no feelings no consciousness their actions rarely varied they appeared like a wooden cuckoo from a clock only silently and no they did not appear to feel the need to pee if an imprint responded to you then it was likely to be something else a visitor or worse an insomniac and you had to review your options and how basically do we know which is which big bald charlie headland had demanded then charlie was simple and belligerent onward christian soldiers and needed confrontation we have tests huw explained after a while you might start feeling maybe you no longer have to apply them youll feel you know whats required been here before already done that youll feel youve attained a sensitivity now youve got to watch that temptation because meaning psychic powers huw clive wells interrupted clive was oldmoney and high church and naturally suspicious of huw with his ancient blue canvas jacket his shaggy grey hair his permanent stubble psychic powers thats what you mean by sensitivity nooo huw stared down at the holes in his trainers its not necessarily the same thing in fact im inclined to distrust people who go on about their powers they start to rely on what they think of as their own ability and they and anybody else who relies on what they say can be deceived i was about to say ive found it dangerous to rely too heavily on your perceived sensitivity that feeling of heightened awareness that can be an illusion too we still need all the time to stay close to an established procedure we need that discipline clive its one of the churchs strengths charlie the chaplain nodded briskly being all for discipline and procedure make sure you put reason above intuition huw said beware of inspiration that include divine inspiration clive demanded huw directed a bleak blue gaze at him how do you know when its divine clive stiffened because im a priest because i have faith listen beware of being too simplistic man said huw coldly theyd all gone quiet at this dusk clogging the grimy diamondpaned window behind huw melding with mountains and low cloud late october long nights looming merrily wishing she was home in front of the vicarage fire i mean dont get me wrong huw was hunched up on a corner of his desk by the barestone inglenook all im saying is he looked suddenly starved that we must strive to know the true god evil lies to you evil is plausible evil butters you up tells you what you want to hear we need to beware of what you might call disinformation hells bells charlie chuckled trying to diffuse the atmosphere times like this you begin to wonder if you havent walked into the wrong course more like mi imprints and visitors weepers breathers hitchhikers indeed important to keep them in their place lad if we overdramatize if we wave our arms and rail against the powers of darkness and all this heavymetal crap if we inflate it then we glorify it we bloat what might simply be a nasty little virus when all it requires is a mild antibiotic i suppose said barry ambrose a worriedlooking vicar from wiltshire if you like take a break shall we huw slid from the desk cue for merrily to stand up and announce that she was going to brave the ladies loo deliverance it meant exorcism when back in the christian exorcism study group had voted to change its name to the christian deliverance study group it was presumably an attempt to desensationalize the job deliverance sounded less medieval less sinister less plain weird but it changed nothing your job was to protect people from the invasion of their lives by entities which even half the professed christians in this country didnt believe in you had the option these days to consider them psychological forces but after a couple of days here you tended not to the journey each morning just before first light from the hotel in brecon to this stark chapel in the wild and lonely uplands was itself coming to represent the idea of entering another dimension merrily would be glad to leave yesterday theyd been addressed by their second psychiatrist on the problem of confusing demonic possession with forms of schizophrenia theyd have to work closely with psychiatrists part of the local supportmechanism they would each need to assemble best to choose your shrink with care huw had said after the doctor had gone because youd almost certainly at some time need to consult him or her on a personal level and then noticing clive wells failing to smother his scorn hed spent just over an hour relating case histories of ministers who had gone mad or become alcoholic or disappeared for long periods or battered their wives or mutilated themselves when a deliverance priest in middlesbrough was eventually taken into hospital theyd found fortyseven crosses razored into his arms an extreme case mind mostly the deliverance ministry was consultative local clergy with problems of a psychic nature on their patch would phone you for advice on how best to handle it only in severe or persistent cases were you obliged to go in personally also genuine demonic possession was very rare and although most of the work would involve hauntings real ghosts unquiet spirits or insomniacs were also relatively infrequent ninety per cent were basic volatiles or imprints like the monk ah yes monks what you needed to understand about these ubiquitous spectral clerics huw said was that they were a very convenient shape robed and cowled and faceless a monk lacked definition in fact anyones aura the electromagnetic haze around a lifeform might look vaguely like a monks cowl so could an imprint a residue so that was why there were so many ghostly monks around see oh just bugger off merrily crumpled the paper towel tossed it at the wall where the smudge had been and went over to investigate the smudge turned out to be not something in the air but in the wall itself an imprint of an old doorway the ghost of a doorway three days of this and you were seeing them everywhere merrily sighed retrieved the towel binned it picked up her cigarette from the edge of the washbasin there you go it was probably the combination of poor light and the smoke in the mirror which had made the outline appear to move it was rare apparently for deliverance ministers or counsellors actually to experience the phenomena they were trying to divert and anyway as huw had just pointed out a perceived experience should not be trusted trust nothing least of all your own senses merrily took a last look at herself in the mirror a small darkhaired person in a sloppy sweater the only woman among nine ministers on this course little dolly of a clergyperson nice legs dinky titties dermot her church organist had said that the day he exposed to her his own organ she shuddered dermot had worn a monkish robe that morning and no underpants so naturally she no longer trusted monks or for that matter priests like charlie headland who looked as if they wouldnt mind spanking you but she was inclined to trust the reverend huw owen faded and weary on the outside but tough and flexible as old leather something of the monk about huw also the celtic hermitmonk in his lonely cell she dropped her cigarette down the loo oh well back into the twilight zone the passage still had lockers and iron hooks on the wall from when the chapel had been an outward bound centre owned by some midland education authority it had changed hands discreetly a couple of years ago was now jointly owned by the church of england and the church in wales although it seemed few people even inside the church knew it was currently used as a training centre for exorcists the door to the big stone room was open she heard muted discussion from inside a shrill affected laugh charlie headland was wedged against the jamb crunching crisps he shook the packet at merrily prawn mayonnaise flavour merrily helped herself to a crisp charlie looked down at her with affection youve got a lot of bottle mrs watkins what just for going for a wee in a haunted loo charlie chuckled on occasion he would fling an arm around merrily and squeeze her twice hed patted her bottom you wouldnt be laughing merrily said if that thing was in the gents instead charlie grimaced and nodded munched meditatively for a while then patted her arm lightly got a little girl i hear not any more a woman she tells me shes sixteen just oh blimey whered you leave her suitably caged one hopes shes staying with friends in the village not this village back home charlie balled his crisp packet tossed it in the air and caught it i reckon he made that up you know who huw that story about the hellfire preacherman who died in the ladies bogs its too pat merrily pulled the door to cutting off the voices from the stone room why would he do that giving us all little tests isnt he you particularly youre the only woman amongst us so theres one place you need to visit alone if youd suddenly started crossing your legs and holding it till you got back to the hotel hed know you were a little timid or if you came back rubbing your hands and saying youd detected a cold patch youd be revealing how impressionable you were be difficult to spot a cold patch in this place youre not wrong said charlie talk about spartan not what most of them were expecting neithers huw awfully downmarket isnt he clives quite insulted expected someone solemn and erudite like his old classics master at eton what about you after fifteen years with the military no problem at all for me funny chap though old huw been through the mill you can tell that wears the scar tissue like a badge charlie dug his hands into his jacket pockets i think huws here to show us where we stand as of now which is he nodded at the closed door out in the cold lunatic fringe half the clergy quite openly dont believe in god as we know him any more and here we all are spooking each other with talk of breathers and hitchhikers and insomniacs not for the first time since her arrival merrily shivered what exactly is a hitchhiker charlie whats it sound like to you something that wants a free ride all the way to hell presumably said charlie mustnt overdramatize merrily reminded him as the door opened and huw stood there unkempt his dogcollar yellowing at the rim putting the telly on now huw said hesitantly if thats all right merrily said cheerfully i didnt notice anything at all in the lavatory huw huw nodded there was a clear dent in the womans forehead also a halfknitted vshaped scab over her left eye the bruised one merrily had seen several women in this condition before although not recently and not under these circumstances obviously mostly in the hostel in liverpool when she was a curate this was what done it the woman was holding out a green pottery ashtray an oldfashioned pub ashtray like a dog bowl see chipped all down the side not from when it hit me like when it fell on the floor afterwards i see the mans voice was calm and gentle and unsurprised not huw too deep too posh so it came flying i shouldve saved the other pieces shouldnt i i didnt think thats quite all right mrs bleep were not the police now the ashtray was where on the sideboard always kept on the sideboard you could see the sideboard behind her looked like early sixties teak with big gilt knobs on the drawers on the oncewhite wall above it was a halfscrubbed stain as though shed started to wipe it off and then thought whats the bloody point so you actually saw it rising up yeah i it come it just come through the air straight at me like whizzing you know this was a very unhappy woman early thirties and losing it all fast eyes downcast except once when shed glanced up in desperation youve got to believe me and merrily could see a corona of blood around the pupil of the damaged eye couldnt you get out of the way couldnt you duck no i never the woman backing off as though the thing was flying straight at her again like it was too quick i couldnt move i mean you dont expect you cant believe whats happening can you did you experience anything else what was there any kind of change in the atmosphere of this room the temperature was it warmer or colder its always cold in here cant afford the gas can i her eyes filling up no he said im sorry tell me where was your husband when this was happening what your husband did he see anything nah he he wasnt here was he plucking at the sleeve of her purple blouse merrily wrote down husband on her pad he was out the woman said has he had any experiences himself in this house he aint seen nothing nothing come flying at him i reckon hes heard like banging noises and stuff though stuff you better ask him have you discussed it much between yourselves minimal shake of the head why not i dunno do i a flicker of exasperation then her body went slack again what you supposed to say about it its the kids innit i dont want nothing to happen to the ki the womans face froze one eye closed all right huw walked back to his desk pocketing the remote control turning to face the students well hold it there any thoughts merrily found shed underlined husband twice they looked at one another nobody wanting to speak first someone yawned nick cowan the former social worker from coventry huw said nick not impressed nick cowan slid down in his canvasbacked chair council house is this huw i dont think you told us would that make a difference its an old trick thats all its a cliche they want rehousing so shes faking it is she well obviously i cant i mean you asked for initial impressions and thats mine based on twentyfive years experience and about a thousand reports from local authorities after that rubbishy film came out amityville whatever its an old scam but they keep on trying it because they know you cant prove it one way or the other and if you dont rehouse them theyll go to the press and then the housell get a reputation and so nick felt for his dogcollar as if to make sure it was still there he was the only one of the group who wore his to these sessions every day he seemed grateful for the dogcollar it represented some kind of immunity perhaps he thought he no longer had to justify his opinions submit reports get his decisions rubberstamped and ratified by the elected representatives just the one big boss now all right then huw went to sit on his desk next to the tv and leaned forward hands clasped merrily he was bound to ask her the only female in the group on the tv screen the woman with one closed eye looked blurred and stupid well merrily said she isnt faking that injury is she how do you think she got the injury merrily do we get to see the husband you think he beat her up id like to know what he has to say huw said nothing looked down at his clasped hands and see what kind of guy he is huw still didnt look at her there was quiet in the stone room thered been a lot of that quite often the course had the feeling of a retreat prayer and contemplation merrily was starting to see the point it was about being receptive while you had to be pragmatic these werent decisions which in the end you could make alone beyond the diamond panes the horn of the moon rose over a foothill of penyfan ok huw stepped down his face was deeply tightly lined as though the lines had been burned in with hot wire but his body was still supple and he moved with a wary grace like an urban tomcat well take another break he switched off the tv ejected the tape id like you to work out between you how you yourselves would proceed with this case who youd involve how much youd keep confidential whether youd move quickly or give the situation a chance to resolve itself main question is she lying is she deluded merrily you look like you could do with another ciggy come for a walk fluctuation the mountains hunched around the chapel in its hollow like some dark sisterhood over a cauldron you had to go to the end of the drive before you could make out the meagre lights of the village it was awesomely lonely up here but it was home to huw who sniffed appreciatively at merrilys smoke relaxing into his accent i were born a bastard in a little bwddyn tother side of that brow gone now but you can find the foundations in the grass if you have a bit of a kick around i wondered about that a yorkshireman called huw owen youre actually welsh then me mam were waitressing up in sheffield by the time i turned two so ive no memories of it she never wanted to come back just me fortyodd years on back to the land of my father whoever the bugger was got five big rugged parishes to run now two of them strong welshspeaking im learning slowly getting there cant be easy huw waved a dismissive arm listen its a holiday luv learning welsh concentrates the mind cold though int it certainly colder than hereford merrily pulled her cheap waxed coat together for all its only fortyodd miles away settled in there now are you more or less they followed a stony track in the last of the light walkers were advised to stick to the paths even in the daytime or they might get lost and wind up dying of hypothermia or gunshot wounds the regular soldiers from brecon and the shadowy sas from hereford did most of their training up here in the beacons no camouflaged soldiers around this evening though no helicopters no flares even the buzzards had gone to roost but to merrily the silence was swollen after theyd tramped a couple of hundred yards she said can we get this over with huw laughed im not daft huw no youre not that he stopped from the top of the rise they could see the white eyes of headlights on the main road crossing the beacons all right huw sat down on the bottom tier of what appeared to be a halfdemolished cairn ill be frank have to say i were a bit surprised when i heard hed offered the job to a young lass merrily stayed on her feet not that young you look frighteningly young to me you must look like a little child after canon thb dobbs huw pronounced the name in deliberate block capitals mr dobbs merrily said yes you know him then not well nobody knows the old bugger well ive never actually met him with him being in and out of hospital for over a year theres a treat to look forward to huw said ive heard hes a traditionalist oh aye hes that all right no bad thing mind i can understand that merrily finally sat down next to him aye huw said but does your new bishop it was coming the point of their expedition the pale moon was limp above a black flank of penyfan bit of a new broom michael henry hunter huw said as a rabbit crossed the track so im told bit of a trendy bit flash so he appoints a female diocesan exorcist merrily said because thats a cool newbroom thing to do you said it only he hasnt appointed me not yet canon dobbs is still officially in harness i havent been appointed to anything oh really huw tossed a pebble into the darkness so are you going to tell him tell him that he shouldnt not my job to tell a bishop what he can and cant do i suppose you want me to tell him that i cant take it on aye huw gazed down at the road id be happy with that shit merrily thought shed met the bishop just once before hed become the bishop it was fatefully at a conference at her old college in birmingham to review the progress of women priests in the midlands he was young not much older than merrily and shed assumed he was chatting her up this was after her unplanned controversial speech to the assembly on the subject of women and ghosts shot my mouth off she told huw sitting now on the other side of the smashed cairn id had a all right a psychic experience one lasting several weeks not the kind i could avoid because it was right there in the vicarage possibly a former incumbent possibly just a volatile plenty of sensations sounds possibly hallucinatory i only ever actually saw it once anyway it was just screwing me up i didnt know how to deal with it and jane saying didnt they teach you anything at theological college mum and im thinking yeah the kids right here we are licensed priests and the one thing they havent taught us is how to handle the supernatural i didnt know about mr dobbs then i didnt even know that every diocese needed to have one or what exactly they did i just wanted to know how many other women felt like me or if i was being naive touched a nerve probably it certainly didnt lead to a discussion and nobody asked me anything about it afterwards except for michael hunter he came over later in the restaurant bought me lunch i thought he was just anyway that was how it happened obviously id no idea then that he was going to be my new bishop but he remembered you once hed got his feet under the table and realized as a radical sort of lad that he could already have a bit of a problem on his hands namely canon thb dobbs his reactionary old diocesan exorcist not deliverance minister decidedly not im afraid deliverance consultant is the bishops term aye she felt his smile you know why dobbs doesnt like the word deliverance because the first two syllables are an anagram of devil thats what they say mustve been relieved mick hunter when the old bugger got his little cardiac prod towards retirement but he hasnt gone yet and im only here because the bishop wants me to get some idea of how no luv huw looked up sharply this isnt a course for people who just want to learn the basics of metaphysical trench warfare as hunter well knows he wants you badly its a sensitive job its very political it throws up a few hot potatoes like the satanic childabuse panic god what was all that about really well i dont want any of this bellbookandcandle incenseburning medieval rubbish i want somebody bright and smart and on their toes but also sympathetic and flexible and nondogmatic and upfront does that describe you merrily mick hunter in his study overlooking the river wye thirtynine years old and lean and fit pulsing with energy and ambition the heavy brown hair shading unruly blue eyes so huw owen said now mockpathetic slumped under the rising moon would you come over all feminist on me if i begged you not to do it merrily said nothing shed been expecting this but that didnt mean she knew how to handle it quite a shock being offered the job obviously shed still known very little about deliverance ministry but did the bishop himself know much more huw appeared to think not i do like women you know he said ruefully ive been very fond of women in me time you want to protect us right i want to protect everybody ill be sixty next time but one and im starting to feel a sense of responsibility i dont want stuff letting in a lot of bad energys crowding the portals i want to keep all the doors locked and the chains up suddenly the big strong male chains acquired all these weak links ive always been a supporter of women priests sounds like it just that it shouldve all been done years ago thats the trouble give the women time to build up a weight of tradition some ballast before the millennial surge and how long does it take to build up a weight of tradition how long in your estimation before well be ready to take on the weepers and the volatiles and the hitchhikers couple of centuries terrific look silverrimmed night clouds were moving behind huw youre not a fundamentalist not a charismatic or a happyclappy youve no visible axe to grind and i can see why he was drawn to you youre in many ways almost exactly the kind of person we need in the trenches and i would keep a very low profile with mick hunter wearing the pointy hat huw hacked off a laugh hell have you right on the front page of the hereford times brandishing a big cross all right joke but youll inevitably draw attention youre very pretty am i allowed to say that and theyll be right on to you if they arent already little rateyes in the dark merrily instantly thought about dermot child the organist in the monks robe i dont know what you mean i think you do merrily satanists among other species of pond life isnt all that a bit simplistic lets pretend you never said that a string of headlights floated down the valley a long way away she thought of jane back home in ledwardine and felt isolated cut off how many of the other priests on the course would agree with huw all of them probably a nightbreeze razored down from crags she could no longer see listen huw said the ordination of women is indisputably the most titillating development in the church since the reformation theyll follow you home theyll breathe into your phone at night break into your vestry and tamper with your gear crouch in the back pews and masturbate through your sermons yes but thats the tip of the iceberg rather than just a phase jesus huw said you know what i heard a woman say the other week we can handle it she said its no more hassle than nurses get and women teachers a priest this was totally failing to take account of the the overwhelming glamour the priesthood itself confers its now a fact that ordained women are the prime target for every psychotic grinder of the dark satanic mills that ever sacrificed a chicken and there are a lot of those buggers about ive read the figures exaggerated two million in britain alone that sort of level i dont think so id guess no more than a thousand hardliners and another five or six thousand misfit hangerson but by god thats enough int it its a modern religion see masquerading as something ancient ive not said much about it down there yet jerking a thumb towards the chapel i like to save it for the end of the course on account of some priests find it harder to take seriously than spooks a blur of white an early barn owl sailing over on cue merrily said what do you mean by a modern religion well not in principle though it got a hell of a boost in the eighties all that worship of money and sex and wordly success lucifer as patron saint of greedy selfserving bastards the lord of this world goes back to some of the old gnostic teachings gods in his heaven while the other feller runs things down here you cant imagine people actually believing that why not if you want to get on in the world you have to join the winning team thats not evil its pragmatic its being levelheaded recognizing the setup a jungle every man for himself thats the manifesto thats the spin got this amazing charge in the eighties took off faster than mobile phones which was when you he lifted a hand i only talk about me when im drunk and i dont like to get drunk any more she stood up and walked with determination around to his side of the stones why are you here really huw i mean out here in the sticks are you in hiding eh i just dont go for all that land of my fathers bullshit something happened to you in sheffield and you felt you couldnt cut it any more im sorry its none of my business she was sorry she wished she could see his eyes but his face was in deep shadow aye well it wasnt sheffield huw said you dont have to i wont im just saying it wasnt sheffield i just look dont try and turn this round merrily you should consider your situation youre on your own your daughter wont be around much longer and i cant possibly hold myself together without a man huw stood up the rising moon blooming on his left shoulder this is not just wankers in the back pews you know she looked at him ive encountered evil face to face hearing it call your name and your mothers name and your daughters name feeling it all over you like some viscous stinking he turned away shaking his head shambled back on to the track towards the chapel look those blokes down there solid stoical middleaged priests i can tell you four of them wont go through with it out of the rest therell be one broken marriage and a nervous breakdown are you listening merrily yes she stumbled after him and he shouted back over his shoulder woman exorcist female guardian of the portals you might as well just paint a great big bullseye between your tits when they got back the chapel was in neardarkness only an unsteady line of light under the door of the stone room inside the oil lamp which normally hung in the passage now stood on huws desk next to the tv powers gone someone said they were all standing around in the lamplight looking guilty like small boys there was a smell of burning ah huw ah the rev charles headland flicked at the letterbox mouth of the vcr some of us wanted to have another look at that lady couldnt make up our minds dodgy items poltergeists it was mainly me said barry ambrose the worried vicar from wiltshire i halfbelieved her but i think id have wanted to go back and talk to her again yes huw closed the door of the room that was what they did it was a rector in northampton he felt bad about them recording the first interview on tape for the likes of us and just giving her a token prayer so he went back to talk to her in private merrily felt a tension in the room sorry huw charlie held up his hands something ribboning and rustling there and glistening in the lamplight dont know what happened here holding up the video cassette about four yards of tape had become unravelled screen went blank ejected the tape and the damn thing was on fire had to rip it out and stamp on it extraordinary thing wasnt your only copy was it doesnt matter huw accepted the remains of the video coming to the end of its shelflife anyway that particular casehistory need a new player too id guess merrily leaned in and saw that the lips of the machine were scorched and warped shed never known this happen to a vcr before thats the fourth one in two years huw said its a right difficult place this jesus merrilys legs felt weak she clutched at a chair youre not saying no luv i dont say anything me silence in the stone room one of those moments when spiderwebs of cracks appeared in the walls of reality and merrily thought do i really want to be doing this should anyone be doing it huw looked over the lamplit assembly of bemused vicars and rectors and priestsincharge gods elite commando unit merrily thought and wanted to give in to hysterical laughter except one or two of them might then think she was possessed so lads huw said which of you would like to practise his cleansing routine charlie headlands mouth tightened merrily guessed he was wondering if huw had rigged this and she even wondered that too tests little tests lies disinformation and should we bless and cleanse the entire premises or perhaps each other merrily thought horrified its getting completely out of hand how quickly we all rush to the edge this is insane nick cowan the exsocial worker said its nonsense there was obviously some sort of electrical fluctuation a power surge thats all huw beamed at him good thought nicholas you do get problems like that in the mountains thats a very good thought there you are he spread his hands lesson for us all always consider the rational nutsandbolts explanation before you get carried away why dont you go and check the fusebox charles in the cupboard over the front door theres a torch in there when charlie had gone merrily sat down she felt tired and heavy to break the uncomfortable silence she said was that a genuine case the woman on the video ah said huw in the wavery light he looked much younger merrily could imagine him in some rock band in the sixties you said they went back to talk to her again well he began to wrap the unravelled videotape in a coil around his hands until it was binding them together our man in northampton knocks on the door and gets no answer but he can hear a radio playing loudly inside the house and the doors unlocked so he goes in and calls out like you do and the radio just goes on playing and our mans beginning to get a funny feeling oh dear god no said clive wells dont say that afraid so clive huw held out his hands pressed together as though in prayer but bound tight somehow blasphemously with black videotape there she is on the settee with a bottle of whisky nearly empty and a bottle of pills very empty and radio two playing comforting sixties hits merrily closed her eyes huw wouldnt be lying about this he wouldnt be that cruel and we still dont know if she was genuine or not huw said sadly the bottom line is that our man in northampton should not have left before administering a proper blessing to leave her in a state of calm feeling protected psychological benefits if nothing else the worst that couldve happened then was hed have looked a pillock if it came out shed made the story up but then looking like a pillocks part of the clergypersons job int it merrily get used to it dont we merrily was still staring into the scorched and grinning maw of the vcr when the lights came on again first law of deliverance huw said always carry plenty of fuse wire part two virus storm trooper they went to look at hereford cathedral because it was raining and because jane had decided she liked churches as distinct of course from the church which was still the last refuge of tossers nohopers and sad gits who liked dressing up jane wandered around in her vintage radiohead sweatshirt arms hanging loose hands opened out despite the presence of all these vacuous dogcollared losers you could still sometimes pick up an essence of real spirituality in these old sacred buildings the kid reckoned this was because of where theyd been built on ancient sacred sites plus the resonance of gothic architecture merrily followed her discreetly hands in pockets head down and didnt argue a row was looming but this was not the place and not the time and anyway she had her own thoughts her own decision to make she wondered about consulting st thomas and was pleased to see jane heading for the north transept where the old guy lay kind of they passed the central altar with its suspended corona like a giant gold and silver cakeruff on saturdays even in october there were usually parties of tourists around the cathedral and its precincts checking out the usual exhibits the mappa mundi the chained library the john piper tapestries the medieval shrine of oh in the north transept merrily came up against a barrier of new wooden partitioning with chains and padlocks it was screening off the end wall and the foot of the huge stainedglass window full of christs and angels and reds and blues jane said so like whats wrong reverend mum she put an eye to the crack in the padlocked partition door looks like a building site they turning it into public lavatories or something i forgot theyre dismantling the shrine what for jane looked interested renovation big job expensive twenty grand plus got to look after your saint saint jane said do me a favour guy was just a heavyduty politician well he was but thomas cantilupe to jane recited former chancellor of england came from a family of wealthy norman barons he really didnt have to try very hard did he well yes he did merrily wanted to say when he became bishop of hereford he tried to put all that behind him wore a hair shirt and as a lover of rich food once had a great pie made with his favourite lampreys from the severn took a single succulent bite and gave the rest away must have had something going for him flower about three hundred miracles were credited to this shrine look jane pushed her dark brown hair behind her ears its the power of place if youd erected a burgerbar here people would still have been cured its all about the confluence of energies nothing to do with the fancy tomb of some overprivileged corrupt she stopped a willowy young guy in a cathedral sweatshirt was strolling over its mrs watkins right hello merrily said uncertainly was she supposed to recognize him she was discovering that what you needed more than anything in this job was a massive database memory er you dont know me mrs watkins i saw you with the archdeacon once neil cooper im kind of helping with the project its just ive got a key if you want to have a look while merrily hesitated jane looked neil cooper over from his blond hair to his dusty tight jeans right jane said cool lets do it under the window a fourteenthcentury bishop slept on his marble mitre like a nightcap but the tomb of his saintly predecessor thomas cantilupe was in pieces stone sections laid out merrily thought like a display of postmodern garden ornaments there were over thirty pieces neil told them all carefully numbered by the stonemasons neil was an archaeology student who came in most weekends it was he said a unique opportunity to examine a famous and fascinating medieval tomb jane stood amongst the rubble and the workbenches peering around and lifting dustcloths so like where are the bones an elderly woman glanced in through the door then backed quickly away as if dust from the freshly exposed tomb might carry some ancient disease jane was prepared to risk it she knelt and stroked one of the oblong sideslabs closing her eyes as though emanations were coming through to her the faint echo of gregorian chant jane liked to feel she was in touch with other spheres of existence nothing religious you understand sorry said neil there arent any no bones hands still moving sensuously over the stone jane opened her eyes and gazed up at neil he looked about twenty an older man jane thought older men were cool and only older men it was beginning to perturb merrily that the kid hadnt found any kind of steady boyfriend her own age since theyd arrived in herefordshire neil glanced at jane only briefly what happened mrs watkins is some of the bones were probably taken away for safekeeping at the time of the reformation and some were apparently carried around the city during the plague in the hope they might bring some relief and i expect a few of those didnt come back so hes widely scattered although part of the skulls supposed to be back in hereford with the monks over at belmont abbey jane stood up so it was like completely empty when you opened it yeah lot of dust said neil the sideslab was divided into six sections on each a knight in armour had been carved their swords and shields and helmets and even chainmail fingers crisply discernible but all the faces gone flattened pulped it didnt look as if time was entirely responsible so in fact jane said this great historic holy artefact is like an empty shell its a shrine merrily said of course thats one of the continuing problems with the anglican church jane smiled slyly before sliding out the punchline so much of its just a hollow shell merrily was careful not to react were delaying you she said to neil cooper it was good of you to let us in no problem mrs watkins drop in any time he smiled at merrily ignoring jane jane scowled i expect youll be around quite often neil said i gather theyre giving you an office in the cloisters nothings fixed yet merrily said too sharply and anyway id only be here oneandahalf days a week i have a parish to run as well god she thought does everybody know about this so much for lowprofile so much for discretion look in anytime neil repeated always nice to see you the trouble with older men said jane as they left the cathedral is that the cretins seem to fancy even older women as they walked into broad street the rain dying off but the sky threatening more merrily noticed that jane seemed taller a little taller than merrily in fact which was not saying much but was momentarily alarming as though this significant spurt had occurred during the few days theyd been apart merrily experiencing weirdness in wales jane staying with trusty villagers gomer and minnie but returning to the vicarage twice a day to feed ethel the cat merrily felt disoriented so much had altered in the ten days since shed last been to the cathedral ten days which because the past week had been such a strange period seemed so much longer even part of a different timeframe she felt a quiver of insecurity glanced back at the ancient edifice of myriad browns and pinks it seemed to have shrunk from most parts of the city centre the spires of all saints and st peters were more dominant the cathedral had long since lost its own spire and sat almost modestly in a secluded corner between the river wye and the castle green and a nest of quiet streets with no shops in them tea merrily said desperately whatever the lateafternoon sky was a smoky kind of orange merrily peered around for cafes snackbars she felt like a stranger needing to ground herself the green dragon they must do afternoon tea jane shrugged they crossed towards herefords biggest hotel nineteenthcentury and the longest facade on broad street so youve learned about thomas cantilupe at school only in passing he didnt figure much nationally nothing that happened in hereford seems to have made much of a difference to anything in the big world useless arguing with jane in this mood the kid had consented to come shopping a big sacrifice on a saturday it was now merrilys task to tease out of her what was wrong and jane wasnt going to assist tiresome timehonoured ritual they found a window table in the green dragon looking back out on to broad street the saturday crowds thinning now as the day closed down sometimes november could bring a last golden surge but this one had seemed colourless and tensed for winter merrily was aware of a drab sense of transience and futility nothing profound maybe just wishing she was janes age again cakes she said brightly just tea thanks black merrily ordered two teas and a scone worried about our weight are we flower no what are we worried about then did we say we were worried the bored halfclosed eyes the sardonic tuck at the corner of the mouth it was pure sean as when merrily was trying to quiz him about some dubious client you dont see your daughter for a week and in the interim shes readmitted her fathers soiled spirit merrily tried again i er i missed you flower really jane tilted her soft pale face into a supportive hand elbow on the table id have thought you had far too much to think about poncing about in your robes and practising your out demons out routine with the soul police ah what thats what this is about the soul police you think im what an anachronism a joke though jane was basically spiritual she just didnt believe the church of england was bad enough to have your own mother walking around in a dogcollar never mind the holy water and the black bag now was that it that was probably too simple nothing about jane was ever really simple a man striding up the street towards all saints glanced through the window blinked paused strode on oh god not him not now merrily turned away from the window stared across the table at jane the kid pushed back her tumbling hair ok look yes merrily leaned forward a crack an opening yes jane said im uncomfortable about what youre doing merrily i see jesus merrily a major development now we are sixteen time to dump this mum nonsense we are two grown women equals this needed some thinking about i dont think you do see jane said so tell me theyre dragging you in arent they who the church its all political of course it is all those fat smug cofe gits theyre worried about losing their power and their influence so theyre appointing cool bishops smooth glossy people like michael hunter mick hunter for gods sake bishops are still appointed by downing street yeah well exactly old mate of tony blairs i can just see them swapping chords for ancient led zeppelin riffs like micks superficially cool and different but hes really establishment underneath phew said merrily theatrically thank god my daughter has finally become a revolutionary i thought it was never going to happen jane glared at her you really dont understand do you sure you think im a glossy superficial bimbo whos more like a trainee stormtrooper actually what look janes eyes flashed it seemed really interesting at first when you said you were going to do this deliverance training im thinking yeah this is what its all about the church actually investigating the supernatural nittygritty instead of just spouting all this bible crap and this course and everything it all seemed really mysterious so like wednesday night i go back to the vicarage to feed ethel i think maybe i should check the answering machine see if theres anything urgent so i go into your office and i find hang on from a pocket of her jeans jane dragged a compacted square of printed paper which she opened out on the tabletop and suddenly i saw what it was all really about merrily pulled towards her a deliverance study group pamphlet heralding a forthcoming seminar entitled new age old enemy shed forgotten about it it had come in a package from the dsg the morning she left for the brecon beacons i havent read it flower i bet but sure i can guess what its about she picked up the leaflet meditationgroups sweatlodges healingcircles it may all seem innocuous but socalled new age pursuits are often the marijuana which leads to the heroin of hardcore satanism introducing the discussion canon stephen rigbey will examine the allure of alternative spirituality and suggest ways of discouraging harmful experimentation merrily said steadily you happen to notice the key word in this dont try and talk all around it its discussion meaning debate its bloody spiritual fascism said jane oh jane listen you listen for once the new age is about its about millions of people saying i want to know more i want an inner life i want to commune with nature and the cosmos and things find out about what were really doing here and whos running the show and like what part i can play in the great scheme of things right pretty much like christianity in fact merrily lit a cigarette no thats bollocks jane shook her head furiously the church is like oh you dont have to know anything you just come along every sunday and sing some crappy victorian hymns and stuff and youll go to heaven jane weve had this argument before you just want to reduce it to and anybody steps out of line its oh youre evil youre a heretic youre an occultist and were gonna like burn you or something which was how you got the old witchhunts because the church has always been on this kind of paternalistic power trip and doesnt want people to search for the truth like it used to be science and darwinism and stuff they were worried about now its the new age because thats like real practical spirituality and its come at a time when the church is really feeble and pathetic and the bishops and everybody are shit scared of it all going down the pan so now we get this big deliverance initiative which is really just about about suppression jane sat back in her chair with a bump wow merrily said dont what youre gonna say something patronizing dont jane snatched back the leaflet and folded it up again evidence obviously i bet you were megaflattered when mick offered you the job werent you i bet it never entered your head that they want people like you because youre quite young and attractive and everything and like it did actually like youre not going to come over as some crucifixwaving loony what it did occur to me merrily cupped both hands around her cigarette she wasnt sure if they allowed smoking in here of course it did its still occurring to me not your letsstampoutthenewage stuff because i cant quite believe that but yeah i think he does want me for reasons other than that im obviously interested in phenomena whatever which is one reason i havent yet said yes to the job jane blinked once and they sat and stared at one another merrily thought about all the other questions that were occurring to her and what huw owen had said to them all as they gathered outside the chapel in the last minutes of the course maybe you should analyse your motives are you doing this out of a desire to help people cope with psychic distress or is it in a spirit of shall we say personal enquiry think how much deeper your faith would be if you had evidence of life after death how much stronger your commitment to the calling if you had proof of the existence of supernatural evil if thats the way youre thinking you need to consider very carefully after you leave here and then for christs sake forget this do something else merrily dragged raggedly on her cigarette you really want it though dont you jane said you really really want it i dont know merrily lied jane smiled i have a lot of thinking to do merrily said you going to tell mick youre in two minds i think i shall be avoiding the bishop for a while ha jane was looking over her mothers left shoulder merrily said wearily he just came in didnt he i think ill leave you to it ill go and have a mooch around waterstones and andys see you back at the car at six the waitress arrived with the tea the bishop can have mine if he likes jane said moon it was what happened with the crow after the rain on dinedor hill this was when lol robinson actually began to be spooked by moon as distinct from sorry for moon puzzled by moon fascinated by moon and attracted to her of course but anything down that road was not an option it was not supposed to be that kind of relationship most people having their possessions carried into a new home would need to supervise the operation make sure nothing got broken moon had shrugged left them to get on with it and melted away into the rain and her beloved hill there really wasnt very much stuff to move in moon didnt even have a proper bed when the removal men had gone lol went up to the iron age ramparts to find her he walked up through the woods not a steep slope because the barn was quite close to the flattened summit where the ancient camp had been the iron age village of circular thatched huts nothing remained of it except dips and hollows guarded now by huge old trees and by the earthen ramparts at the highest point and this was where he found moon where the enormous trees parted to reveal the city of hereford laid out at your feet like an offering lol was aware that some people called the hill a holy hill though he wasnt sure why he should ask moon the ancient mysteries of dinedor swam in her soul she was standing with her back to him next to a huge beech tree which still wore most of its leaves her hair hung almost to the waist of the long medieval sort of dress she wore under a woollen shawl making lol think of drawings of fairies by arthur rackham and the centrefolds of those quasimystical albums from the early seventies the ones which had first inspired him to write songs the kind of songs which were already going out of fashion when lols band hazey jane won their first recording contract moon would still have been at primary school then she seemed to have skipped a whole generation if not two hippy nouvelle down in the city she sometimes looked pale and nervy distanced from everything up here she was connected dick lyden the psychotherapist had noticed this and given his professional blessing to moons plan despite the fears of her brother denny who was jittery as hell about it she cant do this you got to stop her she cannot live there out of the fucking question but she was a grown woman what were they supposed to do short of getting her committed to a psychiatric hospital lol whod been through that particular horror himself was now of the opinion that it should never happen to anyone who was not dangerously insane when he first saw moon on the ramparts even though her face was turned away he thought shed never seemed more serene she glanced over her shoulder and smiled at him hi ok yes she turned back to the view over the city wonderful isnt it look look at the cathedral and all saints isnt that amazing from here even though they were actually several hundred yards apart the church steeple and the cathedral tower overlapped the sky around them was a strange burnedout orange moon said many of the leylines through other towns you cant see them any more because of new highrise buildings but of course there arent any of those in hereford the skyline remains substantially the same lol realized hed seen an old photograph of this view taken in the s by alfred watkins the hereford gentleman whod first noticed that prehistoric stones and mounds and the medieval churches on their sites often seemed to occur on imaginary straight lines running across the landscape most archaeologists thought this was a rubbish theory but katherine moon was not like most archaeologists its at least spiritually valid shed said once he wasnt sure what she meant moon he said now why do some people call it a holy hill she didnt have to think about it the line goes through four ancient places of worship ok ending at a very old church in the country but it starts here and this is the highest point so all these churches including the cathedral remain in its shadow in the poetic sense in the spiritual sense this hill is the mother of the city the camp here was the earliest proper settlement long before there was a town down there over a thousand celtic people lived up here she paused my ancestors there was a touching tremor of pride in her voice so its kind of lol hesitated holy in the pagan sense its just holy moon still had her back to him this was before the time of christ over a thousand people keeping sheep and storing grain doing their spinning and weaving and dyeing it wouldve been idyllic for a time what happened to them the dinedor people some of them never went away and the spirit remains moon gazed down over the spread of the city towards the distant black mountains and welsh border slowly she turned towards him and some some of us have returned he saw tears shining in her eyes and then he saw the black thing clasped to her stomach katherine moon dick lyden the therapist had briefed lol as best he could about three months ago twentysix bright girl quite a good degree in archaeology but an unfortunate history of instability runs in the family evidently her brother denny hes the sanest of them might look like a new age traveller but dennys a businessman has his head screwed on after university dick said katherine had spent a couple of years freelancing on various archaeological digs across britain this was how she became obsessed with dead celtic civilizations began wearing primitive clothing and strange jewellery smoking too much dope tripping out on magicmushroom tea when she arrived back in hereford the katherine bit had gone she was just moon and more than a little weird the reason shed come back to hereford was the lure of the big cathedral close dig also perhaps the impending death of her mother as if moon had sensed this coming her mother had died after several years in and out of expensive psychiatric residential homes one of the reasons denny had kept working so hard now it looked like he had another one to provide for but dennys wife maggie had decreed that katherine wasnt living with them no way this stemming from the christmas before last when moon had come to stay and maggie had found her stash under the babys cot what a dramatic christmas that had been now it was let her take her inheritance smoke it snort it inject it into her arm just keep the mad bitch well out of our lives no wonder maggie was paranoid dennys mother seemed to have picked up psychiatric problems simply by marrying into the moon family like their instability was infectious meanwhile katherine had flipped again bought some speed from a dealer in hereford disappeared into pubs and clubs for three days and been pulled in by the police after nicking two skirts from next denny had taken her to dick lyden as part of the deal for a conditional discharge by hereford magistrates hed refurbished the flat over one of his shops for her suggesting she ran the store for a while knowing this wasnt entirely satisfactory right in the city centre too convenient for pubs and clubs and dealers it was not really where hed wanted her but where did he want her well somewhere safe somewhere he wouldnt have to visit her too often and risk domestic strife but certainly not dinedor hill not in a million years as for fucking dyn farm we got to stop her man denny with his head in his hands beating it on the shop counter when he heard about the barn she cant do this but moon had the money from her mothers bequest shed already signed the lease with the latest people to own the farmhouse and its grade two listed outbuildings think about it this way denny dick lyden had suggested the hill might have terrible memories for you but she was just a child at the time she has no memories of it at all to moon its simply the birthright of which she was robbed so going back to the hill to part of the actual family farm could be a healing thing who knows might even be the making of her if i were you denny and i couldnt disguise my feelings id keep my distance now shes done it it would not be good for her to be exposed to any negativity and then dick had said tell you what why dont we get lol here to keep an eye on her most inoffensive chap i know this patting lol on the arm no threat you see she mustnt feel pressured in any way thats the important thing so lol robinson ex rockstar almost sometime songwriter former mental patient had become moons minder possibly because no one else really wanted to take that responsibility but that was ok lol needed some responsibility it was fine until this the rain had begun again it misted lols glasses and made a glossy slick of moons waistlength hair falling black and limp down her back as black and limp as the dead crow she held she was leaning back against the tree now her right hand cupped under the bird moon lol took a step backwards stumbled to his knees in the mud looking up at her she was beautiful her big eyes were penetrating like an owls look she said there was a spreading patch of blood already the size of a dinner plate on her dress from the stomach to the groin it fell dead at my feet moon said out of the sky isnt that incredible is it lol said faintly appalled to see that her left hand bloodied to the wrist was actually moving inside the body of the crow loose feathers were sticking to the blood on her dress to the ancient celts the crow or raven was a sacred and prophetic bird moon spoke as though she was addressing not one person but a group of students in a lecture room the hero bran was possibly a personification of a raven god there were also several crow or raven goddesses macha nemain badb and the morrigan lol stood up but moved no closer to her it fell dead at my feet she said again it was a gift from the ancestors a greeting on this the day of my homecoming like a housewarming present lol said before he could think he expected her to flare up but she smiled and her eyes glowed yes she looked at lol for the first time and began to cry oh lol i cant tell you i cant express her hand came out of the crow then full of organs and intestines and bloody gunge lol felt sick moon if its a gift the gift moon said happily is prophecy and inner vision the point is that the crow was endowed with supernatural powers it was honoured and feared and revered ok when this one fell to the earth it was still warm and there was a small wound in the abdomen and i put my little finger into the wound and it just why did you do that because it was meant of course by bathing my hands in its blood im acquiring its powers theres a legend of cuchulainn where he does that i she held out the bird to lol i dont know what to do next bury it i think lol said hopefully and moon nodded smiling through her tears lol let her put the mutilated bird into his hands trying not to look at it fixing his gaze out over the city where the cathedral tower still merged with the steeple of all saints under an orangebrown cloudbank down below the ramparts in the bowl of the ancient camp they covered the crow with damp fallen leaves lol wondered if maybe he should say some kind of prayer but couldnt think of one youll fly again he said lamely to the leafy mound you will he felt dazed and inadequate poor crow poor bloody moon she stood up her long grey dress hemmed with mud as he followed her out of the hollow lol thought of merrily watkins whom he hadnt seen since leaving ledwardine would a priest conduct a funeral service for a carrion crow he thought merrily would moon gathered her dark woollen shawl around her numbed he followed her along the slippery path ahead of them was a nowfamiliar oak tree with the single dead branch pointing out of the top like a finger from a fist this was where another steep secret path dropped towards moons new home in its dripping dell when the path curved to the left and the barns metal flue poked out of the trees moons mood changed her face was a tremulous dawn i still cant believe it she stopped where the path became a series of long shallow earthen steps held up by stones and rotting boards im back im really back and they want me back theyve given me their sign isnt that just moon shook her head blown away leaving lol in a quandary his hands sticky with crow bits and blood should he tell denny about this or just dick or not mention it at all id like to sleep now lol moon said good idea he said gratefully i cant tell you how wonderful i feel good lol said thats er good driving the old astra back through the semiindustrial sprawl of rotherwas and into the city he couldnt even think about it he thought instead about stupid things like maybe buying a bike too and getting fit like moon who insisted shed be pedalling to the shop in capuchin lane six days a week all through the coming winter he parked in a private yard behind the shop in a spot which would have been moons if she possessed a car and he walked through an alley and into capuchin lane it was also known these days as church street but he and moon both preferred its old name this was a wonderful street to live in narrow ancient cobbled and closed to traffic full of little shops and pubs and ending at the cathedral presenting in fact the most medieval view of it especially at dawn and in the evening when all the shops were closed and the hanging signs became black romantic silhouettes the flat over the shop called john barleycorn one of moons brothers shops had been semiderelict when moon had first lived here this was when she was helping with the archaeological excavation in the cathedral close before the digging site was released for a new building to house the mappa mundi and the chained library more than a thousand skeletons had been unearthed and moon had spent her days among the dead and her nights on a camp bed in this same flat walking out each morning to the cathedral the dream developing she kept a photograph of herself holding two medieval skulls from the massive charnel pit theyd found all three of them wearing damaged grins when the excavation ended and the bones were removed moon wanted to stay on there and denny wanted her to leave so there was tension and soon afterwards moon stole the skirts from next and the police found her stoned on the castle green and that was when dick had finally agreed to renovate the flat over the shop as a proper home for her moon had seemed fairly content here in capuchin lane only dinedor hill in fact could have lured her away and it did lol in need of somewhere to live had then himself taken over the flat denny was glad about that as it meant lol could keep an eye on moon during her working hours and watch out for any hovering dopedealers he had his key to the side door but went in through the shop to report to denny moons much older and very much bulkier brother sat on a stool behind the counter trying to tune a balalaika although there was only one customer in the store a girl flicking through the cds it seemed quite full for in a street of small shops this was the very smallest and it was full of the busy sound of gomez from big speakers and denny was here a oneman crowd in himself it go all right then my old mate fine shit as well as this shop denny ran a specialist hifi business and his own recording studio in the cellar of his house up towards breinton lol had produced a couple of albums for him there local bands limited editions denny was keen to get him back on to the studio floor but lol wasnt ready yet the songs werent quite there something still missing denny said no fights breakages tears would you count tears of joy shit lol decided to keep quiet about the crow denny twanged the balalaika and winced dont get yourself too comfy in that flat mate she changes like the wind my little sister he shook his bald head and his goldplated novelty earring swung like a tiny censer you hope lol couldnt remember feeling exactly comfy anywhere yeah denny said dont go back thats my philosophy never in life do you fucking well go back lol shrugged helpless whatever that place does to you it has the opposite effect on her you cant get around it shes happy she walks into the woods up to the camp yeah and all the time passing the place where her fucking father topped himself what does that say to you denny sniffed hard and plucked twice at the balalaikas strings then laid it on the counter in disgust what use is a threestring shoebox on a stick kathy bought it from this poor homeless busker probably got the bmw parked round the corner softhearted lol said soft in the head ill tell you one thing first sign of unusual behaviour any hint of dope up there shes out kicking and screaming or the cd ended and denny lowered his voice or however right lol nodded long as we agree on that mate denny said as the girl customer turned around from the cd racks clutching a copy of beth ortons trailer park a slow delighted smile pushing her tongue into a corner of her mouth hey she said lol robinson wow oh lol said it seemed like ages since hed seen her he smiled realizing how much hed missed her even though sometimes like moon she could be trouble well not quite like moon hey cool the girl said and that same old roswell sweatshirt is that the same one or did you buy a set hello jane lol said he wondered how much shed overheard so like whos kathy jane watkins said dark mocking eyes under dark hair a lot like her mother the last exorcist the bishop smiled hard talked fast and wore purple as bishops do the church ok his voice was publicschool with the edges sanded off the church is hierarchical conservative full of rivalry feuding backstabbing and inherently incapable of ever getting anything bloody well done the bishop wore purple all over a tracksuit and jogging gear the bishop jogged all over the city and its outskirts usually in the early mornings and the evenings covering according to the hereford times a minimum of thirty miles a week now youd think wouldnt you that organizing an office in the cathedral cloisters would be the easiest thing scores of cells and crannies and cubicles but all of them the deans and if the dean says there isnt an office to spare im not even permitted to argue within the precincts of the cathedral even god bows to the dean so we shall have to look elsewhere im so sorry merrily its probably meant bishop mick corrected the bishop meant oh it was meant for sure the bastard means to frustrate me who after all is the oldest member of his chapter dobbs the bishop tossed the name out like junkmail the old mans ubiquitous hovering silently like some dark malign spectre id like to i want to exorcize dobbs well i feel very awkward about the whole thing merrily poured tea for them both oh why the bishop quizzically tilted his head as though he really didnt understand he sugared his tea you know the very worst thing about dobbs he actually frightens people imagine you have what you are convinced is an unwelcome presence in your house your nerves are shot to hell you finally gather the courage or the sheer desperation to go to the church for help and what should arrive at your door but this weird shambling creature dressed like an undertaker and mumbling at you like poes doleful raven well youd rather hang on to the bloody ghost wouldnt you the bishop merrily had noticed said bloody rather a lot but nothing stronger always conscious of the parameters of his image as a cool christian she was determined to be neither overawed nor underawed by mick hunter this afternoon neither bulldozed nor seduced she wished he was more like huw owen but men like huw never ever got to be bishops listen merrily his voice dropping an octave latenight dj i realize how you must feel if you were the kind of person who was utterly confident about it i wouldnt want you in this job not a fundamentalist not a charismatic or a happyclappy youve no visible axe to grind and i can see why he was drawn to you youre in many ways almost exactly the kind of person we need in the trenches do you know huw owen she asked only by reputation quite a vocal campaigner for the ordination of women long before it became fa feasible fashionable hed been about to say until it became fashionable mick hunter would have kept very quiet on the issue merrily was trying to see him as jane saw him but it wasnt easy micks blue eyes were clear and blazing with a wild integrity he had a somehow unepiscopal blue jaw he smelled very lightly of clean honest joggers sweat and of something smokily indistinct which made her think rather shockingly of what a very long time it had been since shed last had sex your late husband was a lawyer wasnt he he said startling her upright tea spilling yes she was blushing i me too i mean i was going to be one too until jane came into the picture and a few other things changed shame the bishop said road accident wasnt it on the m he he hit a bridge they hit a bridge sean and karen adair his clerk and girlfriend and accomplice in a number of delicate arrangements with iffy businessmen dying flung together in a ball of fire at the time when merrily was balancing an inevitable divorce against her chances of ordination and jane was just starting secondary school how much of this did the bishop know all of it probably look she had to say this the thing is huws position on the ordination of women doesnt extend to deliverance ministry did you know that he doesnt think were ready for all that yet his eyes widening she realized hed probably sent her on this particular course precisely because he knew huw was sympathetic to women priests not ready for all that the eyes narrowing again all what he doesnt feel that we have the necessary weight of tradition behind us to take on whatevers out there which is a little bit preposterous mick hunter leaned back dont you think its not what i think that matters no quite at the end of the day its what i think the deliverance consultants responsible to the bishop and only to the bishop and i think without any positive discrimination that if anything this is a job a woman can do better than a man it demands delicacy compassion qualities not exactly manifested by dobbs ive ive been trying you know to work out exactly how you do see the job mick hunter stirred his tea thoughtfully two tables away a couple of welldressed notquiteelderly women were openly watching him beefcake bishop a new phenomenon ok right he said while you were in wales we had some basic research carried out quick phonecall to all the parish clergy a few facts and figures did you know for instance that in the past six months in this diocese alone there have been between twenty and thirty appeals to the church for assistance with perceived psychic disturbance really my god and rising mick smiled if the church was a business wed be calling this a major growth area the bishop then talked about apparent psychic blackspots revealed by the survey the north of the diocese was worst and merrily thought about how fate pushed you around all the unplanned directions your life took whether she would ever actually have become a lawyer had she not become pregnant while still at university if she would ever have become a priest had sean not died when he did and if she hadnt discovered he was a crook if she would ever have been drawn into the strange shadowworld of deliverance had her own vicarage in ledwardine not been tenanted by an essence of something which no one else had experienced she felt targeted exposed she wanted to leap up from the table and run to the car and smoke several cigarettes instead she said what exactly are we talking about here the bishop shrugged mostly i suspect about paranoia psychiatric problems loneliness isolation stress modern society merrily postmillennial angst were certainly not talking about the medieval world of canon dobbs nor i think should we be sending the local vicar along just to have a cup of coffee and intone a few prayers which is what happens in most cases now she began to understand about the office he would want one that actually said deliverance consultant on its door he wanted to bring the job out of the closet im glad the awful word exorcisms been ditched he said though im not entirely happy with deliverance either a less portentous term would be rescue dont you think rescue consultant spiritual rescue service srs she raised her cup to mask a smile he didnt notice it would still be part of the parish priests role to deal in the initial stages with people who think theyre being haunted or little darrens got the devil in him or whatever but the public also need to know theres an efficient machinery inside the church for dealing with such problems and that theres a particular person to whom they can turn and i dont want that person to look like dobbs we need to be seen as sympathetic nonjudgemental userfriendly youve read perrys book on deliverance the set text isnt it its a start i find michael perry rather too credulous but i like his insistence on not overreacting the jobs about counselling its about being a spiritual samaritan about listening you notice that perry seldom seems to advocate exorcizing a place he suggests a major exorcism should primarily be focused on a demonically possessed person and then only when a number of other procedures have proved ineffective mick hunter put down his cup i never want to hear of a socalled major exorcism its crude primitive and almost certainly ineffective merrily blinked you dont think that in the presence of extreme evil evils a disease the bishop said in fact its many diseases if were going to deal with it we have to study the symptoms consider the nature of the particular malady and then apply the correct treatment with sensitivity precision and care the major exorcism quite frankly is the kind of medieval bludgeon which in my opinion the postmillennial church can do without are you with me here i dont know merrily thought wildly i dont know its hard she took a breath to calm herself mick hunters enthusiasm picked you up and carried you along and then put you down suddenly and you didnt know where you were its hard to express an opinion about something youve really had no experience of i dont think anyone can possibly merrily he put his hand over hers on the white tablecloth one of my faults is expecting too much of people too soon i realize that but i know from my predecessor that youve proved yourself to be a resourceful resilient person the appalling ledwardine business i know you dont like your part in all that to be talked about no but youve shown you have nerve and wisdom and you can think on your feet ok im aware that were breaking new ground here but its the direction i believe every diocese will be going in within five years he paused ive had a word with gareth by the way the archdeacon under the reorganization you were due to be awarded two extra parishes before the end of the year i pointed out to gareth that under the circumstances that would be far too much of a burden you mean its either the deliverance role or two more parishes to run the two parishes would be a lot easier merrily a quieter life yes if its a quiet life you want what she wanted was a cigarette but she knew the bishop hated them what she wanted was for huw owen to have been proved wrong but everything huw had forecast had been dead right she would wind up with her picture in the hereford times although probably without the crucifix im going to have to play this slowly and diplomatically mick hunter said dobbs wont go until hes too shaky to hold a cup of holy water and as long as hes here he has the support of the deans cabal well all right he can still be an exorcist if he wants that doesnt prevent me appointing a consultant to say prepare a detailed report on the demand for deliverance services merrily said i dont like this merely politics im afraid im quite good at politics she sighed youve given me a lot to think about bishop mick could i have some time to pray for guidance yes merrily said i suppose thats what ill do call my office if youd like another meeting mick stood up zipped his purple tracksuit top er if you cant get an office in the cloisters that means id be working from home then at least she wouldnt have to see the rather scary dobbs oh no mick grinned the dean doesnt screw me so easily i told you im quite good at this im going to put you in the palace in the car going home merrily put on tori amoss from the choirgirl hotel because it was doomy and gothic and would keep jane quiet the kid would want to know what the bishop had been so keen to talk about but first merrily needed to work it out for herself it certainly wasnt what jane had imagined a clandestine return to witchhunting sneaky rearguard action by a defensive church there was no sign of new age old enemy paranoia in mick hunter he was simply enfolding the deliverance ministry into his campaign to project the diocese further into the new millennium as a vibrant caring essential institution was that so wrong but what did he see as the enemy paranoia psychiatric problems loneliness isolation stress postmillennial angst clearly the bishops liberalism did not extend to the supernatural merrily suspected he didnt believe in ghosts and that for him the borderline between demonic possession and schizophrenia would not exist which was worrying to what extent was healthy scepticism compatible with christian faith and what did he mean put you in the palace little record shop in church street huh sorry flower jane reached out and turned down the stereo merrily glanced across at her jane turning down music this had never happened before i said who do you think i ran into in that poky little record shop in church street it was almost dark and they were leaving the city via the kings acre roundabout with a fourteenthcentury cross on its island close lol robinson jane said you do remember oh merrily said casually there was a time when she could have become too fond of lol robinson right how is he jane told her how lol had just started renting this brilliant flat over the shop with a view over the cobbles and two pubs about twenty yards away belongs to the guy who owns the shop his sister used to live there but shes moved out her names katherine moon but shes just known as moon and i think she and lol anyway he looks exactly the same hasnt grown same little round glasses still wearing that black sweatshirt with the alien face on the front possibly symbolic of the way he feels he relates to society and feels that certain people relate to him so apart from the sartorial sameness did he seem ok no he was like waving his arms around and drooling at the mouth of course he seemed ok we went for a coffee in the all saints cafe ive never been in there before its quite cool its in a church yeah i noticed nice to see one fulfilling a useful service anyway i got out of lol what hes doing now he didnt want to tell me but i can be fairly persistent you nailed his guitar hand to the prayerbook shelf look do you want to know what hes doing or not all right you ready for this hes training to be a shrink what but he was well not a shrink exactly he hates psychiatrists because they just give you drugs to keep you quiet more a kind of psychotherapist he was consulting one in hereford and the guy realized that after years in and out of mental hospitals lol knew more ologies and isms than he himself did so now hes employing him a couple of days a week for sort of onthejob training and lols doing these night classes isnt that so cool it merrily thought about this i suppose it is really lol would be pretty good he doesnt judge people yeah thats cool also hes playing again hes made some tapes although he wont let anybody hear them even you im working on it i may go back there i like that shop lots of stuff by indy folk bands and im really glad i saw him i didnt want to lose touch just because he moved out of ledwardine merrily said cautiously lol needed time to get himself together oh jane said airily i think he needed more than that dont you dont start like maybe somebody who wasnt terrified of getting into a relationship because of what the parish might think stop there merrily said lightly all right fine jane prodded the music up to disco level and turned to look out of the side window at the last of the grim amber sinking on to the shelf of the black mountains a desultory rain filmed the windscreen still merrily thought she heard the kid mumble its probably considered socially ok to fuck a bishop that night praying under her bedroom window in the vicarage merrily realized the deliverance issue wasnt really a problem she needed to hang on god at this stage her usual advice to parishioners facing a decision was to gather all the information they could get from available sources on both sides of the argument and only then apply for a solution fair enough she would seek independent advice within the church she went to sit on the edge of the bed looking out at the lights of ledwardine speckling the trees they made her think of what huw owen had said about the targeting of women priests little rateyes in the dark she hadnt even raised that point with mick hunter he would have taken it seriously but not in the way it was meant by huw merrily shivered lightly and slid into bed cuddling the hot water bottle aware of ethel the black cat curling on the duvet against her ankles remembering the night ethel had first appeared at the vicarage in the arms of lol robinson after shed received a kicking from a drunk she hoped lol robinson would be happy with his girlfriend lol and merrily that would never have worked later on the edge of sleep she heard huw owens flat nasal voice as if it were actually in the room little rateyes in the dark and jerked awake ok shed absorbed huws warning listened to the bishops plans it was clear that what she had to do now not least for the sake of her conscience was go back to hereford and talk to canon dobbs the last exorcist merrily lay down again and slept sweat and mothballs oh yes moon said he was outside the window peering in his face right up to the glass his eyes were full of this awful blank confusion i dont think he knew who i was that was the worst thing he didnt know me he was in the garden how do i handle this lol thought shes getting worse i ran out moon said then i saw him again at the bottom of the steps leading up to the camp and then he wasnt there any more she was sitting on a cardboard box full of books there were about two dozen boxes dumped all over the living area lol hadnt been into the kitchen or the bathroom but except for the futon in the open loft it looked exactly the way it had been the last time he was here shed refused offers of help from denny and lol and from dick lydens wife ruth you had to arrange your possessions yourself shed insisted otherwise youd never know where anything was but nothing at all seemed to have been put away nothing even unpacked it was as though shed gone straight to bed when he left her on saturday and had just got up again four days later sleeping beauty situation fairytale again the point about moon was that she was utterly singleminded most of the time she had no small talk and no interest in other people although she could be very generous when some problem was put under her nose like buying the buskers balalaika but now shed found her father and nothing else mattered oh she said and he was wearing a flat cap which i recognized moon was wearing an anklelength white satin nightdress which had collected a lot of dust a thick silver torc around her neck shed had on nothing over the nightdress when shed opened the door to lol she didnt seem cold it was wildly erotic lol wondered how doctors coped with this it was this grey checked one with all the lining hanging out mummy always kept it i mean for years anyway she talked about all the times she used to try and get him to throw it away denny threw it away in the end i suppose now my father has it back delusional lol thought because she doesnt seem scared it has to be wishful thinking but what did it mean that shed wished up a father who didnt seem to recognize her the long nightdress rustled like leaves as moon stood up glided to the window when i was little i used to wonder if that was the cap hed worn when he shot himself so that was why it was all torn of course the gun would have made much more of a mess than that but you dont know these things when youre little do you it occurred to him that this was the first time shed spoken about her father her father had killed himself when she was about two years old denny said she had no memories of him but there was probably some resentment because his folly was the reason theyd had to sell up and leave the hill this fucking insane investment some mate of the old mans had developed this sweet sparkling cider he reckoned was going to snatch at least half the babycham market dad threw everything at it sold off about fifty acres left the farm nonviable theyd lost the farm which was said to have been in the family since at least the middle ages or much longer if you listened to moon denny had said the day we left the old man took his shotgun for a last short walk its a thing farmers do when they feel theyve let their ancestors down how um lols mouth was dry he sat down on another box of books how do you feel about your dad now moon turned to lol her eyes shining i have to reach out to him the ancestors have enabled me to do that ok the crow by bathing my hands in its blood im acquiring its powers they sent him back he doesnt know why but he will he has to know who i am thats the first stage i have to let him know im all right about him youre not just a bit scared hes my father and im his only hope of finding peace he knows hes got a lot of making up to do to mummy as well but thats out of our hands now she went silent the fervour in her eyes slipping away your mum do you feel shes at peace lol didnt know why hed asked that except to get her talking again i dont know she was never the same afterwards i mean all my life she had problems with her nerves it was lucky denny was practically grownup by then and so he took charge it was denny who was always pushing me to do well at school determined i should go to university because he hadnt taking the fathers role you know he owes denny too i suppose how can he make it up to you lol said softly how can your father help she blinked at him as if that was obvious with my book of course my book about the dinedor people he can help me with the book he can make them talk to me they sent him to me so i must be able to reach them through him who the ancestors the barn was quite small just four rooms it had been converted initially as extra holiday accommodation by the present owners of the farmhouse some people called purefoy who apparently ran a bedandbreakfast business but this had not been a very good summer for weather or tourism and theyd presumably realized they could make more money with a longterm let not much ground of course no room for a garage quite difficult access but a beautiful rural situation moon had come up here on the mountainbike denny had bought her in the aftermath of the shoplifting case it was a hot day and she was pushing the bike up towards the camp when she suddenly as she put it felt her ancestors calling out to her it was the most incredible experience like the one alfred watkins must have had when he first saw those lines in the landscape except i was aware of just one line leading from me to the hill and back through the centuries the hill was vibrating under me i was shaking i realized this was what id been training for during all those years of digging people up but that was only bones i want to unearth real people i want to communicate with them i knew i had to discover the story of the hill and the dinedor people it was just an amazing moment i felt as light as a butterfly moon had been up here until the dusk came shed found herself almost frantically knocking on the doors of farmhouses and cottages all around the hill to find out who was living here and who had lived here for the most generations discovering as shed suspected she might that the oldest dinedor family was her own moon maintained that her family had come out of the original settlement on dinedor hill all those years before the time of christ but none lived here any more her father had snapped the line close to sunset moon had arrived at dyn farm at the old mellowed farmhouse near to the camp to find the purefoys londoners earlyretired in the garden usually as you know im so shy unless ive taken something but i was glowing they didnt seem very friendly at first a bit reserved like a lot of new people but when i told them who i was they became quite excited and invited me in of course they were asking me all sorts of questions about the house that i couldnt really answer i was just a toddler when we left then they showed me the barn and i felt that my whole life had been leading up to that moment moon came over and stood in front of lol close enough for him to see her nipples through the nightdress oh god he kept looking at her face i wanted to tell him my father that it was ok it was me i was back i was here i wanted to tell him it was all right that id help him to find peace you tried to talk to him no not last night i couldnt get close enough to him this was the first night last saturday yeah i had a sleep and then i went for a walk in the woods where he shot himself i went there when it was dark you saw him then this is eerie this is not good i didnt see him then that was when i started to call out for him literally maybe i remember standing in the woods and screaming daddy it was funny it was like i was a small child again lol said tentatively you um you think that was safe on your own oh nothing will ever happen to me on the hill i intend to walk and walk day and night until i know every tree and bush of those woods every fold of every field ive got to make up for all those years away you know i have to absolutely immerse myself in the hill until it goes everywhere with me until it fills my dreams so when you when you saw him that was a kind of dream was it she looked down at him her nightdress smelled of sweat and mothballs her hair hung down over each shoulder like a stole she said are you supposed to be my therapist now lol i dont think so not officially i just help dick dicks hopeless isnt he dicks a dead loss he doesnt believe in anything outside of textbook psychology hes a nice bloke lol said awkwardly he wants to do his best for you hes an idiot if you told dick id seen my father hed come up with a beautiful theory involving hallucinations or drugs but you see i dont have any drugs i dont need anything up here its a constant natural high and it would be kind of an insult anyway and i have never had hallucinations ever her hair swung close to his face it was the kind of hair medieval maidens dangled from high windows so that knights could climb up and rescue them so its not official she said i mean us were not counsellor and patient or anything lol was confused he felt himself blushing were a bit official he said you have to report back to dick i suppose so youll tell him about this not if moon turned away and dipped like a heron between two boxes coming up with a dark green cardigan which she pulled on then it was a dream she bent and pouted at him a petulant child it was all a dream graveyard angel a mysterious summons to the bishops palace wednesday afternoon market day and the city still crowded merrily found a parking space near the black lion in bridge street she might have been allowed to drive into the palace courtyard but this could be considered presumptuous she didnt want that almost didnt want to be noticed sliding through the shoppers in her black woollen twopiece a grey silk scarf over her dogcollar looking out while she was in the area for canon dobbs the exorcist what she needed was a confidential chat with the old guy nobody else involved to clear the air maybe even iron things out if she took on this task she wanted no hard feelings no trail of resentment contacting dobbs was not so easy in deliverance according to huw owen lowprofile was essential to avoid being troubled by cranks and nutters or worse but his guy was well below the parapet not even as she discovered in the phone book as a residential canon at the cathedral he had no parishioners to be accessible to but exdirectory evensong at ledwardine church had recently been suspended by popular demand or rather the absence of it so on sunday night with jane out at a friends merrily had found time to ring alan crombie the rector of madley but he wasnt much help never had to consult him merrily but i remember colin strong when he was at vowchurch there was a persistent problem at a farmhouse and he ended up getting dobbs in i think he simply did it through the bishops office you leave a message and he gets in touch with you well that was no use it would get right back to mick hunter so ordinary members of the public have no real access to dobbs not initially alan crombie said its strictly clergyconsultation thats normal practice if you have a problem you go to your local priest and he decides if he can cope with it or if he needs specialist advice what happened at vowchurch did dobbs deal with it lord knows one of his rules is total secrecy anything gets in the papers i gather his wrath is awesome to behold do you have another little problem in that department yourself merrily no i oh what the hell off the record alan the bishops asked me to succeed dobbs when he retires oh i see silence then a nervous laugh well rather you than me i realize i may have to buy a black bag and a big hat god you dont want to go in for that kind of thing alan had said with another nervous laugh have all kinds of perverts following you home merrily walked along king street the cathedral up ahead filling her vision she had no idea what dobbs looked like and saw no men in big hats with black bags although it didnt look much from the front the bishops palace was perhaps the most desirable dwelling in hereford next door to the cathedral but closer to the river wye and dreamily visible from the public footpath on the opposite bank with its big white windows on mellow red brick treefringed lawns sloping to the water inside shed never been further than the vastly refurbished twelfthcentury great hall where receptions were held today she didnt even make it across the courtyard sophie hill the bishops elegant whitehaired laysecretary met her at the entrance steering her through a door under the gatehouse and up winding stone stairs about twenty of them its not very big but michael thought youd like it better that way im sorry merrily pulled off her scarf it could be quite charming sophie reached beyond her to push open the door at the top of the steps with a few pictures and things to the left please mrs watkins there were two offices in the gatehouse a bigger one with a vista of broad street and this sloping ceiling timbered and whitewashed walls a desk with a phone a scuffed repro captains chair that swivelled two filing cabinets a small bookcase with a bible and some local reference books including janes onetime bible the folklore of herefordshire by ella mary leather merrily walked uncertainly over to the window overlooking the courtyard and the former stables a few parked cars and great stacks of split logs for the bishops fires welcome to deliverance tower said sophie deadpan the computers on order walking dazed into the blustery sunshine on broad street merrily felt the hand of fate so heavily on her shoulder that she nearly threw up an arm to shake it off it had felt good up in the gatehouse almost cosy on top of the city and yet remote from it a refuge an eyrie it had felt right careful dont be seduced on the first date sophie had said the bishop had planned to see her himself but mrs hunter had an important appointment and her own car was being serviced this appeared to be true through the window merrily had watched mick in clerical shirt under what was almost certainly an armani jacket accompany his wife to a dusty bmw in british racing green she saw that val hunter was very tall nearly as tall as the bishop angular heronlike tawny hair thrown back a beauty with breeding they had two sons at boarding school although mick had confessed in an interview with the observer to having very mixed feelings about private education merrily suspected his wife didnt share them hes still rather feeling his way sophie had confided but he does want change and im afraid hell be terribly disappointed if you walk away from this mrs watkins he regards it as a very meaningful step for the female ministry at the top of broad street now merrily stared at the rings in a jewellers window and saw her reflection and all the people passing behind her one man with a briefcase looking over his shoulder at her legs while her back was turned she began to tremble she needed a cigarette actually even stronger than that came the realization that she needed to pray like now abruptly as though obeying some hypnotic command she turned back towards the cathedral rapidly crossing the green and once again guiltily winding the scarf about her throat to cover the collar she wanted no one to see her no one to approach within yards of the north door she thought of going around the back to the cloisters asking the first person she didnt recognize where canon dobbs lived but by now the compulsion to pray was too strong a racing in the blood she breathed out jesus it happened only rarely like this like the day she drove into the country with a blinding headache and ended up following a track to a celllike church dedicated to some forgotten celtic saint where when shed most needed it when she was just finding out the sordid truth about seans business thered been this sudden blissful sense of blue and gold and a lamplit path opening in front of her a group was entering the cathedral it looked like a womens institute party isnt there a cafe someone said grumpily merrily felt like pushing past but waited at the end of the line as the women moved singly through the porch when she was inside she saw them fanning into the aisles heard echoes of footsteps and birdlike voices spiralling through sacred stone caverns and she was just standing there on her own and tingling with need welcome to hereford cathedral an amplified voice from the distant pulpit the duty chaplain if youd all please be seated well begin the tour with a short prayer thank you sweating now almost panicking merrily stumbled through the first available doorway and slithered to her knees in the merciful gloom of the fifteenthcentury chantry chapel of bishop john stanbury with its gilded triptych and its luxuriously carved and moulded walls and ceilings merging almost organically it seemed in a rush of rippling honeyed stone when she put her hands together she could feel the tiny hairs on the backs of them standing electrically on end god she was whispering what is it what is it that sensation of incredible potential all the answers to all the questions no more than an instant away an atom of time a membrane of space theres this picture of her jane said that she once threw away only i rescued it from the bin for purposes of future leverage and blackmail and stuff i think she knows ive got it but she never says anything they walked past the school tennis courts their nets removed for the winter and across to the sixthform car park where rowennas fiesta stood six years old and limegreen but otherwise brilliant shes wearing this frock like a heavyduty binliner right and her hairs kind of bunched up with these like plastic spikes sticking out shes got on this luminous white lipstick and her eyes are like under about three economy packs of cheap mascara rowenna shook her head sadly her favourite band jane said was siouxsie and the banshees dont said rowenna pained well actually they werent bad rowenna unlocked the fiesta you could always sell the picture to the tabloids yeah but shed have to do something controversial first to get them interested just another woman priest who used to be a punk that isnt enough is it i suppose i could take it to the hereford times whod pay you about enough to buy a couple of cds yeah midprice ones jane climbed into the passenger seat no the point i was trying to make you look at that picture and you can somehow see the future priest there you know what i mean all dark and ritualistic what shes some kind of vestment fetishist no its just oh shit dean wall and danny gittoes famous sad ledwardine louts were leaning over the car deans big face up against the passenger window jane wound it down dean fumbled out his ingratiating leer all right for a lift home ladies not today ok rowenna said in fact not ever jane cranked up the window like no offence but wed rather not wind up raped and the car burned out if thats ok with you dean was saying you f as jane wound the window the last inch foot down ro rowenna drove off smiling nicely handled kitten thanks rowenna was new at the school but nearly two years older than jane on account of her family moving around a lot and a long spell of illness shed got way behind so shed needed to restart her alevel course she was a cool person in a way a kind of older sister a role she seemed to like you dont mean said jane astounded that you have actually given those two hairballs a lift like how did you get the slime off the upholstery rowenna laughed i see now it was a grave mistake and i wont do it again what were you saying about your mother i didnt quite grasp the nature of the problem oh its just jane cupped her hands over her nose and mouth and sighed into them just shes worth more than this thats all like ok maybe she was drawn into it by this spiritual need and the need to bring it out in other people you know what i mean maybe rowenna drove with easy confidence within only a couple of hundred yards of the school they were out into countryside with wooded hills and orchards but i mean the church of england like what can you really expect of an outfit that was only set up so henry viii could dump his wife spiritually theyre just a bunch of nohope tossers and i cant see that the ordination of women will change a thing i suppose even the catholics kind of look like theyve got something together rowennas father was an army officer possibly sas and the family had spent some time in northern ireland but you know what i mean jane hunched forward clasping her hands together i imagine her in about forty years time sitting by the gas fire in some old clergypersons home full of arthritis from kneeling on cold stone floors and thinking what the hell was that all about rowenna laughed a sound like ice in a cocktail glass she looked innocent and kind of wispy but she was pretty shrewd and this deliverance trip right jane knew she wasnt supposed to discuss this but rowennas military background highsecurity clearance all that stuff meant she could be trusted not to spread things around its obvious she thinks this is a kind of cuttingedge thing to do and will maybe take her closer you know what i mean to the spiritual world but its actually quite the opposite from what i can see the job is actually to stop people getting close she has to actively discourage all contact with the occult or anything mystical anything interesting i think thats kind of immoral dont you its kind of fascist rowenna said lets face it almost any kind of spiritual activity is more fun than going to church i wouldnt argue with that and then as usual it was suddenly gone sometimes you were left floating on a cushion of peace occasionally there was an aching void this time only silence coloured by the placid images of the cathedral and the wye bridge in the small stainedglass window just above her head merrily stood up shakily in the intimacy of bishop stanburys exquisite chantry she stood with her arms by her sides breathing slowly it was like sex sublime at the time but what if anything had it altered what progression was there outside in the main body of the cathedral the prayer was over and there was a communal rising and clattering she stood quietly in the doorway of the chantry her grey silk scarf dangling from her fingers go away go away a few yards away a mans voice rose impatiently i cant possibly discuss this here i dont understand a woman now agitated what have i been doing wrong hush a stuttering of footsteps merrily stepped out of the chantry saw a woman about sixty who drew breath stifled a cry turned sharply and walked quickly away across to the exit which led to the cathedral giftshop she wore a tweed coat and boots and a puffy velvet hat she never looked back from the aisle to the left of the chantry the man watched her go merrily said im so sorry i didnt mean to he wore a long overcoat he glanced at her i think your party is over in the lady chapel then he saw her collar and she saw his and the skirt of the cassock below his overcoat and although shed never seen him before as soon as she discerned cold recognition in the pale eyes in that stone face the face of some ancient eroded graveyard archangel she knew who he was and before she was aware of them the words were out possibly under the circumstances the stupidest words she could have uttered is there anything i can do canon dobbs he looked at her for a long time she couldnt move eventually without any change of expression he walked past her and left the cathedral beautiful theory for many years dick lyden had been something stressful in the city of london now he and his wife were private psychotherapists in hereford dick was about thirty pounds heavier pinkcheeked income decidedly reduced a much happier man and moon in her spiritual home at last he beamed feet on his desk how is moon moon is lol hesitated moon is what i wanted to see you about dick and ruth lived and practised in half of a steep edwardian terrace on the western side not far from the old watertower dicks attic office had a view across the city to dinedor hill to which lols gaze was now inevitably being pulled when dick expansively opened up his hands allowing him the floor lol turned his chair away from the window and told dick about the crow which moon claimed had mystically fallen dead at her feet dick swivelled his feet from the desk rubbed his forehead pushing back slabs of battleshipgrey hair and do you think it really did i didnt see it happen so she may just have found it in the hedge and made the rest up its possible lol said and the blood she actually thats extraordinary dick rubbed his hands together looking up at a plaster cornice above lols head and yet you know while it might seem horrible to the likes of us shes spent quite a few years scrabbling about in the earth ferreting out old skulls with worms in their eyes this was a bit different though yes it was dick conceded in fact yes what they were looking at here was really quite an elaborate fantasy structure on the lines of one of those impossibly complicated computer games his son james used to play before he discovered rock music except this wasnt dragons and demons this was built on layers of actual history lets examine it lets pull it apart dick dragged a foolscap pad towards him began to draw circles and link them with lines whatve we got an extremely intelligent girl with a degree in archaeology some years experience in the field and this absorbing fanatical interest in the iron age civilization which became an obsession the celtic jewellery the strange woollens she still wear that awful sheepskin waistcoat thing not recently thats one good thing anyway suddenly shes aware she can explain this obsession in the context of her own family history shes been told the family roots in that particular spot go back to the dark ages and before which is probably complete nonsense but thats irrelevant she forms the idea that this is what she was born to do because of the place she was born on the side of this iron age fort or whatever it is dick drew a crude hill with battlements perhaps believing that theres some great secret here that only she can recover some holy grail but of course what she really wants to find is a key to her fathers suicide dick smiled happily at lol he loved finding crossreferences who knows laurence who knows what horrors lodged in the mind of a twoyearold child in circumstances like that and dinedor hill never talked about denny going dark with anger if the subject of their father arises so much mystery well she doesnt want to believe her old man topped himself because he messed up his finances its got to be more profound than that its profound enough lol said by losing the farm he let down his family and his ancestors scores of farmers have killed themselves in the past few years for similar reasons and were talking about a very historic family absolutely shes bunched all that together into an epic personal quest with all the pseudomystical and supernatural overtones of jamess trashy computer games is that a good thing though dick moon living at the centre of a fantasy i dont see that its necessarily bad and if its all going to be providing material for her book do we know what kind of book she has in mind a history of dinedor hill seen through the eyes of the people who live there now splendid dick interrupted and the people who lived there over two thousand years ago constructed from archaeological evidence and what she feels is her own instinctive knowledge of her ancestors well that could be a very valid book couldnt it one can certainly imagine a publisher going for that i could talk to some people myself i dont know lol had been doubtful about this book from the start a book wasnt like a song you couldnt knock it out in a couple of hours when the inspiration was there she doesnt seem organized enough for anything like that for instance dennys managing the shop for a few days while she gets the barn sorted supposedly but this morning virtually nothing had changed everything still in boxes which was what denny said itd be like chaos and moon living inside herself dick shrugged so after the excitement of the move theres a period of emotional exhaustion then she dusts herself off starts to pick up the pieces then the rehab begins ill give her a couple of days and then ill go and have a chat myself or we can both go yes ok you dont seem too sure is there something else dicks hopeless isnt he dicks a dead loss he doesnt believe in anything outside of textbook psychology moon had predicted that dick would come up with a beautiful theory and he had without lol even mentioning her story about seeing her father at the window you have to report back to dick youll tell him about this dick tore off the top sheet of the pad and crumpled it up i think youd better spit it out lol yes he had to there was a professional arrangement here dick had insisted lol should be paid a retainer to keep an eye on moon and report back once a week it was complicated at first lol had been paying dick for analysis now dick was paying lol in his kindly way dick was devious lol was still not sure whether observing moon was not supposed to be part of his own therapy women had been lols problem women and religion hed wound up first consulting dick lyden during the summer while still trying to sell his rosesroundthedoor cottage on the edge of an orchard out at ledwardine to which hed moved with a woman called alison who he thought had rescued him from the past and the shadow of the psychiatric hospital but alison had her own reasons for coming to ledwardine and they didnt include lol the people who actually had tried to rescue him had come from the village itself they included a brusque old biddy called lucy devenish now dead and also the parish priestincharge at this stage in lols life priests of any kind were to be avoided his parents had been drawn into this awful evangelicalfundamentalist christian church and had decided that lol with his strange songs and his dubious lifestyle was no longer their son at his mothers graveside lols father had turned his back on him lol had henceforth been suspicious of everything in a dogcollar that was not a dog until the vicar of ledwardine who in the end had been the reason for him leaving the village the vicar was after all a very busy and respected person and lol was this pathetic little sometimessongwriter living on hackwork and royalties from before the fall he wasnt sure she realized how he felt he was sure she didnt need this so he left her his black cat and moved to hereford putting his bits of furniture in store and lodging for a while in a pub just down the street from dick lyden dicks local as it happened also denny moons which had led to several sessions in dennys recording studio and a few consultation sessions with dick because lol still couldnt rely on his own mental equilibrium christ dick had said one afternoon you know more about this bloody trade than i do fascinated by lols extensive knowledge of psychiatry absorbed over hours then weeks and months spent in the medical library at a lax and decaying loonybin in oxfordshire apart from a general selfesteem deficit this is probably your principal problem youre a kind of mental hypochondriac perhaps you need to help diagnose other people for a while to take your mind off it loonies taking over the practice the idea had really appealed to dick the idea of lol keeping an experienced eye on another of his clients twentysomething gorgeous weird dick loved it when clients could help each other his practice becoming a big family it was still small this city he liked the way relationships and associations developed an organic life spread like creeper on a wall and therefore strengthened his own latent roots in hereford thus lol had been introduced to katherine moon and perhaps also because dick couldnt quite get a handle on moon her fathers ghost dick said calmly twice right dick hunched intently forward now think carefully about this lol what effect did this alleged manifestation have on her what kind of an experience was it soothing frightening cathartic not frightening so a mans face at the window at dead of night a young woman all alone in a stillstrange dwelling and shes not frightened what does that tell us she said she had the impression he was more scared than she was disturbed and confused she thought he didnt recognize her didnt know who she was interesting she said she wanted to tell him it was ok dick spread his hands moon as healer she wants him to find peace and when he does she will too dick said i really dont see a problem there seems to be all bubbling away quite satisfactorily in moons subconscious she finds a dead crow and inflicts upon the poor bird all of her not inconsiderable knowledge of celtic crowlore the crows been sent by the ancestors to give her the sight so whats she going to see first thats very good dick it makes sense my boy its about belonging isnt it look at me i do feel ive found my spiritual home here in this city so tiny after london and knowable ruth tells me im continually pulling this town to my bosom but a hill a hills much more embraceable isnt it dick leaned over to the window to scan the horizon you know im not even sure i know which one it is the one with all the trees in the afternoon sunshine the woods were a golden crust on the long shallow loaf hmm dick turned away not particularly imposing is it and this was where the first settled community was this hill is what you might call the mother of hereford i suppose the holy hill super dick said with firm satisfaction one must feel a weight of responsibility to ones ancestors if one was born on a holy hill and her fathers suicide a readymade open wound for her to heal lol felt unhappy he didnt like the way dick seemed to assume that once youd made a neat psychological package out of something that was it sorted in lols experience real life was endlessly messy dick leaned back in his leather swivelrocker hands comfortably enfolded over his lightbulb gut the way we create our destiny on an epic computergame scale would that it was as simple for all of us do you know i rather suspect theres a paper in this lets go and see her what are you doing tomorrow morning so you think it was a dream lol said hmm her father a dream or an invention well good god man dick threw up his arms what the hell else could it have been clerical chic driving home merrily hardly noticed the countryside the shambling black and white farms and cottages the emptied orchards over it all as though bevelled in the windscreen glass hovered the unchanging weathered face of the archaic monument that was canon t h b dobbs that silent confrontation in the cathedral had erased time she could no longer remember praying in bishop stanburys beautiful chantry only the stumbling in and the creeping out the interim was like an alcoholic haze but she had her answer didnt she just in the late afternoon the wind had died leaving the sky lumpy and congealed like a cold fried breakfast beneath it the historic village of ledwardine looked sapped and brittle the black and white buildings lifeless as indeed several now were nothing remained for instance of cassidys country kitchen except a sign and some peeling appletransfers on the dark glass and five for sale signs had sprouted between church street and old barn lane the village looked like it needed care and love and a shot of something an injection of spirit of god perhaps introduced by a conscientious caring priest without selfish ambitions she wasnt equipped to fulfil confess you were stimulated youd had a meaningful brush with the paranormal and you wanted to know more in fact admit it it was you that huw owen was addressing when he said prospective deliverance ministers should analyse their motives consider if they needed evidence of life after death to sustain their faith proof of the existence of supernatural evil to convince them of a power for good huw had been full of foreboding jane had been dismissive only mick hunter was enthusiastic and mick hunter was a politician and now god had arbitrated signalling in the silence of canon t h b dobbs his unequivocal negative of course that could have been pure coincidence if were being rational about this but the compulsion to rush into the cathedral the waiting chantry dobbs being right there when she emerged shed wanted a sign shed received a sign end of story later this evening she would phone the bishop and tell him what wasnt after all going to happen mature trees seemed to push the old vicarage back from the village centre beneath them was parked a lurid luminousgreen fiesta which had to be something to do with jane if it was a boyfriend merrily only hoped he was under twenty because of the size of the house jane had taken over the entire top floor formerly attics as her private apartment and had finally reemulsioned her sittingroomstudy as the dutch painter mondrian might have envisaged it the squares and rectangles between the timbers in different primary colours if the inspector of listed buildings ever turned up the kid was on her own she wasnt on her own up there now though was she merrily edged the volvo around the little car and parked in the driveway although she talked a lot about totty janes relations with boys had been curiously restrained you waited with a certain trepidation for the big one because the kid didnt do things by halves and the first stirring of real love would probably send her virginity spinning straight out of the window so merrily was halfrelieved when she opened the front door to find jane in the hall with a girl in the same school uniform an older girl though not as vividly sophisticated as janes last illfated friend colette cassidy this one was ethereal with long red softspun hair which floated behind her as she gazed around oh hi i was just going to show rowenna the apartment jane gestured vaguely at merrily thats the reverend mum the girl came over and actually shook hands jane sat down on the stairs rowennas dads with the sas with the army rowenna said discreetly this is a really amazing house mrs watkins wonderfully atmospheric you can feel its memories kind of vibrating in the oak beams i was just saying to jane if i lived here i think id just keep going round hugging beams and things our place is really new and boring with fitted cupboards and wardrobes and things i bet its a lot easier to heat and keep clean though merrily said ruefully you live locally rowenna well you know up towards credenhill where the base is rowenna wrinkled her nose i wish we were down here its on a completely different plane the past is real here you feel you could just slip into it right merrily said if thats what you want yes rowenna didnt blink most of the time yes merrily thought it was a sad indictment of society when young people wanted not so much to change the world as to change it back to some golden age which almost certainly never was oh hey listen to this jane sprang up rowennas dad goes running right with mick hunter well not exactly rowenna looked a bit uncomfortable the bishop has this arrangement to go along with the guys on some of their routine crosscountry runs its kind of irregular apparently im not really supposed to talk about it god thought merrily hed just have to go training with the sas wouldnt he isnt that just so cool jane drawled cynically merrily smiled shes not what i expected at all rowenna went to sit on janes old sofa staring up at the mondrian walls most of the women priests you see around look kind of bedraggled but with that suit and the black stockings and everything she makes the dogcollar seem like i dont know a fashion accessory clerical chic jane said dont tell her for gods sake she only stopped wearing that awful anklelength cassock because this guy was turned on by all those buttons to undo which guy her former organist creepy little git no special person in her life only the big guy with the long beard and the bishop rowenna shot her a look hey just professionally said jane i hope sure the first time i saw him i thought wow yeah this is the goods but then i couldnt believe id been that shallow besides hes got a wife and kids whatever that counts for these days yeah hed probably quite like to get his leg over mum if you can keep it inside the priesthood it probably saves a lot of hassle i just hope shes more sensible you want a coffee no thanks i have to be off in a minute rowenna stood up and moved across to janes bookcase youve got it all here havent you personal transformation pastlife regression communicating with nature spirits yeah im a sad new age weirdo dont spread it around its not weird to be interested in whats going to happen to us do you do anything like you know meditation or anything like that ive thought about it after when i once had a couple of odd things happen to me rowenna sat down again go on it was probably just imagination i mean you can make something out of everything cant you like mum she reckons she sometimes gets these images of blue and gold when shes saying her prayers and so she connects it with god because thats like the container shes in but it could be anything couldnt it so what happened to you i dont talk about it much i reckon if you try to analyse this stuff it just evaporates not around me kitten ok well i just feel this intense connection to some places like you were talking about hugging beams i feel i want to hug hills and fields andhey this is really really stupid its just hyperimagination oh jane dont stop now sorry ok well like time passes and youre not aware of it its like youre here but youre not here and then youre here again some kind of shift in reality maybe it happens to everybody but most people disregard it there was an old woman in the village i used to be able to talk to about this stuff but shes dead now i think theres another side to all of us we need to discover rowenna said especially us i mean our generation were growing up into this awesome millennial situation where all the old stuffs breaking down like political divisions and organized religion thats not knocking your mum or anything its ok jane said she knows its all coming to pieces she got these quite sizeable congregations at first on account of being a woman but the noveltys wearing off already when the church is just surviving on gimmicks you know its the slippery slope go on all i was saying is that we shouldnt pass up on the opportunity to expand our consciousness wherever possible ill go along with that what sort of stuff have you done oh ive just kind of messed around the edges rowenna flicked the pages of a paperback about interpreting dreams like when we were in salisbury i had this friend whose sister did tarot readings and she showed me two layouts i was doing it at school for a few weeks it was really incredible how accurate it was then i did this reading for a girl who was getting to be quite a good friend and it came out really horrible and she got meningitis soon afterwards and nearly died and she never came back to school which kind of spooked me jane shrugged that doesnt mean it was the cards gave her meningitis can you still remember how would you be able to do a reading for me mmm dont think so rather not wimp maybe tell you what though i saw this poster down the healthfood shop right theres a psychic fair on in leominster next weekend cool what is it youve never been to one there are loads about rowenna my mothers a vicar i lead this dead sheltered life rowenna smiled well actually ive just been to one and it was seriously tacky and full of freaky old dames in gypsy clobber but good fun if you didnt take it too seriously we could check it out ok jane said i suspect id better not tell mum i suppose she wouldnt be cool about that stuff alternative spirituality subversive actually shes pretty liberal well to a point things could be just a tiny bit dicey at the moment though so i wouldnt want to you know jane thought about the soul police then she looked at rowenna and saw that this was someone intelligent and worldly and kind of unfettered someone she could actually share stuff with i mean i guess mum feels that any kind of spirituality is better than none at all jane grinned which i suppose is how i feel about the church of england that night merrily and jane made sandwiches and ate them in front of a repeat of an early episode of king of the hill and then jane said shed go to her apartment and have a read and an early night so merrily returned as she usually did to the kitchen she always felt more in control in the kitchen it was a bit vast but theyd had lots of cupboards put in and installed a couple of squashy easychairs and some muted lighting recently shed converted the adjacent scullery into an office she supposed this was her apartment which meant that with just the two of them huge areas of the vicarage remained unused stupid and wasteful no wonder the church was selling off so many of its old properties and installing vicars in modest estatehouses at least merrily was no longer so intimidated by all those closed bedroom doors which had played their own sinister role in the paranormal fluctuations that might if shed then heard of him have sent her to consult canon dobbs it had been quiet up there for several months now a day or two ago shed caught herself thinking she would almost welcome its return a chance to study an imprint at close hand but then probably not not now it was ten fifteen the bishop had given her his private number with instructions to call anytime but she never had this was probably too late dont be a wimp merrily went through to the scullery switched on the desk lamp the answering machine had an unblinking red light for once nobody had called on the desk sat the apple mac shed bought secondhand god knows what was being installed in the deliverance office if she didnt stop it now she pulled down the cordless phone and stabbed out the number very quickly it rang only twice before mick hunter came on the latenight dj voice hi val and mick are unavailable at the moment please leave a message after the tone god bless merrily hesitated for a second before she cut the line shed do this properly tomorrow call his office and make an appointment she was aware that when you came face to face with mick hunter your doubts and reservations tended to be tidalwaved by his personality but that wasnt going to happen this time she thought of calling huw owen at his stark stone rectory in the brecon beacons but to say what realizing then that the only reason she would be calling huw at this time of night was some tenuous hope that hed changed his mind about the suitability of women priests for trench warfare unhappy with herself she switched out the lights and went up to bed ethel the black cat padding softly behind her the bedside phone bleeped her awake reverend watkins yes merrily struggled to sit up oh im sorry to disturb you it was your husband i wanted is he there im afraid hes dead merrily squinted at the luminous clock clawing for the light switch over the bed but not finding it nearly ten past two im sorry the woman said have i got the right number im trying to contact the reverend watkins northern irish accent yeah thats me oh well i this is sister cullen at hereford general general what sorry the general hospital jesus merrily scrambled out of bed into a wedge of moonlight sandwiched between the curtains is somebody hurt has there been an accident jane she went cold jane had crept out again after merrily had gone to bed jane and her friend in the car clubbing in hereford too much to drink oh no please its nothing like that the sister said almost impatient it was suggested we call you thats all we have a problem one of our patients is asking for a priest and the hospital chaplains away for the night we were given your number as somebody who should be the one to deal with this there are some complications i dont understand im ten miles away scrabbling on the floor for her cigarettes who suggested we were given your number im sorry they never told me you were a woman that make a difference im sorry i didnt mean anything offensive i dont know what to do now look give me half an hour ok ill get dressed what are the complications you mentioned im sorry its not the sort of thing we discuss over the phone give me strength all right the general you said itll take me about twenty twentyfive minutes sister cullen ask for watkins ward what it was starting to feel like a dream the house had done this to her before the alfred watkins ward said sister cullen dont bother looking for your bible weve got one here denzil reversing the clanking volvo out of the vicarage drive she saw dobbss grim stone face again as though it was superimposed on the windscreen or the night itself as if the old bastard had been in the car waiting for her as if he was staying with her until shed formally walked away from his job as if this has got to bloody stop merrily gripped the wheel shaking it violently but really shaking herself shed become oppressed by the dour image of dobbs when shed had the chance to say a final no thank you to mick hunter and to deliverance she was going to keep well away from the cathedral precincts because she squeezing the wheel until her hands hurt never wanted to see him again ok steadying her breathing this was no state in which to minister to a dying man on the cobbles of the marketplace she thought she could see a glaze of frost the wroughtiron mockgaslamps had gone out leaving only a small wintry security light by the steps to the black swan she drove slowly across the square not wanting to wake anyone shed left a conspicuous note for jane on the kitchen table in case she didnt get home by morning you never knew with hospital vigils virtually alone on the country roads too tense to be tired she found the kids alltime favourite album the complex ok computer on the stereo and tried to concentrate on the words but her perception of the songs full of haunted darkness only reminded her of dobbs she stopped the music she would go over this thing once more the truth was after the shock of seeing dobbs in the cathedral when shed been all charged up and unstable her mind inevitably had contrived this divinely scripted scene he was there because she was but what about the unknown woman dobbs had been with what have i been doing wrong the woman had cried what was all that about well it made no obvious sense so forget it the simple rational explanation was that merrily had walked unexpected into dobbss scene perhaps he was just as shocked when who should suddenly emerge from the chantry but the notorious female pretender all right stop it there stop looking for a way out you made your decision you stick to it the general hospital was an eighteenthcentury brick building with the usual unsightly additions messy at the front but like the bishops palace with a beautiful situation on the wye a few hundred yards downstream from the cathedral no parking problems at pushing three am merrily left the volvo near a public garden where a path led down to the suspension footbridge over the river all dark down there now been here many times to visit parishioners of course but never at this hour and never to the alfred watkins ward named presumably after the herefordian pioneer photographer brewer magistrate and discoverer of leylines no relation of hers as far as she knew but then she didnt know the herefordshire side of the family very well bottom of the corridor a passing paramedic advised turn left and immediately left again through the plastic doors up the stairs left at the top and through the double doors these old buildings were wonderful merrily thought for almost everything except hospitals a plaque on the wall near the main entrance discreetly declared that this used to be a lunatic asylum and as you walked the unevenly lit twisting passages you could imagine the first ever patients wandering here groping vaguely for their senses the air dense with disease and desperation despite the directions received she lost herself in the dim labyrinth and it was over five minutes before she found a sign to alfred watkins ward at its entrance two nurses were talking quietly but with a lot of gesturing when they saw merrily they separated she smiled sister cullen on the ward the younger nurse said who shall i say merrily watkins the younger nurse pushed through the double doors into the gloom of the ward itself merrily unzipped her waxed jacket feeling better now she was here the presence of the dying used to scare her but recently shed become more comfortable with them even slightly in awe aware of this composure they often developed very close to the end a calm anticipation of the big voyage assisted passage and she would sometimes come away with a tentative glow over her past three years as a cleric several nurses had told her shyly that theyd actually seen spirits leaving bodies like a light within a mist oh hell the older nurse spotted the dogcollar took a step back in dismay youre the priest at three am merrily said you dont get an archbishop oh look the nurse was plump midfifties agitated this isnt right eileen cullen shouldnt have done this shes an atheist fair enough but she shouldve had more sense isnt there a male priest you know merrily stared in disbelief at the womans face pale and blotched under the hanging lights and fearful too dont look at me like that im sorry miss reverend its just that what we dont need is another woman look would you mind waiting there while i go and talk to sister cullen fine merrily said tightly dont worry about me i dont have to go to work until sunday look im sorry all right im sorry sure merrily sat down on a leathercovered bench pulled out her cigarettes and im afraid you cant smoke in here sister cullen was about merrilys age but tall shorthaired sombrefaced more like a priest than ill ever look behind her the ward diminished into darkness like a victorian railway tunnel i may have misled you on the phone cullen said i was confused youre confused merrily stood up forgive me but sometimes especially at three in the morning and without a cigarette even the clergy can get a trifle pissed off you know keep your voice down please im sorry i would just like to know what this is about all right cullen gestured at the bench and they both sat down its mr denzil joy thats the patient mr joys dying hes unlikely to see the morning im sorry with respect mrs watkins youll be the only one huh this is a difficult situation hes asked for a priest hasnt he no that thats where i misled you he hasnt she jerked a thumb at the double doors behind the glass merrily saw the other two nurses peering out they looked like they wanted to escape or at least stand as close as possible to the lights outside they did sister cullen said they asked me to call a priest following cullen through the darkened ward she was reminded of those wardrawings by henry moore of people sleeping in airraid shelters swaddled and anonymous the soundtrack of restive breathing ruptured snores shifting bodies was inflated by muted hissings and rumblings in the buildings own decaying metabolism and also merrily felt by slivers of tension in the sour sicknesssmelling air hes in a side ward here cullen whispered weve always had him in a side ward whats his his condition chronic emphysema lungs full of fluid been coming on for years hes been in four times this time he knows hes not going out and he isnt ready right cullen breathed scornfully down her nose earlier tonight he sent for his wife merrily looked for some significance in this shes not here with him now no we sent her home jesus a metalshaded lamp burned bleakly on a table at the entrance to the side ward across which an extra plasticcovered screen had been erected theres an evil in this man sister cullen began sliding the screen away brace yourself merrily said i dont understand what do you and then she did understand it was deliverance business huw owen had stressed compose prepare protect yourself always directing them to the prayer known as st patricks breastplate very old very british part of our legacy from the celtic church huw had said and merrily had seen the strength of the hermit in him the hermitpriest in the cave on the island christ be with me christ within me christ behind me christ before me christ beside me christ to win me christ to comfort and restore me christ beneath me christ above me christ in quiet christ in danger binding yourself with light huw had said this was what it was about a sealing of the portals old christian magic huw had said use it but she hadnt even thought of that shed made no preparations at all simply dashed out of the house like a junior doctor on call because that was all it was a routine ministering to the dying a standin job no one else available nobody had mentioned we were given your number as somebody who should be the one to deal with this there are some complications it had simply never occurred to her that the hospital had been given her name as a trained deliverance minister it never occurred to her that this was what she now was who had directed them the bishops office the bishop himself ive been set up she thought angry and afraid that whatever needed to be done she wouldnt be up to it there were two iron beds in the side ward one empty in the other mr denzil joy his eyes were slits unmoving under a sweatsheened and sallow forehead his hair was black an unnatural black for a man in his sixties a dying man dyeing she thought absurdly two pale green tubes came down his nostrils and looped away over his cheeks like a cartoon smile oxygen cullen explained in a whisper is he asleep in and out of it can he speak trying to understand what she was doing here looking hard at him wondering what she was missing like little horns or something what do you expect to see with difficulty cullen said should i sit with him a while fetch you a bible shall i lets lets just leave that a moment knowing how ominous a black leathered bible could appear to the patient at such times wishing shed brought her blue and white paperback version and still unclear about what they wanted from her here there was a vinylcovered chair next to the bed and she sat down denzil joy wore a white surgical smock thing one of his arms was out in view fingers curved over the coverlet she put her own hand over it and almost recoiled it was warm and damp slimy somehow reptilian a small nervous smile tweaked at cullens lips in the moment merrily touched denzil joy it seemed a certain scent arose the kind of odour you could almost see curling through the air so that it entered your nostrils as if directed there at first sweet and faintly oily then merrily gasped and took in a sickening mouthful and to her shame had to get up and leave the room a hand over her mouth the other hand not the one which had touched denzil joy one of the patients on the ward was calling out nurse as loudly as a farmer summoning a sheepdog over a sixacre field at the door merrily gulped in the stale hospital air as if it was ozone dr taylor found a good description for it eileen cullen was standing beside the metal lamp smiling grimly although he never quite got the full benefit of it being a man he said it was like a mixture of gangrene and cat faeces that seems pretty close though i wouldnt know for sure never kept cats myself excuse me a minute she padded down the ward towards the man calling out one hand raised forefinger of the other to her lips as soon as shed gone the plump middleaged nurse appeared from the shadows put her mouth up to merrilys ear ill tell you what that is reverend its the smell of evil huh he can turn it on dont look at me like that maybe its automatic when his blood temperature rises it comes to the same thing did you feel him enter you what we cant talk here she took merrilys arm pulled her away and into a small room lit by a strip light with sinks and bags of waste she shut the door the disinfectant smell here in comparison with that in the side ward was like honeysuckle on a summer evening im a strong woman the nurse said thirty years in the job everything nasty a person can throw off ive seen it and smelled it and touched it i can imagine no you cant my girl the nurse pushed up a sleeve you have no idea look at that now livid bruising around the wrist like shed been handcuffed what happened was mr joy he asked for a bottle to urinate in you know and then he called me back and he said he was having trouble getting it in well some of them they say that as a matter of course and you have a laugh and you go away and come back brandishing the biggest pair of forceps you can find but denzil joy was a very sick man and he seemed distressed so i did try to help she pulled down her sleeve again you see where that got me oh grip like a monkeywrench my dear thought id never get fooled again you understand now why we wanted a male priest surely what you wanted merrily thought was a male nurse look nurse im sorry nurse protheroe sandra sandra this is a dying man ok he knows hes dying hes afraid hes looking for comfort i suppose that doesnt make him possessed by evil i dont know what his background is i mean farmlabourer and slaughterman been in a few times before he has when he wasnt so bad not so seriously ill that is farmlabourer so his idea of comfort might be a bit rough and ready sandra snorted oh for heavens sake its more than that girl youre not getting this are you ive dealt with that type more times than youve done weddings and funerals rough as an old boar and ready for anything they can get but mr joy hes different mr joys an abuser a destroyer do you know what i mean he likes causing pain and death to animals and he likes doing it to women too hurting them and humiliating them degrading them yes that might very well be true but it doesnt that smell thats not natural not even in a hospital thats his smell thats the smell of all the things hes done and all the things hed still like to do we even put nilodour under his bed one night whats that undertakers fluid they put it in coffins sometimes so its less offensive for the relatives you put undertakers deodorant under a dying patients bed it didnt work you cant remove the smell of evil with chemicals you spend a night in here with that man you cant sleep when you goes home you keep waking up with that protheroe hugged herself as for young tessa white that girl was this was after his wife come in this afternoon sandra look merrily moved to the door this wasnt how stateregistered nurses were supposed to behave she needed to talk to the duty doctor you say i dont get this youre dead right i dont get this at all all right he might not be a very nice man he may not smell very good but thats no excuse to make his last hours a total misery i mean what does his wife say about all this mrs joy dont talk said sandra being as how youre a priest ill tell you about mrs joy shall i if you think itll help sandra exhaled a sour laugh about twenty years younger than him she is but you wouldnt know it to look at her state shes in the poor miserable cow no not a cow a rabbit a poor frightened little wretch we left them alone for about half an hour as you do at times like this then dr taylor comes on his rounds and he has to see mr joy obviously and tess goes in to ask mrs joy will she come out for a couple of minutes and footsteps outside sandra stopped talking looking at the door the footsteps passed sandra lowered her voice the chairs pushed right up next to the bed see that chair you were just sitting on yes merrily found her hands were clasped in front of her rubbing together she wanted to wash them but not in front of sandra protheroe go on so mrs joys standing on that chair leaning over the bed shes holding her dress right up above her waist shes got her knickers round her ankles merrily closed her eyes for a moment and denzils just lying there with his tubes up his nose and all the spittle down his chin wheezing and rattling with glee and his little eyes eating her up but thats not the worst thing see she swallowed backed up against a sink looking down at her shoes and shaking her head the worse thing is her face what tessa said was that womans face was completely blank no expression at all like a zombie shes just looking at the wall and her faces absolutely blank she knows tessas there but she dont get down showing no embarrassment at all though god knows she must have been as full up with shame and humiliation as its possible to be but she just stands there staring at the wall because he hadnt told her she could get down merrilys mouth was dry this is a dying man sandra said and he knows it and she knows it and shes still terrified of him in his younger days see he thought he was gods gift a woman who knows the family she told me about all the women and girls hed had and the way he abused them but they kept coming back he charmed them back he did not by his looks not by his manners he just charmed them and then he got older and he got sick and he got married and he controls the wife by fear and hes lying there delighting in tessa seeing the poor little woman giving him an eyeful of what he owns if thats not evil then i dont know what evil is what is evil huw owen had said its the question youre never going to answer but when youre in the same room with it youll know merrily said im sorry i dont know what i can do protection she wants protection the door had opened sister cullen was standing there the darkness behind her shes right hes a bad man with a black charm but hes just a man and thats where it ends as far as im concerned im from derry so ive seen what religion does to people and i want none of it but this is one patient where im more concerned about his nurses its getting stronger the nearer he comes to death sandra said tell her sandras convinced the smells getting worse and if you dont do something when he dies this wards going to be polluted for ever and im not coming back tomorrow im out let me get this right merrily looked from one to the other the believer and the atheist but both essentially of the same mind youve called me out in the middle of the night not because you want comfort for a distressed terminal patient but because you want protection from him cullen said with resignation if theres anything you think you can do about it feel free but id strongly advise you not to touch the evil bastard again sister the young nurse tessa in the doorway she was crying can you come please scritchscratch merrily thought of the almostpoetic abstraction of imprints and visitors and weepers and breathers she thought about the hitchhiker the disembodied spirit which took over someones body for a period usually for some specific if illogical purpose and then went away she considered probably the worst of them all huw had discussed this in detail over the last two days of the deliverance course the squatter and then thought about the pathetic stinking wheezing nasalcathetered reality of denzil joy who fitted into none of the slick categories which charlie headland had said reminded him of the fictionalized world of espionage what was denzil joy other than an unpleasant man coming to the end of his run was he indeed any of her business there were several tests you had to implement before a subject could reasonably be considered possessed by an external demonic evil most importantly the psychiatric assessment now how could anyone assess a man apparently in the last hours of his life a person unable to speak it was an impossible situation im sorry sister tessa said it was just that his breathing sort of altered and i thought he was starting to go all four of them stood watching denzil from outside the door gone has he an old man warbling from the ward whats happening over there everythings fine francis eileen cullen hissed go to sleep now will you merrily took a closer look at denzil joy his face halflit by the lamp on a table just outside the door black hair over shallow forehead small sucking mouth his frame thin and wiry with bony arms grip like a monkeywrench my dear does he never say anything never ask for anything doesnt he talk to you doesnt like talking to women cullen said prefers to communicate with us in other ways sandra instinctively massaged her bruised wrist i reckon he didnt do this on his own thats what i think now merrily turned to her youre a christian sandra i attend st peters sandra declared piously well not every week sometimes shifts dont allow obviously but one week in every three at least that and you dont believe eileen im aware of evil she snapped of course i am i just think theres quite enough of it on this earth to be going on with tessa im scared in her uniform no makeup tessa looked about janes age although she surely must be several years older she had quite a posh accent i thought he was cheynestoking i didnt want to be alone with him when he died merrily glanced at cullen who beckoned her away from the door she means the kind of sporadic breathing that tells you theyre on their way out merrily nodded remembering other bedsides the smells gone eileen at least its not what it was i dont know he seems to be able to turn it on and off at will thats what gets to protheroe him controlling his smell particularly when a woman gets close theres a psychological solution if you ask me hes kind of drawing energy through sexual arousal i cant imagine theres any physical arousal and i dont feel inclined to check ive about had it with this one cullen wiped her brow with the side of a fist see earlier on sandra was threatening to walk out thats when i called you she knows if i took any disciplinary action over this thered be unfavourable publicity of the kind nobody wants im going through the motions so i am and id be happy if you could just do the same primarily we need to consider whats best for him i just think hes an evil bastard you know i wish hed just die then we could get him portered the hell out of here merrily sighed no putting this off any longer ill go in and say a few prayers for him thats it i thought you were an exorcist of some kind some kind merrily said i bind unto myself the name the strong name of the trinity by invocation of the same the three in one and one in three she was back in the sluiceroom alone this time murmuring st patricks breastplate to the pale grey walls a window was open she heard a siren coming closer police or an ambulance bringing someone into casualty the normal world out there and here she was in a former lunatic asylum getting into dark age armour relying on her god to pull her out of this if it should turn out to be misguided dont ever fall into the trap of thinking its you thats doing it huw had stressed youre never any more than the medium the vessel we dont want any of this van helsing crap wielding the crucifix like its a battleaxe always preferred a titchy little cross meself lets you know where you stand in the great scheme of things she wore her own cross under her jumper and it too was pretty small what she could do was limited anyway she wasnt allowed to perform an exorcism and quite right too without the permission of the bishop knowing mick hunter hed call for a written report spend at least two days considering the ethics of it and how hed look if it leaked out merrily stepped out on to the ward where most of the patients slept noisily on shuffling and muttering few people got a peaceful night in a hospital the silent digital wallclock said id better come in with you the night sister said perhaps not eileen whenever possible have other christians with you as backup or witnesses in case theres any shit flying round afterwards in the media or put it this way if youre having people with you make sure you know where theyve been because im not a bloody biblebasher jesus all right nurse protheroe what about you you started all this sandra shrank away i cant superstition cullen said with contempt i can never accept that in a professional well there has to be a staff nurse in there this is a hospital in case anybodys forgotten ill do it tessa said dont be stupid sandra whispered harshly merrily thought of jane she wouldnt want the kid within a mile of this she thought my god this is some kind of awful first four women gathering like a bunch of witches to plot against a dying man this ever gets out well look ridiculous or dangerously paranoid or cold conspirators heartless vindictive are we look she said ill be all right on my own im not going to be doing anything dramatic no holy water you can all watch through the window if you like no said cullen i teach sunday school tessa offered solemnly and they all looked at her i can handle it as long as im not alone in there all right then eileen cullen shrugged perhaps still wanting to shame sandra protheroe into it but sandra didnt react just as long as you realize its not an instruction and you make sure and stay well back from the reverend you hear any trouble you come and get me you know what i mean by trouble i think so tessa nodded she bit her upper lip plucked a stray ashblonde hair from her forehead merrily put a hand on tessas shoulder leaned in to look for her eyes you sure about this its best isnt it all right do you want to come in here a minute the sluiceroom as temporary chapel merrily faced the girl over the rubbish sacks full of swabs and bandages soaked with bodily fluids and godknowswhat tessa i how old are you nineteen ok look i just want to say im not too sure about any of this whatever mr joys done in his time its not my job to judge him were just going in to pray with him and try to bring him some peace to calm down whatever sick yearnings hes harbouring so that he can end his life in some kind of grace i mean probably none of this will be necessary but when ive started ive got rules to follow so id like to close our eyes a moment our father she said the lords prayer softly tessa joining in then placed her hands either side of the girls bowed head jesus surround her and hold her safe from the forces of evil it again entered her head that this was all a crazy hysterical overreaction there were no forces of evil no je she kicked out mentally sent the thought spinning away she opened the door come on denzil joys terrible breathing was through the mouth liquid strangulated the sound of an oldfashioned hotwater geyser filling up in the side ward with the door closed it seemed all around them underscored by that hum you couldnt seem to escape in hospital wards and the throaty chortle of the overhead heating pipes the green oxygen tubes were clipped together behind his head which was supported by three pillows there were scabs of mucus where the tubes fitted into his nostrils you want me to do anything tessa asked just grab a chair from somewhere id rather stand is that ok however you feel comfortable merrily sat in the vinylcovered chair on which the wretched mrs joy was said to have stood its seat was sunken in the middle ok she pushed up a sleeve of her black jumper reached over in the halflight and took denzils hand instantly screwing up her eyes because it was undeniably vile like picking up a cold turd stop it sliding her hand away from his fingers with their long yellow nails and up to his bony wrist holding it gently calming her breathing denzil she cleared her throat i dont know if you can hear me my names merrily im er the vicar of ledwardine im just doing the rounds as we vicars do if he was even half awake he wouldnt be aware of what time it was how unlikely it was that a vicar would be doing the rounds at all costs she mustnt alarm him i wanted to say a few prayers with you if thats ok his breathing didnt alter his eyes remained threequarters closed he seemed unaware of her she looked down at his thin furtive face the spittle bubbling around his mouth and she pleaded with god to send her some pity nobody should die an object of fear and hatred and revulsion hes very very weak tessa murmured in her ear i dont know how hes holding on merrily nodded almighty god our heavenly father she said softly we know all of us that weve done bad things and neglected to do good things we mightve done she felt denzils wrist turn under her hand other than the breathing the first sign of life the wrist turned so that the palm was upwards the position of supplication as though he was responding holding out his hand for forgiveness for the sake of jesus christ our lord your son we beg you to forgive us close the book on the past calm our souls she squeezed the hand encouragingly outside nurse sandra protheroe passed the door without looking in we know your nature is to have mercy to forgive we beg you to free denzil from whatever bonds are binding his spirit one of denzils fingernails began to move slowly against her palm like the claw of an injured bird it felt actually quite unpleasant suggestive she wished shed never spoken to sandra protheroe tessa was standing beside the door with her hands behind her back she managed a rather wounded smile we ask you this merrily said in the name of our saviour jesus christ she felt slightly sick and closed her eyes at once the light scratching of denzils nail on her palm picked up momentum acquired a rhythm a small highpitched wheeze was detectable under his rasping snuffling breath and the sweet sour stench was back suddenly and rapidly unravelling from him like a soiled string seeming to spiral through the thin stale air directly into merrilys nose and coil there cat faeces and gangrene oh god she felt clammy and nauseous but also starved like she had flu coming on ill tell you what that is reverend its the smell of evil its not evil its sickness its disgusting but its not evil still she tightened her lips against it fighting the compulsion to snatch her hand away she must not she must let it lie there mustnt react its my job its my job its what i do its she could almost hear it now scritchscratch the tiniest movement of a curling nail on the end of a yellow finger suspecting that in the mind of denzil joy this was not a mere finger he can enter you without moving an inch that man slide away squirm away get out of here scritchscratch as though he was teasing away layers of skin in the centre of her palm to get his finger under the flesh but that was imagination his strength his lifeforce was so depleted this was the most he could manage scritchscratch poor guy reach out to the humanity in him poor guy poor guy poor guy poor guy she was aware of him taking in a long long shuddering breath tessa moving towards the bed the breath was not released there was an awesome cliffedge of silence the scratching stopped this is it tessa said quietly so much composure in the kid hes cheynestoking no question this time in the breathless silence merrily would swear she could feel the heat of him slithering from his mind to her mind while his finger lay still in her hand like a small cigar it seemed much darker and colder in here now as though in its hunger for lifeenergy the shrivelled body in the bed was absorbing all the electricity all the light all the heat in the room in fact i think hes gone tessa said darkness cold stillness and the sinuous putrid smell gently merrily attempted to slip her hand out of his and then it seized her grip like a monkeywrench like a train from a tunnel his breath came out and in the same moment his fingers pushed up between hers and tightened a low sniggering laugh seemed to singe the air between them and merrily felt something slide between her legs knowing in a second that shed felt no such thing that it was all imagination conditioning but it was too late the cold wriggled fiercely into her groin jetted into her stomach like an iced enema shed already torn her hand away throwing herself back with so much force that she slipped from the chair to the shiny grey floor and slid back against the second bed hearing herself squealing i bind unto myself the name the strong name of the trin and hearing tessa screaming shrilly she cried out helplessly begone not knowing who or what she meant there was a wrenching snapping sound she saw the green tubes writhing in the air like electric snakes torn from denzils nostrils as suddenly in a single violent ratchet movement he sat up in his bed tessa shrieking noooooooooooo and falling back against the door stumbling out when it was flung open by eileen cullen who just stood there with denzil joys upright stiffened shadowed shape between her and merrily soiled she discovered she was in the corridor outside and that she was half sobbing and half laughing but it wasnt real laughing on the other side of a film of tears a small flame was approaching its not allowed is it was that her voice that mad cackle the hell it isnt said cullen lighting merrilys cigarette and then one for herself they sat on the bench outside the ward it was no longer quiet in there we told them tessa had seen a mouse but patients especially old fellers its like spooking the horses in a stable you know well give them half an hour to get themselves back to sleep before we get somebody up here to take him out im sorry eileen merrily blew her nose this is ridiculous its that all right how the devil he found the strength to sit up like that is beyond me he was a husk so he was nothing left what the hell did you do do she crushed the wet tissue into her palm the palm of the scritchscratch god knows you reckon how would i know i was completely out of my depth no real idea what i was supposed to be doing this is a bloody mugs game eileen a charade maybe playacting my bit was playacting his was real hey i didnt hear that this is your profession cullen put a hand on her knee well go into my office for a cuppa soon as i get protheroe to do the necessary the necessary lay the poor bastard out were none of us scared of dead bodies are we not even this one although you didnt see his face did you merrily shook her head i was on the floor by then could only see the back of his head and those tubes flying out of his nose when he rose up she shuddered the snapping of the tubes she could still hear it thats lucky youll maybe get some sleep tonight eileen cullen dragged on her cigarette jesus he was frightened i thought at first it was me he was looking at but hes staring over my shoulder out of the door into thin air nobody there nobody i could see and the look on his face like somebody was coming for him you know like the person he feared most in all the world was standing in that doorway waiting to oh jesus the things you see in this job you could go out of your mind if you hadnt so much to bloody do waiting to take him away merrily said drably whatever it was was waiting to take him away its the chemicals is all it is the chemicals in the brain some people that close to the end the chemicals ease the way you know the angels on the threshold merrily blew her nose again into the sodden tissue or the devil whatever cocktail of volatile chemicals was sloshing round in that mans head they mustve shown him the devil and all his works which means i failed natural justice merrily thats not the way its supposed to work there was a question she needed to ask a really obvious question what was it she couldnt think come and have that cuppa thanks but i need to get home ive got my daughter you want someone to drive you i think youre in shock you know god no ill be fine maybe i should come back later and cleanse the place what with all the patients awake cullen stood up you in there flashing the big cross and doing the mumbojumbo forget it mop and bucketll see it right its over is it what do you want me to say im a nonbeliever was all chemicals merrily maybe a few of yours as well dont you think you go sleep it off well tell the bishop or who you like that you did a terrific job the bishop id rather you said id never even been you dont mean that tell them i didnt answer the phone when you rang get yourself some rest call me at home sometime ive written the number on your ciggy packet sister cullen squeezed her shoulder thank you merrily you did ok i reckon for a biblebasher the bishop had the bishop set her up for it this was the question shed meant to ask she remembered that as she was leaving the building pulling on her coat who exactly had told them to contact her who had advised them that merrily watkins was deliverancetrained and available for work had to be him he was dangerous michael hunter bishop cool was a dangerous man to have organizing your career there was light in the sky and a cold wind what the hell time was it where had she left the car all those hours ago when all shed had to think about was dobbs she hurried down the drive and into the deserted street full of fresh cold air from the hills it was the cold inside that scared her she stood and shivered by the entrance to the shambling jumble of a hospital where the body of denzil joy lay cooling i was raped like icy letters in the sky he raped me she felt greasy slimy soiled used hed made his smell go into her had scratched himself an entrance hole and then hed died hed gone away but hed left his filthy essence inside her she needed a long shower needed to pray needed to think because this would not could not have happened to a male priest a male exorcist i need exorcizing violently she zipped up her fading waxed coat and strode away into the predawn murk she would find a church that was open or failing that would go to her own church in ledwardine she couldnt take the pitiful disgusting dregs of denzil home to jane she would have to go into a church and pray for his soul pray for it to be taken away somewhere and stripped and cleaned she saw that the old blue volvo had been very badly parked even for three in the morning standing half on the grass near the little gardens where the footpath went up and then down to the wye another six inches and shed have backed into a sign saying no parking keep entrance clear she fumbled out her keys excuse me madam hed blundered out of the bushes a big heavy guy in some kind of rally anorak luminous stripe down one arm is this your car who are you police how long has the car been here please all she needed look im sorry i was in a hurry and i thought itd be ok when did you park it about three i suppose to go to the hospital yes can i ask why look merrily said exasperated it couldve been parked a whole lot better i agree im very sorry give me a ticket or whatever im a bit knackered ok it isnt about parking miss would you mind telling me your name please after i see your id merrily unlocked the volvo if he took any time producing his warrant card she was out of here you didnt trust big guys in the semidark not these days its all right peter its her a woman in a long white raincoat emerged from the river path ms watkins person of the cloth ill deal with this the big man nodded trudged back up the footpath merrily sighed di howe acting dci actually the old fast tracks moved up a gear has it weariness loosening merrilys reserve let me guess ive walked into some kind of stakeout colombian drugs barons are bringing a consignment up the wye annie howe didnt laugh it occurred to merrily that she had yet ever to hear annie howe laugh her short ashen hair gleamed dully like a helmet in the early light you priests work long hours sick parishioner dead merrily said just now obviously a night for it ms watkins for what annie howe came to stand next to her glancing into the volvo she was maybe five years younger than merrily a smooth efficient overeducated cid person both feet on the escalator during the police hunt in ledwardine earlier this year jane had remarked that howe reminded her of a nazi dentist you could tell where the kid was coming from weve pulled a body out of the wye ms watkins just down there not far from victoria bridge oh god just couple of hours ago she remembered hearing the siren from the sluiceroom window what happened were not sure yet but it didnt appear to have been in the water an awfully long time so were rather keen to talk to anyone who might have seen something howe smiled thinly or heard a solitary splash perhaps not me you arrived about three i hear that right something like that nobody about at all not that i can recall you ever been down to the river this way not really its quite pretty howe said come and see merrily sighed and followed her past some flowerless beds and a bench to a little parapet below them was a narrow suspension bridge grey girders across the dark misty river a glimmering of pale plastic tape and two policemen howe said its just that if theres a particular parking place most convenient for the river then your cars in it we thought it might be the dead mans at first quite a disappointment really when your name came up as the owner and when the body wasnt a woman about my age in a dogcollar not quite what i meant it just made it less easy to put a name to him but we will how old was he quite young thirties suicide its a possibility given the time of day sos accidental death annie howe looked at merrily sos murder he didnt drown we should know quite soon but he came off the bridge howe shrugged if you knew it was my car why didnt you come into the hospital and ask for me we did nobody seemed to know you were there the alfred watkins ward if you want to check ask for sister cullen ive been with her for the last three hours or so howe nodded so its unlikely you wouldve seen anything ah well nothings ever simple is it ms watkins thanks for your help i dont suppose well be in touch but if you remember anything that might be useful the wind whipped the skirt of howes raincoat against her calves you know where to find me merrily looked down into the swirling mist and dark water it looked somehow warmer than she felt and almost inviting show barn it was rare to see genial dick lyden in a bad mood when lol arrived just after eight am dick was pacing the kitchen slamming his right fist into his left palm the little shit he fumed the fucking little shit hes just trying it on mrs ruth lyden fellow therapist said calmly he knows you too well hes got you psyched out he knows your particular weak spot and he goes for it there was plenty of room for dick to pace the lydens kitchen was as big as a restaurant kitchen more than half as big as lols new flat over the shop it was all white and metallic like a dairy his psychological knowhow goes out of the window when hes dealing with his own son ruth told lol she was a large placid frizzyhaired woman whod once been dicks personal secretary in london well you cant can you dick sat down at the banquetsized table you simply cant distance yourself sufficiently from your own family be wrong even to try i think were probably even worse than ordinary people at dealing with our own problems lol didnt like to ask what the present personal problem was ruth told him anyway james has been chosen as boy bishop she searched lols face eyebrows raised you know about that sorry lol said im not that well up on the church medieval christmas tradition used to happen all over the place but its almost unique to hereford now a boy is chosen from the cathedral choristers or the retired choristers to replace the bishop on his throne on st nicholass day gets to wear the mitre and wield the staff and whatnot terribly solemn and everything though quite fun as well its actually a great honour dick said especially for newcomers like us little shit and of course james now says hes going to refuse to do it ruth poured coffee for lol when they offered it to him he was very flattered in a cynical sort of way but now hes announced it would be morally wrong of him to do it having decided hes an atheist what the fuck difference does that make dick snarled at least twentyfive per cent of the bloody clergy are atheists and that it isnt in line with his personal image or his musical direction hes sixteen now and at sixteen ones image is awfully well defined how quickly they change one year an angelic little choirboy and then a bloody yob said dick wheres his guitar im going to lock it in the shed hes taken it to school with him ruth hid a smile behind her coffee cup told you he had you psyched devious little bastard dick drained his cup coughed at the strength of the coffee right ill get my coat lol be good to go out and deal with something straightforward moon is straightforward well you know what i mean straightforwardly convoluted poor dick ruth said when hed left the kitchen its an honour for him rather than james a sign that hes really been accepted into the city he needs that needs to be at the hub of things hes a terrible controlfreak really in his ohsoamiable way lol said do you guys psychoanalyse one another all the time ruth laughed outside it began to rain a sudden cold splattering wow jane was observing her mother from the stove you really do look like shit thank you i think weve established that merrily had told her about being delayed by the police investigating a body in the wye but that evidently didnt explain why she looked like shit you need a hot bath jane said and then off to bed the bath certainly no question about that merrily watched the rain on the window it looked dirty everything looked dirty even after twenty minutes before the altar scritchscratch so jane shovelled inchthick toast on to a plate you want to talk about the other stuff what makes you think theres other stuff do me a favour jane said the kid had realized from quite soon after seans death that her mother would need someone on whom she could lay heavy issues there were times when she instinctively became a kind of sensible younger sister with no sarcasm pointscoring storage of information for future blackmail hang on though merrily looked up what time is it the school busll be going without you im taking the day off i have a migraine in which case flower you appear to be coping with the blinding agony which defines that condition with what i can only describe as a remarkable stoicism yeah its a fairly mild attack but it could get worse besides when youve really sussed out the way teachers operate you can take the odd day off any time you like without missing a thing except you never have have you a vicars daughter has to be flexible if i went to school youd stay up and work all day and by the time i got home youd be soooo unbearable jane dont argue just have some breakfast and bugger off to bed ill stick around make a brilliant log fire and repel all the timewasting gits merrily gave up but this must never happen again jane shrugged all right merrily said no egg for me thanks my digestive system can just about cope with marmite right jane brought the teapot to the table and sat down whats disturbed it exactly merrily sighed a couple of times and watched the rain blurring the window and she then told jane about denzil joy some of it rain sheeted down on dinedor hill the twisty road narrowing as they climbed dick was clearly disappointed when they ran out of track for the massive mitsubishi intercooler super turboplus hed borrowed from denny for the weekend dick was contemplating a move into fourwheel drive lol unbuckled his seatbelt if you go any further english heritagell be down on you itll be in the hereford times city therapist squashes ancient camp you may scoff but i do feel its important to be a good citizen we chose to come here which confers responsibility dick braked and reversed into something satisfyingly deep and viscous even to something that just looks like any other hill you have no soul dick dick squinted through the mudblotched windcreen buggered if im staggering up there in this weather what am i missing nice view over the city for the rest you need a soul imagination dick leaned back in the driving seat allowing the glass to mist i have very little thank goodness the ancestors jung would have found plenty to go at but ive never been particularly drawn to the idea of the collectiveunconscious race memories all that it sounds good but what do you think im inclined to believe it ive got a bit in common with moon i suppose and you fancy her well of course you do awfully sexy creature yes lol had been half expecting this she is so whats the problem dick started ticking off plusfactors on his fingers youre both on your own im her actual therapist not you so no ethical barriers do find her attractive dont you shes beautiful but you think she doesnt fancy you that it oh i think she does old son i think she does lol felt awkward maybe we wouldnt be too good for each other you dont get to laugh much around moon not a terrific sense of humour no dick conceded like you want to make her happy but you dont somehow think shed be happy being happy and that was it really you couldnt help feeling that life with moon was destined to end in a suicide pact lol dick said i realize youre a sensitive soul but you dont particularly need to think about psychology when youre shagging someone do you yuk jane said i mean yuk quite i mean its awful its tragic and everything but its also really inconsiderate i really think you shouldve walked out like how were you to know these nurses werent lying nobody should have to make a decision like that with the old guys clock running down the whole time it wasnt an actual exorcism it wasnt much at all in the end sounds like thats what the older nurse wanted though an exorcism possibly the parts merrily hadnt mentioned included the scratching finger and other sensations the subjective aspects face it jane poured the tea its a crap deal mum they send you in armed with a handful of halfassed prayers and platitudes which are supposed to cover all eventualities youre holding a duff hand from the start well not its like with these evangelical maniacs where you like go along and youre looking a bit offcolour and in about three minutes flat theyve discovered youre possessed by seventeen different demons and the next thing youre rolling around on the floor throwing up you could really damage people its a bit more disciplined than that but yeah i know what you mean it is a minefield and its just useless liturgy like with all respect what real actual practical training have you had its not like youve even done any meditation or yoga or anything i mean theological college does that even equal say two weeks at a respectable ashram i think it possibly does merrily said but wondering but youre not really spiritually developed are you not like buddhist monks and indian gurus and guys like that like you cant i dont know leave your body or anything youve just read the books and yet they want you to mess with peoples souls its supposed to be god who does the actual messing that is we dont believe we have any special powers we kind of signpost the way for the holy spirit you ever ask yourself if the holy spirit is so ubi allovertheplace and on the ball why does it need a signpost we have to invite the holy spirit in you know why because thats one of the rules deep theology flower bollocks jane murmured anyway i wouldnt let hunter get away with this merrily paused with the mug at her mouth hes the guvnor hes a tosser but i will call him ill have a bath and a rest and then ill call him maybe rowenna could get some of the sas crosscountry guys to elbow the flash git into a deep ditch jane mused muddy his fetching purple tracksuit the rain was battering the barn windows and lol was sure there was an element of sleet to it now but dick was all sunshine like his row with the boy james had never happened well this is super clasping his herbal tea to his chest this is quite magnificent and it was the little barn was transformed all the boxes had disappeared everything put away everything tidy a bright coalfire on the simple stone hearth fragments of black pottery arranged on a small shelf on the wall alongside the steps to the bedroom loft was a detailed penandink plan of presumably the dinedor iron age community round huts with stone bases and conical thatched roofs moon had made mysterious marks on it dots and symbols archaeologist stuff ideal homes show barn you were right and we were wrong dick told moon but he was smiling at lol and the smile said i was right and you were wrong above the fireplace was a giltframed photograph of a smiling man leaning against a land rover the mans smile was moons smile we thought youd be a bit ah cut off up here dick said a bit lonely but this is your place moon what are you going to do well im going back to work in the shop moon wore the long grey dress freshly washed without mud on the hem it looked like a hostess dress her very long hair was in a loose lush plait for a while anyway playing it day by day im not an alcoholic dick she didnt smile she hadnt looked at lol he felt hed betrayed her what i meant moon dick said is that you clearly no longer feel the need to hurry rush from one experience to another youve been away youve been through all kinds of changes and now youve returned to repossess your past your past your place firm ground it must feel wonderful moon said nothing dick took this as agreement and nodded enthusiastically it was the conclusion he wanted the neat outcome of a very singular case he had her all packaged up in his head at least an article for psychology today or whatever he subscribed to moon was getting better moon was taking responsibility for herself so why to lol had she never seemed more of an enigma what had caused her suddenly to launch into this place like a team of industrial cleaners as if shed known they were coming or someone else determined that the barn should project the image of a balanced settled academic individual it was a facade it had to be and the picture of her smiling father disturbed him if dick had noticed it he didnt comment lol looked closely at the photograph when it was taken moons father would have been about dennys age early to mid forties he looked more like moon than denny did the same smile and the same deepsunk glittering eyes something black and gnarled lay on the mantelpiece below the picture lol bent to examine it dont touch that moon almost ran across the room eased herself between lol and the fireplace lol stepped back im sorry its very delicate what is it i found it it was only about ten yards from the barn someone had started digging out a pond some time ago and never finished it and there was a heap of soil where the ground was turned over and it was actually projecting sticking out she moved aside to let them see now they realized they mustnt touch it was knobbled and corroded about ten inches long anyone else if they didnt know about these things theyd think it was just an old tractor part or something i mean nothing much has ever been found up here a trench was once cut from the ramparts to the centre of the camp and nothing much was found there except lots of black pottery and an axehead its a dagger lol decided a sword confirmation for me that this farm not so much the house but the farm has been here since the iron age it was waiting for me to find it you see now fate lol said hollowly oh no moon said far less random than fate whats that mean moon shook her head he thought she smiled you could take it to a museum have it cleaned up by experts moon was horrified nobodys going to touch it but me i dont want the flow blocked by anyone elses vibrations good for you moon said dick look we must have a good long chat yes but not today moon said my landlords are coming over for lunch tim and anna purefoy from the farm ah dick nodded excellent getting to know the neighbours im meeting all the people who live around the hill for my book if im going to trace how the communitys changed over two millennia i have to examine its components quite a few of the newcomers here are very interested too theyre going to help me terrific dick looked like he wanted to pat her on the head cant wait to read it later when dick went to have fun reversing the mitsubishi out of the morass in front of the barn where someone had once started to dig a pond moon came to stand next to lol in the doorway dont bring him here again hell hear you i dont care if he does i dont want him here hes an idiot denny only employed him to get the court off our backs your back moon hes an idiot he means well lol if you come here again as dicks assistant i wont tell you anything in future i dont need people around me i cant trust the slanting rain plucked at the mud im sorry lol said do you want me to come back she looked at him smiling almost coyly only as yourself as merrily rolled gratefully into bed the phone rang unplug it jane screeched from the landing unplug it now ill get it downstairs hello merrily said ledwardine vicarage merrily its sophie at the bishops office michael asked me to ring we wondered if youd be popping into town today and if so could you call in well i wasnt planning on the one hand she very much needed to talk to the bishop on the other not in this state bit tied up this morning oh well this afternoon therell be nobody here better make it tomorrow i suppose its just a little job in connection with the deliverance side of things oh i dont imagine its terribly urgent good sophie do all the deliverance cases come through your office well its intended that they should im afraid canon dobbs was less organized what about the problem last night at the general hospital at the hospital was there a problem so it didnt come through the office it didnt come through me if you werent there would the bishop have handled it himself they wouldnt normally get through to the bishop anyway he wasnt here last night he was at his parents home in the forest of dean they thought his father had suffered another heart attack but it was a false alarm im glad to say oh merrily said good did you have to go to the hospital then merrily yes i did she gripped the phone tightly if hunter had been away then who had directed the hospital to approach her who set her up for denzil joys grisly farewell party merrily are you all right yes i this other job can you tell me what that is im not sure i should over the phone you dont need to mention names well its a haunting at a home for the elderly near dorstone out towards the welsh border and where did that come from who told you about it it came from the new vicar of dorstone i believe michael had asked me to keep him informed of any reports of this nature and when i mentioned it to him he said hed like you to take a crack at it as he put it he she hesitated what he went on to say if im not speaking out of turn is that it would be a test of how committed you were committed frankly he feels youre rather stalling hed expected a firm answer by now when we spoke on the phone he asked if id heard from you i see so if i sidestep this haunting or suggest the vicar of dorstone handles it himself hell take that as a no i may be wrong about that sophie was never wrong merrily felt she could almost see the hand of fate greygloved in the halflight of the bedroom from the landing jane called out for christs sake mum in merrilys head the demonic denzil joy sat up in bed for the last time tubes flying out of his nose in twin puffs of snot huw owens voice echoed over the brecon beacons might as well just paint a great big bullseye between your tits and she thought it was dobbs wasnt it it was bloody dobbs it has to be dobbs set me up she felt lightheaded with fatigue she knew that later when she awoke again she was going to be very angry but now the rage was still misty and distant so were the words she spoke so faintly that she wasnt sure she hadnt merely thought them ill come in tomorrow then sophie ten tenthirty she didnt hear the reply wasnt even aware of hanging up the phone there were no dreams thank god the first exorcist she stopped at the top of the gatehouse stairs rubbing circulation back into her hands it seemed to have become winter overnight the waxed jacket felt as flimsy as a binliner no good shed have to get herself a proper coat when she had time when she saw the office door she didnt know whether to laugh or cry or turn around and creep quietly away the white panels were adorned by a single black gothic letter above it a simple black cross the rev charlie headland was chuckling softly in her head more like mi too late to turn around and creep out sophie grey suit pearls neat white bun halfglasses on a chain stood in the adjacent doorway merrily good morning did you see a few specks of snow im convinced i saw snow heavens come up do i have to sign in maybe pass through a detector sophie smiled wryly michaels specific instructions in one respect i suppose its rather elegant sophie it looks like the entrance to a bloody chapel of rest oh sophie looked put out she was the bishops person whoever the current bishop happened to be the new arrival on the office desk was an apple mac and a printer and something merrily took to be a scanner jesus she said all i know how to do on one of these is type dont worry sophie said a little cool now im your secretary as well for a while michael wants me to open a deliverance database filing and categorizing the various cases and giving area breakdowns he also wants me to arrange a meeting with the director of social services the chief executive of the health authority charities like mind and also the police merrily flopped down behind the desk what and youre to have an email address possibly a website she looked into the blank computer screen as though it were a crystal ball conjuring up huw owens tired rugged face i dont want stuff letting in a lot of bad energys crowding the portals i want to keep all the doors locked and the chains up her new secretary stood by the window hands linked demurely at the waist of her tweed skirt look sophie merrily moistened her windroughened lips the thing about deliverance it needs to be lowprofile i wouldnt go as far as to use the word clandestine but theres a danger of attracting timewasters and fanatics and loonies and other undesirable elements the bishop doesnt seem to have grasped this basic point deliverance is getting a high priority merrily sophie slipped into the visitors chair look i really wouldnt worry about this michaels a very young man to be a bishop and he perhaps feels hes been put in place to make an impression help push the church firmly into the twentyfirst century hes also a very clever man with an impeccable pedigree which he tends to underplay father and an uncle were both bishops fatherinlaws the dean of gloucester michael feels that if people are aware of the amount of work undertaken by the deliverance ministry they may be more inclined towards what you might call spiritual preventative medicine you mean what we used to call going to church sophie smiled wryly i know merrily said wearily it all makes a kind of sense i just wish there was less bollocks i dont doubt that youll cope merrily youll find the details of the dorstone haunting on your computer if you click on the desktop file marked memo i shall be next door if you want me thanks merrily shed her coat and switched on the computer and then closed the door and picked up the phone and rang eileen cullen at home timed it well merrily come off shift whizz round tesco home to bed away from the ward cullens voice sounded softer how are you now bit confused ahha well what can i tell you theres a palpable sense of relief on the ward we laid him out he made the scariest corpse i ever handled then we fumigated the side ward too much to expect that hed take his smell down to the mortuary with him almost immediately denzils reptilian odour was in her head merrily stifled a cough oh and later in the morning eileen cullen said im told that the old man came in and said a prayer or two old man merrily tingled i dont even know his name but his collar was the right way round so nobody questions it his name is dobbs merrily said aye thats the feller i suppose he already knew about denzil didnt he he mustve though how hed have found out the man was dead i dont know weve hardly got the time to put out a general bulletin to the clergy ok look lets not keep walking around each other ill explain canon dobbs is the diocesan exorcist im the one being set up to take over from him he doesnt want to go and he certainly doesnt want to be replaced by a woman im coming round to thinking he set me up with denzil last night to give me a taste of just how nasty and squalid the job could be and why its not a suitable job for a woman after a moment cullen said that wasnt very nice of him then was it not awfully so id appreciate just knowing like anything you can remember entirely off the record eileen aye said cullen you get surgeons like that they love to leave you holding the shit end of the stick all right ill tell you what i know he did know denzil joy whether this was from denzils life outside of hospital i wouldnt know probably but he came in once i didnt see this i wasnt there but protheroe was and they had to ask him to leave denzils spitting at him coming out with all kinds of foul stuff you dont want to be hearing from a sickbed and it carried on that way after the priest was well out of the building its why we put him in solitary the past two times though obviously his wife lived to regret that did anyone ask dobbs about the incident oh he wouldnt talk to the likes of us except very briefly to protheroe he said to let him know if we had any further trouble with mr joy so naturally the other night after the business with the wife protheroes screaming call the priest call the priest the mans possessed with evil and you called him i called the number she gave me and a woman answered and i told her what it was about and she said to hang on and then she came back and said to call the reverend watkins does that solve your problem do you remember the phone number you rang for dobbs oh i probably wrote it down and threw it away protheroe probably keeps it in a gold locket around her neck well thanks youve been very helpful aye a pause howre you feeling yourself merrily like did he do anything to you i maybe i dont want to worry you cullen said but they say it comes back sometimes like the ache you get with the shingles you know ive never had shingles pray you never do cullen said seems daft saying this to a priest but if you ever want a chat about anything youve got the number thanks merrily said thanks she clicked on memo strictly private and confidential mrs susan thorpe proprietor the glades residential home hardwicke between dorstone and hayonwye requests a discreet meeting with regard to unexplained occurrences sophies head came round the door just then as if shed heard the click of the mouse would you like me to call her for you make an appointment just leave the number on the desk sophie could you give me another bit of information its what im here for merrily could you tell me exactly where in the close canon dobbs lives sophie removed her halfglasses hohum she said the bishops specific instructions are to keep dobbs and me well apart right michael doesnt discuss canon dobbs perhaps you could try the telephone directory of which you know hes ex sophie sighed he moved out of the canonry when his wife died he lives in a little terraced house in gwynne street thats less than fifty yards from where i sit just down from the christian bookshop and i didnt tell you that thank you i suppose you had to get this over at some stage sophie refixed her glasses dont forget your haunting will you frostblackened plants dripped down the sides of a hanging basket next to the door the green door needed painting paint was peeling from the wooden window ledge the wood was rotting the house itself rather let gwynne street down the street was narrow almost like an alley following the perimeter wall of the bishops palace and sloping downhill towards the river the house was one of the lower ones before they gave way to warehouses and garages near the banks of the wye there was no bell no knocker merrily banged on the door with a fist which hurt and brought more paint flying off there was no answer she peered in at the window the curtains were drawn against her she looked around in frustration there was no sign of another way in above her the sky was tight and darkflecked like stretched goatskin hello merrily all right luv i dont really know oh silence on the line as huw owen mulled this over that sounds like you took on the job i thought you wouldnt back out i was actually about to turn it down merrily lit a cigarette looking out of the window into the bishops palace yard then a case happened just happened eh huw said just like that well whats dones done int it how can i help i dont suppose any of the othersve called charlie clive never off lass do excuse me bothering you again huw but i have a teensy problem and im not entirely sure if its a weeper or a breather merrily blew an accidental smokering so im the first to come crying to the headmaster i always liked you the best anyroad luv charlie and clivell fall on their arses sooner or later but they wont tell me she started to laugh picturing him sitting placidly in his isolated bronteesque rectory like some ungroomed old wolfhound lets hear it then lass she told him about denzil joy she told it simply and concisely she missed out nothing she thought might be important scritchscratch and then the dobbs link it took over fifteen minutes and it brought everything back and she felt unclean again my huw said thats a foxy one int it what dyou think could be a few things could be just a very nasty little man or it could be a carrier a carrier did you tell us about carriers happen i forgot meaning you deliberately forgot would carriers be the people who pick up hitchhikers youre not daft merrily i said that dint i provable carriers are not that common and not easy to diagnose and they can lead to a lot of hysteria of the fundamentalist type you know if one blokes got it it must be contagious and then you get these dubious massexorcisms everybody rolling around and clutching their guts just one man merrily said so far thats good to know well a carrier is usually a nasty person who attracts more nastiness to him like iron filings to a magnet usually theres a bit of a sexual kink an overly powerful sexdrive and probably not bright not a lot up top too much down below anything i need to do now hes gone to make sure he dont come back sounds like mr dobbs has done it not going quietly into that good night is he clearly not might not work mind thats the big irony with deliverance half the time it dont work but in somewhere like a hospital itll fade or get consumed by all the rest of the pervading anguish you could happen do a protection on yourself periodically oh and leave off sex for a week gosh huw thats going to be a tall order oh dear huw said so youre still on your own eh what a bloody waste god hates waste before lunch merrily made an appointment to meet mrs susan thorpe at the glades residential home at eleven oclock the following morning there must have been somebody in the room who didnt know about this issue because mrs thorpe kept addressing her as if she were rentokil coming to deal with an infestation of woodworm sophie was meeting a friend for lunch at the green dragon merrily decided to see what was on offer at the cafe inside all saints church a fairly ingenious idea for getting bums on pews or at least close to pews but first sod it im not walking away from this she slipped round the wall and back into gwynne street there was a weak creamcoloured sun now over broad street but gwynne street was still in shadow the only point of light was in the middle of dobbss flaking green door it turned out to be a slender white envelope trapped by a corner in the letterbox flap as she raised a fist to knock on the door and wondered if she ought to push the envelope through she saw the name typed on the front mrs m watkins she caught a movement at an upstairs window and glanced up saw a curtain quiver he was there the old bastard had been in the whole time hed watched her standing here knocking more paint from his door and now hed left her a letter the street was deserted no cars no people no voices she felt like smashing dobbss window instead she snatched the envelope out of the box and walked away and didnt look back she walked quickly out of gwynne street past the christian bookshop and the tourist information shop and round the corner into king street where she stood at the kerb and tore open the envelope she hoped it was a threat something abusive there was a single sheet of notepaper folded inside in the centre a single line of type the first exorcist was jesus christ this was all it said male thing the woman behind the counter was by any standards dropdead gorgeous worse still kind of pale and mysterious and distant with hair you could trip over a woollen scarf masking her lower face jane watched from outside the shop window saturday morning bright enough to bring thousands of shoppers into hereford from all over the county and from large areas of wales cold enough for there still to be condensation on the windows even in sheltered church street jane had come in on the early bus the only bus out of ledwardine on a saturday at halftwelve rowenna was picking her up outside the library it was psychic fair day which left her a couple of hours to kill it was inevitable shed wind up here at some point she almost wished she hadnt this was so awful lol had written songs about creatures like this and now he lived above the same shop maybe during the lunch hour the woman would weave her languorous way up some archaic spiral staircase and hed be waiting for her up on the landing where theyd start undressing each other before making their frenzied jane damn he must have come out of a side entrance she must remain cool show no surprise so thats her is it lol who he was shivering in his thin faded sweatshirt his hair needed attention it had never looked the same since hed cut it off at the back and lost the ponytail made him look too grownup almost like a man of thirtyeight moon jane lowered her scarf inside the shop the woman saw them looking at her and smiled absently arranging a display of cds on the counter shes quite ordinarylooking isnt she almost plain lol said jane how much would it cost to make you go away and stop embarrassing me more than youve got on you much more how about a cappuccino yeah thatll do jane said it was set in deep countryside a kind of manor house rambling but not very old maybe early nineteenthcentury squat gateposts with plain stone balls on top and a notice in the entrance the glades residential home stencilled over a painted purple hill with the sun above it a bright yellow sun with no suggestion of it setting which would have been the wrong image altogether there was a small car park in front with a sweeping view of the radnor hills but a woman appeared around the side of the house and beckoned her to drive closer to her merrily followed the drive around to a brick doublegarage and parked in front of it the woman hurrying after her youre wearing your uniform she said in a loud dismayed whisper when merrily got out of the car im sorry i should have emphasized the need for discretion merrily smiled dont worry about that dont worry yet we may not even paste your case on the deliverance website its all been very difficult the woman said we didnt want to call in the local vicar far too close so the obvious person was mr dobbs but then such a bombshell we wont talk about that im susan thorpe well go in this way she was a big woman dark blonde hair pushed under a wide practical hairslide she led merrily through a small back door down a short drab passage and into what was clearly her private sitting room very untidy have a seat throw those magazines on the floor ive sent for some coffee is that all right god i didnt need this i really didnt need this everything comes at once dont you find that now i discover i have to find a room for my mother must be a problem if you run a home like this and your mother gets to the age oh its not like that mothers fitter than me shes lost her job thats all and her home she was someones housekeeper im sorry im afraid ive forgotten your name merrily watkins merrily and youre the new diocesan exorcist i was in quite a quandary merrily so i rang the diocese i said could you send anybody but dobbs dobbs merrily still had his oneliner in her bag the first exorcist was jesus christ hence jesus must be our role model and jesus was not a woman why didnt you want canon dobbs this problem i was very loath at first to think it was a problem your kind of problem anyway old people can be such delinquents theyll break a teapot because they dont like the colour wet the bed because they dont like the sheets this is a volatile er poltergeist phenomenon oh no the point i was making is that when one of the staff complains of strange things happening i immediately suspect one or other of the residents in this case neither i nor so far thank god any of the residents have seen or heard a thing so who has merrily still hadnt received an answer to her question about dobbs was this another of his setups another attempt to show her why she as a woman was unfit to follow in the footsteps of jesus chambermaids said mrs thorpe well domestic careworkers actually but we do try to make it seem like a hotel for the sake of the residents so we call them chambermaids the other week one simply gave in her notice or rather sent it by post having failed to return after a weekend away gave no explanation other than personal reasons it was only then that my assistant manager told me the woman had rushed downstairs one evening white as a sheet and said she wasnt going up there again where to the third floor merrily tensed thinking of her own thirdfloor problem currently in remission at the vicarage did she elaborate no as i say she simply left and we thought no more about it and took on a replacement a local woman who didnt want to live in but was prepared to work nights well at least she couldnt just bugger off without an explanation shes had the same experience we presume it was the same do you want to talk to her if thats possible shell be coming in with the coffee in a minute mrs thorpe pulled a halfcrushed cigarette packet from between the sofa cushions does smoke interfere with whatever it is you do i hope not have one of mine im terrible sorry with all the persecution these days one assumes other people dont smoke have you met canon dobbs kind of hes going out of his mind you know oh always been a very very strange man but its been downhill all the way for the past year the man ought to be in a well a place like this i suppose not this one though so you know him quite well then susan thorpe lit up and coughed fiercely sorry thought i told you my mother was his housekeeper dobbss housekeeper in hereford for five years when his wife died he moved out of his canonry with about twenty thousand books bought two houses in a nearby terrace one for the housekeeper and more books of course this is in gwynne street thats it quite a nice place to live if you like cities mother rather wondered if he might do the decent thing and leave it to her when he shuffled off his mortal coil but then a couple of days ago absolutely out of the blue he just tells her to go leave gives her five thousand quid and instructions to be out by the weekend thats today why she says utterly dumbfounded what have i done to you nothing he says dont ask questions just leave and thank you very much what dyou make of that weird merrily said i i dont understand what have i been doing wrong she heard the words with their long cathedral echo saw a woman of about sixty distressed walking away in her sensible boots her tweed coat her mrs thorpe does your mother ever wear a green velvet hat sort of tudorlooking go away go away canon dobbs had hissed i cant possibly discuss this here oh my god jane thought they are they really are an item in the corner cafe she and lol had a slab of chocolate fudge cake each which they had to take turns in forking up because the table had one leg shorter than the other three so like this is serious right you and moon were just good friends kind of he seemed uncomfortable discussing moon she must be a good ten years younger not that that mattered of course jane was a good twenty years younger than lol and she quite anyway so youre kind of looking after her flat here while shes doing up this barn sort of her family came from dinedor hill and shes always been keen to move back er hows your mum oh you remember her how sweet shes ok in fact shes actually working a couple of days a week out of an office just a few hundred yards from here really he looked up in the bishops palace gatehouse i havent been there yet but i gather its cool whats she doing there not so cool shes been appointed deliverance minister you know like used to be called exorcist like in that film where the kids head does a complete circle while shes throwing up green bile and masturbating with a crucifix mum now gets to deal with people like that only of course there arent many people like that not in these parts which is why its such a dodgy job lol put down his cake fork he looked concerned why would she want to do it because she thinks the church should be in a position to give advice on the paranormal and there was nobody around to give her advice when she needed it i remember the question you should be asking is why would they want her to do that and i think its to put a pretty face on a fairly nasty reactionary business like for instance theyd say that the reason there isnt much about ghosts in the bible is that god doesnt want us to mess with ghosts or study our own inner consciousness that kind of thing god just wants us to toddle off to church on a sunday otherwise keep our noses out that wouldnt necessarily be bad advice for everybody lol said and she could sense he was thinking about something in particular thats the wimps attitude mr robinson absolutely and somebodys whos been banged up with mad people and even madder psychiatrists so does that mean youll be avoiding mum like the plague oh thats not a problem ive had the plague what was on his mind did he still have feelings for mum despite the exquisite moon or maybe she wasnt such a trophy lol mmm something bothering you er lol ate the last bit of his fudge cake in the film with the kids head spinning round and the green bile and the crucifix all that doesnt happen simultaneously what are you on about thosere completely different scenes in the film thank you lol jane said annoyed with him now ill tell mum shell be ever so reassured the care assistants name was helen matthews she lived in hayonwye about five miles away she was about thirty had two young children seemed balanced reliable its the kids i worry about she said and merrily was reminded of the poor woman in the deliverance study group video whod said something similar i wouldnt want to go taking anything back to them see despite having dependants and an iffy husband the woman in the video had still killed herself clear evidence that paranormal events could drastically affect a persons mental equilibrium not a problem here merrily felt on relatively firm ground with this one from what you say this is what we call an imprint and it usually belongs to a place it wont follow you it cant get into you you cant take it away its like a colourslide projected on a wall mrs watkins helen matthews was at the edge of the sofa she wore a white coat her short black hair was tied back and her voice shook you can tell yourself how it wont harm you how it isnt really there but when youre on your own in an upstairs passage and its late at night and all the doors are shut and the lights are turned down and you know that that something is following you and you finally make make yourself turn round to reassure yourself theres nothing there and there is there is she shuddered so violently it was almost a convulsion she held on to the sofa near tears even susan thorpe looked unnerved ok merrily said gently lets just be sure about this you say all the doors were closed and the lights were dimmed is it possible one of the doors opened and no definitely not and if it was well theyre all old ladies there are only old ladies here at present this was a man or at least a male a male thing what did he look like he looked helen lost it he looked like a bloody ghost he walked out of the wall could you see his face i think he had a moustache and i think he was wearing a suit like in the old black and white films doublebreasted wide shoulders sort of thing merrily glanced at susan thorpe who shook her head description like that it could have been anyone who lived here over the past threequarters of a century weve only been here four years moved from hampshire to be near my mother i mean there were no old photo albums lying around the place and it was a guesthouse before we came it could be anybody are there any stories about the house youre fairly local helen are there any i dont really know what im looking for murders suicides i dont know but i could ask around in hay christs sake dont do that susan thorpe rose up i know what its like in hay itll be all over the town in no time this is a business were running here seven jobs depend on us so lets not get hysterical so far weve managed to conceal it from the residents lets keep it that way and anyway we havent seen anything and no residents have reported anything in the past four years why should this thing start to appear now we believe imprints and placememories can be activated after years and years merrily said sometimes its a result of an emotional crisis or a disturbance absolutely not nothing like that here at all you said yourself that old people can behave like delinquents sometimes mental instability senile dementia any signs of dementia they have to go im afraid we arent a nursing home and the only signs of hysteria have been well not you helen but certainly your predecessor you didnt see it helen said quietly have you ever seen one mrs watkins possibly put it this way i know what it feels like i know how frightening it is but i dont want to overreact either i dont plan to squirt holy water all over the place what id like to do is go up there now with both of you and say a few prayers susan thorpe sat up aloud of course aloud oh no we cant have that some of the residents will be in their rooms theyll hear you merrily sighed i think its a good idea helen matthews said ill come im sorry susan thorpe stood up adjusted her hairslide i cant have it cant you do it outside out of earshot gods everywhere isnt he why cant you go outside i could but i dont think that would have any effect helen said if ive seen it mrs thorpe its only a matter of time before one of the old ladies does what if someone has a heart attack merrily thought of the video again and what huw had said bottom line is that our man in northampton should not have left before administering a proper blessing leaving her in a state of calm feeling protected yes suppose someone did have a heart attack god susan thorpe breathed this is getting beyond a joke it never is a joke merrily said im starting to realize that the problem is finding a time when that passage and all the rooms off it are empty look all right most of the residents totter off to hardwicke church on a sunday morning as people of that age tend to what are you doing tomorrow morning im going to my church susan im a vicar oh susan thorpe was unembarrassed you dont do this sort of thing fulltime then like this diminished merrily a parttimer susan became agitated well look look theres going to be a party one of the residents is a hundred years old were having a small soiree for her i can tell you old people never miss a party suppose while it was on we could smuggle you upstairs and you could do your little ceremony you do work at night your mother will be here then i suppose i should think ill see what i can do merrily said it would be very interesting to talk to mrs thorpes mother five thousand quid and instructions to be out by the weekend either dobbs really was going out of his mind or there was something very odd here she had to go carefully though mustnt appear to be checking on him casually running into the former housekeeper while processing an imprint that would do fine as she left the glades merrily saw that it was snowing lightly out of a sky like stone winter deftly gatecrashing autumns mournful party real stuff the stall which made jane laugh the most was the one selling something called the circlet of selene it looked like three strands of copper wire bound together into a bangle or a necklet and secured by small curtain rings the wording was a bit careful it didnt actually promise you more energy a better nights sleep and a dynamic sex life it claimed however that many people had found that all this had come about after only three weeks of wearing the circlet of selene which cost a mere for the bangle or for the necklet neither of which must have cost more than p to produce still people were buying them women mostly well ninety per cent of the punters here were women in fact the tottyquotient was pretty bloody lamentable especially in the marquee which had been erected in a field behind the pub most of the blokes had stayed in the bar as blokes were wont to do and even that wasnt exactly crowded with intriguing darkeyed gipsylooking guys the marquee housed most of the stalls crystals incenseburners cosmic jewellery though it was far too cold a day for a marquee youd think the weather situation might have been foreseen given the number of selfstyled psychics and seers on the premises most had clearly taken cover in the pub where it was warmer but jane hadnt felt drawn to consult any of them they were probably all a bit pricey too tastelapse she sipped muddy coffee from a plastic cup serious serious tastelapse rowenna they were in a cold corner behind a trestle table displaying lurid healing crystals and supervised by a gross middleaged couple in matching bobblehats tapeloop relaxation music was trickling out of little speakers and it got on your nerves im sorry rowenna looked around the last one i went to wasnt this bad really oh theres kirlian photography over there you could have your aura photographed you ever have yours done once i got a picture of my hand with what looked like little flames coming out of the fingertips what does it prove that youve got an aura if you didnt have an aura youd be dead wouldnt you im glad i cant see yours today rowenna said itd be all dark and negative you having problems on the domestic front or something not to speak of you can speak to me of anything at all kitten rowenna touched the tip of janes nose with a gloved forefinger her floaty red hair was topped by a black velvet beret the coat she wore just had to be cashmere she looked far too cool and upmarket for this shoddy bazaar well i was talking to this bloke jane said bloke a bloke i was sure was seriously into mum at one time and oh your mum how do you mean into well not into like not in the fullest sense i just had it in mind that theyd be good together hes quite insecure and vulnerable but also kind of cool he was a musician and songwriter when he was young too young maybe and he got led astray and into drugs and wound up in a mental hospital the way you do its surprising how easily that can happen anyway i dont like guys who are too secure and full of themselves do you like a certain degree of pathos can be kind of sexy rowenna looked unimpressed by this the sound of slow waves breaking on rocks cascaded serenely out of the speakers which sounded pretty naff in a damp tent in a field near leominster so i was telling lol that mum was now an exorcist like in that film where the kid gets possessed and spews green bile everywhere and how there was no call for dealing with stuff like that around here but like i mean there is you know when you think about it its really like that and whereas in that film you had these heavyduty casehardened jesuit priests and even they couldnt handle it come into me come into me rowenna intoned and then he crashes out of the window to his death what do you mean its really like that she had this meganasty job jane said soberly nightmare stuff and like no warning you know i dont actually believe you thats all right im not supposed to talk about it anyway all right if you tell me ill buy you a circlet of selene not good enough you have to promise never ever to buy me a circlet of selene it was probably ok to talk about this one with him being dead and everything all right guy in the hospital this really awful rapist kind of slimeball gets off on degrading women and hes dying ok ok by me said rowenna but he cant let go of his abiding obsession you can see it glistening on his skin like grease jane shivered with a warped sort of pleasure like she didnt tell me all of this but i put it together anyway the nurses theyre all like really shitscared of this pervert because hes got this totally tainted aura what was his name mr joy isnt that excellent youre embroidering this i so am not his name was denzil joy he was in the watkins ward right up at the top of the hospital where its old and spooky and the nurses were genuinely scared of him takes a lot to scare nurses all the stuff theyve seen what did he do she wouldnt say but i could tell she was still like trembling with revulsion hours later heavy trauma scenario what i think it was was that this man could like make you feel like youd been raped he could invade your body just by thinking about what he wanted to do to you and that got all boiled together with the sickness and the frustration inside him the nurses are convinced he was possessed creepy the hell with creepy this was bloody dangerous if you ask me and the bishop just sends her in to sort out this evil scumbag without a second thought on account of shes like a priest and priests know what to do but seriously is she equipped for this does she know what shes doing does she hell occultwise shes probably as naive as all these idiots cooing over the frigging circlet of selene like i feel theres probably a lot i could tell her to help you know but would she listen jane rowenna said listen to me you cannot change other people only yourself in the end the winners in this life are the people who go in with their eyes open and say im not going to let god or nature or the bishop of hereford or whoever fuck about with me im going to call the shots right jane said i suppose thats right and its great if you can actually see that while youre still young enough to do something about it like us you know and of course jane knew it was right when someone like rowenna who was just that bit older and a cool person too said this is right it conferred a kind of responsibility you felt you had to do something about it she tossed her paper cup into a litter bucket lets get out of this amusement arcade good idea said rowenna go find the real stuff huh this is just a front isnt it the real heavyduty clairvoyants are in little back rooms in the pub you want to consult a clairvoyant check them out anyway see if theyre genuine if theyre not itll just be a laugh cost an arm and a leg jane said doubtfully they usually leave the amount up to you hey tenderly rowenna bent and stroked back janes hair and peered into her eyes youre not apprehensive are you christ no said jane lets go for it twice lol had been down to the shop once to see if moon wanted any help but she explained that running a record shop wasnt as easy as he might think and shooed him away the second time to see what she was doing for lunch moon had brought along two apples and a banana moon insisted she was fine dick lyden also said moon was fine if dick was in two minds about anyone it was probably lol whod claimed that moon was living in squalor in the barn until dick had seen the place looking like a suburban villa and moon poised like she was ready to serve the canapes denny also seemed a little happier when he called in appearing at the door of the flat wearing a plaid overcoat and a big hat with a red feather halfway to a smile shes looking almost healthy he conceded is there something i dont know lol shrugged what could he say to him without reference to ghosts or disembowelled crows listen i dont mind denny spread himself in the armchair i think its good im glad all right shes working on her book book oh denny looked uninterested a touch pained thats not really gonna happen is it does your family go all the way back to the iron age dennys smile shut down altogether could be is it a celtic name moon i really dont know we werent always called moon a daughter inherited the farm back in the eighteenth century married a bloke called moon look denny pulled on his earring theres a little something you gotta help me with here mate unblocking drains is not my responsibility you are the landlord dennis nothing that simple little friend this is a really distasteful job dick lyden fill you in about his kid this bishopforaday crap the kid refusing to play along lol nodded warily if theyd told me at sixteen id been picked for boy bishop idve tried to get expelled first this kid attends the cathedral school denny said so his father pays good money for him to be publicly humiliated in front of his peers lol brought two lagers from the fridge as denny spelled it out dick it seemed had resorted to bribery if the boy james swallowed his cool for just a day dick would finance a professionally produced cd by james and his rock band lol winced what are they called tuneless little twats with fender strats fuck knows does it matter i told him youd do it lol me produce them youll get paid of course sod off laurence were talking eplength thats all four tracks two days work max a hundred copies which is where i make my profit its common enough these days how i keep the studio up and running i said youd do it james knows your stuff james even likes your stuff suppose i hate his stuff good boy said denny i appreciate this i said wed give their material a listen tomorrow afternoon ok good and im glad about kathy and you i am really glad god knows i would do anything give anything to get her away from there meanwhile if shes not alone thats the best thing i could hope for under the circumstances lol went still what has she said im her brother denny said she doesnt have to say anything to me later after denny had gone it started to snow a little lol stood by the window in the dark looking down into lamplit church streetcapuchin lane the centuries seeping away along with the colours of the day it was snowing briskly all the shops had closed most of the people had gone if he leaned into the top corner of the window he could see the blackening tower of the cathedral below him a young guy guided a young woman gently into a shallow doorway and they embraced lol thought of moon in her dusty white nightdress if shes not alone fucking hell i didnt expect that rowenna had gone in first and when she came out she raised her eyebrows pulled jane over to the door she was good she was actually how much twenty i paid for you as well there was no need for that im not forget it go on dont keep her waiting she might hang a curse on you shit said jane that was a joke sure she didnt to be honest like fortunetellers one bit and for the very reasons rowenna had put to her earlier suppose the woman told her she was going to die soon or that mum was not that they ever did they just looked at you sadly from under their headscarves and said take your money back dearie all of a sudden im not feeling too well and that was when you knew they were genuine and your card was marked go on rowenna hissed the booth was just an alcove in the public bar with a wicker screen set up to hide it angela tarot readings rowenna had opted for her because like shed said she herself knew a bit about the tarot so would be able to tell if angela was the real mccoy oh shit another thing jane didnt like was the way you were kind of putting yourself and your future in someone elses hands whatever they wanted to tell you it would stay with you colour your dreams frame your nightmares not janes idea of new age which was about selfexploration wasnt it jane yeah ok no alternative no way out jane squeezed behind the partition wise women angela smiled you look worried she said why is that im not worried theres no need to be have you consulted the tarot before once or twice jane lied angela smiled she was sitting at a long pub table of scratched mahogany with wroughtiron legs behind her was a narrow window of frosted glass the light it shed was cold and grey it was going rapidly dark out there angelas hands were already in motion spreading the cards and then gathering them together her hands were slender and supple there were no rings suddenly she pushed the full pack in front of jane pick them up me angela nodded she was not what jane had been expecting no headscarf no big brass earrings jane saw a long oval face and midlength ashblonde hair she wore a pale linen suit which seemed no more suited to this event than rowennas cashmere jane reached out for the cards and shuffle them they were quite big cards and jane was clumsy cards kept sliding out as she tried to mix them up sorry its all right youre doing fine now cut the pack angelas voice was the most unexpected thing it was warm and surprisingly cultured jane cut the cards and left them in two piles what i want you to understand angela said is that the cards are merely an aid they form a psychic link between us she put the pack together and then lifted her hand sharply as though it had given her an electric shock oh whats wrong oh jane christ whats she seen jane said nervously how do you know my name im psychic angela laughed lightly no your friend told me of course what else did she tell you well she certainly didnt tell me how powerful you were has no one told you that before angela began to lay out the cards one on top of another not that i recall ah right she was beginning to get the picture now they will angela said with calm certainty oh sure i wonder how many other people you said that to today jane nodded and said nothing now she knew it was a scam she was no longer worried did rowenna realize it was a scam of course she did when she came out shed just been taking the piss picking up on janes manifest trepidation angela had the cards laid out in a neat semicircle they were beautifully coloured and jane started looking for the ones shed seen pictures of on the covers of mystery novels death the devil the hanged man the last judgement but none of these was obvious in the dim light all the designs were unfamiliar angela placed one card facedown below the others contemplated it for a moment and then turned it over to reveal a faintly smiling woman in a long white robe sitting on some sort of throne with mystical symbols and artefacts all around her there were lights on in the pub but somehow they didnt penetrate into this alcove or at least not as far as angela tell me something jane what do you know of your ancestors sorry i mean are you aware of how can i put this wise women in your family i guess that depends on what you mean by wise im picking up a i suppose you would say a tradition i feel i believe you have much to inherit whether its immediate ancestry or something further back its hard to say but its there it came up immediately no mistaking it at all so i doublechecked and the cards are reinforcing it theres a very strong tradition here mum does she mean mum jane found herself holding her breath do you know what im talking about well maybe mum had sometimes talked of experiences shed had in churches visions of a cosmic benevolence in blue and gold the feeling that she really had to dont tell her what mum is astonishingly angela held up a hand no you dont have to explain as long as you understand yeah jane breathed out jesus christ angela was gazing intently at the cards her attention locked on the layout she was absolutely still as though she and the cards were encased in glass eventually without looking up she said its a big big responsibility oh it needs to be nurtured angela turned over two more cards which seemed to be in conjunction ah now theres been a gap in your life i think someone missing would you do you perhaps have just the one parent yes jane said awed how did you i dont think thats been such a big handicap for you as it might have been for others you have reserves of emotional and psychic energy which have been sustaining you but now that reservoir of psychic energy ought to be plumbed or it may overflow that can cause problems how do you mean jane felt a slow excitement burning somewhere down in her abdomen she looked at angelas halfshadowed face and saw intelligence there and beauty too fine bones angela must be over fifty but jane thought men would find her awfully sexy jane i dont want to alarm you but if one is given a talent and one fails to develop it or allows powerful energy to go its own way it can become misdirected and cause all sorts of problems physical and mental chronic ailments nervous trouble quite a lot of people in hospitals and mental institutions are simply people who have failed to recognize and channel certain energies angela looked up suddenly jane saw her eyes clearly for the first time they were like chips of flint she was serious about this she was dead serious she said faintly what does that mean angela reached over and touched her fingers oh im sorry please dont worry sometimes im concentrating so hard i say the first things that come into my head its just so rare that i get anything as clear and specific as this im probably getting carried away no please go on i dont think so angela swept all the cards together ive been overloading you with my own impressions and thats not a good thing to do lets relax a moment and ill tell you about some less farreaching aspects of your life she asked jane to shuffle and cut the pack again then did a couple of smaller layouts and told jane a few things about herself and her future which were more in line with the stuff you expected to hear well a bit more intimate perhaps like that she was a virgin but wouldnt be for long that she would have more than one serious lover before she was twenty jane smiled at one time shed have been fairly excited about that not to say relieved but right now it didnt seem as vital angela told her that she was extremely intelligent and could have her pick of careers but she might feel herself drawn towards communications or even performance art cool but her main choices angela sighed like shed tried to get away from this but couldnt would be in the spiritual realm other levels of existence were already becoming accessible to her other planes angela said other spheres someone who has gone before has opened the way does that make any sense to you jane thought at once of her old friend the late miss lucy devenish writer of childrens stories and proprietor of the magical giftshop called ledwardine lore who had introduced her to rural mysteries and the mystical poetry of thomas traherne and showed her that spirituality was a shining crystal of which christianity was only one face what jane found it hard to speak her mouth was so dry what do you think i should do dont know its not for me to say this is a very personal issue you cant just leave it like that i mean i could buy books and things but i already do that angela gathered up the cards have you had any personal experiences which have mystified you maybe like there was this time i kind of fell asleep in a field and when i awoke i felt as though id been someone else its like really hard to explain but dont tell me these are messages for you alone look jane what im going to do is give you a telephone number not mine because i dont think you should be entirely influenced by one person or feel that youre being pressed from one direction angela reached down to a handbag on the floor and pulled out a notepad and a pen jane felt a welling excitement and also a small fizzing trepidation as angela wrote this is the number of a young woman called sorrel not far from here youll like her shes very downtoearth who is she just another person with a questing spirit she runs a healthfood restaurant in hereford and holds meetings there for people of a like mind to share experiences and consider methods of developing their skills sounds a bit i mean id feel a bit if you did decide to go you could always take your friend rosemary was it rowenna jane felt much better yeah thatd be cool er develop skills what sort of skills do you think i might have healing clairvoyance its not for me to say perhaps you can find out angela tore the top page out of her notebook and placed it in front of jane its entirely up to you now right jane said right when she stood up her legs felt cold and trembly moon was pulling down the oldfashioned rollerblind over the closed sign on the door all the lights were out except for a brownshaded one on the counter so that the air in the shop had a deepshadowed sepia density the unsaleable balalaika hung forlornly on the wall behind the till the lowlevel music from the speakers each end of the single seventeenthcentury beam was by radiohead at their most suicidal the one about escaping lest you choked lol swallowed moon said to him as though hed been here for some time i asked denny to come over for supper he said hed really love to but he was too busy i knew hed say that well he probably is works piling up in the studio moon shook her head its his wife maggie thinks im still doing dope and im poison in all sorts of other ways plus he just doesnt want to come to the barn she came to stand next to him she was wearing a long brown cardigan over a toomuchunbuttoned white cotton blouse and jeans something dull and metallic hung from a leather thong around her neck moon you cant go home on your bike in the dark up that hill its snowing hard ive got good lights and nothing will touch me on dinedor i could try and get it in the back of the car or i could take you back in the car now and pick you up again tomorrow he felt tense the missing element here as usual was lightness in any situation moon was a solemn person no humour no banter as if all the familys irony genes had been been used up on denny sixteen years before she was born silly making two trips moon argued i dont mind really or you could stay moon said why not stay over she was very close to him what exactly did denny say to you he said that he was glad you werent on your own moon laughed lightly what did you tell him moon it doesnt matter poor denny moon took lols left hand and held it between both of hers they were slim hands but strong hardened by delving in the earth and stupid dick i cant believe how timid and stupid people can be dick and his feeble psychology denny hiding behind a wall against the past and you she looked closely at his hand are you timid too oh im more timid than any of them lol said what of what are you frightened of lol she was standing close enough now for him to see that there was dust on her blouse she seemed to attract dust dust of ages lol thought the past had become attracted to her a long way away radiohead were playing karma police about what you got if you messed with us he could hardly hear it for the drumming in his head i think im frightened of you lol whispered in shame and i dont know why the movements were so minimal that hed hardly noticed her creeping into his arms until they were kissing and his hands were in the long long hair and something flared inside him like when you finally put a match to a longprepared fire of brittle paper and dry kindling so what are you going to do rowenna asked as they drove into ledwardine marketplace which had a lacing of snow stop just here for a while jane said you havent even told me what she said to you the cobbled square with its little timbered markethall was lit by electric gaslamps on wroughtiron poles and brackets rowenna parked under one of these and its light turned her hair into shivering spirals of rosegold she told me my spiritual progression would be very much bound up with a friends oh gosh there were only two cars on the square both in front of the black swan there was a light visible between the trees which screened the vicarage and jane thought she could see a cluster of early stars around the tip of the church steeple but that might just have been snow she just so much wanted this to be a magical night so are you going to phone this other woman kitten its a big step no it isnt you can check it out first and if it sounds iffy you dont get involved i dont get involved all right we dont what about mum we dont have to invite her do we you know what i mean right now she would not be cool about this shes insecure enough as it is of course shes insecure shes a christian i dont think i can do it to her youre not doing anything to her id be lying they expect us to lie rowenna said the snow made spangles in the fake gaslight i need to think about this well dont think too long like angela said repressing it may seriously damage your health jane sighed the village seemed deserted through the snowflakes the light in the vicarage looked very far away overhead cables cut where did you get to flower oh hereford and places shopping and stuff what did you buy nothing much rowenna got some things she seems to have a lot of money merrily said heating soup at the stove i suppose shes indulged quite a bit having to be dragged around the country with her father stationed at different bases yeah jane said noncommittally shed arrived home about seven looking a bit pale merrily thought outside it was snowing quite hard and sticking impressively to the ground and the trees november snow it couldnt last surely where did rowenna live before whats this about said jane just interest you seem to be spending a lot of time with her thats all that said jane is because shes interesting they were at malmesbury in wiltshire her dad was with the army at salisbury or somewhere they dont like to talk about it the sas so i dont ask satisfied later she said im sorry mum im being a pig tired thats all i think ill have an early night merrily didnt argue she wanted to be up early herself she suspected thered be a bigger congregation tomorrow than usual people always liked going to church in the snow she was in bed by eleven with a hotwater bottle less than ten minutes later the phone bleeped ledwardine vic merrily its sophie at the bishops office im terribly sorry to bother you but were having a problem at the cathedral i wonder could you perhaps come over big grey snowflakes tumbled against the window merrily sat up in bed it had never felt so cold in here before whats happened i it involves canon dobbs i dont like to say too much on the phone merrily switched on the bedside lamp give me half an hour maybe fortyfive minutes if the roads are bad oh god yes i didnt realize do be careful ill see you soon when she came out of the bedroom buttoning her jeans she found jane on the landing i heard the phone she was in her dressinggown and mustnt have been asleep some kind of problem at the cathedral why should that concern you i dont really know shall i come it looks a bit rough out there god no you get back to bed what if you get stuck these roads can be really nasty and the councils megaslow off the mark like about three days apparently its a big car ill be fine this is like deliverance business again isnt it to be honest i just dont know talk about secrecy jane said strangely wide awake you deliverance guys make the sas seem like doubleglazing salesmen why had she imagined the cathedral would be all lit up maybe because that was how shed been hoping to find it a beacon of old christian warmth and strength but in the snow and the night she was more than ever aware of how setapart it had become once it had stood almost next to the medieval castle two powerhouses together now the city was growing away from the river and the castle had vanished the cathedral crouched black on white like the church at bay merrily parked on broad street near the central library the dashboard clock always five to ten minutes fast indicated nearmidnight it had been a grindingly slow journey with her window wound down to let the cigarette smoke out and the arctic air in just to keep her awake shed taken the longer wider route east of the wye where there was always some traffic even the chance of snowploughing if anyone in the highways department had happened to notice a change in the weather the roadsurface was white and brown and treacherous snowlagged trees slumped over it like gross cauliflowers it all still seemed so unlikely what would hunter want with her at this time of night was he trying to turn deliverance into the fourth emergency service merrily locked the volvo put on her gloves pulled up her hood and set out across the snowquilted silence of broad street no one about not even a drunk in view no traffic at all the city centre as you rarely saw it luminous and christmascard serene snowflakes like big stars against the blueblack merrilys booted steps were muted on the padded pavement behind her only the green dragon had lights on she felt conspicuous there was no sign of the bishop or the bishops men hadnt a woman once been raped in the cathedrals shadow hadnt the last time shed been called out at night christ be with me christ within me the cathedral was towered and turreted the paths and the green lawns submerged together in snow a white moat around gods fortress but no other night defences its guardians the canons and the vergers were sleeping in the warren of cloisters behind nobody about except merrily sophie came hurrying around the building towards the north porch following the bouncing beam of a torch attached to a large shadow beside her merrily breathed normally again thank heavens you made it the bishops secretary lived not five minutes walk away in a quiet victorian villa near the castle green she wore a long sheepskin coat her white hair coming apart under a woollen scarf we were just wondering whether to call michael after all but i thought the bishop he doesnt know anything about this sophie said quickly do you know george curtiss good evening mrs watkins i ah think we have met oh yes hello he was one of the cathedral canons a big overcoated man with a beard of greek orthodox proportions and a surprisingly hesitant reedy voice george called me to ask if we should tell michael about this sophie said but i suggested we consult you this is all very difficult look im sorry am i supposed to know whats happening you tell her george yes its oh dear george curtiss glanced behind him to make sure they were alone bringing down his voice its about old ah tom dobbs im afraid merrily sophie was hugging herself hes virtually barricaded himself in we think hes drunk i rather fear george said what hes behind that partition sophie said you know where theyre repairing the cantilupe tomb hes in there with chained and padlocked himself in he wont talk to us hes just rambling to someone else to himself i dont know rambling on and on neither of us understands but i just well i rather suspected you might its all its rather frightening actually so there is a merrily swallowed a deliverance context what a stupid question oh yes sophie said i think so dont you george curtiss shuffled impatiently i trust we can ah rely on your discretion mrs watkins i know hes an odd character but i do have a longstanding admiration for the man as does as does the dean but i dont know him ive never even spoken to him hes ah had his problems george said feels rather beleaguered threatened by by certain recent developments in view of these wed rather avoid involving the dean or the bishop at this stage but i dont know him and he but you know what he does merrily sophie whispered urgently do i mrs watkins george curtis coughed we all know what he does if not the ah technicalities of it its just were a little nervous about whats going on in there you want me to try and talk to him just listen i suppose sophie tightened her scarf interpret for us my latin isnt what it used to be george said latin george dragged a long breath through the brambles of his beard but his voice still came out weakly my impression is hes talking to ah to ah to st thomas i dont understand merrily said sophie almost snapped at her you think we do they followed george curtiss and his torch around the building to st johns door which was used mainly by the clergy and the vergers snow was already spattered up the nearby walls well go in very quietly george said as though addressing a party of schoolchildren he was one of the regular tourguides merrily recalled i sometimes think the dean has ultrasonic hearing merrily stepped warily inside as if a madeyed dobbs might come rampaging at them swinging his crucifix drunk if dobbs had a drink problem it was the first shed heard about it but if the old exorcist had become a public embarrassment the dean could no longer be seen to support him that way the dean would himself lose face and if the bishop found out he would make the most of it in the most discreet way of course to strengthen his position as an engine of reform get rid of dobbs and perhaps the dean as well can of worms although it felt no warmer inside merrily unzipped her waxed coat and put a hand to the bump in her sweater her pectoral cross this was because the atmosphere in the cathedral was different live sophie touched her arm are you all right yes merrily remembered reading once that gothic churches somehow recharged themselves at night like battery packs she felt again the powerful inner call to prayer shed experienced on the afternoon shed emerged from the shelllike chantry to encounter dobbs and the woman i wont put on any lights george whispered dont want to draw undue ah attention he snapped off his torch for a moment the only illumination now was the little aumbry light over the cupboard holding the emergency sacrament wine and wafers in a silver container merrily felt a desperate vibrating desire to kneel before it there was no sound at all all right george switched on his torch again and they followed its bobbing beam through the lady chapel and into the north transept where the great stainedglass window reared over the temporary screening partition hiding the dismantled tomb of st thomas cantilupe george shone his torch over the various posters drawingpinned to it telling the story of cantilupe a wise and caring bishop according to the cathedral guidebook who stood firm against evil in all its guises george stopped and called out harshly thomas as though he hadnt intended to as though the word had been wrenched out of him merrily quivered for an instant thomas as if he was summoning the spirit of cantilupe he might as well have been there was no response merrily looked at sophie youre sure hes still george moved across and shone his torch on the plywood partition door merrily remembered a padlocked chain connecting steel staples on the outside all this will be taken down quite soon george said theyre putting the tomb back together next week the chain appeared to have been dragged inside through a halfinch crack between the illfitting door and its frame dobbs or someone else had to be still behind it merrily said do you feel anything i feel quite annoyed actually sophie muttered why isnt he doing what he was doing earlier youll think we only dragged you here on a such a dreadful night on some sort of perverse whim no the atmosphere sophie the atmospheres somehow i dont know disarranged how do you mean i dont know ive never been in here at night before not like this anyway she had a feeling of overhead cables cut slashed through of them hanging down now still live and dangerous thomas george rapped on the plywood door thomas its george getting a bit anxious about you old chap somethings happened merrily said suddenly can you break it down thomas george slapped the partition with a leathergloved hand are you there break it down he swung round this is a cathedral mrs watkins maybe you can snap the chain i cant even reach the chain kick the door i i cant merrily hurriedly unzipped her coat and slipped out of it stand back then ill do it no i thomas for gods sake george put an ear to the crack between the door and the frame stop wait i can hear merrily went still i can hear him breathing george said can you hear that she turned her back to the plywood screen steadying her own breathing she rubbed her eyes think practically think rationally when she turned back both george and sophie were staring at her and the air in the high transept was still invisibly untidy with snipped wires all right big george began to unbutton his overcoat ill do it he wore fat black boots doc martens probably size eleven at least with equipment like that he could bring the whole damned partition crashing down he gave merrily the rubbercovered torch which felt moist by its light she saw that his brown eyes were wide and scared and a froth of spittle glistened in his beard christ be with us merrily heard herself saying costume drama siren warbling blue beacons strobing violently beautiful over the snow the ambulance broke the rules by cutting from broad street across the cathedral green merrily stood outside st johns door with sophie feeling useless even in his condition dobbs had reared up from the stones at the sight of her one arm hanging limp and his face like a waxwork melting down one side george curtiss had then taken charge suggesting she and sophie should phone for help from the office in the gatehouse merrily had glanced back once before they hurried away and had seen george fumbling at the wall under the aumbry light the sacrament sophie had started to shake oh dear god hes asked for the sacrament merrily wasnt sure dobbs had been in any condition at the time to voice a request this was probably georges own decision probably a wise one she and sophie stood back while the paramedics brought the old man out multiple headlights creaming the snow and more people gathering one of the vergers a couple of policemen and the right reverend michael hunter loping towards them the bishop in a purple tracksuit merrily what on earth are you doing here michael i sent for her sophie explained at once i thought thats good the bishop said thats fine entirely appropriate summoned from his bed no doubt by the ambulance siren he seemed neither cold nor tired merrily could almost see his athletes glow as an actual halo as he raised a palm over the two women like a blessing poor canon dobbs sophie said the bishop nodded a good and distinguished servant of god huh merrily recalled their discussion in the green dragon the old mans ubiquitous hovering silently like some dark malign spectre id like to i want to exorcize dobbs classic episcopal hypocrisy but he worked himself too hard and for too long the bishop said a stroke i gather yes merrily said thats what it looks like no cool efficient sophie started to cry two strokes it must have been two dont you see we thought he must be must have been drinking when we heard his voice all slurred in fact he was simply struggling to speak after a first stroke probably only a minor one and then i remember my father oh god how stupid we were how utterly thoughtless sophie merrily said if it wasnt for you he might still be lying there perhaps it was us shouting at him to come out perhaps all the fuss threw him into some sort of confused panic and that was what brought on the second stroke sophie listen the bishop took his secretary by both shoulders then eased back her scarf so as to look into her eyes we all knew that thomas was long long overdue for retirement his particular ministry put him under enormous pressure several of us as you know tried very hard to persuade him to give it up i think it was becoming explicitly clear to everyone that this good mans mind was breaking down hey watch yourself he guided sophie out of the path of the ambulance as it started up preparing to bear the stricken dobbs to the general hospital george curtiss appeared from behind it breathing hard through his beard bishop well done george im afraid i didnt do enough im sure you did everything humanly possible mick hunter said then after a pause except to inform your bishop oh yes i ah thought hoped that it wouldnt be necessary to involve you or the dean i want to be appraised of everything george you wont forget that again will you no the big canon a good ten years older than the bishop looked like a chastized schoolboy im sorry bishop get some sleep well talk about this tomorrow merrily bishop she was annoyed at the way hed spoken to george whod administered the sacrament to dobbs stayed with him tried to make him comfortable keep him calm the bishop said what was canon dobbs actually doing when you found him he was having a stroke bishop merrily said wearily mick hunter was silent im sorry merrily said its been a difficult night has it i see ill talk to you on monday merrily this is obviously going to have a bearing on your situation he turned and walked towards the cathedral i thought for a moment he was going to say something about god moving in mysterious ways merrily muttered to clear the way for the new regime hes wearing trainers sophie said absently his poor feet must be absolutely soaked wellies wouldnt fit the image hes more than image merrily sophie said quietly i think you know that hes a very young man one day hell be a great man i should think one day hell probably be an archbishop merrily thought but i doubt hell be a great man but shed said enough thank you for coming sophie said though clearly it wasnt a terribly good idea sophie merrily glanced over her shoulder at the cathedral which although someone probably the bishop had put on lights was still not the imagined beacon of old christian warmth not now when george said dobbs was talking to thomas cantilupe what did he mean by that sophie appeared uncomfortable does that matter now yeah i think it does that was georges surmise i thought he was talking to himself thomas you see both of them thomases it was as though he perhaps he was already feeling ill and he was urging himself to hold on what were his words well like that he did actually say that at least once please god hold on thomas and then hed lapse into mumbling latin how did he get in does he have keys he must have does he often come here alone at night it sophie sighed so they say what else do they say they say he has rather an obsession with st thomas cantilupe i do know he studied the medieval church so perhaps he sought some sort of deeper communion with the saint on a spiritual level i dont like to you mean because the tomb was lying open for the first time in over a century he thought the saint would be more accessible you have to help me here sophie i dont understand i dont know what to say sophie said i dont feel its right to talk about it now with the poor man probably dying i mean george gave him the sacrament sophie just let me get this right are you saying you called me in because you and george thought canon dobbs was attempting to make contact with a dead saint i dont know merrily sophie was wringing the ends of her scarf look i just wanted to protect oh i dont know who i wanted to protect the bishop canon dobbs or just the cathedral in the end it all comes back to the cathedral doesnt it i she stamped a booted foot on the snow as if to emphasize it to herself i work for the cathedral is there something is there a problem in the cathedral is that what youre trying to say maybe she should talk to george who was still with the two policemen beside their car at the roadside can we talk about this again sophie said if im going to help youve got to trust me i do trust you merrily thats why i telephoned for you and i feel guilty now you look so awfully tired do you really have to drive back the roads are going to be dreadful no worse than when i came i think the snows stopping anyway but itll probably freeze on top thats rather treacherous and its always a little warmer in the city look why dont you stay with us tonight we always keep a room prepared and andrew will have hot chocolate ready well thanks but theres jane at home and tomorrows services i do feel so guilty about bringing you here dont worry i wont fall asleep at the wheel ill smoke hmm sophie said disapprovingly good night sophie watching sophie walk away towards warmth and hot chocolate merrily felt damp and chilled inside her thinning fakebarbour she saw the police car pulling away into broad street and george curtiss had already gone fatigue had induced detachment she didnt want to be detached she remembered how when she and sophie and george had first entered the cathedral tonight the urge to pray had washed over her like surf a tide of need dobbss need that had gone now her prayers werent needed or not so urgently she ought to have obeyed that call fallen to her knees and the whole bit bloody anglican reserve the church of the stiff upper lip abruptly merrily went back into the cathedral to pray for dobbs before it was all locked up again knowing she would make for the place where george had kicked down a partition door the cantilupe fragments what did she know about cantilupe bishop of hereford in the late thirteenth century born into a wealthy norman baronial family educated for the church a political career before he came to hereford in middle age in the reign of edward i a row with the archbishop of canterbury which got him excommunicated reinstatement then death then sainthood then the miracles dozens of miracles around the shrine the tomb that no longer had a body in it and that was now in pieces the aumbry light still shone a relic of the medieval church seldom needed now tonight another medieval relic had required the last rites merrily realized she very much did not want dobbs to die she went down on her knees on the hard coldness before the aumbry light itself let him live please god let him survive build some kind of bridge between us throw down some quiet light let there be useless incoherent she was just too tired she couldnt find the words to explain herself merrily she opened her eyes im sorry i was so abrupt merrily it wasnt you it was me im sorry i felt excluded the latenight dj voice resonant burntumber she should have realized hed still be here perhaps she had hello mick the bishop extended a hand he was very strong and suddenly she was on her feet again you look very tired mick said i hear youve been working hard tonight finding it hard thats all as youre bound to his lean face was crinkled by a sympathetic closedmouth smile he surveyed her in the mellow light its a very taxing role social worker psychotherapist and virtuoso stageperformer all rolled into one stageperformer were all of us actors merrily the church is a faded but still fabulous costume drama oh and to survive it has to be considerably more sophisticated these days poor dobbs is strictly hammer films im afraid he should retire if he recovers to one of those nice rural nursing homes for ageing clerics there to write his memoirs dont you think i dont know what i think youre overtired mick said poor baby im not going to let you drive home you realize that its only twenty minutes he was offering to drive her in these conditions at least an hour and requiring rather more attention than i suspect youd be able to summon consider this an executive ruling come to the palace weve lots of spare rooms i always feel guilty about perhaps we should make some available to selected homeless people what do you think i think it would be very much an unnecessary imposition on mrs hunter what accommodating the homeless or accommodating you either way not a problem valentinas away for a couple of days visiting her ageing parents in the cotswolds old church vals father yesterdays church we have endless and insoluble theological arguments so these days i tend to plead pressure of work merrily smiled look its very kind of you mick its just she moved selfconsciously towards st johns door you he followed her need all your strength just let others look after you sometimes we can get you back in good time for tomorrows services if thats what youre worried about we have a wonderful old land rover at our disposal theres jane you know jane my daughter she thought he blinked shes not a child any more is she she must be getting quite used to your nocturnal comings and goings i suppose she is well then he put his hands on her shoulders as he had on sophies earlier his hands were big and firm and warm merrily you have to stop shouldering the problems of the world besides it would be a good opportunity for us to talk about the future itll be impossible to keep this out of the papers you know especially if the old guy dies on us we need to be ready hmm as mick hunter lowered his arms from her shoulders his head bent quickly and she was sure his lips touched her forehead just once on the hairline this means we can stop quietly phasing you in and officially announce the establishment of a deliverance consultancy we need to discuss how were going to handle that but not tonight oh no not tonight tomorrow he paused over our breakfast perhaps the way he said our breakfast the way he had his arms by his sides now but had not stepped back the way he seemed to be closer than when his hands had been on her she felt an awful compulsion to fall forward collapse into that strong muscular episcopal chest up to you of course he said coincidentally weve just had a guest suite refurbished bathroom with shower small sitting room that sort of setup you may find you have to overnight in hereford quite often as your role expands consider it available at any time as youll be reporting exclusively to me it would seem like an arrangement with considerable possibilities you know she stayed silent giving him an opportunity to qualify that but he didnt he just stood there gazing at her and after a moment he calmly folded his arms sometimes a defensive gesture but not this time no this couldnt be couldnt possibly be how it sounded everythings changing merrily mick said easily this is a time of transition when traditional values old restrictions should be allowed to drift away we should stop presuming to know what god wants of us merrily backed against the door needing cold air space we should be prepared to experiment mick continued calmly until the waters settle and we know where we are again for a while he followed her out of the cathedral leaving the door for the verger to lock outside an unreal mauvish mist was gathering around white roofs over white pavements the greywhite road a christmascard hereford out of time mick hunter in his purple tracksuit seemed part of the picture part of the illusion not real see no traffic at all he said earlier i believe the tv and radio stations were warning motorists not to venture out unless it was absolutely vital time of transition in the tingling mist merrily felt as though she was being drawn into a developing lucid dream and had to go with it some of the way at least to see if its destination could possibly be what she was halfimagining or make a wild dash across broad street for her car or she heard jane saying its probably considered socially ok to fuck a bishop and felt appalled mick look i actually think its beginning to thaw i can be home in half an hour nonsense merrily you know you dont really want to do that i have to she began to walk away from him towards the road and then stopped and turned as the bishop spoke again with quiet insistence you only have to do what you want to do thats not true this was not the bishop talking but the bulge in his tracksuit trousers she closed her eyes briefly and wished him gone oh excuse me miss a man stepped out from behind one of the trees like some accosting beggar one of those homeless that mick and val would not be accommodating at the palace not now the bishop told him irritably sorry sir not you the lady are you by any chance the lady whose daughter ordered a minicab huh mrs watson watkins yeah thats it mick hunter didnt move merrily shrugged and gave him a bashful smile i didnt know shed done that kid does my thinking for me thanks anyway bishop what time do you want to see me on monday eleven oclock the bishop said tonelessly in the great hall she nodded good night he said its this way said the cabbie mick hunter had vanished by the time she found out that the cabbie did not have a vehicle with him not good they walked in silence a short way along broad street until merrily was sure the bishop had returned to the palace then lol robinson hurried her discreetly across the whitened green and into church street little jane called me about half an hour ago said you were heading this way and you might be able to use a cup of coffee at some stage ive just been hanging around so intuitive that kid god she was pleased to see him although under the circumstances anybody at all would have been a serious blessing i think she was worried about you he said merrily smiled im sure she felt lightheaded glad for the first time she could remember to be out of the cathedral who was that guy in the tracksuit lol unlocked a recessed door in the alleyway next to the little music shop that laurence was the bishop of hereford oh i see lol wore nothing over the familiar black sweatshirt with the roswell alien face printed on it in flaking grey he must be freezing i had him down as some latenight jogger who i dont really know thought i was a prostitute like you always find in the cathedral close lol grinned who was the bloke they put in the ambulance canon dobbs hes had a stroke we found him collapsed in the cathedral oh lol shouldered the door open and turned on the light they entered a hallway with a flight of stairs and a mountainbike they called me in merrily said because he was still is the last diocesan exorcist you know about all that i suppose well you know ive talked to jane then you know everything she looked around the shapeless lamplit room with its beams and trusses and sash windows with lots of little square panes lols old guitar rested on a metal stand by the brickedup fireplace a stained and sagging armchair she remembered from his old cottage in ledwardine ethel used to sleep in this she said how is ethel ethel is fine you get extra points for being a vicarage cat lol moved around opening up radiators his brassrimmed glasses had halfmisted this place is better for you merrily flopped into the chair without taking off her coat do you feel better here havent been here long enough to think too much about it its ok i suppose he went into what was presumably the kitchen leaving the door open a bluewhite light flickering very central convenient for the cathedral right she forced herself out of the chair and went to join him in the kitchen it had barely room for two people the fluorescent striplighting hurt her eyes reminding her of the sluiceroom next to the alfred watkins ward that was your idea the taxi all i could think of at the time he had his back to her filling the kettle thank you she said solemnly you got me out of something heavy really he turned round looking happy like you did for me and ethel that night oh more than that the way this was going i might not have had a career well you know i didnt really hear anything yes you did ok i did how many points for sleeping with a lady vicar for a bishop i honestly cant recall a precedent but bishops are survivors especially this one i suspect lady vicars theyre expendable especially ones caught in sin she was startled at how easy it was to discuss all this with lol though they hadnt spoken for months it might have been just this morning she last saw him she looked around the little kitchen plywood cupboards a small fridge a microwave three mugs with hedgehog motifs on a shelf nothing suggestive of permanence she was looking for a sign that lol was out of limbo now and not finding one erm he turned to pull two of the mugs from the shelf when you said just now that you might not have had a career does that mean that if i hadnt shown up what it would have meant merrily said slowly is that in order to get away from him i would probably have had to stop pretending he was simply offering me a room for the night right lol set down the mugs his glasses had misted again janell be glad to know that they sat and drank their coffee merrily in ethels old chair lol on the floor his back to the window shed have to be going soon if she was going to grab a couple of hours before holy communion jane said you were training to be a psychotherapist wild exaggeration ive been helping my therapist former therapist hopefully that means i help a bit with other clients as a kind of therapy well one other client mainly the woman who used to live in this flat oh merrily said that would be this er moon just that jane implied ive got a vague idea what jane implied that kid could start wars merrily stretched i dont want to move so dont move i have to anyway i think youd make rather a good psychotherapist being an exloony not only that thanks you know what i mean youve been swallowed by the system once you could be good at keeping other people out of the system lol said maybe there are too many therapists and counsellors around already all talking different kinds of bollocks is this dick paying you kind of theres no big problem with money the song royalties trickle in and i might have another album sometime lol stood up i er i was thinking of ringing you sometime actually what do you do if someone insists theyve seen a ghost i mean not just any old ghost a close relative and so maybe they want to see it to see more of it well id try and find out if it was a real ghost maybe id ask a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist for some advice and say this psychotherapist or somebody else who knew this person well was fairly convinced that there was something unusual happening here well merrily lit a cigarette id probably try and explain to the person that this was not a very good idea its not uncommon actually seeing relatives whove just passed on twentyfive years ago thats more uncommon a visitor is the loose term we er we tend to use for this kind of phenomenon and its a bad thing is it even if the person is not scared by it any prolonged contact with a spirit or whatever is unhealthy it can lead to all kinds of problems mental problems obviously and also well you might think that what youre seeing is your old mum but it might be something else i take it were talking about this moon possibly lol you only have one client ok its moon whos she been seeing her father he died when she was two any complications shot himself oh thats not good is it thats not good at all merrily said would she see me do you think i dont know maybe if you werent wearing you know a dogcollar and i introduced you as a friend sounds like a good idea shes working in the shop down below all week maybe ill call in on monday then merrily said i dont know what time yet ill be in the gatehouse if you want me except midmorning when im having discussions with my friend the bishop pity you cant see her house really a barn shes leasing up on dinedor hill shes quite obsessive about the hill its where she was born where the family have lived since the iron age or so she claims this sounds awfully complicated lol merrily yawned and forced herself out of the chair whered i put my coat all i can say is that shes different when shes up there a different person half half somewhere else he unhooked her waxed jacket from behind the door i dont suppose no never mind i hate it when anyone says that just that she left her bike here and i drove her home last night because of the snow so i have to pick her up on monday morning fetch her in to work early ish if you could get me back to the gatehouse by eleven i can come up with you whats my excuse then your car wouldnt start so im giving you a lift somewhere shell buy that this is really good of you merrily its my job were told to work with shrinks the bishop would approve the shrink doesnt know lol said the shrink must never know a nonbeliever huh of the most intractable kind lol said you want me to drive you back now no lol merrily annunciated carefully youre not really a minicab driver that was for the benefit of the bishop she went smiling into the snow she must be overtired at least the roads were no worse back in the vicarage just before five she called the general hospital she gave them her name and they put her through to the ward she just knew which one it was going to be there was an ironic inevitability about it reverend watkins not the biggest surprise of the morning to have you ring what was the biggest the biggest to tell you the simple truth eileen cullen said is that the auld fellers still with us would that be an indication he might be coming through this ah now i wouldnt go taking bets on that he knows when youre talking to him his eyesll follow you around the room but hes not talking back yet mr dobbs is not a big conversationalist in my experience the room you havent got him christ no we have this other wee side ward at the far end of the main ward if denzil was still with us mr dobbs wouldnt even be able to smell him merrily shuddered so collapsed in the cathedral they say cullen said nonchalantly yes thats what they say well im off home in a while but im sure theyll keep you posted on any developments ill mention it thanks a pause then cullen said funny isnt it how things come around mr dobbs arranging like that for you to have a mauling from denzil in his deaththroes and now you ever find out why he did that to you i never did merrily said maybe never will now well cullen said a patientll talk about all kinds of things so he will in the night sometimes ill keep my ears open chalk circle she knew the words of course she did she knew the words but they wouldnt come she bent close to him his breath uneven his eyes closed against her like this was an act of will she brought the chalice close to his stony face on the hospital pillow white as a linen altarcloth and tipped her hand very slightly so that the wine rolled slowly down the silver vessel and trickled between his parted lips a drop remaining on his lower lip like blood blood yes yes of course the blood of our lord jesus christ which was shed for you preserve your body and soul into everlasting life drink this in remembrance that christs blood was shed for you thomas dobbs began to suck greedily at the wine she was so grateful at having remembered the words that she tilted the chalice again at a steeper angle and wine flooded between his lips and filled his cheeks and she began to murmur the lords prayer our father who there was a cracking sound like splintering stone and his eyes flicked open shocking her dobbss eyes were grey and white and when he saw who hovered behind the sacrament they blurred and foamed like a stream over rocks in winter hallowed be dobbss shoulders began to quake thy kingdom she watched him rising up in the metal bed his cheeks expanding she could not move this was her job she kept on murmuring the prayer when eyes bulging in fury he coughed the consecrated wine in a great spout into her face it was indeed as warm as fresh blood and she felt its rivulets down her cheeks this was her job she could not move his hand snaked from under the bedclothes and when it gripped her wrist like a monkeywrench the green tubes were ejected from his nose with a soft popping she didnt scream she was a priest she just woke up with a whimper sweating after a little over an hours sleep on the sofa and half a minute before the alarm was due to go off you look awful said ted clowes after morning service as senior churchwarden and merrilys uncle he was entitled to be insulting this damned deliverance nonsense i suppose ive told you i have an extreme aversion to anything evangelical uncle ted a retired solicitor had read widely the daily mail about the toronto blessing and certain churches in greater london where parishioners with emotional problems were exorcized of their devils in front of the entire congregation he was monitoring all merrilys services for danger signs in addition theres all the time it seems to take up time that should be spent in this parish merrily ted i wouldnt have been doing anything here in the parish in the early hours of this morning but look at the state of you look at the shadows under your eyes you look as if youd been beaten up i tell you these things dont go unnoticed in a village half of those old women are not listening to a word of your sermon theyre examining you inch by inch for signs of disrepair anyway i should get some sleep for an hour or two after lunch put that child of yours on telephone duty jane was sitting in mums sculleryoffice with ethel on her knees and her one purchase from the psychic fair open on the desk a secondhand copy of a treatise on cosmic fire by alice a bailey so far she couldnt understand how a book with such a cool title could be so impenetrable it sometimes read like one of those stereotype fantasy sagas she devoured as a kid well until about last year actually with all these references to the sevenfold lords and stuff like that except this was for real but wasnt there a simpler way to enlightenment in her pocket she had the phone number angela had given her sorrel she took it out then put it back instead she rang lol mum had said very little about last night apart from dobbs and his stroke like tough but the old guy was plainly out of his tree as well as being seriously outdated on the issue of women priests if you had to have soul police and no way did you better someone decently liberal like mum dobbs should have bowed out long ago and gone to tend his roses or something jane scratched behind ethels left ear until the black cat twisted her neck purred luxuriously and faked an orgasm lol wasnt answering his phone mum said shed had a cup of coffee with lol that was all not as good as getting completely soaked through and having to take off all her clothes on lols hearthrug but a start jane hung up closed alice a bailey put ethel on the carpet she took a long long breath and got out the piece of paper denny had upgraded his studio to track this is it for me he said finito i think weve all been getting too technoconscious its not what rock and rolls about when i was a kid you had a twotrack grundig in somebodys garage and you were bloody grateful what on earth is a grundig asked james lydens friend eirion unpacking his bass forget it denny said the house was no more than half a mile from dicks place about the same age but detached and with a longish drive just as well with a studio underneath however denny had also allowed for major soundproofing the creation of an anteroom and homemade acoustic walls had reduced the main cellar to about twothirds of its original size four of them now stood in the glassscreened control room with dennys personalized mixingboard it was a warm secure little world this was the wine cellar james enquired presumably wondering what denny had done with all his wine coal cellar denny snapped james didnt have a stratocaster he had a gibson les paul copy a good one you had to look hard to be sure he gazed around ive got a rough idea how this setup operates but perhaps you could stick around for an hour or two before you let us get on with it lol blinked they expected denny to leave them here alone with his gear but denny wasnt listening he was underneath the mainboard now with a hand lamp messing with something lol wondered if james actually had got the wrong idea about this or whether he was just trying it on he looked like the kind of kid who would always try for more with a fair chance of success lol figured the boy looked austere and kind of patrician and tall a good six inches taller than dick a good bit slimmer than dick too who would have ceased to be jamess role model many years ago like when james was about six i used to rather like those hazey jane albums he said to lol you were a pretty good songwriter you had that melancholy feel of what was his name i cant remember mum had an album of his nick drake through the glass lol could see the two nonsongwriting band members erecting a drum kit down on the studio floor oh i know james taylor thats interesting lol said james nodded knowledgeably his mother as a therapist would have told him about the young james taylors psychiatric problems which would be why hed made the comparison letting lol know he knew the history he smiled compassionately down at lol you did absolutely the right thing in my view i mean packing in when you did if everybody stopped recording at their peak wed have a hell of a lot less dross to wade through in my view like someone shouldve shot lennon ten years earlier thats what you think they should have shot mccartney first said eirion he was from cardiff one of those wealthy welshspeaking families but eirion spoke english with an accent straight out of hampstead or somewhere eirion reckons twentyfive james said i say twentyseven giving them the benefit of the doubt compulsory retirement age for rock musicians eirion explained we argue about it a lot personally i think semivoluntary euthanasias probably the best answer lol said when they stop playing their health goes or they take too many drugs and become a burden on the state eirion considered this they could surely afford bupa or something couldnt they lol heard rumbles from underneath the mixingboard detected sounds resembling fucking little and shits he was beginning to enjoy this in fact he felt much better today about well most of it this morning the disparate pieces of a song which had been lying around for most of a month had fallen exquisitely into place so how many songs you actually got james how many eirion twenty twentytwo well yes but some of them are fairly embarrassing now actually things we did over a year ago that old huh said lol james looked sullen dad says hes only paying for four but he can cock off that would be a pure waste of time and manpower besides weve worked seriously hard and were pretty fucking efficient it wouldnt take that much longer to lay down the other six an album in fact anything less isnt worth the hassle said james dont you think well see how it goes lol said its this blokes studio denny came up redfaced from underneath the board his big earring swinging furiously sorted he announced oh i get it james tucked his rugby shirt into his jeans and strapped on his guitar youre the engineer too and the cleaner denny said menacingly and the teaboy no i mean to be tactful about this we dont mind you guys hanging around we do want to be produced but we need space to experiment yeah were only into being guided up to a point i mean you know i dont want to sound arrogant or anything perish the thought lol said he kept wondering how he would be feeling now if instead of meeting merrily watkins again hed spent last night in moons barn in moons futon but it hadnt worked out like that and he was so glad merrily lay awake tasting the formless dregs of a dream with the feeling of something wrong of loneliness and the recurrent domestic agoraphobia of two small women sharing seven bedrooms youre never really alone you know how often had she said that to a bereaved parishioner whichever way you looked at him god was never another warm body in a cold bed on a winters night the luminous clock indicated pm time to leave for evensong except theyd dropped it last september because so few people liked turning out in winter darkness she remembered the essence of her dream oh god an image of the lithe and tawny val hunter astride mick under some high moulded ceiling with all the lights on merrily standing in the doorway shocked to find herself wearing a very short black nightie cold legs cold feet come on merrily the bishop had shouted impatiently dont be nervous this is a time of transition we have to experiment the kingsize bed a fourposter had shiny purple sheets but that confrontation under the aumbry light now seemed no less unlikely than the dream of the purple sheets merrily slid out of bed downstairs there was no sign of jane ethel eyed her sleepily from the basket beside the aga as merrily made herself some coffee she thought of the night lol had first arrived with ethel after the cat had been savagely kicked by a drunk theyd examined her on the kitchen table just there where a note lay neatly printed from the computer mum rowenna turned up didnt want to wake you so left machine on back by ten swear to god heres list of phone calls so far emily price from old barn lane wanting to firmup a date for wedding rehearsal uncle ted in churchwarden mode didnt say what it was about probably usual pep talk about not neglecting parish for glamour of hereford sister cullen can you ring her at home thats it love j eileen cullen said dont worry the auld fellers not gone yet i was thinking of visiting him is he allowed visitors cullen laughed well its funny you should say that merrily mr dobbs has had a visitor thats why i called you i thought youd maybe want to know just the one visitor someone i know youll be on your own if you do youre going to spin this one out arent you all right cullen said ill tell you first off i wasnt there young tessa was there you remember tessa sundayschool teacher the plucky kid holding denzils other hand i remember like you could forget anybody there that night this afternoon all right a man in an overcoat carrying an attache case a minister he says come to pray with mr dobbs but mr dobbs cant speak tessa tells him doesnt matter the priest says they would like some peace and quiet and nobody coming in what was his name he didnt give his name i told you dobbs was in another wee side ward all on his own well the priests drawn the curtain across the glass in the door except its not possible to block the window fully if youre nosy enough you can stand on a chair and look down through the top which tessa did after she caught the light from the candles candles were always a bit careful the range of religious fellers show up these days and all quite legit you know only sister millers on her break and tessas a wee bit unsure about this so she takes a peep hed about finished by then so he had he was picking up his wee bottles of holy water scrubbing out his chalk circle chalk circle merrily sat down hard at the scullery desk me telling you like this it sounds like a joke but the child was terrified hed drawn a circle round the bed if you please yellow chalk making a bit of extra room by pushing the visitors chair under the door handle the cheeky sod so anyoned have a job getting in even if they wanted to and some bottles of water with stoppers placed around the circle he also had a black book very eerie very frightening what did she do went to find sister miller time the two of them got back your man had gone she rang me here during her break well merrily drew erratic circles on a pad im lost i dont understand this all i can say is that i was raised a catholic and it isnt one of our things our rituals doesnt even seem like proper religion eileen more like magic you sure this was a real priest i didnt see him tessa says he was wearing a dogcollar he had a hat and scarf so she couldnt see much of his face did they check dobbs over after hed gone no change he lies there still as corpse so he does sometimes his eyesll be open but you never see it happen whatll we do call the police you reckon i dont know what the police could do to be honest but if he shows up again would you mind calling me merrily cullen said if its me thats on when he shows ill be on to you before the divils got both feet on the blessed ward at all edict monday morning and jane felt good which was rare she lay and watched for the dawn shed seen like hundreds of dawns from here now her bed facing the east window this was not brilliant feng shui wise but you did get to see the sun come up over the wooded hill and that was seriously important today jane replayed last nights encounter still amazed at how cool sorrel had been inviting her and rowenna over at once to talk about it all jane calling rowenna and ro saying look better not tell them were still at school these people worry about parents finding out and making a fuss that was cool so they were office working girls sorrel who looked about mums age had with her an elderly woman called patricia who was kind of the head of the group and was obviously a really heavy person and had quizzed them in this really soft knowing voice how important is it to you to find the path within yourself are you ready for so much hard work at a time when most girls your age are out having fun that made you think you could spend years in search of enlightenment and still wind up disillusioned at forty or something the answer was give it six months and then if it wasnt working for you let it go no sign of dawn and it was getting on for seven mum was probably up already because yes mum was meeting lol later in hereford she didnt know what the meeting was about and why it was so early but that didnt matter their meeting was still a major coup for mystic jane who had set the whole thing up the other night classic when you thought about it lol taking merrily in from the cold offering her sanctuary just like shed done for him that time mum still very big on the sanctuary concept like with all those hookers she tried to rescue when she was a curate in liverpool it would be really good to have lol around again so cool in his vulnerable nervous way this moon she was entirely wrong for him you could tell just by watching her in the shop that she was remote and selfobsessed so ok she was beautiful and about ten years younger than mum but mum was still sexy well she could be sexy if she wanted to if the bloody church or if theyd met way back mum in her goth frock and her siouxie sioux makeup lol unhappily on the road with his band hazey jane you seemed to go all tightened up and inhibited when you got older especially when you had your whole life hijacked by the church the dogcollar it was like some sick masochism trip the punks used to wear actual dogcollars had mum once been into bondage gear and was that a natural progression to clerical costume jane was just picturing mum in the pulpit in her sunday surplice and half a potful of coalblack mascara when she became aware of the frozen night sky at last beginning to brown with heat from the east patricia said you were supposed to wait for the big orb itself but like what if it didnt show until you were on the school bus or something she scrambled out of bed and walked slowly to the eastfacing window and opened it as wide as it would go it was absolutely bloody freezing well good jane steeled herself and flung her arms wide now her first exercise she had the words patricia had given them written out on the back of an old birthday card all ready balanced on the window ledge she pictured rowenna standing at her own window in the big modern house in credenhill jane hadnt yet visited she pictured patricia and sorrel sisters kind of ok she took a mouthful of cold air and coughed then she looked into the sandy sky and read aloud from the card hail to thee eternal spiritual sun whose symbol now rises in the heavens hail to thee from the abodes of morning jane lowered her arms and stayed silent by tomorrow she wouldnt need the card she was on the path this time she was going to do it right merrily dumped her waxed jacket on a front pew and went to kneel in the chancel before her the altar was a hazygrey block under a stainedglass window its colours still sleeping she hadnt switched on the lamps or even lit a candle unlocking the church shed thought what a shame it was to have to restrict the house of god to not much more than normal working hours ted wanted to lock it up at five each evening but merrily was insisting on seven at least even if she then had to go along with her own keys a church should really be offering sanctuary around the clock perhaps you could employ a sympathetic security patrol to filter out the vandals try getting that one past the parish council enough merrily kneeled in silence for maybe ten minutes letting thoughts drift away and then began her voice was hesitant but steady she kept it low christ be with me christ within me christ behind me christ and who else a story in the church times last week had revealed two more attacks one of them sexual on women priests in their own churches but you couldnt wrap yourself in cottonwool like some religious statuette equally shed seen with the denzil joy incident the potential dangers of not protecting yourself before you went out on a case and there was a lot about this moon business she didnt like obsession for a start was always dangerous shed called lol last night while jane was out to get some more background she didnt like the idea of that newly displayed photograph of the dead father in a room full of iron age relics there was the possibility that this woman was drawing down pagan celtic elements she would not be able to deal with lol was right it was necessary to go to the location on this one to try to see it through moons eyes but if there was something there some lurking presence from way way back would merrily be able to sense it while at the same time keeping it out i bind unto myself the name the strong name of the trinity by invocation of the same the three in one and one in three pippop the green tubes ejecting from the nostrils of dying denzil joy pippop merrily cringed stop she opened and closed her eyes and pulled the folds of blue and gold around her start again christ be with me christ within me but merrilys visit with lol to moons barn was not going to happen something appalling already had something she could not ignore jane took the call while merrily was making breakfast its some really nasty officioussounding bastard not so loud merrily took it on the cordless phone in the kitchen merrily watkins speaking this is major weston area organizer for the redundant churches fund i make no apologies for calling you before eight i find it ridiculous that i should have to call you at all i wanted the local man to deal with it bizarrely the local man tells me all matters of this nature have to be referred directly to you whats the problem major she wasnt aware that the redundant churches fund even had an area organizer desecration is the problem mrs watkins at the church of st cosmas and st damien at stretford do you know where that is vaguely i expect youll manage to find it the police already have for what theyre worth what kind of desecration what kind satanic desecration of course jane was furious you cant do this to lol whatever it was you promised him i have to its your job yeah yeah you know what i think i think youre empirebuilding flower its not me i didnt even know about this but apparently every vicar or rector or priestincharge in the diocese has received an edict from the bishops office to say that anything arising in their parishes possibly related to deliverance should be referred initially to me through the deliverance office naturally but this major westons obviously had an earful from a local vicar happy to wash his hands of it and so the majors made a special point of finding my home number and getting me up nice and early in the morning what can i do you dont have to go now i do have to go now theyve got to get the place cleaned up its a disused church supported by this charity but she was annoyed neither mick nor sophie had mentioned this memo going out to all the priests yes it did look like empirebuilding and whilst a few vicars would be secretly relieved the majority would resent it she would have resented it ill call lol she said strawberry ice the main road was a brown channel between banks of snow the cathedral usually seen at its most imposing from greyfriars bridge skulked uneasily in halflit mist beyond the bridge the car slid alarmingly towards the kerb where there was a pub called the treacle mine this was not promising the hill might still be a problem like the other night white hell then not ten minutes out of the city but the snow had lain undisturbed for longer dennys monster mitsubishi would for once have been useful dont even try the steep bit moon had said youll just get stuck i can walk down from here oh its hazardous out there moon snowblindness hypothermia lol the hills only five hundred and ninetyfive feet above sea level sometimes her humourvacuum was almost endearing ever since theyd left the shop moon in her green padded skijacket snuggling into his shoulder lol had been thinking i was wrong im crazy theres nothing weird going on all she needs is love anyway he couldnt stop now there was nowhere to turn the car around this morning with no further snow things were better someone must have been up the hill with a tractor perhaps even a snowplough he made it without too much revving and sliding as far as the little car park for visitors to the ancient camp the desolation of the day was getting to him hed been looking forward to bringing merrily up here but merrily couldnt make it second thoughts maybe about loopy moon and loopy lol too hed misunderstood her from the back of the car he pulled his wellies and his old army combat jacket the snow around here was untrodden lying in big drifts even where it hadnt drifted it was four five inches deep lol ploughed through the earth steps had disappeared becoming a deceptive white skirun lol stopped hed imagined the barn below would be winterpicturesque but it was like a short blackened toadstool under its snowswollen roof neglected and charmless most of its windows shrunken by snow on saturday night a gauzy moon had been nesting in the snowbent treetops and moon had walked across where the patch of garden would be and looked all around like she wanted to establish a memory of how the barn and the surrounding trees looked in their moonlit winter robes and lol had then thought this is it dick whispering in his ear you do find her attractive dont you think she doesnt fancy you oh i think she does old son i think she does and then denny i would do anything give anything to get her away from there meanwhile if shes not alone thats the best thing i could hope for under the circumstances lol crunched carefully down the long earthen steps it was fully light now or as light as it was going to get he knocked on the front door set into the glassedover barn bay long curtains drawn on either side there was no answer after a minute lol stepped back on to the snowshrouded garden and looked around a big man was striding out of a wall of conifers on the other side of the barn he stopped hello can i help im looking for kathy moon yes this is where she lives he had a high hearty voice not local he wore a shiny new green barbour and a matching cap im from the farm tim purefoy lol robinson im a friend of hers yes im sure shes spoken of you tim purefoy looked down at lol recognition dawning i know you were here helping katherine move in yes he ambled across to the glassedover barn bay squinting through a hole in the condensation bit odd shes usually up and about quite early cycles into town you know lol explained about driving moon home on saturday and the bike being still at the shop well i dont know what to say said mr purefoy gone for a stroll maybe perhaps she wanted to see what the hill was like under snow before it all vanished bit of a romantic about this hill as you probably know anyway cant be far away come and wait at the farmhouse if you like and have a coffee actually lol said i dont suppose i could use your phone its possible her brother got worried about her being up here in the blizzard maybe hes collected her no problem at all follow me tim purefoy beat his gloved hands together like midwinter already isnt it the dyn farmhouse was unexpectedly close no more than fifteen yards behind the tight row of leylandii it was these conifers that deprived the barn of its view but when you passed between them lol almost gasped they were standing on a wide white lawn sloping away to a line of low bushes which probably hid the road but it might as well have been a cliff edge below it the city a timeless vision in the mist startling isnt it tim purefoy folded his arms in satisfaction best view of hereford youll get from anywhere except from the ramparts of the hillfort itself the snow had made hereford an island and softened the outlines of its buildings so that the new merged colourlessly with the old and because the city had somehow been bypassed by the highrise revolution of the sixties and seventies it might all have been seventeenthcentury even medieval underneath it was both remote and intimate it made lol feel very strange see how the steeple of all saints is superimposed on the cathedral tower tim said knowledgeably thats one of alfred watkinss leylines an invisible mystical cable joining sacred sites a prehistoric path of power and were standing on it absolutely it goes very close to the house we had a chap over to dowse it the earthenergy theyre energy lines you know and spirit paths so were told no wonder this guy had taken to moon standing in the thin rain on the snowy lawn lol suddenly felt he could jump off and slide down that mystical cable from the hill to the steeple to the tower in the mist probably all nonsense tim purefoy said but at sunset you can feel you own the city come and have some coffee my friend lol shook himself the farmhouse was threestoreyed ruggedly rendered in white with lots of haphazard irregular mullioned windows it looked as old as the hill itself how could moon live out in that sunken treesmothered barn knowing her own family had lost this house and this view anna tim purefoy shouldered open the door of a wooden leanto porch on the side of the house coffee darling he held open the door for lol come in come in dont worry about the boots its a flagged floor and the place is a damn mess this morning anyway globular hanging lights were switched on in the vast farmhouse kitchen it was golden with antique pine and had an old creamcoloured doubleoven aga which seemed actually to be putting heat into the room like a furnace in fact lol felt almost oppressed by the sudden warmth one second the woman kneeling at the stove wore jeans and a sackclothcoloured apron tied over a long rainbow sweater her fair hair was efficiently bound up in a yellow silk scarf my wife anna tim purefoy pulled off his cap freeing springy whiteblond curls darling this chaps a friend of katherine who seems to have gone walkabout in the woods again oh gosh not untypical though anna purefoy closed an oven door sprang up patting floury hands on her apron im making bread one can buy a marvellous loaf at any one of a halfdozen places in town but one somehow feels obliged living in a house this old do you know what i mean lol nodded responsibility to the ancestors my god said tim this chap does know katherine its good to think someone does anna pulled out chairs from under a refectory table concern put lines into her face she was perhaps fifteen years older than shed first appeared dont interfere darling said tim with affection you know what we said about interfering my wifes lost unless she can find someone to worry about theres a loaf in here for katherine said anna left to herself shed go days without food oh nonsense anna his wife glared at him tim i have been in her kitchen and found the refrigerator absolutely bare while the girl sits there with all her books and her maps and her notes fascinating what shes doing of course and weve learned a lot by helping her but shes so obsessive isnt she i feel enormously guilty she thinks we twisted her arm to take on the barn tim pulled off his barbour revealing a thick and costly cowboy shirt and a silk cravat in fact she virtually twisted ours he focused narrowed eyes on lol you know the history i suppose lol nodded warily i er know about her father oooh anna hugged herself with a shiver speaking personally tim said i wouldnt want to live within a hundred miles of here under those particular circumstances but there we are telephones in the hall i say do take off your coat so you wont feel it so cold when you go outside again from the square oakpillared hall lol called the shop and got no answer then he called denny at home denny said angrily gone how can she be gone so you havent seen her i came to pick her up here what you mean came to pick her up lol said awkwardly denny theres theres nothing happening between moon and me there never has been denny was quiet for a few seconds then he said i dont believe this you gay laurence no then what the fuck i cant she sometimes goes in to see the idiots next door at the farm thats where im calling from and they havent seen her either they say she sometimes goes out for walks but i cant see any footprints im coming over denny said fucking stay there lol went back outside with both purefoys you er you still own the barn presumably oh yes anna said katherines indicated several times that shed like to buy it but were not awfully happy about that idea it is very near to the house and suppose she well suppose she had a change of heart or had to sell suddenly meaning lol guessed suppose she was removed by men in white coats anyone could buy it then couldnt they tim said and its awfully close to our house so you still have keys presumably well we do but wed never dream of going in without permission as i keep telling anna its not our place to interfere or to be over curious that is we try not to notice what were not supposed to notice what had moon been doing lol wondered how long the purefoys themselves would stay here once theyd got used to that view and over the novelty of homemade bread houses like this previously occupied by the same family for centuries might then change hands half a dozen times in the following twenty years it was hard to settle under the weight of someone elses tradition and costly too you bought a country residence for what seemed like peanuts compared with london and then you found out how much you had to spend just to keep it standing moon must have been a gift to them theyd probably run out of money halfway through converting the barn and bodged the rest very quickly once she came on the scene are you something to do with the little shop anna asked a scarlet parka now setting off her yellow scarf that place where katherine works me not exactly im just a friend of hers and of denny must be a busy man her brother tim said never seems to have time to visit her here lol tried knocking one more time harder in case she was still asleep ok if i go round the back and bang on one of the windows my dear chap whatever you want lol pushed through bushes at one corner behind the barn there was under snow what must be a small square of lawn up against a low bank it looked quite pretty like a cake with pink icing also like some exotic confection its design became more complex as he stared pink but pale brown in places where the thaw had already eroded the snow strawberry icecream in the middle sorbet round the edges up against the back wall made of rubblestone all it needed was a cherry in the middle lol thought in the wild surrealism of the moment the red woollen beret merrily used to wear that would do if you threw her beret into the centre of this lawn it would lodge lusciously in the soft wet pink snow like a cherry there was a jagged hole in the snow under the nozzle of a pipe poking out of the wall about eighteen inches above the ground theyd bodged the plumbing he thought that was the overflow from the bath and it should empty down into a drain oh god lol stood there remembering how completely moon had changed once theyd reached the door of the barn her voice becoming sharp like the night her eyes glittering like ice under the moon as she pulled out her keys she had been talking about dick lyden again and what a clown he was while separating a long black key and unlocking the door in the glass bay maybe not such a clown lol had thought at the time confidence had seemed to click into place the minute moon arrived back here the strength of the old settlement around her the child of the hill in dicks terms of reference a fantasy structure the way we create our destiny the way we form fate hed moved to follow her into the barn but shed turned in the doorway somehow stiffening shed said no moon ive changed my mind i dont want you to come in hed stepped back thank you moon had said once she had opened the door the darkness inside seemed to suck her in and thrust him away now when lol walked back round to the front of the barn he was shaking no luck old chap i think were going to need those keys mr purefoy lol said last long prayer the medieval church of st cosmas and st damien was almost part of a farmyard situated on the edge of a hamlet among windylooking fields in the north of the county not that far from main roads but merrily who thought she knew this county fairly well had been unaware of it the church was tiny the size of a small barn with a little timbered bellturret at one end st cosmas and st damien fourthcentury mediterranean saints said major weston connected with physicians and surgeons for some reason local doctors hold the occasional service here otherwise its disused absolute bloody tragedy one of all too many these days major powdered snow blew at merrilys legs call me nigel suggested major weston whose belligerence had dropped away the moment he saw her he was about sixty had a moist and petulant lower lip and a costly camel coat merrily followed him around the raised churchyard pine trees rearing grimly on its edge i think it was the bishop of lincoln the major said who warned that disused churches were now increasingly falling prey to satanism the message seems to be that if your people dont want them the devils only too happy to take them on its not that we dont want them i know i know but you dont do you otherwise my fund wouldnt exist we maintain nearly three hundred churches at present and the figures going up at an alarming rate now when you think what a comparatively tiny population england had when these lovely old buildings were erected yeah merrily said tell me about it they stopped outside the porch she saw that the single long gothic window in the wall beside it had an iron bar up the middle on one side lay the farm and some houses on the other a stones throw away if i was a satanist major i really dont think id feel too safe performing a black mass here you wouldnt be able to chant very loudly would you before somebody came in with a torch and a shotgun thats what the police said mustve been lunatics but then thats what they are arent they not normal these people beggars belief ive never met one id rather like to he peered at her would you by god just to try and find out why what theyve done in here may just change your mind ready to go in sure not squeamish are you lets hope not she followed him into the porch and he lifted the latch theres no lock there should be and there will be a new ones in the course of being made i believe perhaps these scum knew that meanwhile the church is left without a lock you cant just put any old lock on a building dating back to the twelfth century in you go mdear holding the door for her letting her go in first a gentleman ha it was dim and intimate no immediate echo none of that sense of higher authority you had in most cathedrals and big churches like her own at ledwardine it was in fact fascinating the church of st cosmas and st damien quartered by an arcade of stone and a wooden screen with a pulpit in the middle two short naves and what seemed to be two chancels with two altars although she could only see one from where she was standing a plain wooden table without a cloth against the far wall and close to the floor the stone effigies of a knight in armour and his lady shared that last long prayer merrily didnt move she was reminded of nowhere so much as the little stone celtic cell where shed had the vision of the blue and the gold and the lamplit path only the smell was different she knew the smells of old churches and they didnt usually include urine before tim purefoy was even back with his keys a big vehicle was roaring up to the barn bay sloshing through the wet snow the dull gold bullbarred mitsubishi spattered from wheels to windscreen with snowslicks and mud skidded to within a couple of feet of the glass wall denny moon slammed out looking once hard at the barn as though angry it was still there not burned out derelict toppled into rubble he wore an old leather jacket and a black baseball cap wraparound dark glasses like he feared snowblindness he took in the encircling trees and the overgrown leylandii hedge sucking air through his teeth fucking place lol walked nervously towards the car mr purefoys gone for his keys fuck that ill kick the door down denny gave him a black stare lol what is it what is it you know man we just need to get in look at you somethings scared you what is it tim purefoy appeared holding up a long key on an extended wire ring holding also two smaller ones at the same time his wife came round from the back of the barn she looked stricken call call the police she stammered better call the police denny gasped and snatched the keys the big room was brightened by snowlight from the highest window exposed trusses the colour of bone kathy denny bawled kathy the smell of candlewax blobs of it on the floor dennys head swivelled she sleep up there he made for the stairs to the loft he hadnt seen the lawn so he wouldnt know that what they really needed was the bathroom kathy two doors behind the stairs one ajar through which lol could see kitchen worktops and the edge of a cooker the other door shut lol opened it and went in into the square white bittersmelling metalsmelling bathroom quietly closing the door and snipping the catch sealing himself in with her like he should have done on saturday night resisting the hostile thrust of the barn when shed said i dont want you to come in his back against the door he saw first on the wall over the bath like an icon the photograph of a smiling man standing before a land rover on the rim of the bath were pebblesmooth shards of black pottery arranged in a line no sign he heard denny shout from upstairs sounding relieved almost optimistic because he hadnt found her dead in her futon lol saw the crusted brown tidemark on the porcelain around the overflow grille like sloppy dinner deposits around a babys mouth presumably a tap had been left running and the overflow had gulped it all down and regurgitated it on to the snowy lawn stopping only when the primitive water tank ran dry lol dennys feet descending the stairs whered he go it was dreamlike lol thought at first from the position of her the stillness of the tableau of ophelia in that sad famous preraphaelite painting the thin pine door bulged against him as denny tried to open it and then battered it with his fists making it vibrate against lols back until lol almost tripped and fell forward towards the bath and he cried out oh god seeing it now as it was graceless peaceless sorrowless nothing like ophelia who wouldnt have been naked or grinning like moon was grinning congealing in her stagnant pool of rich scummy pinkybrown cold water with eyes open like frosted glass and lips retracted over stiff ridged gums and sharp white teeth beautiful moon so defiantly disgusting now with her cunning secret bloodless grin and her bloodpickled fingers below her breasts on the waterline on the bloodline and the wrists ripped open not nice neat slits the skin was torn and ruched lol denny screamed and the pressure on lols back eased telling him denny was about to hurl himself against the door shed been here a long time you could tell this hadnt happened this morning or even last night this had to be saturday night maybe only hours after hed brought her home and meekly taken no for an answer almost gratefully because hed already had the sense of something dark and soiled he should have said moon there are things we have to talk about he should have said this long ago after the crow he should have gone long ago to merrily watkins swallowing his nausea he went closer and bent over the bath on the bottom between moons legs lay the eroded filelike blade ragged and blackened and scabby and old very old he remembered those slender but unexpectedly hardened hands fouled by crows blood and turned away and opened the door to denny id like to sleep now lol sad tosser sophie said was it very horrible it was actually its so utterly distressing sophies face creased into shadows i once read a book by a reformed satanist who said that when they break into a church and do appalling acts it has an almost intoxicating effect afterwards they feel a terrible elation almost sexual well merrily said by the very nature of what they are theyre not going to walk out feeling disgusted and nauseous are they sophie shuddered when shed gone merrily rang huw owen no reply no answering machine she thought about calling lol to rearrange that chance encounter with his troubled friend moon but then sophie came through again merrily its chief inspector howe on the line oh right ms watkins good morning ms watkins i er id like to consult you as an expert me indeed howe said heavens what seemed likely was that the superintendent after a lunch with the bishop had strongly suggested annie howe consult merrily over something anything howe would be disinclined as acting dci to make waves ms watkins sorry just swallowing one of the pills ive been prescribed for moments of overexcitement howe sighed perhaps we could meet i gather youve been cleaning up after devilworshippers blanket term annie im not convinced good thats what i wanted to discuss with you one oclock pub no ill come to your office annie howe said keeping it official hanging up sophie came back again the reverend owen now take it on my phone if you like i have to powder my nose it seemed that sophie didnt feel she was ready to hear about this incident in detail hard to get rid of the taste int it lass hard to lose the smell number twos as well not that i could detect but i didnt go prying into too many dark corners aye well your problem here huw said is deciding whether this is the real thing or just kids who think itd be fun to play at being satanists for an hour or so i thought you didnt get away with just playing at it in my experience you dont but lets not worry about poor little dabblers at this stage tell me again about the bird well it was had been a crow or a raven is there much difference i dont know it had been cut open and its entrails spread over the altar there are kind of twin chancels in this church but this was the real altar on the right two chancels side by side very unusual quite a special little place let me have a think merrily looked down from sophies window at white roofs on cars and people hurrying hereford people were essentially country folk and country folk had no great love for snow certainly not november snow never a good sign winter was supposed to settle in slowly what if this went on until march or april two chancels huw said they might see this as representing a dualism left and right darkness and light actually there was some blood on the other table too as if the sacrificed crow had been brought from one side to the other how do you know it was sacrificed i dont it would be nice nicer to think it was already dead and they just wanted to make a mess huw the way youre talking suggests you think this was the real thing its possible if it was the real thing what would be the motive what would they be after kicks a buzz power or biggest addiction of the lot the pursuit of knowledge nowt you wont do to feed your craving ordinary mortals expendable like cattle kindness and mercy waste of energy loves a drain faiths for feeble minds can you understand that to know is all can you get a handle on that no thats why im a christian working towards it anyway made it to the pious bitch stage mind a crow splattered over a country church that still has the touch of lowgrade headbangers what are you going to do about it major weston was asking for reconsecration i said that wasnt necessary as a consecrations for all time correct what you proposing instead a lesser exorcism do you think when i was thinking early evening if we could get some people together then i wouldnt like to think of the place getting snowed in before we could do it you want me to come over i couldnt ask you to do that give me directions huw said ill be there at five i cant keep leaning on you i like it huw said keeps me off the drink merrily smiled she saw annie howe in her white belted mac walking rapidly out of king street carrying a briefcase i suppose youve heard about dobbs aye any thoughts on that poor bugger thats it lets hope so huw said sophie pulled up an extra chair for howe and left them in her office the acting dci kept her mac on she hated informality my knowledge of police demarcations fairly negligible merrily said but arent you a bit senior to be investigating the minor desecration of a country church im not sure i am annie howe brought a tabloid newspaper from her case and placed it before merrily on sophies desk youve seen this i imagine a copy of last nights evening news the anchor story wye death man named oh this is the guy merrily had scarcely given it another thought all memories of that night were still dominated by denzil joy she scanned the text identified as yearold paul sayer from chepstow mr sayer had not been reported missing for over a week because his family understood he was on holiday abroad acting det chief inspector annie howe who is leading the investigation said we are very anxious to talk to anyone who may have seen mr sayer since november we believe he may have arrived in hereford by bus or train and no need to read the lot its mainly waffle his relatives arent going to talk and we ourselves have been rather economical with any information given out to the press arent you always need to know ms watkins howe said need to know let me tell you what we do know about sayer she brought out a folder containing photographs sophie fetching in coffee for them on a tray spotted one of them and made a choking noise would you mind howe stood up and shut the door on both sophie and the coffee i believe its known as the goat of mendes merrily said a colour photograph of what seemed to be a poster luridly demonic like the cover of a dinosaur heavymetal album from the eighties well return to that howe said but this is a photograph of paul sayer he may for all we know have been around the city for several days before he was killed he had a foxlike face the lower half almost a triangle no smile hair lank looked as if it would be greasy though his eyes were lifeless he was not dead in this picture passport photo annie howe unbelted her raincoat does look like him though recognize him merrily shook her head howe looked openly around the office merrily wished the d on the door was removable for occasions like this she felt selfconscious felt like a fraud howe smiled blandly her contactlensed eyes conveying an extremely subtle sneer youre like a little watchdog at the gate up here ms watkins look if youre not here specifically to arrest me how about you call me merrily actually the people i call by their first names tend to be the ones ive already arrested standard interviewroom technique but the suspects dont get to call you annie you might wonder if anyone did under the rank of superintendent she had such glacial dignity she was only thirtytwo merrily estimated the same age as the man pulled out of the wye paul sayer whose photo lay on the desk i expect youll get round to explaining what this poor guy has to do with the goat and me this poor guy said annie howe why do i suspect your sympathy may be shortlived he had er form none at all he was according to his surviving family a quiet decent cleanliving man who worked as a bank clerk in chepstow and lived in a terraced house on the edge of the town which was immaculately maintained he was unmarried but once engaged for three years to a young woman from stroud whos since emigrated to australia ill be talking to her tonight but one can guess why the relationship foundered merrily took out a cigarette do you mind its your office ill open the window why did the engagement fall through dont bother with the window ms watkins im paid to take risks well i suppose she must have seen his cellar cellar oh my god not a fred west situation lets not get too carried away this is it six more photographs all eight by ten all in colour although there wasnt much colour in that cellar christ merrily said so now you understand why im here howe turned one of the pictures around a wideangle taken from the top of the cellar steps is this your standard satanic temple then would you say ive never actually been in one but it looks well it looks like something inspired by old dracula films and dennis wheatley novels to be honest the altar howe said appears to have been put together from components acquired at garden centres in the vicinity reconstituted stone the wall posters of american origin probably obtained by mailorder we found some glossy magazines full of this stuff sad yes i admit i have a problem understanding the millions of people who seem to worship your own god but this how real are these people how genuine i dont know id be inclined to think the guy who built this temple is i may be wrong what my daughter would call a sad tosser but a dead tosser howe said and we have to consider that his death could be linked to his faith merrily examined a closeup of the altar whats the stain we wondered that but its only wine so no signs of blood sacrifice we havent finished there yet but no how did you find this setup we had to break through a very thick door with a very big lock the local boys were quite intrigued not that he appears to have broken any laws its all perfectly acceptable in the eyes of the law as you know makes you wonder why there are any laws left merrily said ive always thought christianity would become fashionable overnight if they started persecuting us again so howe gathered up the photos you arent very impressed by mr sayers evident commitment to his satanic majesty no more than i was by the sick bastards who spread a crow over a lovely little old church but yes thats the point in your opinion if we were to devote more personhours than we might normally do to catching the insects who dirtied this church which amounts to no more than wilful damage and possible cruelty to a wild bird which is unprovable might they be able to throw some light on the religious activities of mr sayer youre asking if theres a network in this area precisely ive no idea it is our intention to build up a file or database but im only just getting my feet under the table and nothing like that seems to exist at present my predecessor is not going to be saying an awful lot to anyone for quite a while from what i hear if ever im sorry about this merrily was desperate for another cigarette but unwilling to display weakness in front of howe who leaned back and looked pensive ms watkins whats your gut feeling my gut feeling is that although theres no obvious pattern theres something a bit odd going on i mean i was on a course for deliverance priests all of us were vicars rectors nobody does this fulltime thats the point we were told a diocesan exorcist might receive four five assignments in a year while you you want to see my appointments diary already plus two satanic links within a week yes you might find it worth following through on the stretford case i wonder if they ever return to the scene of the crime why do you ask im going back tonight to do what we call a minor exorcism interesting if theyre local they might not be able to resist turning up thats what i thought thank you ms watkins well be represented annie howe snapped her briefcase shut just one thing hmm could you make them christians who the coppers are you serious two reasons merrily said one is that if theyre not i cant let them in two a few extra devout bodies at an exorcism can only help i understand you understand ive never done one before have i family heirloom lol sat in the flat above church street moons capuchin lane he was waiting for denny hed been waiting for denny for several hours it was going dark again the shop below called john barleycorn had been closed all day denny had not yet said he was coming but lol knew that sooner or later he would have to it was anna purefoy who had found the photocopy about the same time that lol left the bathroom and denny went in and they heard him roar in his agony and outrage like a maddened bull it was mrs purefoy lol thought who in the choking aftermath of a tragedy that was all the more horrifying because it wasnt a surprise was the calmest of them is katherine dead lol had nodded still carrying an image of the encrusted overflow grille like the mouth of a vortex moons life sucked into it tim mrs purefoy had said then i think you should telephone the police from our house i dont think we should touch anything here and when tim had gone shed led lol to the telephone table by the side of the stairs i was about to phone for them myself and then i saw this her red parka creaked as she bent over the table did you know about this mr robinson it was a copy of a cutting from the hereford times dated november it took lol less than half a minute to make horrifying sense of it he was stunned did you know about it a mad question maybe would anybody knowing about this have bought the old house by then denny had emerged from the bathroom and was standing head bowed on the other side of the stairs after a moment he looked up wiped the back of a hand across his lips and shook his head savagely his earring jangling he didnt look at lol or mrs purefoy as he strode through the room and out of the barn the door swinging behind him you could hear his feet grinding snow to slush as he paced outside mrs purefoy said did you know her very well mr robinson not well enough obviously lol said no no i didnt know her well and then the police had arrived two constables after his first brief interview not much more than personal details lol had gone out on the hill while they were talking to denny and the purefoys he ascended the soggy earthsteps to the car freezing up with delayed horror a clogging of sorrow and shame backed up against a hundred questions hed waited by the barn with denny until they brought the body out hearing the splash and slap and gurgle and other sounds from the bathroom watching the utility coffin borne away to the postmortem and then he and denny had gone to hereford police headquarters where they were questioned separately by a uniformed sergeant and a detective constable statements were made and signed lol feeling numbed throughout he and denny had had no opportunity to talk in any kind of privacy the police had shown lol the old cutting from the hereford times and asked him if hed seen it before or if he was aware of the events decribed in the story lol had told them he knew it had happened but not like this hed always understood it had been a shotgun in the woods but he didnt remember how he had come to know that later the police let him read the item again in the absence of a suicide note they were obviously glad to have it it made their job so much easier ancient sword used by suicide farmer hereford farmer harry moon killed himself with a twothousandyearold family heirloom an inquest was told this week mr moon who had been forced to sell dyn farm on dinedor hill because of a failed business venture told his family he was going to take a last look around the farm before they moved out he was later found by his young son in a barn near the house lying in a stone cattle trough with both wrists cut dennis moon told hereford deputy coroner colin hurley how he found a teninch long sword an iron age relic lying on his fathers chest the sword had hung in the hall for as long as i can remember he said it was supposed to have been handed down from generation to generation a verdict of suicide while the balance of mind was disturbed was recorded on yearold mr moon who and when you left her at the door on saturday evening the sergeant said how would you describe miss moons state of mind kind of intense lol had said honestly intense how she was researching a book about her family i had the impression she couldnt wait to get back to it the sergeant had shaken his head not quite what hed expected to hear lol sat now in ethels old chair shadows gathering around him sometime tonight hed have to ring dick lyden most famous quote i realize youre a sensitive soul but you dont particularly need to think about psychology when youre shagging someone do you he couldnt face it just before fourthirty pm he heard a key in the lock and then dennys footsteps on the stairs it had been merrilys plan to spend an hour meditating in ledwardine church before driving nearly twenty miles to meet huw at the church of st cosmas and st damien but shed been waylaid in the porch by uncle ted in heavy churchwarden mode where on earth have you been i tried to ring your socalled office engaged engaged engaged its not good enough merrily ted ive just spent nearly two hours trying to put together a small congregation that absolutely nobody wants to join i have one hour to get myself together and then ive got to go out again im sorry merrily but if you havent got time for your own church then ted she backed away from him i really dont want to go into this now whatever it is ok can we talk in the morning it was not too dark to see his plump smooth retired face changing colour were you here this morning someone thought they saw you early yes god was that only today what time i dont know sevenish maybe what did you notice anything amiss i just went up to the chancel to pray dont say yes someone broke in someone broke into your church last night oh god she thought at once of a dead crow and a smell of piss what did they do smashed a window oh no come and look she followed him into the church where the lights were on and they turned left into the vestry where she saw that the bulb had been smashed in its shade and a big piece of hardboard covered the window facing the orchard the vestry thank god for that no stained glass there did they take anything no but thats not the point is it no blood no entrails no urine merrily took the opportunity to fumble her way to the wardrobe and pull out her vestments on their hangers shed have to change at home now have you told the police of course we did not that they took much interest i suppose if nothing was taken look im sorry ted ill have to take a proper look round tomorrow i have to tell jane where im going and where are you going i have to conduct a service over at stretford near dilwyn this damned deliverance twaddle again i suppose he said contemptuously youre on a damned slippery slope merrily dennys speech his whole manner had slowed down like somebody had unplugged him lol thought or stopped his medication denny seemed ten years older his oversized earring now looked absurd you see dad hed bought this house for us to move to when he sold the farm at tupsley right on the edge of the city denny had the chair lol was on the floor by the brickedup fireplace a parchmentshaded reading lamp was on far too bloody close that house denny said christ i used to wonder didnt he ever think about that how mum was gonna be able to handle living around here with his suicide hanging over us the whole family tainted with it everybody talking about us the selfish bastard lol thought of that smiling man with the land rover who threw a shadow twentyfive years long denny lit up a silk cut from a full packet merrily had left behind so after he died we flogged the tupsley house sharpish and moved over to the first place we could find in gloucester we had relatives there see and nobody there to blab to little kathy about what had happened like kids wouldve done if wed still been in town whispers in the schoolyard jesus we never talked about it it never got mentioned in our house let alone how it happened if some bloody old auntie ever let it slip ma would go loopy for days after and me shes watching me all the time in case im developing the symptoms of what schizophrenia lol sensed denny moons personal fears of inheriting some fatal family flaw some sick gene denny keeping the anxiety well flattened under years of bluster laughter and general loudness so we when kathys five or six and starting to ask questions like how come she didnt have an old man we told her it was an accident his gun went off in the woods no big deal she never remembered him anyway when she was older twelve maybe i broke it to her that he topped himself and why but i stuck with the gun you know why cause i knew shed make me tell her what it was like finding him what he looked like in that trough like one of them stone coffins you find around old churches yes lol found himself nodding remembering the photo of moon in the cathedral close charnel pit gleefully holding up two ruined medieval skulls like shed been reunited with old friends so happy so at home with images of death reaching out to the image of her dead father feverish eyes under the flat cap she thought he might have been wearing when he shot himself sick denny threw him a grateful glance i was fifteen all you can do with a memory like that is burn it out of your mind like they used to do with the stump when you lost an arm in some battle so she leaves school goes off to university in bristol i get the first shop inherited mums side i come back to hereford i meet maggie you know the rest it never occurred to you shed find out one day why denny croaked why should she all those years ago how many people remember anyway it was over and how could i ever have imagined in any kind of worstcase scenario that she was gonna rent this place the same fucking barn what kind of impossible nightmare coincidence is that i was amazed its still here like whod want to live at a house with that abattoir right next door somebody obviously tried hard to keep the barn out of view lol thought of the wall of fastgrowing leylandii planted there presumably by the people whod bought dyn farm from harry moon or by the owners after that out of sight out of mind out of nightmares and the purefoys were incomers how would they know stupid gits you lol hesitated you didnt think of telling her before she moved in and what do you think that wouldve achieved laurence you think that wouldve put her off denny produced wild synthetic laughter her poor bloody denny who wanted to burn away his own last image of harry moon like cauterizing a stump terrified of what might happen if he came up here and it all crashed back on him so hed simply stayed away paying dick to look out for his sister and both of them laying it on lol wanting lol to get close move in with her lol imagined what merrily would say about this a situation so unbelievably flawed and precarious that only men could have allowed it to develop and in a way that was right but lol could see dennys skewed logic why hed gone to dick lyden instead of a real psychiatrist and to dick rather than ruth a guy he knew from the pub a mate nothing formal someone he could talk to without having to tell all hes an idiot moon had said that paper denny said that copy of the times it never even came into our house you know anything about this how she got hold of it lol shook his head first time ive seen it i dont know did somebody give it to her was she going back through the old newspaper files part of her research and came across it that way and just laid it out there on the table where the purefoy woman found it had it all worked out didnt she so bloody happy to join the father she couldnt even remember denny began to cry happy you think she was happy some psychologist lol thought maybe even dick in his paper for psychology today might draw a flawed parallel with the heavens gate masssuicides all those people in san diego who came to believe they could hitch a ride on the hale bopp comet i never understood her lol said and always just a little repelled all down to me denny said his voice flat and dry like cardboard its all going down to me she suddenly learns i lied to her all those years ago thats what theyre gonna say and that fucking sword and the bath you know where that bath is dont you he sprang up fists clenched at his sides that was exactly where the mangers were for winter feed and water exactly lol felt cold inside that stone trough it was where the bath is now id swear to it they probably used the same holes for the fucking pipes and the sword that fucking sword man i want to scream it is not possible she said she dug it up where just outside somebody had been trying to dig a pond and given up and she saw this thing sticking out where the ground had been excavated unless she knew all the time about what your father really did theres no way she would have just found this thing and made that connection nooo denny leapt up threw his cigarette on to the hearth you dont understand do you the police after the inquest they asked if we wanted it back the fucking family heirloom the thing hed specially sharpened on the old scythe stone so itd go through f flesh and veins without much sawing lol thought about the blackened relic she must have sharpened that too must have honed the edge testing it on her thumb maybe rehearsing you didnt slash your wrists sideways you cut upwards into the vein a fellow patient in the psychiatric hospital had told lol that and warm water to prevent muscle cramps and stop the blood clotting dreamy otherworldly unstable moon hadnt done a thing wrong police said what did we wanna do with it this valuable antique so i took it ma was in no state at the time never would be again so i took it ma signs for it never knew what she was signing for i was sixteen by then big man taking charge i knew what to do with it i wrapped it up in some newspaper stuffed it in my bike bag brought it up here back to the old farm come up on the bike early one morning and buried the fucker you buried it and then many years later my poor little mental sister comes along and digs it up the same blade denny hissed it defies fucking belief you dont know that lol leapt up aghast you cant possibly know that dont know it it was on our wall for i dunno for centuries thats why i knew kathy wasnt talking total crap about us being in this direct line to the old celtic village my grandad when i was little he told me that artefactd been in the family for two thousand years sounds balls dont it what familys been two thousand years in the same spot where did you bury it in the shit a short bitter laugh there was this kind of slurry pit in front of here in those days i dug down to the bottom of it i put the sword in the shit it all fitted so well perhaps the purefoys or their predecessors had found the old pit thought it was the site of a pond so dug down and when no water came up they abandoned it it all fitted so horribly well you tell the police it was the same sword they never asked they knew shed dug up all this stuff far as theyre concerned she was just obsessed with dads suicide theyre not connecting it beyond an obsession if you were the police would you wanner know all this shit about the ancestors would you want a hint of anything denny drew breath and bit his lower lip anything paranormal you think that sometimes denny said its the least complicated option she said it was telling her things lol said she wouldnt even let me touch it she said she didnt want the flow blocked by anyone elses vibrations madness denny said lets just call it madness lol stood up and moved to the window looked down into capuchin lane snow now in rags against the house walls after a day of shoppers shoes she just wanted to think she was in almost physical contact with her ancestors shes with the primitive fuckers now denny said sourly protect her this night the day after tomorrow it would be december amidst frozen fields the church of st cosmas and st damien a small candleshimmer behind its leaded windows looked peaceful in a humblestableatbethlehem way or so she told herself another attempt to dispel the fear always make time to prepare huw would say all the time shed made shed blown an hour fending off ted clowes who saw himself as her laysupervisor who was always credited with getting merrily the ledwardine living to ease the worries of her mother his sister in cheltenham who was convinced that it was only a matter of time before any female curate in liverpool was found raped and battered in the churchyard ted would also dump her without a qualm if anything began reflecting badly on himself i think hed told her before they finally parted tonight that this parish is beginning to realize precisely where it stands with you merrily and she knew that this time hed cause trouble perhaps a discreet call to the archdeacon a question at the parish council which would be recorded in the minutes it had left her less than an hour to see to the blessing and bottling of the water and to explain to jane where she was going and why jane who would be more than a bit interested could not come the truth was if there was anything in there she didnt want jane exposed to it kids her age were easy prey it might even have been kids janes age who were behind the desecration but jane seemed unconcerned said that was ok as she was going out anyway to see a movie in hereford with rowenna hardly for the first time as she parked the volvo at the side of the track next to a suzuki fourwheel drive and a muddied mondeo merrily wondered why jane did not have a boyfriend she went round the boot to fetch her case containing the bibles the prayer books the rites of blessing and lesser exorcism that shed handcopied on to cards and the holy water she was freezing shed changed into her vestments before leaving so now she put on her cowled clerical cloak of heavyweight loden but it did nothing for the cold inside lights shone from the cottages the church however was in darkness no candlelight visible from this side she saw figures waiting for her at the edge of the churchyard ds bliss he shone a torch upwards to his own gingertopped face franny bliss merseyside accent im a catholic you all right with that vicar thats fine im merrily i know seen your piccy in the local rag this big yobbos pc dave jones nonconformist him what was that bloody chapel of yours again dave pisgah sarge pisgah chapel pc jones was in plain clothes dark anorak and a flat cap not been back in years mind i just love to hear him say it bliss said now just sos you know merrily weve gor another lad hanging out by the farm we dont talk about him many years lapsed thats why he gets to stay in the cold anyway were the best the dci could put together in the time where do you want us i dont know how you want to handle it merrily stood on the parapet surrounding the churchyard looking out at the bare fields gleaming silver under a sizable moon the wind plucked at her cloak this could be a wildgoose chase for you like most of our nights that is said bulky dave merrily gathered the cloak around her she was scared and had been since changing into her priestly things under her cloak the cassock had begun to feel clammy the surplice stiff for a start who else knows about this franny bliss asked well i told major weston and made a courtesy call to my colleague at dilwyn left a message on his machine anyway i also rang the farm here and got the numbers of about half a dozen people living in the area giving them the opportunity to come along if they felt strongly about it or if they fancied watching an exorcism merrily sighed unfortunately yes but i said the number allowed inside the church would be limited and definitely no children would it be all right if we talked to a few of the locals in areas like this people hear things afterwards though well ask them to hang on and well pay particular attention to anyone who doesnt want to i do feel quite strongly about it meself its only wilful damage but if they can do this theyre capable of a lot of other stuff carrying stiffer sentences you know what i mean i had a chat with inspector howe and your bishops had a chat with our divisional super its about community relations at the highest level ah im sorry about that the bishop had been hard to pin down and tonights ceremony had in the end been cleared with him on his mobile via sophie not that we wouldnt be here anyway franny bliss said but maybe not three of us still get these lads and even if we dont get a line on the body in the wye we might get something else might get possessed sarge pc jones said heavily merrilyll protect us dave wont yer merrily there was nothing essentially wrong with christianity patricia said it promoted a useful if simplistic moral code but it was an import when it was introduced it was revolutionary and brash and sometimes brutal and crass it trampled over ancient wisdom jane saw rowennas glance none of the rest of the group knew her mother was a vicar they thought she was a teacher and they thought jane was eighteen and working as a secretary blinds were down over the window a small brass oil lamp burned on a high table seven of them sat in a vague semicircle around patricia on mats and darkcoloured pillows there was a faint scent mustysweet perhaps from the oil in the lamp it was mysterious but also cosy and christianity has always been used as a prop for prejudices patricia continued creating the myth of the clovenhoofed devil and demonizing black cats which were tortured and slaughtered in their hundreds jane thought about ethel and seethed so many of these things are forgotten now patricia said patricia had the look of someone much older than she possibly could be someone whod been soaking up wisdom for like centuries she was the elder of the circle and the others deferred to her jane wasnt sure how many others there were in the group they came from a wide area on both sides of the welsh border all women a couple of oldhippy types long skirts and braided hair but mainly the kind you thought of as schoolteacherish thank heavens none of their own teachers were here she and rowenna were the youngest the women called themselves the pod after the cafe itself patricia was saying its the basis of many of our exercises that human beings are the central nervous system of the earth thus we can receive impulses and also send them out we can effect changes with our minds and this is a responsibility not to be taken lightly that was the definition of magic wasnt it effecting change with the mind mums lot would say that only god could effect changes which from where jane was sitting was bollocks basically all this serving the will of god stuff like the wholesale slaughter of black cats the spanish inquisition but was the pod a pagan thing because ok she was entitled to find her own spiritual path but it would be better if it was like parallel to mums she wasnt particularly looking for confrontation and heavyduty domestic strife she just wished someone would explain simple things like that its about consciousness patricia looked suddenly at jane as if shed picked up her thoughts her uncertainty jane shivered she was a little scared of patricia with her smokygrey dress and her tight parchmentcoloured hair she wanted to ask exactly what patricia meant by consciousness but this was only their second meeting and she didnt want to seem stupid the nature of consciousness was something on which shed be expected to meditate she was establishing a special corner for that in her sittingroomstudy next to a big yellow rectangle on one of the mondrian walls shed bought a little incenseburner but hadnt used it yet it was all a little bit frightening therefore naturally wonderful jane glanced up patricia was looking directly at her in the gloom patricias eyes burned like tiny torchbulbs jane gulped suddenly panicked christ shed been rumbled theyd found out that her mother was an anglican priest they thought she was some sort of church spy she looked across at rowenna but rowenna was staring away into the darkness the others were gazing placidly down into their laps she didnt really know any of them angela the tarot lady had not been present at either of the meetings jane had expected all kinds of questions before she was admitted to the circle but it hadnt been like that it was only when you got here and experienced the electric atmosphere as if this little room was the entrance to an endless tunnel that you instinctively wanted to keep quiet about yourself at least you did if your old lady was a vicar dont worry jane patricia said suddenly were here to help you the woman smiled thinly the wind whined in the rafters and the flame of the oil lamp shrank back as though it was cowering cool the church was now lit by two oil lamps supported on brackets three candles and a hurricane lantern on the central pulpit it looked deceptively cosy huw owen was there with a curlyhaired juttingjawed youngish minister who backed away from merrily in her cloak as if she was a vampire throwing up his hands in mock defence mrs watkins i beg forgiveness from me im jeffrey kimball from dilwyn major weston approached me this morning to perform the necessary and im afraid i threw a tantrum and gave him your home number which i looked up in the telephone book it was pure pique on my part after that memorandum from the bishop on the subject of deliverance and im sorry to have taken it out on you i can understand your to be quite honest mrs watkins i tend to object to more or less anything this particular bishop does i do so hate blatantly political appointments of any kind absolutely everyone thought hereford should have gone to tom armstrong a canon at the cathedral for five years before he went to reading as dean immensely able man and they used a very minor heart problem as an excuse to give it to hunter i make no secret of my feelings and i realize you happen you can save that till after lad huw owen said oh the rev kimball let his arms fall to his sides yes of course i should have thought merrily needs a bit of quiet huw said yes i shall leave you alone and go out to contemplate the moonlight on the snow aye give us quarter of an hour theres a good lad i know his type huw said as the latch dropped into place behind kimball gets to the age when the bishops are looking younger how are you lass she hugged huw it was the first time theyd been together since the deliverance course he wore what looked like an airforce greatcoat and a yellow bobblehat you all right for this merrily sure she looked around sniffed the air could only smell disinfectant who cleared it up huw asked i did couldnt ask anybody else could i buried the remains just over the wall little ceremony hands and knees wi a scrubbing brush eh what you got in mind for tonight were looking at minor exorcism never go over the top a cleansing holy water go right round it i would take one of them coppers with you never had a copper at one of mine right make a start you want to pray together first that would be good they sat side by side on the pew nearest the pulpit ill keep it simple huw said then well have a bit of quiet lord be with us in this tainted place tonight help this lass merrily to repossess it in your name from whatever dark shadows may still hang around it protect her this night amen amen merrily added and during the ensuing period of quiet she felt nothing at first when she closed her eyes she saw neither the blue nor the gold nor the lamplit path she saw nothing but a swirling grey untinged by the lamps and the candles she was not comfortable on the strange sloping pew found she was squirming a bit her cassock feeling clammy again she was actually sweating she felt damp down her spine come on calm down she undid the cloak let it slip from her shoulders opened her eyes but lowered the lids letting them relax shifted position again and was aware of huws brief sideways glance lamplight flushed the sandstone faces of the knight and his lady raised only inches above the floor to her left they were believed she now knew to be john and agnes de la bere the de la beres were lords of the manor for much of the middle ages john wore armour and carried a shield his wife was gowned and wimpled slim and girlishly pretty another knight probably johns father robert lay in the subchancel in front with his wife margaret some effigies were terrifying but these were courtly and benign and truthful john de la bere was stocky had narrow eyes and a big nose in other words she felt ok about them and about the church so why was she so uneasy she closed her eyes again pressed her hands formally together like the hands of john and agnes de la bere and murmured st patricks breastplate in her mind she smelled the pine disinfectant shed borrowed from the farm and ignored the slowburning itch which occurred in the palm of her left hand and then the right as though transmitted from one to the other huw was watching her openly now she was absolutely desperate for a smoke she shifted again the itch in her hands was worse she couldnt ignore it had to concentrate hard to stop herself pulling her hands apart and rubbing her palms on the edge of the pew when she could bear it no longer and yearned for relief she was at last given some help scritchscratch the tiny birdclaw the curling nail on a yellow finger the smell of disinfectant had grown sweet and rancid and was pulled into her nostrils like thin string and down into her throat cat faeces and gangrene a rough cough came up like vomit merrily began to cough and cough and couldnt stop she folded up on the pew arms flailing eyes streaming she felt huws arms around her heard him praying frantically under his breath clutching her to him and still she couldnt stop coughing and slid down his legs to the stone floor and he pulled away from her and she heard him scrabbling about drink he said urgently then a hard ring of glass pushing at her lips chinking on her teeth she gripped it and sucked and huw held it there merrily fell back against the pew holy water dribbling down her chin the lamps and candles blurring into a blaze huw brought her gently to her feet and put her cloak around her shoulders out of here lass he said mildly dont come back eh crone with a toad lol saw that dick lyden had become aware of deep waters and was now backing into the paddling area dick poured glenmorangie for lol and himself he still looked shaken not terribly upset exactly more like unnerved almost certainly this was the first time a client of his had taken her own life an unexpected minefield then psychotherapy dick sat down behind his desk lamp some artdeco thing with a cold blue shade it created distance and the police lol the police are saying what keeping the lid on it no crime no guilty parties probably doing their best to disregard the bizarre bits dick had finally got through on the phone demanding lol should come round at once needing to know for his peace of mind and his professional security everything that had happened and how it might rebound on him this was no longer jolly old dick revelling in his newfound status as analyst delightedly knitting strands of experience together into some stupid woolly jumper lol said as i understand it they dont particularly want to know if its the same sword basically thats quite understandable a suicide is not a murder this this wristcutting is still not uncommon i gather in an age of subtler methods not a difficult way to go more distressing perhaps for whoever finds the body and the weapon an important symbol for moon no doubt under the regrettable circumstances but irrelevant as far as the police are concerned but what the hell was denny doing sitting on this information would i have supported her plan to move into that place if id known her father had done it in that actual same whens the inquest meaning will i be called what am i going to say going to be opened tomorrow but thats just so denny can give formal identification of the body and they can release her for burial itll then be adjourned for weeks maybe months while they put the medical evidence together they havent been to see me yet maybe you dont matter dick lol said coldly hed hate to think that dick was counting on the inquest being economical with the facts so thered be more unpublicized material available for his own psychological paper on moons case hed really hate to think that but the inquest was going to get it all wrong wasnt it just that lol couldnt see through to the truth either look ahm dick leaned back well behind his blue lamp lol i dont want you to blame yourself for this you tried to get close to her and it didnt work out perhaps that was a mistake but well never know we must accept well never know and and and let it go a subtle restructuring of history here like it had been lols sole decision to try to get close to moon with dicks tentative guarded approval well dick stood up thanks for coming over ahm this wont affect the boys recording will it denny well obviously something creative to occupy his mind tuneless little twats with fender strats im sure its exactly what he needs said lol good man dick said the boy you see the boys been very difficult and uncommunicative and when he does communicate its with an unpleasant teenage sneer goes out every night now pushing it as far as he can get when hes not with his band hes with some girl some girls got her hooks into him so i would rather he was with the band in dennys studio at least until after sunday why sunday his enthronement as boy bishop in the cathedral during evensong by the actual bishop and before a packed cathedral just lets get that over with you still think he might back out right not if the little shit knows whats good for him dick said through his teeth then he laughed at his own venom look lol moon was ill more ill than any of us knew delusional shouldnt have been on her own there were all to blame for that denny you ah me and the health service all im saying the police are right lets not overcomplicate things or see things that might not be there thats how myths are created right lol said a small fury ignited inside him good man dick clapped him on the shoulder it was thawing at last clouds crowded the moon as lol crossed the main road towards the refashioned ruins of the city wall this cd would be his last work for dick lyden he hadnt been to his psychology nightclass for over a fortnight the city wall glistened in the moonlight so the version of moons death which the inquest would establish would be untrue the verdict unless the postmortem threw up something unexpected would be a straightforward suicide while the balance of mind was disturbed and no blindingly obvious warnings from the coroner afterwards there was nothing anyone else would learn from this and when you left her at the door on saturday evening how would you describe miss moons state of mind kind of intense she was researching a book about her family i had the impression she couldnt wait to get back to it it was true when hed left her there was no indication at all that she might if you were the police denny had said would you want a hint of anything paranormal why had denny said that it was the first time hed ever mentioned the paranormal in connection with moon or indeed any connection at all but how well did he really know denny only well enough to know now that denny had been putting up a front to conceal unvoiced fears perhaps if hed told denny rather than dick about the crow and about moon seeing her father oh hell lol stood on the medieval bridge gazing over the parapet into the wye numbed by a quiet panic he didnt know what to do which street to go down directionless working with dick while it hadnt felt exactly right at least had been a new rope to hold on to very soon he would reach the main road again having walked in a complete circle he felt like some aimless vagrant or worse closer to the truth a mental patient returned to the care of the community he turned abruptly moved back up bridge street past the offlicence and peter bells typewriter shop the snow on the pavement reduced to slivers of slush two young women walked out of a darkened doorway about five yards ahead of him and he saw by an allnightlighted shopfront that one of them was jane watkins perhaps she noticed him she turned sharply away and hurried on slightly ahead of her companion the doorway belonged to pods a healthfood cafe hed been in there just once it was dark and primitive and woody with secondhand tables and rickety chairs people who opened healthfood restaurants were into recycling and no frills on the whitewashed walls in thin black frames he remembered were reproductions of drawings by mervyn peake twisted figures spindly figures bulbous figures in gloomy landscapes lol recalled eating a soyasausage roll under one showing a crone with a toad he hadnt stayed long when she got in she put out some food for ethel and went up to the bathroom which was still like a s public lavatory with black and white tiles and a shower the size of an iron streetlamp she sat on the lavatory head in hands her stomach churning she heard janes key turn in the door but it was quite a while before merrily could go down youre ill jane said looking up from the omelette mix in the pan the sight of the yellow slop made merrily want to throw up she shivered damply inside her dressinggown im sorry flower i cant eat anything im really sorry id better stay off school tomorrow and look after you jane said promptly if youre no better by then no thank you i mean certainly not how long have you been in not long merrily leaned against the aga rail next to her daughter how did it go all right i think did you feel ill then yes in fact i couldnt do it but huw was there huw did it jane sniffed her eyes narrowing youve been drinking hey what is this i called into a pub for something to settle my stomach everybody trying not to stare at the cloaked figure with the bottom of her cassock showing the first female whiskypriest in the diocese hmm jane said why dont you go to bed ill bring you a drink up thanks flower she thought she might be about to cry again she took up a hotwater bottle dumped her cassock and surplice in the washbin lay between the sheets and sweated shed been here before a panicattack at her own installation service at ledwardine church and hallucinations but what kind of sick warped mind conjures up the filth of denzil joy dear god franny bliss and his colleague had watched her hobble to the car perhaps waiting to see her safely back to the church of st cosmas and st damien but she hadnt returned out of here lass it was all over finished jane brought her hot chocolate theres a drop of brandy in it youll have me at the betty ford clinic flower jane smiled wanly where did you go tonight just you know to see a couple of friends they could come here sometime lots of room yeah jane said maybe sometime merrily sank back into the sweatdamp pillow and slithered into a feverish sleep at times she heard bleeps and voices which might have been on the answering machine or in her hot fogged head like satanic static just before midnight the bedside phone bleeped huw she said feverishly you were asleep merrily yes hello eileen your mans back cullen said with his candles and his bottles oh i said id call you she clawed for consciousness its not visiting time is it jesus you must have been sound asleep being as mr dobbs is in a side ward any time is visiting time within reason this is not exactly within my idea of reason but the visitors a very plausible feller whatever the hell kind of weirdness hes getting up to in there i have to say i quite took to him you talked to him he was very apologetic said hed have come earlier but he had some urgent business to see to are you still there merrily what did he look like oh late fifties longish straggly grey hair he had a bobblehat and he was in this auld blue airmans coat talked like whos that feller alan bennett but a real auld hippy you know yes hes still in there doing his stuff around mr dobbs with his candles probably be gone by the time you get here i could try to keep him talking if you like no merrily said bleakly its all right now eileen i dont think i want to see him fog at first it felt like the start of a cold that filthy metallic tainting of the back of the throat and then she was fully awake knowing what it was panting in terror hes here rolling out of bed breath coming in sobs rolling over and scrambling on to her knees she began to mutter the breastplate groping on the carpet for her pectoral cross by invocation of the same the three in one and one in three of whom all nature hath creation eternal father spirit word and she fell back against the bottom of the bed gulping air gone perhaps after a while she sat up before reaching instinctively for the cigarettes and lighter pulling herself to her feet into the old woollen dressinggown and out of the cold uncosy bedroom she ached the light from the landing window was the colour of damp concrete the garden below looked like her head felt choked with fog she stood swaying at the top of the stairs dizzy thought she would fall and hugged the newel post on the landing the cigarette dangling from her mouth repeatedly scraping her thumb against the zippo but the light wouldnt come sweating and shaking with panic and betrayal mum what mum the kid stood at the bottom of the stairs looking frightened merrily heard a single letter dropping through the box the postman normality she began to cough no such thing because there was no light as such penetrating capuchin lane lol overslept and awoke to the leaden grind of a harmonium from the shop below a deep and doomy female voice nico mournful sinister old nico songs from the seventies unshaven lol made it down to the shop past moons lonely mountainbike and found viv the new manager a sloppyhippy granny old friend of dennys do you like nico lol sometimes lol said i love her viv said i know shes not to everybodys taste but its moons funeral on friday a mourning time thats three days away he didnt know whether moon had ever even liked nico it was not unlikely i thought id play it for an hour every morning to show that were in mourning viv promised theres a letter for you from london lol opened it over his toast in the corner cafe ironically it promised money money as usual for nothing the revered norma waterson wanted to use one of his songs on her next solo album it was the bakers lament the one about the death of traditional village life he was depressed by james lydens rules he should have been dead now for at least ten years on the other hand unless folk singers were exempt norma waterson should have been dead for over twentyfive he stared through the cafe window into the fog there was nothing in the day ahead for him it had come to this whereas moon so excited by her research so driven had just simply ended it he could not believe that what shed discovered had led her to the conclusion that the only way of repairing the broken link with her ancestors was by joining them hed heard nothing more from merrily lol finished his toast walked back to the shop a customer was coming out and lol heard that endless dirge again through the open door it sounded because nico was also dead like an accusation from beyond the grave a bony finger pointing sophie was saying into the phone have they doublechecked yes of course im sorry but it seems so merrily pulled off her coat tossed it over the back of her chair slumped down into it she was going to miss sophie and even the office with d on the door almost a second home now with none of the complications of the first sophie put down the phone tucking a strand of white hair behind one ear its bizarre merrily quite bizarre that was george curtiss the deans absolutely furious you know the cantilupe tomb was due to be reassembled this week in time for the boy bishop ceremony on sunday but would you believe theres a piece missing a piece one of the side panels you know the sidepanels with the figures of knights knights templar someone suggested i know she remembered the knights blurred by age their faces disfigured well one had broken away from the panel maybe through age or stonefatigue it was due to be repaired but now its vanished someone pinched a slab of stone so it seems when the masons were sorting out all the segments it just wasnt there its not huge about a foot wide eighteen inches deep though heavy obviously not easily shoved in your shopping bag merrily said but safely locked up behind that partition surely thats the point sophie looked worried about the only time its removal could have happened was when we were all fussing over canon dobbs after his stroke they suspect one of us maybe she thought insanely i could resign under suspicion of stealing a chunk of cantilupe it would be easier less complicated this dean will suspect anyone connected with the bishop sophie said with rare malice hes already calling for a full inquiry no i dont for a minute think they suspect one of us they just think we might have been more i dont know observant whod want to nick a single medieval knight not in terrific condition and what for a birdtable dont joke about it in front of the dean whatever you do i never seem to meet the dean merrily said personally i never joke in front of the dean the bishop had appeared in the doorway the bishop at his hunkiest with the possiblyarmani jacket over a denim shirt and jeans the only purple now was a handkerchief carelessly tucked into his breast pocket good morning sophie merrily how did it go last night nothing over the top one trusts restraint is our new watchword she said you havent heard what should i have heard mick look she came slowly to her feet i need to talk to you oh yes sophie said quickly the blessing at stretford i gather you werent very well merrily who told she really shouldnt have turned out michael sophie said you can see how terribly pale she is merrily the bishop moved into the office turned his famous blue eyes on her lord yes you dont look well at all fortunately sophie said huw owen was present and able to take over and conduct the service so that was all right merrily stared at her what are you doing owen the bishops face stiffened with outrage who the hell invited owen i did merrily said im sorry i should have told you shouldnt i yes you should the mans from outside the diocese hes church in wales its my fault sophie said quickly merrily told me shed asked the reverend owen to come in as handholder merrily said it was my first serious exorcism as it was to be in a church i didnt want to make a mistake well i should have been told the bishop said almost peevishly i realize he was your course tutor merrily but ive appointed you not him in fact if id known more about owen at the time we might not have sent you on that particular course im sorry lets just say the bishops eyes were hard that his roots are planted in the same general area as dobbss oh michael any further discussion of the dangers of medievalism was forestalled by sophie informing the bishop about the missing cantilupe knight apparently smuggled out of the cathedral and thats all they took the bishop slowly shook his head halfsmiling now admittedly we dont want opportunist tombrobbers cruising the cathedral but its hardly cause for a major panic surely our guys can construct a temporary substitute if they need to put the shrine together in a hurry reconstituted stone or something who after all is going to know reconstituted stone sophie said faintly poor old boys bones are already widely scattered the bishop said reasonably its not as if those knights have anything to guard any more is it sophie val and i shall be leaving earlier for london than planned im sorry sophie spun towards her office i thought the reception was tomorrow well theres going to be a dinner now tonight with tony and cherie and other people of course he laughed one can hardly reschedule these things according to ones personal convenience well need to get off before lunch so merrily turning his attention on her like a loaded shotgun i want you to think about something he stepped back and surveyed her critically she thought in her black jumper and woollen skirt flaking fakebarbour over the back of the chair whatever it is now she thought not today ironic that the question of dobbs and owen should arise traditionalism i want all this to be raised at the next general synod and i want you merrily to give some thought to producing a paper on what for want of a better term im officially calling new deliverance she stared at him me very definitely you i think i may be looking at the very face of new deliverance bishop i dont know what you mean about new surely the whole point of you know very well what i mean merrily think back to our discussion in the green dragon anyway i dont have time to expand on it now well talk again before christmas yes she couldnt reply excellent the bishop said crisply as he left merrilys phone rang merrily frannie bliss remember how are you im ok you dont sound all that ok to me you shouldve said something us keeping you talking outside in the cold all that time not that it was much warmer inside sorry you had to go off like that but you probably did the best thing hes a card that huw isnt he turned out well for us anyway it did im not gonna bore you with the runup to this but we finally had a chat with two very nice elderly ladies sisters churchgoers and active members of the royal society for the protection of birds they put us on to a lad called craig proctor lives out near monkland now young craig for reasons you really dont want to know about especially if youre not feeling well is an expert at trapping wild birds these old ladiesve been after him for months but hes clever is craig or he thought he was anyway after a long and meaningful exchange at leominster nick this morning craig has told us he was approached by a chap he didnt know and given a hundred and fifty pounds to procure one live carrion crow christ the fog outside was like a carpet against the window yeh frannie said now whats that say to you merrily it says youre not just looking for a bunch of kids whove seen some nasty films the real thing eh yes though i dont know what i mean when i say that did you get a description out of him young guy motorbike moustache hardlooking thats not much help craigs never seen him before he claims you arrest him no he knew wed no evidence and he wasnt gonna confess you made a deal we dont make deals as you well know merrily just have a little think about why somebody would blow a hundred and fifty on setting up some grubby little sacrifice in a church nobody uses and taking a considerable risk too merrily said stretford itself might be a bit lonely but the church is hardly lonely within stretford that too have you asked huw well yeh i did call huw to be honest but he wasnt there hes a busy man merrily said quietly sophie had gestured to her something about popping out for a while merrily considered waiting for her to return needing to find out how shed learned about last nights disaster and why shed been so quick to cover up in front of the bishop but by lunchtime sophie had not come back so merrily switched on the computer and typed out the letter it had already been composed in her head on the way here it was formal and uncomplicated that was always best no need for details not that she felt able to put that stuff on paper dear bishop after long consideration and a great deal of prayer and agonizing i have decided to ask you to accept my resignation from the role of diocesan deliverance consultant i do not doubt that this is or will become a valid job for a woman however events have proved to me that i am not yet sufficiently wise or experienced enough to take it on therefore i honestly think i should make a discreet exit before i become a liability to the church i would like to thank you for your kindness and albeit misplaced confidence in me i am sorry for wasting so much of your very valuable time yours sincerely merrily watkins it hung there on the screen and she sat in front of it reading it over and over again until she saw it only as words with no coherent meaning she could print it out and post it or send it through the internal mail either way he would not see it before he and val left for london or maybe email it immediately to the bishops palace that would be the quickest and the best and leave no room for hesitation she read it through again there was nothing more to say she looked up the palaces email address and prepared to send it would be courteous perhaps to show it first to sophie perhaps shed wait until sophie returned perhaps she wouldnt what she would not do was ring huw owen about it as often the only certainty was a cigarette her packet was empty so she felt in her bag for another and came up with a creamywhite envelope the one pushed through the letterbox while she was shivering on the landing shed stuffed it into her bag while arguing with jane that she was perfectly fit to go to work no she did not have flu its mental flower im coming apart and torturing myself with sick sexual demonic fantasies gods way of showing me im not equipped to take on other peoples terrors but she hadnt said any of that either she opened the letter postmarked hereford and addressed to the reverend mrs watkins it came straight to the point dear reverend watkins you should know that your daughter has been seen brazenly endangering her soul and yours by mixing with the spiritually unclean ask her what she was doing last saturday afternoon at the socalled psychic fair at leominster it is well known that such events attract members of occult groups in search of converts ask her how long she has been consorting with a clairvoyant who uses the devils picturebook many people have always been disgusted that your daughter does not attend church as the daughter of a minister of god ought to now we know why if it is true that you have been appointed exorcist then perhaps you should start by cleansing the filthy soul of your own daughter it was unsigned quite expensively done judged by the standards set by these creeps usually the paper was cheap and crumpled and whereas most of them were pushed into a letterbox either here or at the church this one had come by post surprising how many anonymous letters you got or perhaps male ministers didnt get so many quite a few of these letters muttered that you should stop pretending to be a priest and go out and get yourself a husband like ordinary decent women did one or two of them also offered to give her what ordinary decent women were getting but she evidently wasnt she picked these ones up by one corner and washed her hands afterwards some of them she felt she ought to file or give to the police in case other women were receiving similar messages and the sender ever got nicked some she really didnt want to take to the police in case anyone at the station suspected there was no smoke without fire but most of them got burned in the grate or the nearest ashtray merrily flicked the zippo it would be true of course jane had laid it on the line that altogether fateful afternoon in the coffee lounge at the green dragon the church has always been on this kind of paternalistic powertrip doesnt want people to search for the truth like it used to be science and darwinism and stuff they were worried about now its the new age because thats like real practical spirituality psychic fairs were where people went in search of real practical spirituality merrily didnt doubt that what the letter said was essentially true it would explain a lot of things not least the allure of rowenna she knew the devils picturebook was the tarot a doorway et tu flower she felt choked by acrid fog her head ached no option now she sent the bishop his email walked out of the office and down the stone stairs part three projection selfpity she felt cold and dangerously light inside as though a dead weight had rolled away but releasing nothing she stepped through a tide of pensioners a coach party heading towards the cathedral the sky was overcast nobody seemed to be smiling any more one of the old men looked a bit like dobbs she should tell dobbs that it was ok now that he could go ahead and recover shed do that yes shed go to the hospital at visiting time and tell him jesus christ was the first exorcist the pattern is unbroken this would draw a final line under everything unless huw was there the bastard with his holy water and his candles jesus the city swirled around her in the fog undefined she mustnt look back at the cathedral it was no part of her life now she should go back to her own parish and deal with the church breakin head ted clowes off at the pass at ledwardine her home or not sweat sprang out on her forehead she felt insubstantial worthless she had no home no lover no spiritual adviser no daughter failed her too bound up in your own conceits sending her into the arms of new age occult freaks a reaction to living with a pious bitch her dead husband sean had been the first to call her that after a day quite like this a headachy day the desperate day when shed found out just how bent he was and screamed at him for his duplicity and his greed and hed screamed back i was doing it for you you pious bitch she hated that word dont ever be pious smoke curse never be afraid to say jesus christ in fury or astonishment at least it keeps the name in circulation strive to be a good person a good priest never a pious priest once up in liverpool shed conducted a youth service wearing a binliner instead of a cassock it was half a generation too late some of the kids were appalled others sneered not so easy not being pious merrily found herself back on the green watching the cathedral placidly swallowing the coach party the fog was lifting but the sky behind it was darkening she had no idea which way to go next suppose shed backed away from the lamplit path and supported sean had said lets fight this together would he have made the effort for her found some fresh uncorrupted friends a new but much older secretary would he in the end have survived might she have saved his life by not following the path of the pious bitch into the arms of god she stood at the barrier preventing cars turning into church street she was panting thoughts racing again wasnt it true that having women in the priesthood was creating a new divide between the sexes because men could love both god and their wives but no truly heterosexual woman could love both god and a man with sufficient intensity to make both relationships potent was it all a sham was it true that all she was searching for in god were those qualities lacking in ordinary men or at least in sean oh christ merrily flattened herself against a brick wall facing the side of the cathedral the headache had gone she wished it was back she wanted pain fumbling at her dogcollar she took it off and put it in her bag a cold breeze seemed to leap immediately to her throat like a stab of admonishment she zipped up her coat holding its collar together turned her back on the cathedral and walked quickly into church street lol saw merrily from his window through the drifting fog gliding almost drunkenly along the street peering unseeingly into shop windows newly edged with christmas glitter he ran downstairs past the bike past nicos sepulchral drone and the very interested gaze of big viv merrily close up she seemed limp drained oh she said hi and he was shocked because she looked as vague as moon had often been but that was just him wasnt it his paranoia but paranoia hadnt created the shadows and creases the dark hair all mussed dark eyes moist makeup escaping he looked around not the flat now it had been too awkward there the other night as if foreshadowed by the death of moon she let him steer her into the corner cafe where he and jane had eaten chocolate fudge cake there was no one else in the back room a brown pot of tea between them on the wall above them was a framed cezanne poster baked furrowed earth under a heat haze the letter lay folded on the table held down by the sugar bowl revealing only the words known that such events attract members of occult groups in search of converts but surely he said they mainly just attract ordinary people who read their daily horoscopes it doesnt mean shes sacrificing babies but he thought of seeing jane and the other girl coming out of pods last night long after it was closed and jane pretending for the first time ever not to have seen him if this was london she said i could get away with it or if jane was grownup and living somewhere else if shed even been upfront about it i could have merrily it means nothing i cant believe youve just quit because of this its the bishop isnt it sorry he made another move on you right no she smiled hes been fine and anyway i might have taken that the wrong way late at night very tired no im just paranoid she held up her halfsmoked cigarette as though using it as a measure of something also i have filthy habits and a deep reservoir of selfpity he nodded at the cigarette what are the others then merrily tipped it into the ashtray he saw she was blushing she had no filthy habits just tell me to pull myself together ok i like you being untogether it makes me feel responsible and kind of protective sort of like a real bloke she smiled so what are you going to do now go back to my flock and try to be a good little shepherd the deliverance ministry was a wrong move i thought it was something you could pick up as you went along i didnt realize im a fraud lol i dont know what im doing let too many people down i even let you down i said id go and see your friend moon she looked vague was that yesterday mmm i mean i could still see her im still a minister of sorts shes not there now he said too quietly lol she looked directly at him for the first time since sitting down at the table she died her face froze up behind the smoke no he put up his hands she was dead long before you couldve got there there was nothing you could have done and he told her about it about the iron age sword about the old newspaper report why denny had concealed the truth why denny said hed concealed the truth why dick thought they should let it lie she kept shaking her head lips parted he was relieved at the way outrage had lifted her again lol ive never heard anything so there is something deeply deeply wrong here dont you think but what can you do about it we cant bring her back and we cant find out what was in her mind what about this book she was supposed to be writing supposed to be but i dont think shed written a word but if there is anything lying around denny will find it and if it says anything he doesnt like hell destroy it without telling anyone will you be called as a witness at the inquest i expect so i was the first to the first to enter the bathroom and what will you say ill just answer their questions that should cover about half of the truth and the rest of it cant be the truth because it has no rationality she looked down into her cup as if there might be a message for her in the tealeaves im so sorry lol the point at which people say ah well one of those things except this wasnt after a while she said what if all your working life is concerned with things that threequarters of the civilized world now consider irrational that could be stressful he said there were lights on in the cafe now but they didnt seem to reach merrily what was she not telling him she said you know why some vicars busy themselves constantly with youth work and stuff like that its so that if at any point they realize theres no god they can think well at least i havent been wasting my time cynical rational for the same reasons some deliverance ministers prefer to think of themselves as christian psychologists psychology is wonderful lol said grimly look how much it helped moon perhaps she had the wrong therapist we must get her a better one next time i think you could have helped moon i wish to god id told you about her earlier and i think i think there must be a lot of other people you could help thanks but youre being kind she dropped the cigarettes and lighter into her bag then folded up the anonymous letter very tightly this was not good nothing had been resolved he sensed that when she returned to her flock she would be different a sad shepherd exiled unfulfilled into a community that wasnt a community any more none of them were village life like hed said in his song was no more than a sweet watercolour memory shed grow old and lined and end up hating god listen lol lowered his voice to an urgent whisper my life is pathetic im a failed performer a mediocre songwriter an exmental patient who cant keep a woman my sole function on this earth at the present time appears to be producing an album for a semitalented obnoxious little git whos blackmailing his father three days ago a woman i couldnt love but needed to help just shut me out in the snow and then slashed both her wrists now somebody who i care about is holding out on me in exactly the same way what does this tell me mega selfpity he thought as she sat down again occasionally it works merrily said looking down at the table sometimes i think youre the only friend i have left friend he repeated sadly she met his eyes its a big word lol he nodded although he knew there were bigger ones outside it was already going dark and the fog had never really lifted old tiger jane stood on the vicarage lawn ethel the cat watching her from inside the kitchen window there was fog still around but a paler patch almost directly overhead the moon was probably just there behind layer upon layer of steamy cloud right then shed been told that it was ok to do this from the inside of the house but she didnt feel quite right about that not with the moon somehow and it was a vicarage whereas the garden bordered the old and sinister orchard which though it belonged to the church had been here in essence far longer prechristian almost certainly the night was young but silent around jane you could usually hear some sounds from the marketplace or the black swan but not many people seemed to have ventured out tonight also the fog itself created this lovely padded hush it lined the hills and blocked in the spaces between the trees in the dense woods above ledwardine as if the whole valley had acquired these deep resonant walls like a vast auditorium she wondered if rowenna was outside in her garden too the problem was that there were doubtless other houses overlooking that one and rowenna had younger brothers who would just take the piss so she was probably now in her room searching for the same moon jane looked up cleared her throat almost nervously probably mum felt like this in the pulpit dont think about mum this is nothing to do with her she drew in a long chilled breath imagining moonbeams unfortunately there werent any also being drawn down filling her with silken silvery light and then she called out not too loud as villages had ears hail to thee lady moon whose light reflects our most secret hopes hail to thee from the abodes of darkness something about that abodes of darkness making it more thrilling than the sun thing in the morning especially in this fog and it did work this cycle of spiritual salutation it put the whole day into a natural sequence it deepened your awareness of the connectedness of everything and your role as part of the great perceiving mechanism that was humanity jane felt seriously calm by now and not at all cold like she was generating her own inner heat or something was she looked up into the sky again just as this really miraculous thing began to happen the moon appeared first as just a grey imprint on the cloudtapestry then as this kind of smokewreathed silver figurine the goddess gathering the folds of her cloudrobes around her and finally as a core of brilliant white fire at the heart of the fog winter glory oh wow she heard me jane just stood there and shivered in amazement and delight like totally transported cool like really really really cool visiting times not for another hour sister miller said its teatime and the patients have to eat youll need to come back sister miller was all nurse tough and ageless merrily concentrated on her seasoned face because the view along watkins ward was dizzying and oppressive it would have been hard to come up here alone tonight any night she told sister miller that sister cullen had said visiting hours were less strict if the patient was in a side ward which one canon dobbs that old man said sister miller are you relatives im a colleague because my view is that he doesnt need to be here now no matter what dr bradley says why cant someone look after him at home hes just taking up a bed you mean hes recovering of course hes recovering ive been in nursing for nearly forty years mr dobbs was walking perfectly well this morning he can also feed himself i believe he could also talk if he wanted to sister miller turned on lol have you any idea why hes refusing to talk lol thought about it perhaps hes just impatient with routine questions like how are we today you have ten minutes and no longer said sister miller it was like praying over a tomb he lay on his back as still as an effigy eyes shut you were not aware of him breathing he looked dead just a short prayer then nothing clever someone else having seen to all the smart stuff afterwards merrily brushed her knees and sat in the bedside chair hello mr dobbs he didnt move he was like stone could he possibly be awake we havent spoken before as such im merrily watkins keeping her voice low and even ive come to say goodbye on the other side of the doors glass square lol smiled ok that was not the most tactful thing to say in a hospital by which i mean that ive now decided not to accept the deliverance role i just wanted you to know that we never met formally and now theres no reason we ever should the side ward enclosing dobbs was like a drab chapel a faintly mouldy smell came from him not organic more like the miasma of old books in a damp warehouse im sorry that youre in here im sorry we didnt get to you sooner in the cathedral she halfrose to pull the bedside chair a little closer and lowered her voice to below prayer level im even sorrier you didnt feel able to tell any of us what you were doing there she leaned her face forward to within six inches of his theyd kept him shaved but stubble had sprouted under his chin like a patch of sparse grass on a rockface it doesnt matter to me now not professionally im out of it feeling a little humiliated rather slighted i know jesus christ was the first exorcist but also that half the worlds population is female and rather more than half the people with problems of psychic disturbance or so it seems to me are female too i believe that one day there will be a female exorcist in this diocese without the fires of hell burning in high town i just wanted you to know that too no reaction yet he could apparently walk and feed himself she felt angry i probably felt less insulted but more puzzled when i heard youd been avoiding all women dumping your housekeeper that wasnt a terribly kind thing to do why are you scared of women her hand went instinctively to her throat she still wasnt wearing the dogcollar i dont know what makes you tick canon dobbs ive been trying to forgive you for setting me up for that final session with denzil joy she felt tainted just uttering the name particularly here too much like an invocation if you wanted to scare me off show me how unpleasant it could be you very nearly succeeded but that wasnt in the end why i decided to quit she stood up on his bedside table she placed two pounds of seedless grapes and two bottles of malvern water maybe you could share these with huw owen next time he comes with his candles and his holy water and his magic chalk she waited not a movement she took a last look at him but he remained like a fossil when she reached the door she stopped noticing that lols eyes had widened she resisted the urge to spin around once out of the door she turned left towards the ward entrance refusing even to glance back along watkins to the top side ward where denzil joys spirit had left his body and gone where the sudden shudder ripped up her spine like a razorblade ok he opened his eyes lol informed her outside the hospital as soon as you turned your back and walked away his eyes snapped open then closed again when he saw me standing on the other side of the glass merrilys volvo was parked in a small bay near a little park by the path to the victoria footbridge over the wye they leaned against it he heard it all then she said every word his eyes were very bright fully aware and mad as hell when he saw me good my god mmm those eyes had spooked lol they were burning with the hard wary intelligence of an old tiger but the effect of this news on merrily he found exciting the cold had lost its bite and the fog had thinned he could see the threequarter moon as through a lace curtain merrily said could we go for a short walk i need to clear my head it was very short he followed her through the patch of parkland to a kind of viewing platform overlooking the still dark wye and the suspension footbridge last time i stood here inspector annie howe was showing me where a body had been found what exciting times you have merrily such drama too much drama she stood with her back to the river beside an ornate lamp standard well this suggests dobbs was an active participant in huws ritual doesnt it or maybe even directing it youre the expert obviously not or id know what this was about and this huw going behind your back thats the reason you resigned she shrugged i still dont see it lol he was my course tutor the deliverance man hes the nearest ive had or wanted to have to a spiritual adviser i rated the guy i really liked him i see no you dont a fatherfigure just about but more important the person you trust to guide you through the through the hinterland of hell if you like but what if theres something iffy about what they were both doing iffy i dont know and you want to yeah her dark hair shone in the lamplight more than a professional interest i dont have a professional interest any more i am just so angry that shit excellent huh im happy youre mad when i first saw you in church street you were about as animated as mr dobbs back there i worry easily she smiled shaking her head lol mmm i said some stupid things all right things that werent necessarily true which in particular you choose merrily said her face seemed flushed he thought for a moment ok ive chosen dont tell me why not because because little jane doesnt know where you are little jane doesnt bloody care i think she does merrily and its not my place to say so to a professional good person but if you take this out on her before youve gone into it properly you might regret it you mean i should take steps to find out what shes doing and who with i can help maybe if you want why are you doing this lol a number of possible reasons lol stood close to her but looked across the river to the haze of misted lights on the fringe of the city you choose merrily sighed i cant go to bed with you you know and naturally she looked softfocus beautiful under the lamp not the way things are god lol said sadly he has a lot to answer for it isnt god merrily said oh he wanted to roll over the rail into the black river that means somebody else yes she turned away from him and from the light in the moment before she did he saw her eyes and he thought he saw a flash of fear there and he thought there was a shudder of revulsion but he was paranoid official ill take you back now merrily said fantasy world jane threw open the bedroom window and the damned fog came in and she started to cough it was like being with mum in the sculleryoffice on a heavy silk cut night down on the lawn the last rags of snow had gone snow was clean bright refreshing fog was misery it was december today so only three weeks to midwinter the great solstice when the year had the first gleam of spring in its eye always darkest before the dawn this jane thought was like a midwinter of the spirit she cleared her throat hail to thee eternal spiritual sun whose visible symbol now rises from the heavens that was a bloody laugh hail unto thee from the abodes of morning it had been so brilliant last night out in the garden maybe she was a night person maybe a moon person and yet the bedtime exercise had not gone too well the great rewinding of the day before you go to sleep make a journey back through the day starting with the very last thing you did or said or thought then going back through every small event every action every perception as though you were rewinding a sensory videotape of your day consider each occurrence impartially as though it were happening to someone else and notice how one thing led to another thus will you learn about cause and effect this reverse procedure also deconditions your mind from thinking sequentially past present and future and demolishes the web of falsehood you habitually weave to excuse your wrong behaviour it was impossible to stay with it you got sidetracked you thought of something interesting and followed it through or something bad like mum being ill which could plunge you without warning into some awful stalinist scenario at grans in cheltenham as long as your mother is in hospital jane you are under my roof and a young lady does not go out looking like that or you remembered seeing some cool male person and despite what angela had foretold you were into the old dyingavirgin angst rowenna never seemed prey to these fears had she no hormones gratefully jane closed the window mum had not looked too bad last night quiet though pensive youre not ok youre not you look like sh dont say it all right its true and jesus it was true that ratty old dressinggown the cig drooping from the corner of her mouth a vicar standing on the stairs she looked like some ageing hooker its the weather mum said it so is not the weather maybe you should see a doctor i dont know about exorcist you look like completely bloody possessed for a moment mum looked quite horrible face all red and scrunched up like some kind of bloodpressure situation and then stop it dont you ever ever make jokes about that do you hear and like whatever happened to the sense of humour jane backed away into the kitchen teetering on the rim of tears they ate breakfast in silence apart from the bleeping of the answering machine unplayed messages from last night arent you going to ever listen to that thing jane said finally at the front door ill get around to it flower mum said drably turning away because for less than half a second jane had caught her eyes and seen in them the harsh glint of fear no please standing desolate on the darkshrouded market square as the headlights of the school bus bleared around the corner jane thought suppose its not flu nor even some kind of virus suppose shes found symptoms of something shes afraid to take to the doctor oh god please god the only time jane ever reverted to the old guy was when it was about mum bleep merrily its sophie im calling at seven oclock please ring me at home bleep ms watkins acting dci howe tuesday i need to talk to you can you call me between eightthirty and ten tomorrow wednesday thanks bleep this is susan thorpe mrs watkins at the glades could you confirm our arrangement for tomorrow evening thank you bleep merrily its sophie again please call me you must realize what its about bleep hello lass time we had a chat eh merrily didnt think so lol said viv you know the alternative hereford i mean most of the people on that side of things my love big viv laughed throatily i am the alternative hereford just dont ask me to point you to a dealer what happens over that healthfood cafe in bridge street pods viv gave him a sharp look he saw she had two tight liprings on this morning well they used to do a good cashewburger then they got a different cook and it wasnt so good you wont meet anybody there uhhuh lol shook his head gently im not looking to score anything chemical he collected another hard look what then i dont know mysticism you wont score that either not at pods he didnt know whether to be relieved or disappointed wrong gender lol its a woman thing there i can put you on to a few other people if you like depending what youre into wicca theosophy gurdjieff ill tell you the truth lol said it involves a friend of mine she thought her daughter might be involved in something possibly linked to pods and shed like to know a bit about it its a peaceofmind thing whats her name jane jane watkins dont know her viv went to sit behind the till all right i went there a few times but it got a bit intense yeah what was it into selfdiscovery developing an inner life meditation astralprojection occult lite you know you manage to leave your body viv no such luck darling the best teacher they had just dropped out then they got very responsible a bit elitist no riffraff no dopeheads like an esoteric ladies club you know that was when i kicked it into touch lifes too short for what for taking seriously plus it was inconvenient they started meeting in an afternoon on account of the kind of women they were attracting didnt want their ohsorespectable husbands to find out anyway it was all a bit snooty and bit too sombre lol wondered how sombre was too sombre for a nicofan this is a very intense intellectual kid lol not how id describe her well not how i would have described her they change so fast kids viv said the only call merrily returned was susan thorpes a careattendant answered mrs thorpe had left early for hereford market merrily said quickly before she could let herself back out could you tell her the arrangement still stands she felt really unsure about this but she very much wanted to speak to susan thorpes mother wanted every bit of background she could get on thomas dobbs and it was only an imprint a redirection of energies she could handle that couldnt she if she protected herself thats fine the woman said thank you mrs watkins ok she lit a cigarette and pulled over the phone book this was something she should have done days ago napier surprisingly there were three in credenhill would it say major napier colonel napier she didnt even know rowennas fathers rank a serving officer in the sas would anyway be unlikely to advertise his situation might even be exdirectory she called the first napier no reply at the second a woman answered and merrily asked if this was where rowenna lived the woman laughed with no humour this is where she sleeps london accent sometimes there was the sound of a morning tv talkshow in the background a studio audience programmed to gasp and hoot is that mrs napier no its mrs straker would it be possible to speak to mrs napier i wouldnt know dear depends if you can afford longdistance merrily said nothing im rowennas aunt mrs straker continued heavily like shed had to explain this a thousand times too many i look after the kids for steve hes my younger brother he and helen split up about four years ago shes in canada now if you want to speak to steve youll have to call back tonight im sorry i didnt know any of this my names merrily watkins from ledwardine my daughter jane she seems to be rowennas best friend at school no reaction this wasnt what shed expected she wanted a warm concerned parent delighted to hear from little janes mother i dont know any jane mrs straker said see mrs watkins merrily yeah see since her dad bought her that car we never know where she is i wouldnt have got it her personally i dont think she should have a car till shes at college or got a job but steves soft with her and now she goes where she likes and she dont bring her girl friends back here or the men either merrily sat down her picture of rowenna and her family background undergoing radical revision sometimes mrs straker was saying i think i should be bothering more than i do but when she was here all the time it was nothing but rows and sulks and this is a very small house for the five of us where we were before down in salisbury things was difficult but it was a bigger place at least you know what i mean i suppose your brother has to go away a lot in the sas merrily had heard you could never rely on not having to be in bosnia or somewhere at a days notice no said mrs straker he is a an army officer isnt he your brother mrs straker laughed thats what she told you is it not exactly merrily said it was jane whod told her steves a corporal he works in admin i see thats not good enough for rowenna obviously she lives in what i would call a fantasy world steve cant see it or he dont want to i dunno what your daughters like mrs watson impressionable merrilys stomach felt like lead shes been out a lot lately at night and she doesnt always say where im getting worried which is why i rang you want to watch her mrs straker said keep an eye on her thats my advice why would you advise that mrs straker made a pregnant humming noise there was a lot she could say would enjoy relating but she apparently wanted more encouragement merrily said its a bit difficult for me to keep an eye on jane all the time being a single mum you know having to work divorced widow yes im a widow too mrs straker said its not easy is it never thought id end up looking after somebody elses kids even if they are my own brothers but i cant watch that girl as well i told steve that not now shes got a car what do you do yes i can see the problem no what do you do whats your job the front doorbell rang im er im a minister in the church a vicar the line went quiet oh dear mrs straker said thats not what i expected at all thats very funny that is the doorbell rang again twice followed by a rapping of the knocker why is that so funny thats your front door dear mrs straker said youd best go and get it ring me back if you like why is that so funny mrs straker its not funny at all mrs watson you wont find it funny ill guarantee that wrong number dear annie howe stood on the step young and spruce and clean fasttrack fresh against the swirling murk ah you are there ms watkins i was driving over from leominster so i thought id call her ashblonde head tilted taking in the dressinggown and the blotches and the bags no doubt you really arent well are you not wonderful flu no its ok to come in merrily said you wont catch anything i seldom do is this nervous exhaustion perhaps that might be closer howe stepped into the kitchen with a slight wrinkling of the nose her own kitchen would be hardwood and stainlesssteel cool as a morgue she sat down at the table confidently pushing the ashtray away ms watkins its the paul sayer thing again merrily filled the kettle that seemed to have gone quiet thats because were still choosing not to make too much noise about it im wondering if we ought to you want me to discuss it in a sermon howe smiled thinly perhaps a sarcasm amnesty sure sorry go on so what did she do about this if howe knew she was in the process of shedding the deliverance role this conversation would never reach the coffee stage difficult since she was unable to square it with the bishop until his return from london ok say nothing you heard from ds bliss i believe howe said he told me about the supplier of crows did you get any further unfortunately not they appeared to have paid their money taken their crow and melted back into their own netherworld but as you agreed with bliss the fee suggests that the people involved in this are not the usual how shall i say toerags quite so let me get this right have you actually said publicly that sayer was murdered yet howe shook her head were staying with the phrase suspicious circumstances the situation is as you must realize that we could doubtless get widespread national publicity if we told the press about sayers hobby especially if you gave them the pictures of course but apart from producing an unseemly doublepage spread in the daily star i cant see that it would help im no longer sure the people we want to talk to would ever read a tabloid yes its possible sayer may simply be a wanker weve found some videotapes under a floorboard which seem to show ritual activities but we dont know if these are events that sayer was personally involved in or sadopornographic tapes he acquired for his own gratification theyre quite explicit not commercial films oh no the qualitys not good enough lots of camera shake and the picture itself is so poor it seems to have been recorded with either old or very cheap equipment which suggests its not simulated what kind of ritual activities you can view them if you like id rather you just told me well one shows a man penetrating a woman on an altar shes wearing a blindfold and a gag and it looks like rape the mans face is not hidden but well covered by long hair and a beard in the background are several people whose faces are even less distinguishable what does that sound like to you any suggestion of location possibly a church and then theres the inevitable passingroundthechalice sequence black mass someone drinks from the chalice and theres residue on the mouth suggestive of blood but as i say the quality is appalling you see on the one hand merrily said the black mass is the bestknown of all satanic rituals and probably the easiest to carry out if youre just idiots with a warped idea of fun you just do everything in reverse say the lords prayer backwards et cetera and you pervert everything urinate in the chalice or use blood instead of wine blood is the aspect which could on the other hand mean serious business blood represents the lifeforce and its seen as the most potent of all magical substances if you want to make something happen you use real blood of course we have no way of knowing whether this is it looks too thin for ketchup but it could be soy sauce or something im not being much help am i its more a question of what help you might be in the future howe said weve failed to identify a single person whos been involved in any any activity with sayer or indeed with serious satanic activity of any kind thats not including the selfpublicists of course when did you ever see a serious heavyduty educated satanist stripped off in the news of the world you mean as with organized crime the big operators are the outwardly respectable types youd never suspect i suppose thats a good parallel its also largely a myth said howe the mr bigs of this world are very rare and we do know who they are but im still interested do you personally believe there are highpowered practitioners with big houses and executive posts how would i know im only a village vicar but if sayer was just a wanker perhaps he was playing out of his league you mean if he was regarded by some serious and outwardly respectable practitioner as a potential embarrassment or he was getting too ambitious or he angered some rival group im told theres a lot of jealousy and infighting and powerstruggling among certain occult sects who told you that it was discussed during a course i was sent on is this what you wanted to hear go on we were told that there are basically two classes of satanist what huw our tutor calls the headbangers who are just in it for the experience or whatever psychic charge they can get and the intellectuals these are people who came out of gnosticism and believe that knowledge is all and so anything is valid if it leads to more knowledge including murder probably although theyd be as reluctant as the rest of us to break the law satanists basically are the people who hate christianity and they hate us because they see us as irrational they despise us for our pomp and our smugness all these great cathedrals costing millions of pounds a year to maintain all the wasted psychic energy to promote what they see as the idiot myth that you can get there by love i see why do i get the feeling you also think its an idiot myth because im a policeperson howe said love is something we seldom encounter when howe had left merrily phoned mrs straker back four times and never got an answer her own phone rang three times she didnt pick it up but pressed each time the calls were from sophie uncle ted and sophie respectively she owed sophie an explanation but couldnt face that now and anyway when mick returned tomorrow shed have to talk to him at length no doubt before then she wanted to have lost this virus in the afternoon she filled a plastic bottle with tapwater and took it across to the church and into the chancel where she stood it before the altar in the choir stalls she meditated for almost an hour blue and gold lamplit path she went into the vestry and changed into the cassock and surplice shed worn at st cosmas and st damien since washed and replaced in the vestry wardrobe she walked head bowed along the central aisle back to the chancel and stood before the altar lord god almighty the creator of life bless this water back in the vicarage she went up to her bedroom and sprinkled holy water in all four corners then across the threshold and at the window top and bottom she went down on her knees and prayed that the soul of our brother denzil might be directed away from its suffering and its earthly obsessions and led into the light filtered through fog the fading light lay like a dustsheet on the bedroom jane felt uncomfortable on the school bus home increasingly so as more and more students got off the buses had arrived early at the school on account of the fog which was getting worse classes had been wound up twenty minutes ahead of time the bus was moving very slowly in low gear it must be like driving through frogspawn jane just hoped to god that mum was feeling better was not going to be really ill ledwardine was near the end of the line dean wall legendary greaseball knew that so there was no need at all for him to dump his fat ass on the seat next to jane he was on his own tonight his mate danny gittoes off sick supposedly just wanted to make sure you didnt miss your stop in all this fog seein as how you ent much used to buses these days very funny jane gathered her bag protectively on to her lap dont worry about me i have a natural homing instinct the bus was crawling now she had no idea where the hell they were only tryin tbe helpful watkins dean wall shoved his fat thigh against hers leaned back and stretched the fat bastard clearly wasnt going to move goin out tonight probably not off with some bloke tonight then is she i wouldnt have thought so walls big fat lips shambled into a loose smile look just sod off ok jane said i wouldnt worry watkins youll still get yours ers likely bisexual will you piss off you dont know nothin do you youre dead naive you are jane gazed out of the window at dense nothing stop trying to wind me up im tryin to put you right jane you wanner talk to gittoes you do cept he ent capable of speech right now still recoverin like his mas thinkin of gettin him plastic surgery to take the smile off his face i dont want to know i bet you do dean wall leaned a little closer and jane shrank against the streaming window dean lowered his voice er give danny a blow job back o the woodwork building she spun and stared at him listen i ent kiddin jane he threw up his hands like she was about to hit him gittoes was pretty bloody gobsmacked himself as it were you totally disgusting slimeball er needed a favour see i want you to sit somewhere else all right jane said im going to count to five if you havent gone by then ill start screaming then ill tell the driver you put your hand up my skirt mrs straker yes whos this its merrily watkins again ive tried several times to call back but i suppose you had to go out whod you say you were merrily its janes mum shes rowennas friend we spoke earlier i think youve got the wrong number dear we spoke about an hour and a half ago you said there was something i should know about rowenna you wont find it funny ill guarantee that you must be thinking of somebody else mrs straker said ive never spoken to you before in my life she couldnt talk merrily decided someone had come into the house who shouldnt hear this or someone she was afraid of is there somebody with you has rowenna come back is jane with her could you just answer yes or no listen mrs straker hissed i dont know who you are but if you pester me again ill call the police that clear enough for you dear now get off the fucking line she lay awake that night for over an hour a whole carillon of alarm bells ringing it was the first evening this week that she and jane had eaten together afterwards they made a log fire in the drawing room and watched tv all very mellow and companionable later they put out the lamps and moved out of the draughts and close to the fire sipped their tea and talked and then she got around to telling jane about katherine moon dead so she hadnt known it was hard to tell how jane really felt about this she seemed to have assumed moon and lol had been at some stage an item when merrily came to moons use of the iron age knife this kind of stuff never seemed to upset jane particularly as long as no animals were involved the kid nodded solemnly sure the later celtic period coming up to the dark ages that was like this really screwedup time it was merrily curling her legs on to the sofa bad magic the druids were getting into blood sacrifices and stuff if your family was rooted in all that youre quite likely to get reverberations plus who knows what else happened on the site of that barn i mean way back it could be really poisoned giving off all kinds of mindwarping vibrations if you dont know how to handle these things it could go badly wrong for you thats very interesting merrily had said mildly where did you learn all that flower everybody knows that jane said inscrutably she was sitting on a big cushion at the edge of the hearth so this moon was bonkers all along she had a history of psychiatric problems which led to a long and fairly sensible discussion about lol and the kind of unsuitable women into whose ambience he seemed to have been drawn beginning with his bornagain christian mother then the problem over a fifteenyearold schoolgirl when he himself was about nineteen but no more mature than the girl and then some older woman who was into drugs and later alison kinnersley whod first drawn him to herefordshire for entirely her own ends hows he taken it jane set her mug down on the hearth and prodded at a log with the poker he thinks he should have known the way things were going which is what people always say after a suicide but in this case people were trying to help her its very odd it doesnt add up so like lol was he in love with her i really dont think so flower and at this point the phone had rung and shed waited and dialled finding it had been lol himself she called him back from the sculleryoffice still answering monosyllabically because jane was sometimes a stealthy mover so she never did learn how hed discovered the kid had become involved with something called the pod which met above a cafe in hereford it could be worse however lol said women only nothing sexual selfdevelopment through meditation and spiritual exercises progressing possibly to journeys out of the body oh was that all when she went back to the drawing room jane had put on the stereo and it was playing one of the warmest breathiest nick drakeiest songs on the second and final hazey jane album the one which went waking in the misty dawn and finding you there merrily lay on the sofa and listened to the music her thoughts tumbling like water on to rocks during the remainder of the evening the phone rang twice merrily said the machine would get it although she knew it was still unplugged the last caller shed discovered from the bedside phone was huw owen she fell asleep trying to make sense of him and dobbs she lay there half awake for quite a while dimly aware of both palms itching before the jagged cold ripped up her from vagina to throat and then she was throwing herself out of bed and rolling away into a corner where the carpet was still damp from holy water and she curled up dripping with sweat and terror and saw from the neonred digits of the illuminated clock that the time was four am the hour of his death in hereford general across the room with a waft of cats faeces and gangrene a shadow sat up in her bed a party the bulkhead light came on and the back door was tugged open somewhere deep in the stone and panelled heart of the glades a piano was being plonked a dozen cracked sopranos clawing for the notes of what might have been a hymn ah susan thorpe stepped out in her aran sweater heathery skirt riding boots splendid we were beginning to think you werent going to venture out no how good of you to turn out on a night like this mrs thorpe appeared to think deliverance was the kind of local service you paid for in your council tax the singing voices shrilled and then shrank under a great clumping chord i can never say no to a party merrily said she shed her fakebarbour in the hall underneath she wore a shaggy black mohair jumper over another jumper her largest pectoral cross snuggling between the two layers susan thorpe looked relieved that she wasnt in a surplice but her husband chris obviously thought she ought to be this is a proper exorcism isnt it he was extremely tall with a shelf of bushy eyebrow and a premature stoop his wife glared they arent all bloody deaf in there you know lets get this clear merrily said it isnt going to be an exorcism at all an exorcism is an extreme measure only normally used for the removal of an evil presence how dyou know it isnt that i dont know what it is yet mr thorpe yet that was optimistic if it does turn out to be er malevolent we shall have to think again believe me if you had real malevolence here you would know always believed in belt and braces myself chris thorpe said gruffly go in hard if youve got rats you put down poison block all the holes merrily smiled demurely up at him how fortunate we all are that youre not an exorcist let it go chris susan thorpe pushed him into the passage leading to the private sitting room held open the door for merrily the truth is my husbands a sceptic he teaches physics oh where moorfield high susan said quickly oh dear a mere state school the thorpes were no more than latethirties yet had the style and attitudes of people at least a generation older you couldnt imagine this was entirely down to living with old people more a cultivated image over which theyd lost all control the sitting room was gloomily lit by a standard lamp with an underpowered bulb but it was much tidier tonight possibly the work of the plump woman who sat placidly sipping tea on her knees was a plate with a knife on it and cake crumbs this is my mother edna rees this is mrs merrily watkins mother shes dobbss successor the former housekeeper to the canon had raw red farmers cheeks and wore her hat indoors how many women did that these days she put down her cup and studied merrily at length unembarrassed you seem very young mrs watkins im not sure which way to take that mrs rees oh i think you are my dear mrs reess accent was far more local than her daughters herefordwelsh i think you are merrily smiled how do i get to talk to her in private susan thorpe frowned i dont know how long this operation normally takes you merrily but our venerable guest of honour is usually in bed by ten so theres going to be nobody on that floor until then nobody living said mrs rees blandly chris thorpe glanced at merrilys shoulderbag you have some equipment we dont have to be near any power points if thats what you mean chris why dont you go and do something else susan said through her teeth its my house ive a right to be informed but i dont feel you really believe its going to achieve anything merrily said its just that normally we like to do this in the presence of people who are a bit sympathetic a scattering of actual christians i mean are there any practising christians around what about the woman who saw him helen supervising the party susan said making sure it doesnt get too rowdy anyway she doesnt want to be involved christians no shortage of them but theyre the ones were trying not to alarm youre on your own im afraid merrily can i offer you a fortifying cigarette thanks afterwards i think if you could just point me at the spot dont fret mrs rees put down her cup and saucer ill go with you excellent did you ever go with canon dobbs mrs rees oh no mrs rees stood up shaking cake crumbs from her pleated skirt wasnt womans work was it jane and rowenna ordered coffee and doughnuts at the little chef between hereford and leominster jane nervously stirred an extra sugar into hers i didnt even tell her i was going out tonight its come to this separate lives rowenna was unsympathetic youre a woman now you live by your own rules yeah well jane looked through the window at the car park and a petrolstation forecourt she kind of liked little chefs because they sold maps and stuff as well giving you a feeling of being on a journey they werent travelling far this time however only to the pub where the psychic fair had been held there to meet with the gracious angela jane felt like macbeth going for his second session with the weird sisters like face it the first meeting had changed janes life she hadnt seen much of rowenna over the past couple of days then this morning the limegreen fiesta had slid into ledwardine market square while she was waiting for the bus shed immediately wondered whether to tell rowenna what dean wall had said if somebody was spreading that kind of filth about you you had a right to know but the minute she got in ro was like guess who called me last night jane abandoned half her doughnut pushed the plate away dont look so worried rowenna wore a new belted coat of soft white leather jane was wearing her school duffel coat people must think she was like some hitchhiker this genteel lady had picked up is she going to give us a reading i dont know rowenna said you scared of that i was so pissed off when i got up i forgot to do the sun thing so whats she going to do about that rowenna said quite irritably give you detention lighten up these people are not like with a napkin over her finger she dabbed a crumb from the edge of janes mouth listen you know what your problem is your mothers dreary anglicanism is weighing down on you so gloomy kitten you spend your whole life making sacrifices and practising selfdenial in the hope of getting your reward in heaven what kind of crappy deal is that yeah i know going to waste her whole life on that shit and they get paid peanuts dont they i mean that great old house and no money to make the most of it whats the point shes still attractive your old lady its understandable that it pisses you off i cant run her life no if it was me id feel it was my responsibility to kind of rescue her you know shes obviously got talent psychicsensitivity all that stuff but shes just pouring it down the drain jane laughed grimly oh sure i walk in one night and im like look mum i can get you out of this life of misery why dont you come along to my group one night and learn some cool spiritual exercises you underrate yourself jane you can be much more subtle than that rowenna said there was something new about her tonight an aggression and a lessthansubtle change of attitude remember listen to me you cannot change other people only yourself how many days ago did she say that come on rowenna said lets go a bulb blew merrilys right hand slid under her top sweater to grip the pectoral cross a bright anger flared inside her the lights were wallmounted lowpowered pearlized pearshaped bulbs two on each dusty bracket the brackets about eight feet apart along the narrow passage this was the one furthest away so that now the passage not very bright to begin with was dimmed by new shadows and no longer had a visible end easy in this lightless tunnel to conjure a moving shadow edna rees chuckled she was sitting in a pink wicker chair pulled out from a bathroom merrily was kneeling on the topmost of three carpeted steps leading up to the haunted east wing this was the third floor and once was attics this was a stakeout because you didnt simply arrive and go straight into the spiel spend some time with it huw owen said let it talk to you no of course they seldom actually talk and yet they do could she trust anything huw owen had told her theyd been here twenty minutes downstairs susan thorpe would be glaring at her watch always take your time huw said never let any bugger rush you where some of these customers come from there is no time dont rush dont overreact dont go drowning it in holy water merrilys bag contained only one small bottle of holy water for all the use that was her only other equipment was a christian deliverance study group booklet of suitable prayers most of which she knew off by heart anyway she was just going through the motions with no confidence that it would work it doesnt always work huws truest phrase it should be printed on the front of the deliverance handbook it should be the title of the deliverance handbook and where was she really how far had she come since the four am horror since the fleeing of her bedroom the vomiting in the kitchen sink the stovehugging the burning of lights till dawn and the oh christ why hast thou forsaken me there was then the putting on a brave face until the bus takes jane away interlude shed had the time hours to wash and dress carefully apply makeup to stand back from the mirror and recoil at the sight of age and fear pushing through like a disease then the staringatthephone phase the agitated for gods sake ring huw moments he keeps calling you he wants to explain so you should call him back it doesnt matter that he and dobbs conspired against you it doesnt matter what he did you need him you need him to take it away you need to call him now and say huw i am possessed i am possessed by the spirit of denzil joy yet it was not like that she might look rough in the mirror but her dull tired eyes were not the sleazedover eyes of denzil joy she didnt feel his greasy desires she didnt know him was not possessed by him haunted though certainly that useless to paper it over with psychology she was haunted by him he followed her had become her spiritstalker because shed failed that night in the general to redirect his malignant energy its residue had clung to her shed walked out of the hospital with denzil joy crawling and skulking behind her like some foul familiar he was hers now no one else had caught his disease and shed been unaware of it until once again insufficiently prepared she had been collecting herself for the assault on the crowkiller of st cosmas collecting her energy then into the cocktail had seeped his essence was that what happened had yesterdays holywater exercise been a failure because it had been directed only at the bedroom making the room safe rather than herself because she was the magnet right shed invited him sitting by his bedside holding his kippered hands the female exorcist attracting the incubus just as the priestincharge had invoked the lust of the organist whod flashed at her from a tombstone today shed concentrated on cleansing herself leaving the answering machine unplugged shed set out on a tour of churches a pilgrimage on the perimeter of hereford a full day of prayer and meditation finally parking in a back street near the cathedral school and slipping discreetly into the cathedral sitting quietly at the back for over an hour while tourists and canons she didnt know flitted through she had not called huw or sophie had resisted the impulse to enter church street and find lol she had left the answering machine unplugged at four pm shed returned to the vicarage and fed the cat and made a meal for jane and herself then one more visit to the church before the drive leaving plenty of time to the glades it was not about proving herself as an exorcist any more that was over this was about saving her ministry and her sanity leave sanity out of this sanity is relative edna rees looked along the passage without apparent apprehension to where the bulb had just blown surely thats not the first time its happened to you my dear merrily said nothing edna shifted comfortably in her wicker chair regular occurrence it was in gwynne street wherever he lived it happened so i learned bulbs blowing mightve put me off if id known before i took the job see but you get used to it merrily glanced along the line of bulbs the loss of one seemed to make all the others less bright as though they were losing heart there was probably a simple scientific explanation she should ask chris thorpe one week we lost five edna said i said you want to charge them for all these bulbs canon well expensive they are these days bulbs we tried those economy things cost the earth take an age to come on but theyre supposed to last ten years not in that house they didnt what else happened some nights edna pulled her skirt down over her knees you just couldnt heat that place to save your life even with all the radiators turned up the livingroom fire banked all day wasnt even that cold outside sometimes see and yet come the night just when youd think itd be getting nicely warmed up cold spots this passage had five doors all closed closed doors were threatening doors ajar with darkness within were terrifying merrily guessed she just didnt like doors otherwise there was no sense of disturbance no cold spots and certainly nothing like the acrid soulshrivelling stench which had gathered around stop she turned briskly to edna are you saying that he brought his work home edna looked at merrily from under her bottlegreen velvet hat her eyes were brown and shrewd over cheeks that were small explosions of split veins my dear his work followed him home she froze he told you that he never talked about his work edna said not to me not to anyone far as i know but when he came back sometimes it was like jack frost himself walking in what did he do about that not for me to know mrs watkins no merrily said obviously not i saw you with him the other week in the cathedral yes edna said calmly i thought it was you he was telling you to go away he said there was something he couldnt couldnt discuss there sharp ears you have is it none of my business you must think it is why here why did he want to get you out of the cathedral for the same reason he wanted me out of his house mrs watkins which is why are you asking me these questions because i cant ask him because hes lying in hospital apparently incapable of speech or at least he doesnt speak to the female nurses edna smiled any more than hed speak to me before his stroke he froze me out too on the grounds that i wasnt fit to do his job his sole communication with me was a cryptic note saying that jesus christ was the first exorcist there ive told you everything edna it was what she wanted merrily can i call you merrily please do merrily this began i dont know exactly when it began but it did have a beginning yes i started to hear him praying very loud and anguished i would hear him through the walls sometimes in what sounded like latin the words meant nothing to me he would shout them into the night and then backwards and forwards from the cathedral hed go at all hours in all weathers i would hear his footsteps in the street at two three in the morning going to the cathedral coming from there sometimes rushing he was like a man possessed i dont mean that in the i know and this was when he began cutting himself off from men too but especially from women would not even see his own sister he would put her off i was made to put her off when she wanted to visit he would not even speak to her on the telephone or to his granddaughters he has two granddaughters one of them brought her new baby to show him he saw her coming down the street and made me tell her he was away it made no sense to me hed been married for forty years does it make sense now i have been reading edna said about st thomas of hereford thomas cantilupe he would not have women near him either she fell silent but that was then merrily said that was the middle ages cantilupe was a roman catholic bishop they werent allowed to have i know that but where did the canon go when he went into the cathedral where did he have his stroke cantilupes tomb i cant tell you any more edna said you had better do what you came for in fact the routine for this kind of situation usually involved blessing the entire house room by room starting at the main entrance the blessing thus extended to all who passed in and out but susan thorpe was hardly going to permit that if you couldnt tie down a haunting to a specific incident in the history of the house then you at least should ask whats causing it to happen now is it connected to the present function of the house the kind of people living here old people feeling unwanted neglected passedover confused their senses fuddled yet susan thorpe wouldnt accommodate that kind of client any signs of dementia they have to go we arent a nursing home you could spend days investigating this and then discover it was a simple optical illusion merrily moved a little closer to the dead bulbs bracket i dont know what your soninlaw expected but stuffedshirt he is edna said i hope i die i do before i have to go into a place owned by people like them pretendcarers they are out of her daughters earshot ednas accent had strengthened poor old souls grit my teeth i will and stay here until i can find a little flat then you wont see me for dust good for you merrily said it was quiet no wind in the rafters they stood in silence for a couple of minutes and then merrily called on god who himself never slept to bless these bedrooms and watch over all who rested in them sholto her hands together head bowed even the piano was inaudible up here and in the silence her words sounded hollow and banal and ask you to bless and protect the stairs and the landings and the corridors along which the residents and the workers here must pass to reach these rooms she was visualizing the old ladies gathered around the piano two floors below so as to draw them into the prayer we pray in the name of our lord jesus christ that no spirit or shade or image from the past will disturb the people dwelling here we pray that these images or spirits will return to their ordained place and there rest in peace this covered both imprints and insomniacs although she didnt really think it could be an insomniac thered surely be some sign in that case some pervading atmosphere of unrest amen edna said merrily held her breath it had been known huw owen had said for the spirit itself to appear momentarily usually at the closing of the ritual before fading in theory for ever from the atmosphere mind its also been known to appear with a mocking smile on its face and then this is frightening appearing again and again bangbangbang in different corners of the room although it was hard not to flick a glance over her shoulder merrily kept on looking calmly in front of her under halflowered eyelids her body turned towards the darkness at the end of the passage from which drifted a musty smell of dust and camphor which may not have been there before she waited raising her eyes to the sloping ceiling with its blockedin beams and the filigree pouches of old cobwebs over the single curtained window she straightened her shoulders feeling the pull of the pectoral cross it was darker well seemed darker as though thered been a thirty per cent decrease in the wattage of the bulbs possibly something was happening something absorbing the energy something which had begun as she ended her first prayer a mild resistance was swelling now merrily began to sweat trying not to tense against the ballooning atmosphere she wondered if edna was aware of it or if she herself was the only focus her lone ritual beckoning it when she spoke again her voice sounded high and erratic if there is a an unquiet spirit we pray that you may be freed from whatever anxiety or obsession binds you to this place we pray that you may rise above all earthly ties and go in peace to christ that sounded feeble it lacked something it was too bloody reasonable belt and braces said the awful chris thorpe stooped like a crane and sneering yes ok there was something now that she was sure of that there should perhaps be a eucharist performed for the blessing of the house it could be conducted by the local vicar held under some pretext where all the residents could be invited those who were churchgoers would accept it without too many questions the atmosphere bulged she felt a sudden urgent need to empty her bladder may the saints of god pray for you and the angels of god guard and protect you either the air had tightened or she was feeling faint resist it she fumbled at the mohair sweater to expose the cross as she pulled at the sweater her palms began to mrs watkins merrily let go of the sweater her eyes snapped open edna rees was pointing to where at the top of the three shallow steps a figure stood please theres really no need for this it said angela turned over six cards in sequence and then quickly swept the whole layout into a pile but not before jane had seen the cards and recognized three of them death the devil the tower struck by lightning i cant do this angela said im afraid its rowennas fault it was the same pub where the psychic fair had been held but this time they were upstairs in a kind of boxroom pretty drab just the card table and two chairs rowenna had to perch on a chest of drawers her head inches from a dangling lightbulb with no shade im sorry angela she said i really didnt realize angela looked petite inside a huge sheepskin coat with the collar turned up she also looked casually glamorous like a movie star on location but she looked irritated too i suppose you werent to know but its one of my rules in a situation like this to know only the inner person i dont like to learn in advance about anyones background or situation because then if i see a problem in the cards i can know for sure that this information comes from the source and is not conditioned by my personal knowledge preconceptions or prejudices im sorry jane jane heard the rumble of barlife from the room below angela she said nervously thats not because you turned up some really bad cards and you dont think i can take it angela looked cross cards have many meanings according to their juxtaposition looked like a pretty heavy juxtaposition to me rowenna said with a hint of malice angela had already done a reading for rowenna her future was bound up with a friends needing to help this friend discover her true identity something of that nature rowenna had seemed bored and annoyed that the emphasis seemed to be on jane jane said what was it rowenna told you i told her what your mother was ok rowenna said on the phone last night it just came out priest or exorcist jane was transfixed for a moment by foreboding that reading was telling you something about me and mum wasnt it angela straightened the pack and put it reverently into the centre of a black cloth and then folded the cloth over it jane im not well disposed towards the church a friend of mine also a tarotreader was once hounded out of a particular village in oxfordshire because the vicar branded her as an evil infuence vicars can be such pigs rowenna said however angela looked up i make a point of never coming between husbands and wives or children and parents please will you tell me what jane angelas calm eyes held hers when i look at your inner being i sense a generous and uninhibited soul but if your mothers burden is to be constrained by dogma and an unhappy tradition you really dont have to share it well i know but mostly we get on since dad died weve supported each other you know admirable in principle like shes pretty liberal about most things but shes got this really closed mind about other things all right my last word on this angela began to exude this commanding stillness you found you were listening very hard it might be wise for both your sakes your own and your mothers for you to keep on walking towards the light dont compromise dont look back pray im going to say it pray that she follows in your wake you mean she needs to get out of the church these are your cards jane not hers or what whats going to happen to her if she stays with the church jane dont put me in a difficult position now how are things going at the pod the shadow on the stairs spoke in a surprising littlegirly voice arent you going to introduce me to your friend mrs rees this edna said with an overtone of resignation is miss anthea white athena miss ath e na white why arent you at the party then miss white at the piano with all those old ladies one finds that sort of gathering so depressing miss white moved out of the shadows she was small even next to merrily wearing a long blue dressinggown which buttoned like a cassock very tiny and elflike not as old as you expected in a place like this no more than seventy this is mrs watkins edna said miss white inspected merrily through brassrimmed glasses like the ones lol robinson wore only much thicker ah there it is you keep the clerical collar wellhidden mrs clergywoman i say youre very very pretty arent you thank you merrily said one had feared the new female ministers were all going to be frightful leatherfaced lezzies come and have a drink in my cell now edna said you know youre not supposed to have alcohol in your rooms oh mrs rees you arent going to blab to the governor are you its such a frightfully cold night light seemed to gather in her glasses far too cold for an exorcism perhaps you could excuse me edna said oh do you have to leave i rather understand that i do edna said tactfully how did you guess merrily asked feeling tired now oh dont be ridiculous miss white handed her an inch of whisky in what seemed to be a tooth glass you were hardly here to conduct a wedding her room was an odd little grotto up in the rafters with afghan rugs on the wall an aztecpatterned bedspread and a strange atmosphere merrily sensed of illusion twin bottles of johnnie walker lurked inside an ancient wooden radiocabinet there were several freestanding cupboards with locks the room was lit by an electrified pottery oillamp on a stand athena white went to sit on the high wooden bed her legs under her in an almost yogic position her dressinggown unbuttoned upwards to the waist no surgical stockings needed here merrily was sitting uncomfortably on a kind of camping stool near the door it put her head on a level with miss whites projecting knees miss white seemed relaxed like some tiny goddessfigure on a plinth now then she said what are you trying to do to sholto she let the name hang in the air until merrily repeated it sholto a mellower light gathered in miss whites glasses werent you able to see him merrily made no reply come on young mrs clergyperson either you did or you didnt lets say i didnt thats a shame perhaps you were erecting a barrier thats what your church does though isnt it very very sad throwing up barriers wrapping itself in a blanket of disapproval and yet miss whites head tilted in mild curiosity you are afraid i dont think so oh yes i can always detect fear youre not afraid of sholto are you am i to understand sholto is your ghost how perceptive of you to apply the possessive said miss white i must say its an awful job you have mrs clergyperson i never thought to see a woman doing it why not is it a specialist thing or have you simply been commandeered as thorpes prison chaplain miss white your church is like some repressive totalitarian regime everyone has a perfectly good radio set but you try to make sure they can only tune in to state broadcasts whenever the curtains accidentally open on some sublime vista you rush in and snap them shut again thats your job isnt it the soul police merrily said you should meet my daughter ye gods are you old enough to have a daughter lets drop the flattery miss white what are you trying to tell me what i am telling you miss white turned fullface to merrily and the light in her glasses became twin pinpoints is to leave him alone sholto have you any idea what its like in one of these places where all is grey and faded and romance resides solely in ones memory this rooms hardly grey and faded you like my eyrie its very cosy cosy said miss white in disgust pah but to get back to sholto thats your name for him is it that my dear clergyperson is his name you know his history some things about him theres nothing i dont know about him hes a randy sod sometimes and a frightful lounge lizard but very very charming a look of ronald colman but i suppose youre too young no ive seen some of those old films and you have seen him i take it what a stupid question and the other residents well i cant speak for all the hags sholtos quite choosy wont pinch the flabbier old buttocks what oh for heavens sake dont look like that girl he was a man of his time men used to pinch bottoms im sorry merrily was feeling cramped on the stool but what exactly are we talking about here who what exactly do you think sholto is what do i think he is a vaguely malevolent elf now white light spearing from her glasses what do you think he is an imprint an insomniac a volatile this is the terminology of the deliverance age miss white ill tell you what he isnt mrs clergygirl a finger wagging the face narrowing and the eyes almost merging behind the glasses he isnt doing any harm so you should go away and forget about him in this museum of memories sholto is necessary merrily drank more whisky to moisten her mouth would you mind if i had a cigarette certainly i would pull yourself together if you dont realize the importance of willpower in your job miss whites neck extended birdlike what is the matter with you child willpower merrily went cold it was you wasnt it i beg your pardon something was trying to stop me administering the blessing that was you wasnt it exercising your willpower oh what nonsense miss white sniffed delighted please merrily said wearily no more bullshit athena a selfsatisfied smile escaped beneath a little portcullis of teeth why dont you just ask yourself whats your name by the way merrily well ask yourself merrily was what you were doing appropriate was it polite sorry did you ask permission no you didnt it was like a police raid the way they always go in at dawn and bash someones door down its disgraceful were not criminals even if we are in prison and what has sholto done wrong well he hes dead he shouldnt be here miss whites magnified eyes glowed shes mad merrily thought look she said reasonably shouldnt he be free to move on thats what matters and what keeps him here that matters too because if what keeps him here is only the undying pull of the flesh one presumes perhaps were part of his karma broke a lot of young hearts in his time id guess now all he has to amuse him is a bunch of raddled old bags with their tits round their waists for him thats purgatory to use your terminology but were all of us far too old to be corrupted sholto is needed here to feed peoples fantasies hes not only harmless hes essential and thats an end to it ill keep him in order dont worry you can tell thorpe youve got rid of him now lets examine your own problem which i would guess is a good deal less benign what are you carrying around with you what look at you all hunched up against the cold youre cowering merrily instinctively straightened as best she could on her camping stool oh stop it youre cowering inside you cant hide that from me come here merrily found herself standing up come and sit on the bed come on im not going to touch you up athena white slid from the bed and leaned in her tubular robe over merrily peering closely into her eyes ye gods you are buggered up arent you merrilys legs felt suddenly quite weak dont struggle miss white said this is not right its not right at all look at me no focus on me girl thats better i want to see the inner person i feel youre normally quite strong but hes certainly depleted you who you tell me go on tell me his name i dont know what you tell me his name that ball of spiritual pus thats attached itself to you what is his name denzil joy thats better said miss white crow maiden by james lyden and his band had been ejected from the cellar studio in breinton lane lol got out of there too before dennys rage could do some damage by the time the band had been packed into their transit in the driveway he was making his excuses there was someone he needed to call which was true you can do it from here man dennys bald head was shining with angry sweat i cant lol was backing away out of the drive pulling on his armysurplus jacket no way he wanted to discuss this with denny until he had some background you denny was stabbing at the fog you know more than youre letting on wheres this come from whats this crow shit ill call you tomorrow and you can tell that fucking lyden hes finished denny bawled after him down breinton lane the transit van had reversed and was alongside lol now jamess welsh friend eirion at the wheel it stopped mr robinson eirion shouted for heavens sake what have we done he sounded shocked and frightened get your cocking head back in here lewis lol heard james say lazily the old man will sort it im sorry eirion said as the van pulled away lol wondered what his chances were of talking to dick before james did how old are you merrily thirtysix she sat at the bottom of the bed feeling a little unconnected slightly notquitehere she felt guilty because that was not unpleasant maybe the whisky or not when i was your age i knew nothing miss white said indeed i knew very little even when i retired from the civil service you would have been only a child then i however was very highpowered in those days or so i thought in reality i knew nothing it was only when i left london that i began to study in earnest she unlocked one of the cupboards threw open its double doors merrily thought oh my god books hundreds of books many stored horizontally on the shelves so as to stuff more in madame blavatsky rudolph steiner israel regardie dion fortune recent paperbacks wedged against yellowing tomes on meditation astrology the qabalah if the other cupboards were similarly stocked there must be several thousand books in this attic a lifetimes collection of esoteric reading a witchs cave of forbidden literature you wouldnt have prised jane out of here this side of breakfast time they know i have books in my cupboards miss white said but i rather imagine they consider me a subscriber to the lists of messrs mills and boon merrily thought how wary she herself used to be of janes guru the late folklorist lucy devenish god only knew what this old girl got up to when the lights were out one thing puzzled her miss white i cant what are you doing in a place like this ah yes why not the bijou black and white cottage why not the roses round the door and the persian cat in the window something like that because then my little clergyperson one would be obliged to prune the roses and feed the cat to shop for food and employ workmen to preserve the ancient timbers how much more space there is here inner space i mean as well as beautiful hills to walk in should one be overtaken by the need to commune with nature but how can you i dont know how to put this be surrounded by twittering biddies patronized by the dreadful thorpe that is simply the outer life the thorpes suspect i have enough money to buy the whole place so they dont pressure me all right when one gets very very annoyed with them one can be mischievous i bet while at the same time miss white smiled almost seraphically giving ones fellow inmates a welcome nostalgic frisson once in a while his name drifted serenely in the air between them sholto merrily said eventually aha how did you do it miss white selected from the bookshelves what turned out to be a stiffbacked folder and took out a yellowing photograph pasted on card this is him he wore a pinstriped suit with wide lapels his hair was dark and kinked his moustache trimmed to a shadow i bought him in a print shop in hay said miss white i liked his little twist of a smile no idea who he is or where he came from theres no name on the photo i thought he rather looked like a sholto merrily said im not going to ask you how you did this good because i should refuse to tell you you could find out easily enough if you studied its a very well established technique he isnt a ghost at all hes a projection do you know what i mean by that merrily said can i think about it projection psychic projection psychological projection a grey area come on huw what are we dealing with here we dont fully understand this but if we assume to put it simply that an imprint exists on a sensory wavelength or plane parallel to our own then it follows that some people are capable of tuning into that wavelength sometimes allowing the imprint to be transmitted in a way that renders it visible to others they may be able consciously or unconsciously to lend it the energy it needs to manifest they may even create their own imprint projecting it like a hologram if you come across one of these youre unlikely to be able to get rid of it through prayer or ritual alone youve got to stop the person from doing it merrily imagined in the part of the passage where the bulb had blown turning it into a black tunnel a man in a doublebreasted suit bringing a match to his cigarette exhaling the smoke towards her smoke which rose in a v a grey sardonic smile before shrivelling up into his own vapour like a silently bursting balloon youre thinking is this devilry arent you the light through miss whites glasses was intense and focused like when as a kid you used the sun through a magnifying glass to burn a hole in a newspaper i suppose i am would you settle for naughty id love to but i dont think id be allowed to you see the problem as i see it is that youve created an energy form separate from yourself but possessing a few atoms of your transferred intelligence perhaps how far is that from it acquiring a level of existence of its own a primitive level perhaps but then other possibly negative energies might be attracted to it and then you could have trouble thats not so easy to control a volatile a poltergeist or worse yes athena white sat down next to merrily i follow your argument its unlikely though especially if im here but im sorry athena but youre not always going to be here are you hell die when i die you reckon oh you are a pain mrs clergyperson all right ill consider it but itll be a frightful wrench for all of us im sure hell live on in all your memories ive said ill consider it athena snapped now tell me about denzil joy there was a rapping on the door and susan thorpe said miss white is there a woman in there with you im here susan merrily said miss whites been helping me i hope she can keep her mouth shut miss white said loftily you may for once count on it thorpe now leave us you know i cant drag the party out much longer well tell your husband to take his clothes off oh said susan thorpe they heard her footsteps recede that makes me feel quite queasy merrily said wait till youre as old as they are mrs white stood up merrily im very disturbed by this i think hes feeding off you dont if one doesnt face these things one cant take remedial action i suspect you havent been yourself for some days tired depleted prone to emotional outbursts well yes since you ask and also flulike symptoms vaguely sore throat blocked nose temperature i put it down to stress losing the will to fight it half the time i just want to run away i mean well to be quite honest this was going to be my last job as deliverance consultant diocesan exorcist you were giving it up an eyebrow rose above the spectacles while under different circumstances that is a decision one might wish to applaud i felt i couldnt cope i felt under attack from all kinds of different directions as you may well be this could be precisely whats happening how many people know of your appalling experience with this man i dont know the nurses involved my daughter jane my deliverance course tutor and canon dobbs of course as he appeared to have arranged it for you the sheer ignorance of the clergy dumbfounds me who else theres no one else ive told i dont think its not something i enjoy talking about whats the significance of that anyway if i mishandled the job in the hospital and ive let him in thats not their fault admittedly the idea of an unhappy spirit desperately clinging at the moment of death to a living person is not unknown particularly in a sexually charged situation but i think you must also consider the possibility of psychic attack by person or persons unknown which is far far more common than most people would imagine merely thinking ill of someone is its most basic form but we may be looking at something more complex in this instance if i were to lend you my copy of dion fortunes psychic selfdefence what are you trying to do to me im a christian as was fortune herself after her fashion merrily how soon after the incident at the hospital did this unclean presence make itself apparent i felt tired afterwards but that was natural id been up all night but i dont think i really became aware of it until i was called in to cleanse a desecrated church interesting this was during your service well i didnt actually it was before when you entered the church i merrily remembered standing outside the church talking to the policemen with a stiffness and a clamminess in her vestments had she felt that in the car on the way there possibly think back merrily who were you with when you first experienced something amiss policemen i dont know cant think im mixed up and a bit anxious because im sitting here a minister of the church unburdening myself to a practising occultist who by force of willpower has created a haunted house who would you normally go to for spiritual help huw my course tutor who was in the church with me when i exhibited what must have seemed to him like many of the symptoms of demonic possession in which case why the blue blazes its complicated all right athena white placed a hand on merrilys knee it didnt feel like a cloven hoof go home pull your bed into the centre of the room and draw a pentacle you have got to be joking all right a circle in salt or even chalk around the bed perform whatever rite your religion allows but supplement it when youre lying in bed by visualizing rings of bright orange or golden light around you and above you so that you are enclosed in an orb of light keep that in your mind constantly until you fall asleep if you awake in the night visualize it at once intact this should bring you unmolested to the morning a circle dont be afraid of it there is but one god consider it heavenly light angelic huw and dobbs merrily frowned she always knew it had to be something like this secondly take the robes vestments you were wearing in the church when you were spiritually assaulted and burn them you could try to bless them or sprinkle them with holy water but its really not worth it get rid of them merrily supposed this made sense but that is not enough and you know it merrily until you trace it to its source and eradicate it youre always going to be a magnet for the obscene advances of this earthbound essence this denzil joy one can almost see him now bloating your aura you absolutely cannot afford to rest indeed you will not rest because of who you are until you put him to rest yes i was going to ring you dick lyden said agitated the boys back already and hes not terribly happy hes not happy lol dragged the phone over to the armchair dick said laurence it was my understanding that dennys studio was a proper professional operation not some mickey mouse outfit you know what this is costing me dont you lol assured dick that while this was not the biggest studio around it was one in which he personally would be delighted to record dick said as long as it didnt bloody well blow up presumably it didnt blow up lol told him denny blew up pressured beyond reasonable resistance by the song they were laying on him when denny had heard enough of it wires became detached im not paying the man to be a bloody critic dick said i dont like any damned song they do either and i havent even heard them lol said do you and ruth talk about your work much over the family supper comparing notes that kind of thing what the hell has for instance did you talk much about moon in front of james dicks voice dropped like it had been fastfaded what are you saying lol said james as you may have gathered isnt satisfied with an ep he wants an album denny and me we were a bit underwhelmed by the quality of what wed heard so far we suggested the boys run through the rest of their material so wed know what we were looking at most of it wasnt wonderful either to be fair it wasnt badly played and the harmonies were as neatly dovetailed as you might expect from newly retired cathedral choirboys it was the material derived from the work of seconddivision bands which were already derivative of other seconddivision bands twenty years earlier that didnt make it denny had in reality told lol behind the protection of thick glass that they would make a recording of such pristine quality that the deficiencies in the area of compositional talent would stand out like neon well jamess mate eirion isnt entirely insensitive really dick said his old man runs welsh water eirion can tell denny isnt impressed so after about three routine powerchord numbers he gets the band into a huddle and then he and james sit down with acoustic guitars and they go into this quiet little ballad which james introduces as the crow maiden perfect crystal harmonies you could hear every word get to the point i tend to remember lyrics remembered the last verse anyway so i wrote it down lol began to unfold a john barleycorn paper bag its really subtle as you can imagine still youll probably get the drift you ready oh for heavens sake lol held up the paper bag and recited found your refuge in the past you hid beneath its shade and when you knew it couldnt last you took your life with an ancient blade crow maiden crow maiden youre fadin away would you like that again you could hear dicks hand squeezing the phone the little shit dick said faeces and gangrene friday morning six am a cold morning moon through new glass and a smell of putty in the vestry at ledwardine where merrily stood before the wardrobe frozen with indecision she had the zippo the zippo would do it what are you waiting for she hadnt slept well but she had slept until five with all right yes the bed in the middle of the room inside a circle of salt all of which shed swept into a dustpan before she left the vicarage in case she didnt return before first light and jane came looking for her popped her head around the bedroom door and god forbid she was half ashamed half embarrassed and had as soon as she arose knelt before the window and apologized to god if he had been offended by the circle and the salt but she was in the end helplessly grateful for the first time in days she had not awakened feeling ill congested soiled or worse grateful to whom though shed prayed for a peaceful night prayed for the soul of denzil joy but it was to her disquiet the orangegold orb of athena white which had coloured her dreams was she balancing at the top of the slippery slope into new age madness into jane country and if she burned the cassock and surplice last night in her state of compliance at the glades half hypnotized by the extraordinary miss white this had seemed entirely logical this morning shed been dwelling on it with increasing horror a bonfire of these vestments was wholly sacrilegious the most explicit symbolic rejection of her vows shed prayed hard over this one kneeling under the window summoning the blue and the gold oh jesus give me a sign that this is acceptable in your eyes please god dont take it the wrong way infantile god listened to your heart you will not rest until you put him to rest oh miss white so plausible this career civil servant very highpowered who had committed herself to an old folks home to develop her inner life damned woman susan thorpe had said afterwards i could have sworn she was downstairs with the others but you did manage to complete your exorcism no problem merrily had assured her miss white was a surprisingly devout believer one god angelic light a dabbler a minister of god was following the advice of a mad dabbler all the way to new age hell now merrily stood in the vestry with no lights on and her torch switched off after sunday nights breakin ted probably had vigilantes watching out for signs of intruders she felt like a thief the taking and destruction of priests vestments wilful damage and worse burn them where on the drawingroom fire in the garden like a funeral pyre of her faith it was well meant she had no bad feelings at all about athena white as a human being and the advice was well meant and it was insidiously irresistible last night after jane had gone to bed and merrily had been standing at the sink filling her hot water bottle and contemplating the night ahead smelling his smell feeling his fingers scritchscratch hearing the ratchet wrench as his body snapped upright in its deathbed the tubes expelled pippop and now remembering how ethel the cat who until this week had habitually slept at the bottom of merrilys bed had once again padded discreetly and faithlessly up the stairs after jane it was then that shed reached into the cupboard for the drum of kitchen salt taking it with her into the sculleryoffice where shed followed the mad womans next instruction trace it to its source and called the alfred watkins ward to ask eileen cullen for the address of the widow joy and eileen puzzled asking her is there a problem there merrily you think would it not be a case of blessed relief for the poor woman sometimes it doesnt work like that merrily had said she may even be feeling guilt that she wasnt there at the end that was my fault so help me for not telling the poor cow until it was over all right merrily whatever your secret agenda is you made a good case you know your way to bobblestock district shed find it as soon as jane was off the premises she would go and find mrs joy she would take the whole deliverance kit and fresh vestments in the car boot but not these vestments she opened the wardrobe and pulled them down theyd been washed of course since the night at st cosmas she hung the cassock and surplice over the arm that held the torch still not switched on she opened both doors wide and felt around to make sure shed taken the correct garments which was when she found the mans suit what she pushed the torch inside the wardrobe and switched it on the suit was on a hanger pushed to the end of the rail so that it was not visible if you opened only one door merrily pushed her head inside to examine the suit it was dark green with a thin stripe of light brown made of some heavyweight material and well worn she touched it it felt damp or moist more like merrily screamed she now had her sign she stood retching in the moonwashed vestry the thin smell the suit gave off had reminded a doctor at the general hospital of cat faeces and gangrene it was around eight cloudy but fogfree when lol spotted the boy in cathedral school uniform lurking below in church street he went down and the boy came over a stocky darkhaired boy with an unexpectedly bashful smile it was eirion lewis son of the boss of welsh water hoped you might be about mr robinson i just didnt really feel like going to school until i knew where we stood you know come on up lol said once inside eirion went straight to the guitar wow is that a washburn could i lol handed eirion the washburn and the boy sat down with it picking out the opening riff to the crow maiden i have to play bass in the band because james is rather better on this than me like mccartney lol recalled really he was the worst guitarist in the band so he wound up on bass brilliant bassplayer actually i you know i didnt mean what i said about how he should have been shot you feel youve got to keep up with jamess cynicism sometimes like hes younger than me you know right lol said i mr robinson i really dont have much time i just sort of eirion hung his head over the guitar i dont know what we did but we did something didnt we i mean this is really important to me this recording i dont want to blow it you know well it was that song lol said this song the crow maiden which of you actually wrote it we both did i do the tunes james does the words like he gives me a poem or something and i work a tune around it or the other way about you know its a bit more er resonant than the other stuff isnt it yes it is james tell you where he got the idea i assumed he made it up or pinched it from some ancient fairport convention album or something actually you know what can i say i mean james is a shit isnt he oh lol tilted his head why he just is isnt he he kind of tells lies a lot enjoys getting up peoples noses does kind of antisocial things for the hell of it well lately anyway god this is stupid of me youre his dads mate arent you you used to kind of work with him right oh well thats over now lol said nothing you say will get back to jamess old man ok the crow maiden its about dennys sister sorry she committed suicide last weekend she cut her wrists with an ancient blade eirions fingers fell from the frets mmm lol said i can see you didnt know that at the front door jane sniffed whats burning out there i cant smell anything flower its probably from the orchard gomers been clearing some undergrowth right jane inspected her mum in the first bright daylight of the week youre looking better thanks pressure off now maybe youre going to miss the school bus jane said casually you know if things have loosened up a bit mum you really ought to take the opportunity to think about your longterm future its not a problem flower ill be going to heaven god said jane you christians are so simplistic bye work hard flower when the kid was out of sight merrily went around the side of the house to check out the garden incinerator the vestments were ashes she made the sign of the cross over them then she burned the suit merrily called directory enquiries for the reverend barry ambrose in devizes wiltshire she rang his number im sorry hes just popped round to the church a woman said pleasantly hell be back for his breakfast any minute im stella his longsuffering wife can i get him to call you if you could tell him i really wont keep him a minute thats no problem hes talked a lot about you merrily since you were on that course together he thinks youre awfully plucky well thats a common illusion has barry done much in the way of deliverance so far only bits and bobs you know hes still quite nervous about it to be honest and you still feeling my way merrily said waiting for barry ambrose to call back she went to the bookcase in the hall where they kept the local stuff she plucked out one shed bought in the cathedral shop st thomas cantilupe bishop of hereford essays in his honour she hadnt yet had time to open it i have been reading edna rees had said about st thomas of hereford in the book several historians explored aspects of the saints life and the effect hed had on hereford enormous apparently merrily began to read about cantilupes final months in after his dispute with the archbishop of canterbury john pecham this seemed to be a bureaucratic argument about one going over the others head further fired up by a clash of temperament it had ended with cantilupe being excommunicated and travelling to italy to appeal personally to the pope on the way back exhausted hed collapsed and died at dusk on august while still in italy as was the custom really christ the body was boiled to remove the flesh from the bones the flesh was buried at the monastery church of san severo the heart and bones were brought back to england by cantilupes steward john de clare the heart was then kept at ashridge in buckinghamshire at a college of canons while the bones came back to hereford where they began to attract pilgrims thousands of them when news of the miracles spread cures of the crippled and the blind it became the most important shrine in the west of england and it made this comparatively remote cathedral very wealthy although several of the bones seemed to have been removed as relics before this it was not until the shrine was destroyed in the reformation on the orders of henry viii that they were dispersed the book recorded without further comment a story that during the journey from italy the persecuted bones had bled barry ambrose called back she liked barry he was inoffensive hamsterish an oldfashioned vicar hey merrily you heard about clive wells the lofty oldmoney priest whod sneered at huw should i have hes packed it in said barry what deliverance the lot hes apparently planning to emigrate to canada with his family had some experience he wouldnt talk about to anybody now he cant even go into the church cant even pass a church without going to pieces so they say god makes you think doesnt it merrily what can i do for you it was she admitted a long shot theres a girl moved into this area from wiltshire salisbury oh theyre very doubtful about me in salisbury you know what its like yeah no its just if you happened to hear anything i dont even know what im looking for this girls called rowenna napier they left the area earlier this year it was suggested to me that there was something funny in her past which might not seem very funny to a church minister im sorry thats it im afraid barry was unfazed well ive got a name thats a start i suppose i can only roll it along the cathedral close and see if anybody picks it up could you give me a day or two so hows it going merrily really she heard the boxy sound of him covering the mouthpiece i tell you it scares seven shades out of me sometimes thank god you said that barry stella gave me the impression you hadnt been doing too much all she knows barry said with an audible shudder viv arrived at the shop with a hereford times not too much about moon thank gawd they havent picked up on her fathers suicide so thats a mercy maybe nobodys worked there long enough to remember or else denny had refused to talk to them lol thought and they were sitting on it till it all came out at the full inquest viv said oh yeah i talked to my friend who still goes to the pod its bizarre but these two girls turn up out of nowhere your friends kid and an older one right patricia who is like mother superior in the group says to make this jane feel at home shes a special person they have to take care of her shes got problems at home this kind of stuff problems at home i only mention this like maybe you dont know as much as you think you got something happening with the mother is that it was that her the other day when you ran outside lol didnt answer viv had tossed the hereford times on the counter and hed just noticed the lead headline crow sacrificed in county church horror he snatched up the newspaper nevermore do you know how many messagesi have left on your machine in the past two days sophie demanded angrily surely even if you were ill ill yes shed been ill she saw that now merrily sat at the desk in the office with the d on the door nothing had altered and yet everything had the white winter sun lit the room there were things to do im very sorry sophie ive behaved very badly it could have been entirely psychological if her vestments were tainted however slightly with denzils insidious musk it would have a subliminal effect expanding at moments of high emotional stress or extreme sensitivity like the buildup to an exorcism in a country church into a near manifestation and it would then take root and arise again at times like emerging from sleep when the subconscious was in freeflow whatever someone out there had tried to break her but now deep in her solar plexus she was feeling the warm pulsing thrill of redemption sophie wore a royalblue twopiece woollen suit her white hair was tightly bunned she looked angry and perhaps overtired but her eyes also displayed a small sparkle of hope shed become like a mother merrily realized merrily about your resignation email oh yes has the bishop received that yet she heard the unconcern in her own voice it didnt really matter any more whether or not she was the official deliverance consultant that was a spurious manufactured title which conferred no special powers it was just a beacon for the rateyes in the dark the bishop doesnt read his email sophie said i read his email and print out the relevant items and put them on his desk this is yours i think what would you like me to do with it she placed in front of merrily a sheet of a dear bishop after long consideration merrily saw what sophie wanted how she could make sophie much happier could you wipe it she said easily i wasnt really myself was i sophie gripped the desk tightly and then let go sophie merrily stood up took her arm i didnt want you to go and leave me alone here sophie swallowed sometimes i feel im going mad that doesnt sound like you i know capable reliable old sophie total commitment to the cathedral thats the problem isnt it what is something in the cathedrals going wrong and im afraid michael merrily sighed might as well say it sophie he cant see it can he he wouldnt feel it because he has no basic faith or spirituality isnt that what youre saying that the cathedrals not safe in micks hands treason sophie sophie brought a finger to her brow as if to halt a fastescaping thought we have to talk merrily the phone rang on her desk in the other office sure merrily said whenever she went in search of lol in john barleycorn the large triballooking woman regarded her with some interest you must be janes mum you know jane not personally the big woman said with an enigmatic smile but ive got daughters so i know the problem is there a problem what the hell had lol been saying merrily rocked inside with a blinding urge to wipe away all the rumours and gossip and deceit that had gathered in the days of the fog and oh there was so much to say to jane and so much to bring out after a week in which merrily had felt so scared of her own daughter that the only way shed been able to approach this issue was behind the kids back the shop woman smiled to herself heavy with superior knowledge wheres lol merrily snapped oh the woman recoiled i think hes over in the central library thats where he said he was going thank you the day had taken a sharp dive into december dusk she became aware for the first time of christmas lights little golden santas racing across broad street on their sleighs and the warm red lanterns winking a welcome to wallets everywhere christmas in three weeks goodwill to all men school nativity play in the church afternoon carol service midnight eucharist the churchwardens beadily monitoring those big festive collections courtesy visits glass of sherry for the vicar celia not too much dont want you falling out of the pulpit haha and the core of cold and loneliness at the heart of it all the huddling together with drunken bonhomie and false laughter to ward off the dark she stopped outside the library the lights still blinking universal panic over parties unorganized presents unbought for merrily they emphasized a core of darkness in the little city of hereford deep and intense she stood amid the rushhour shoppers and she felt it in her solar plexus where the ghost of denzil joy the ghost that wasnt had formed an interior fog and now it was clear lol was coming down the library steps with a big brown book under his arm merrily santalight dancing across his goldframed glasses lol she wanted to shout im all right im clear and rush into his arms and i still cant go to bed with you we priests dont do that kind of thing we have to talk merrily suddenly everybody wanted to talk me too she told him still on that strange sensitive high lets go to church the vicar of all saints had a bigger more regular congregation than the cathedrals this was because theyd cleared a big space at the rear of the medieval citycentre church and turned it into a restaurant a good one too it might not work in a village like ledwardine but it had worked here this church was what it used to be in the middle ages what it was built to be the centre of everything it was good to hear laughter in a church see piles of shopping bags and children who maybe had never been in a church before gazing in halffearful fascination down the nave towards the secret holy places they carried their cups of tea to a table lol still had the big brown book under his arm thats the holy bible isnt it merrily said go on i can take it excite me not lol put down the book exactly on the spine it said black on gold ross pagan celtic britain damn merrily said so close the crow lol said what you didnt tell me about the bloody crow they spread all over the altar at that little church should i have lol opened the book didnt anyone give a thought to why they would sacrifice a crow lol we just want to keep the bastards out were not into understanding them maybe you should talk to the social services crows and ravens lol said feared and venerated by the iron age celts mostly feared for their prophetic qualities but not like the youregoingtowinthelottery kind of prophecy quoth the raven nevermore right that kind of prophecy harbingers of darkness being black the persecution we still inflict on anything or anybody black how bloody primitive we still are in celtic folk tales it says here crows and ravens figured as birds of illomen or as a form taken by antichristian forces merrily sat up theres a story in here lol said of how as late as the seventeenth century a congregation in a house in the north of scotland that was used for christian worship how the congregation was virtually paralysed by the appearance of a big black bird sitting on a pillar emanating evil nobody could leave that house for over two days they became so screwed up that it was even suggested the householders son should be sacrificed to the bird this isnt a legend then why if it inspires so much primitive awe would anyone dare to sacrifice a crow possibly to take on its powers of prophecy whatever thats been known to happen this makes me suspicious merrily said youre doing my job for me why are you doing my job because of something that happened with moon and he told her about the disturbed woman standing on the iron age ramparts at dinedor with her hand inside a dead crow merrily thinking drank a whole cup of tea then poured more she stared down the nave into the old mystery lol said the way she died i dont believe she would have killed herself like that i cant believe in the reasons like the psychological answer that she was locked into this fatal obsession so when she found out how her father died it all came to a head or the possible psychic theory that maybe dennys been turning over in his mind some lingering dark force which periodically curses his family with madness and the only way you can make sure of avoiding it is to stay the hell away from dinedor hill that can happen lol we believe that can happen psychology and parapsychology are so very close but i dont necessarily buy a connection between what happened to moon and the crow sacrifice at st cosmas no lol said maybe youre right maybe i just saw the headline in the hereford times at the wrong time crows were on my mind then he closed the book you look better merrily tired but better tired i suppose i must be i didnt realize ive been dashing about oh i took back my letter of resignation figured you might something gave like you found out about this guy huw and old dobbs no i still dont know about that but i will very soon and jane inquiries are in hand lol said ive had viv in the shop looking into the pod ah that explains her apparently you might find this interesting not to say insulting the women were told to look after jane that she was a special person with er a problem background merrily stiffened a special person she said that a special person with a problem background where did that come from who told these women all this dont know merrily breathed out slowly that night lol dreamed he awoke and went into the living room and stood at the window gazing down into capuchin lane which was murky with predawn mist no lights anywhere he knew she was there even before he saw her grey and sorrowful the dress meeting the mist in furls and furrows her eyes as black as the eyes of the crumbling skulls she held one in each hand id like to sleep now lol she said but the tone of it had changed there was anguish he awoke cold and numb in ethels chair he didnt remember going to sleep there one sad person she slept through incredibly until almost ten without any circles of golden light without come to think of it any protective prayers only mumbles of gratitude as she fell into bed why didnt you wake me because you were like megaknackered jane said you obviously needed it merrily registered the toast crumbs jane had breakfasted alone there was weak sunshine through mist it looked cold out there nobody rang nobody not even ted not huw owen shed called huw four times last night to keep herself in line for lastcaller if he should try uhhuh jane shook her head you need a new dressinggown by the way you look like a baglady not annie howe either the icemaiden of west mercia cid you cant be that desperate for friends we commune occasionally jesus said jane itll be girls nights out at the police social club next and guest spots on identity parades jane what merrily pulled out a dining chair sit down why because we need to talk i cant im meeting rowenna in town when for lunch at slaters then were going christmas shopping but i wanted to get into town a couple of hours early because i havent got her anything yet ok youre spending a lot of time with rowenna arent you meaning like more than with you or even boys merrily said lightly janes eyes hardened thats because were lesbians you going to sit down flower i have to go sit down jane slumped sullenly into the chair why do you hate rowenna i dont know rowenna ive only met her once shes a significant person jane said in what way in a way that id expect you to actually understand like she has a spiritual identity she seeks wisdom most of the people at school teachers included think selfdevelopment is about alevels and biceps rowennas a religious person i think weve had this discussion before jane said loftily religion implies organized religion anything else therefore must be dis organized religion ah a fleeting farawayness in the kids eyes how wrong can you get so tell me jane looked at her unblinking tell you what tell me how wrong i can get tell me why im wrong again jane raised her eyes it has to be a personal thing right you have to work at it make a commitment to yourself i mean going to church singing a couple of hymns listening to some trite sermon thats just like oh if i do this every week endure the tedium for a couple of hours godll take care of me well thats got to be crap hasnt it thats the sheep mentality and when you end up in the slaughterhouse youre thinking hey why didnt i just get under the fence that time merrily felt shadows deepening so youre under the fence are you flower jane shrugged only i had this anonymous letter merrily said was it sexy was it from one of those sad old guys who want to get into your cassock ill show it to you merrily went over to the dresser plucked the folded letter out of her bag handed the letter to jane glimpsing the words brazenly endangering her soul as the kid unfolded it brazenly endangering her soul and yours jane said by mixing with the spiritually unclean well well unsigned naturally when exactly did this come few days ago so youve been kind of sitting on it right ive had one or two other things to think about as you well know jane held the letter between finger and thumb as though it might be infected burn it if you like merrily said oh no jane carefully folded the paper her eyes glowed like a cats i dont think so im going to hunt down this scumbag and when i find out i think merrily said more sharply than she intended that youre missing the point you went to this socalled psychic fair without even mentioning it why would you have wanted to come along maybe i would actually yeah like some kind of dawn raid by the soul police i accept merrily kept her temper which would have gone out of the window long ago if theyd been having this discussion last night that most of the selfstyled new age people at these events selecting her words like picking apples from an iffy market stall and finding they were all rotten are perfectly nice wellmeaning deluded idiots jane i cant believe this jane leapt up some shrivelledup pofaced old fart sends you a poisonpen letter and you secrete it away in your bag and save it up probably sneaking the occasional peep to stoke up your holierthaneverybastardformilesaround righteous indignation sit down flower no i thought you were behaving funny youre bloody terrified arent you its not like how dare this old fart point the finger at my daughter oh no youre crapping yourself in case this gets back to michael and you get like decommissioned from the soul police jesus you are one sad person mother jane merrily steadied herself on the aga rail would you come back and sit down then we can talk about this like adults you mean like priest and sinner i dont think so merrily im going upstairs to my apartment im going to light some candles on my altar and probably offer a couple of meaningful prayers to my goddess then im going out im not sure when ill be back light a couple of candles i see maybe four they say its always so much more effective jane said coming from a vicarage really jane turned away and opened the door to the hall thats what they say at the pod is it merrily said the phone rang in the kitchen just then and half a second later in the sculleryoffice and it went on and on and merrily didnt dare answer it because she knew jane would be out of the room before she reached the receiver youd better get that it might be annie howe jane said and merrily could see she was trembling with rage she must she mustve already taught you everything she knows about spying on people undercover investigations the soul police will never look back you fucking nosy bitch right thats it merrily bounced off the stove and into the middle of the room you think youre incredibly cool and clever and in control of your own destiny and all this crap the truth is youre either a complete hypocrite or youre unbelievably naive and has it never entered your head that the only reason this little sect is interested in you is because of me and what i me me me me jane screeched you are so arrogant you are soooo disgustingly ambitious that you cant see the truth which is that nobody gives a shit for your church or the pygmies strutting around the cathedral close not realizing what a total joke they are your congregations are like laughable in twenty years youll all be preaching to each other you dont matter any more you havent mattered for years im just like embarrassed to tell anybody what you do you know that you embarrass me to death so just get off my back the phone stopped get out merrily said fair enough jane smiled i may be away some time whatever you like in fact maybe you could go and stay at rowennas for a few days im sure there are lots of spare bedrooms in colonel napiers mansion jane paused in the doorway meaning what only that you may not know as much about your very best friend as you thought you did youve been investigating her too youve been checking up on rowenna tears spurted into janes eyes and merrily took a step towards her flower please you keep away from me you keep away you dont care how low you sink do you to protect your piddling little reputation get a life jane janes smile was horribly twisted oh i will i will certainly get a life she was whispering now you see theres no way i could ever trust you again and if you cant trust somebody whats the point i dont have to stay at rowennas there are loads of places i can live i know lots of people now like really good people that would be really stupid youre sixteen years old thats right at least you can count and these are not good people what the fuck would you know merrily jane prodded a finger at the air between them ill tell you something id rather sell my soul to the devil than spend one more night in this mausoleum all right merrily said stop right there i dont care what you say about me but dont ever say that just dont ever say it jane shrugged like come and get me satan she tossed back her hair which wasnt really long enough to toss and went out into the hall and merrily heard her snatching her coat from the peg and then the creak and judder of the front door merrily stood in the centre of the kitchen after a while she was aware of ethel the black cat mewing pitifully at her feet she picked up the cat and saw that the mist outside was thickening the phone rang again shed been hoping the first call would be from huw but now she hoped it was lol she needed to tell somebody merrily its barry ambrose oh hello barry she sat down at her desk in the sculleryoffice hoping just at this moment that he was calling to say he hadnt found out a thing i found out about that girl merrily rowenna i hope shes not too close to you thats all barry said part four squatter dark hand the fog was worse in leominster which was why the bus was late the driver explained fog just when you thought youd got rid of it then again if the bus hadnt been late jane would have missed it thanks to the reverend bloody watkins she slumped down near the back and felt sick that was it wasnt it that was really it there was no way she could go back there tonight outside the bus windows the hills had disappeared the view of fields extended about fifty yards and then all you saw were a few treeskeletons why had she done this to herself why hadnt she just sat it out mumbled a few apologies about going to the psychic fair and but that wouldnt have worked would it mum knew about the pod how the hell did she find that out was the pod leaky had it been infiltrated by christians this was just like so totally unfair jane felt sad and shabby in her old school duffel coat hadnt even had a chance to find something else if youre storming out you had to do it like now you couldnt blow the whole effect by going up to your apartment to change into your tight black sweater and your nicer jeans or collect your new fleece coat ironic really this morning doing her salute to the eternal spiritual sun shed thought what is this really achieving and thinking of the women in the pod how basically sad most of them looked and yet the fact that they were so sad completely discredited mums crap about them only being interested in jane because her mother was this bigtime church of england exorcist this was all so megastupid if the bitch hadnt been so totally offensive the two of them could have sorted this out that remark about jane having no boyfriend that was just like well out of order boyfriend like who dean wall danny gittoes the really humiliating aspect of this was that mum herself not long out of leather pants and tops made out of heavyduty pondliner had been pregnant at nineteen so presumably had been putting it about for years by then life was such a pile of shit when they crawled into the bus station behind tesco jane didnt want to get off she had her money with her but she didnt feel like shopping especially while walking around with rowenna in all her designer items and jane in her darkblue school duffel what was she going to buy rowenna anyway that wouldnt cause mutual embarrassment she made her way out of the bus station and across the car park hoping there was nobody from school around which was too much to hope for on a saturday close to christmas everybody came into hereford on saturday mornings where else was there to go the fog was cold and she didnt even have her scarf tonight it would probably be freezing fog suppose rowenna couldnt organize her a room what would happen then it was a lie natch that jane knew loads of people she didnt know anyone in the pod well enough to beg a bed worstcase scenario some shop doorway in the maylords orchard precinct or did they have iron gates on that and then at two am some dopehead comes along and rapes you ok if it came to it she probably had enough money to get a room in a hotel not the green dragon obviously maybe something between that and the pubs where the junkies went to score funny how homely old hereford took on this new and dangerous aspect when you were alone and destined to stay alone possibly for ever she turned down where the car park doglegged and the path led through evergreen bushes to the archway under the buildings and into widemarsh street and then rowenna laughed lightly and said why dont we do it here wed be hidden by the fog that would be pretty cool huh jane stopped there were cars parked fairly tightly here with thick laurel bushes just behind them you could tell there were two people in the bushes standing up locked together jane backed up to the edge of the main car park vehicles were coming up out of the tunnel from the underground part and one of them hooted at her to get out of the way so she moved to the edge of the undergrowth and flattened herself against the wall they probably would never spot her from the bushes as she couldnt see them properly either she wouldnt have known it was rowenna but for the voice she could see the guy better because he was pretty tall and from here it looked like most of his tongue was down rowennas throat dont you think this has appalled me too dick lyden was raking his thick grey hair i can only offer you my profoundest apologies and assure you that it wont happen it fucking has happened denny snarled his back to the door of lols flat as if dick might make a break for it its done it exists if i hadnt been listening to the words which i usually dont id be down as producing it denny dont do this to me dick pleaded dont do it to you lol was sitting on the window ledge he had no meaningful contribution to make to this how old is your boy dick said to denny eleven and a half id like to think you didnt have this to come denny but at some stage in his adolescent years youll wonder what kind of monster youve foisted on the world as well as trying to think what you did to become the object of his undying hatred sensing that dick was actually close to tears lol said did you find out how he came to write that song oh well dick escaped gratefully into anger an artist an artist gathers his inspiration wherever he may find it art is above pity art bows to no taboos you know the kind of balls they spout at that age i dont i dont actually know whats the matter with him lately hes become remote hes arrogant he sneers he does small spiteful things a complete bastard in fact lol said thats your professional assessment then and denny finally smiled the point is lol continued that the song isnt going to be heard any more because eirion lewis says hell refuse to play it hes not a bad kid it seems he glanced apologetically at dick a bit older than james so perhaps hes come through the bastard phase in the final analysis dick said this is my fault ruth and i discuss cases and quite often the boys pottering about with his walkman on and one thinks hes not interested little swine was probably making notes its a i suppose a diverting tale isnt it its a family tragedy denny growled denny i have learned a lesson but the crows man how the fuckd he know about the crows its an old celtic harbinger of death lol said quickly because hed never actually told denny about the crow denny looked dazed for a second then shook himself like he was trying to shed clinging shreds of the past he moved away from the door his earring swinging less menacingly all right ill let them back in so long as lol turns the knobs dick looked at lol ok lol said puzzled about what denny had meant how the fuckd he know about the crows and still wondering how james could have been so crazy as to sing that song blatantly in dennys face like the boy needed to see how far he could go how much he could get away with how badly he could hurt thanks dick said humbly thank you both you know i this is going to sound a bit cranky coming from a shrink but i am a christian sort of shrink and i feel that becoming boy bishop will somehow help to straighten the lad out what is this boy bishop balls anyway denny said you hear about it read bits in the times but i never take much notice more people ought to take notice or well lose it like so many other things its a unique example of the church affirming christs compassion for the lowly but its always a kid from the cathedral school denny pointed out how lowly is that its symbolic dates back to medieval times the boy is bishop until christmas but doesnt do much gives a token sermon on his enthronement makes the odd public appearance used to be taken on a tour of churches in the county but i think theyve dropped that it also illustrates the principle of the humble being exalted its about the humble and the meek something like that the humble and the meek lol said thats why they chose james all right i know i know i suppose they chose james because he was a leading chorister and hes a big lad so the robes will fit and of course he ah rather looks the part like i said denny shrugged its basically balls isnt it i see it as a rite of passage dick persisted i dont think you can do something like that without experiencing a mans responsibility lol thought this was not the best time to talk about a mans responsibility in front of denny but denny didnt react listen he said tell the kid i can maybe do the studio monday ill feel better tonight when the funerals over when dick had gone he said to lol im still looking for somebody else to blame for kathy he just got in the way lol nodded im closing this shop by the way denny said this afternoon for the funeral viv said for good we close at lunchtime we dont open again ever im shifting the records to the other place tomorrow and big viv too extending the shop space into a storeroom if youre selling hifi it makes sense to have a record department on the premises this one was never big enough to take all the stock you need to really get the punters in it was just kathys shop i dont ever want to come here again and this flat it wont affect you unless i cant manage to let the shop on its own in which case ill maybe sell the whole building sorry to spring it on you mate but nothings permanent youre not a permanent sort of guy anyway are you lol forced a smile see you at the crem then denny added there wont be a meal or nothing afterwards wont be enough people plus im not into that shit denny lol said when you said to dick how did he know about the crows what did you mean leave it denny opened the door like you said it was nothing a coincidence just the way some things cause you to remember other things some memory pops up and you put it all together wrong what memory you dont let go of things do you lol some things wont let go of me its guilt probably you didnt like her did you denny said i liked her more towards the end you wouldnt fuck her because you didnt like her thats the truth isnt it i dont know thats kind of honourable i suppose no it isnt tell me about the crows denny came back in shut the door when she was a kid they used to put her in her pushchair in the farmyard to watch the chicks and stuff yeah and the crows would come crowsd come right up to her theyd land on the yard and come strutting up to the pushchair or theyd fly low and sit on the roof just over the back door sit there like vultures when kathy was there only when she was there lol thrust his hands in the pockets of his jeans and stiffened his shoulders against the shiver he felt how long did this go on until the old man shot them denny said do you remember hilary pyle barry ambrose asked her i dont think so who was she he barry said it was in some of the papers certainly the telegraph which always seems to splash church crises but they didnt know the whole story even i i didnt know that was her name until this morning wheres she now the girl you asked about shes at my daughters school oh dear said barry but then people do sometimes change dont they if they want to merrily said they have to want to so what happened to this hilary pyle she did he was a canon at the cathedral fortyfive years old married with kids i didnt know him particularly well but i assumed he was a sound bloke certainly not the kind youd imagine taking up with a schoolgirl rowenna soldiers daughter wasnt named in the papers i think she was underage in fact im sure she was fifteen or something also there was some question of rape when they first arrested hilary so the girl couldnt be named in the press but he certainly was now i remember about two years ago but he yes poor bloke hanged himself in his garage leaving a note rather a long note do you remember that it was read out at the inquest hed apparently requested that remind me merrily felt a stab of foreboding it was a rather florid piece of writing he kept quoting bits of milton he said the girl was sent by the devil and this caused a bit of amusement in the press just the sort of thing some clergyman would say to excuse his appalling behaviour sent by the devil she was a pale little thing they said but she knew which levers to pull if youll pardon the er merrily found she was writing it all down on her sermon pad you said there was more other things that didnt get into the press oh yes im frankly amazed it didnt get out but i suppose the people who knew about it realized what the bad publicity could do i think it was probably as a result of this that i of all people was asked to take on the deliverance ministry here they wanted an outsider someone previously unconnected with the cathedral you see its so easy for a panic to spread look at lincoln and the imp look at westminster there are always people wholl look for the dark hand of satan arent there not us of course quite so what happened after hilary committed suicide two other canons confessed to the bishop that theyd also had relations with this girl jesus she hadnt been expecting that it was thought there was another one but he kept very quiet and survived the investigation not a police investigation of course did anybody talk to the girl herself quite frankly i dont think anybody in the cathedral was prepared to go anywhere near the girl what happened i believe was that the army arranged for her father to be based somewhere else hereford obviously though no one here knew where theyd gone nor wanted to it cast quite a shadow for a while perhaps it still does i know a number of previously stable marriages have gone down the tubes since then poor hilarys suggestion of something evil had gathered quite a few supporters before the year was out barry i dont know how to thank you i dont know what youre going to tell your daughter merrily barry said but if she hangs around with rowenna napier she might start growing up a little too quickly if you see what i mean i owe you one merrily said now she was frightened take me in slaters behind broad street jane had a deeppan pizza and stayed cool reminding herself periodically about dean wall the slimeball on the school bus in the fog and what hed said about rowenna and danny gittoes gittoes was deans best friend and slightly less offensive but the thought of rowennas small mouth around whatever abomination he kept in his greasy trousers was still pretty distasteful especially when you knew it could be true calm down kitten rowenna had a burger with salad mayonnaise all over it oh please i just lost it completely jane was sitting with her back to the door and the front windows watching the cook at work behind a counter at the far end the problem with rowenna was that she was so incredibly charming she gave you her full attention and you felt so grateful she wanted you as a friend what did you say to her i slagged off the church rubbished everything that means anything to her said she was ambitious and arrogant and that id rather sell my soul to the devil than spend another night there i guess this was not what angela had in mind when she talked about leading mum towards the light rowenna laughed and you didnt mean a word of it right i meant it at the time jane cut another slice of pizza she also said we were spending too much time together she suggested i should be going out with boys can you believe that thats uncommon rowenna said theyre usually terrified youre going to get pregnant like theres nothing wrong with me jane said experimentally i dont have problems in that area ive had relationships its just there arent any guys around right now that i could fancy that much it occurred to her theyd rarely talked about men the choice is severely limited almost nonexistent sure like i travel on the bus every day with wall and gittoes dont rowenna said i may vomit she grinned shreds of chargrilled burger on teeth that were translucent like a babys come on jane thought it might not have been her at all by the car park it might not could we perhaps lighten up now i keep thinking of those tarot cards jane said seriously you said it seemed like a pretty heavy layout right kitten its ages since i even looked at a tarot pack you forget these things you dont forget those are like archetypal images theyre imprinted on your consciousness that guy in the denim jacket fancies you hes looking at you hes just wondering how to get me out of the way death that was the first of them yeah but the death card can also just mean the end of something before a new beginning the tower its been struck by lightning theres a big crack with people falling off that speaks for itself really some really horrendous disaster something wrenched apart shit or it could just mean a big clearout in your life throwing out the stuff that isnt important like if i dont get away ill go down with the tower say the tower in this instance represents your mothers faith in this cruel old testament god and youve got to help shatter it it could have been a prediction of what began this morning though couldnt it everything quiet right me getting ready to go out shes had this decent nights sleep for once well rested looking much better and then like out of nowhere were into the worst row for like ages it just blew up out of nothing like the tower cracking up and then i say that thing to her about the devil it just came out i wasnt thinking and that that was the third card dont panic rowenna put down her knife and fork the devil isnt always negative either you know the devil was invented by the christians as a condemnation of anybody who thought that they the christians were a bit suspect but actually the devils vital for balance in this world you reckon living with a vicar youre bombarded with propaganda but when you look at the situation all the devil represents is doing what you want not what youre told satan is just another word for personal freedom so maybe satanists are just people who dont like rules thats a bit simplistic isnt it no its not ok what about the lowlifes who killed that crow in the church so well thats got to be evil ok rowenna said one theres nothing to say they killed the crow two it was a church nobody uses a redundant church right three whats the difference between that and any normal protesters who disagree with what something stands for and go in and trash the place suppose these are just people who are seriously pissed off at how rich the church of england is and how totally useless like the house of lords a complete con to keep people in order well maybe theres no maybe that was your subconscious talking your inner self crying out to be free by coming out with the most outrageous thing possible in a vicarage right or i just wanted to get up her nose youre backpedalling you didnt plan what you wanted to say before it came out so it has to be an expression of your innermost desire to be free listen do it are you crazy there you go again put up or shut up so do it give yourself to the devil you just stand up and open your arms and you breathe in your most seductive voice lord satan take me rowenna giggled its just words so it cant harm you but its also an invitation to your inner self to throw off the shackles i reckon if you actually said that in a church youd get this amazing buzz no thanks see rowenna pointed her knife youre just completely indoctrinated you will never escape jane was uncomfortable shed felt cool and superior when shed first come in but now rowenna had turned the tables she was a wimp again a frightened little girl ro she said any chance of sleeping at your place tonight i cant go back can i sure you can go back take satan with you by which i mean go back with your head held high with a new attitude it would just be one night oh kitten rowenna sighed that could really be a problem we have this diplomat from the middle east staying with us im not supposed to even tell you this because there are a lot of people want this guy dead its a security job and were the safehouse you know what i mean armed guys in vans parked outside all night its really really tedious oh it happens to us quite often it means that anybody wants to stay with us they have to be vetted weeks in advance in case something crops up what am i going to do rowenna leaned over and squeezed janes wrist you know your problem you worry too much you still have this deeply constricted innerself ok the pod will help sort that eventually and i mean eventually whats wrong with the pod nothing its fine as far as it goes its merely a reasonable outlet for bored housewives too timid to have an affair you must have realized that by now i thought it was quite heavy actually rowenna smiled sympathetically listen i have to go now go on ask me where youre gonna like this huh the cathedral i thought we were going shopping yeah me too rowenna said ruefully i just forgot what day it was i have to meet my cousin who rowenna looked up whos this where guy looking at you through the window you tried that one earlier jane said hes not bad actually if youre into older men hes wearing black hes all in black i think hes coming in yeah i know jane bit off a corner of pizza its fucking satan right he is hes coming in for you a draught hit the back of janes ankles as the door to the street opened just when merrily was in no mood to talk to him huw rang how are you lass im ok ive rung a few times huw said ive prayed too thanks whats been the problem as though theyd spoken only last night and parted amicably rateyes merrily said probably oh aye no change of tone whatsoever she told him calmly that she had been the subject of what seemed to be a psychic attack she told him it had now been dealt with this was what came with you into st cosmas huw said i believe so and its dealt with yes youre clean then i believe i am how about you huw left a pause then he said about the hospital i went in last night and i got a bollocking from an irish nurse with a very high opinion of you i said i shared that naturally and explained to her why you and dobbs were shafting me i assured her i would explain the situation fully to you at the earliest possible opportunity which is why im ringing can i meet you tonight i dont know merrily said i have other problems happen i can help happen i dont want you to merrily what we have a crisis whos we you me your cathedral the c of e do you want to come here well meet in your gatehouse at six well be alone then all right she said lol held open the passenger door of the astra for her he slammed it shut and got in the other side jane stared at him coming down off her high where are we going he started the engine put on the lights and booted the ancient heap out into the traffic to a funeral im afraid youre kidding yeah im kidding i always wear a black suit on saturdays oh christ jane said its moon isnt it lol turned right towards greyfriars bridge she was making a point of not asking him why hed just swanned into the restaurant like that looking quite smooth for lol it had been cool anyway to play along cool too that the extreme warmth of her welcome appeared to have shocked him a little she grinned i frightened you didnt i theres effusive lol said and theres effusive darling as it happens i was glad to see you there was no way lol would let her spend the night in c amp as doorway what was her face like whose rowennas i couldnt see could i i was busy expressing my delight at your arrival yeah he said i can still taste the mozzarella so how did she react she looked surprised excellent jane said lol crossed four lanes of traffic at the lights foot down he must be running late she suspected there were aspects of lols relationship with moon she didnt fully understand of course the problem here was that if hed taken time to come and find her in his funeral suit that suggested he was acting on specific instructions from the reverend watkins in the end you couldnt get away from her could you you werent just passing were you lol your mum told me where you were having lunch great jane said dully she said youd had a row it was a minor disagreement like between the serbs and the croats what else did she say she said a lot of things im inclined to let her explain to you personally look jane said more harshly than she intended tell her to fax it or something im not going back you bloody are jane you cant make me do anything i dont want to lol turned left into the crematorium drive youre right he sighed i probably cant even trust you to stay in the car while i go inside god he looks so kind of desolate yes you can she said im sorry lol denny had been wrong the modern crematorium chapel was at least halffull distant relatives he explained to lol nosey bastards whose faces he only half remembered also a pair of archaeologist friends of moons from northumberland where shed lived for a couple of years and big viv and her partner gary and the purefoys tim and anna and dick and ruth lyden and moon of course moon was here denny had booked a minister though shed probably have preferred a fucking druid he said seeming uncomfortable and aggressive he wasnt wearing his earring without it he looked less amiable embittered he looked like he wanted to hit people his wife maggie was here without the children she was tall shorthaired and well dressed and talked to the relatives but not much to denny he must be difficult to live with right now the minister said some careful things about moon he said she was highly intelligent and enthusiastic and it was a tragic loss both to her brother dennis and his family and to the world of archaeology denny muttered and looked down at his feet anna purefoy wept silently into a handkerchief they sang two hymns during which lol gazed at the costly oak coffin and pictured moon inside it with her strange hard hands crossed over her breast to intensify the experience in this bland place to make it hurt he made her say id like to sleep now lol it hurt all the more because he knew that was wrong she couldnt sleep he kept thinking of his dream of the mistfurled moon in capuchin lane holding the broken heads of the ancestors as shed held the crow a dream like the dreams shed had of her father moon had joined not the ancestors but the grey ranks of the sleepless when the curtains closed over the coffin there were tears in lols eyes because he could not love her had not even been able to help her it was a disaster and it was not over outside in the foggy car park dick lyden said to lol never seen you in a suit before old chap then he patted denny sympathetically on the arm denny looked like he wanted to smash dicks face in lol found the slender sweetfaced anna purefoy at his side i feel so guilty mr robinson we should have positively discouraged her we should have seen the psychiatric problems they arent always easy to spot lol said i taught at a furthereducation college for a year ive seen it all in young women manic depression druginduced psychosis i should have seen her as she really was but we were so delighted by her absorption in the farm that we couldnt resist offering her the barn we thought she was perfect for it you couldnt hope to understand an obsession on that scale lol said he realized it was going to be worse for the purefoys than for anyone else here maybe even for denny they would have to live with that barn what will you do with it now i suspect it will be impossible to find a permanent tenant wed have to tell people wouldnt we perhaps we could revert to our original plan of holiday accommodation i dont know its too early well good luck lol said he wondered if merrily might be persuaded to go up there and bless the barn or something he watched the purefoys walk away to their land rover discovery dennys wife maggie was chatting to an elderly couple while denny stood by with his hands behind his back rocking on his heels a lone crow of all birds flew over his head and landed on the roof of the crematorium and stayed there as though it was waiting for moons spirit to emerge in the smoke to accompany it back to dinedor hill but nobody could see the smoke in this fog and the way to dinedor would be obscured he imagined moon alone in that car park after everyone had gone moon cold in the tatters of her medieval dress bewildered because there was nobody left nobody left to understand what had happened to her the astra was parked about fifteen yards away as he approached janes face appeared in the blotched windscreen looking very young and starved he tried to smile at her she looked so vulnerable it was cold in the car as he started the engine she said lol that woman you were talking to mrs purefoy the blonde woman that was moons neighbour and landlady anna purefoy he drove slowly out of the car park on dipped headlights jane said you mean angela i thought it was anna i could be wrong moons neighbour on dinedor hill they own the farm where she died after a while as the car crept back into the hidden city jane said help me lol things have got like horribly screwed up the invisible church the golden santas drove their reindeer across a thick sea of mist in broad street the lanterns glowed red like fog warnings in the dense grey middledistance the christmas trees twinkling above the shop fronts were like the lights of a different city and merrily alone in the gatehouse office with the cathedral on one side and the bishops palace on the other felt calmer now because lol had called her before she left because jane was with lol in the flat above john barleycorn not three minutes walk away and maybe lol would now find out how far it went this liaison with the wan and wispy rowenna serial seducer of priests scrabbling about under sophies desk she found an old twobar electric fire with a concave chrome reflector plugged it in and watched the bars slowly warm up with tiny tapping sounds until they matched the vermilion of the lanterns outside merrily stood by the fire warming her calves and watching the lights they were all part of christmas but anyone who didnt know about christmas would not see them as linked she thought about that devilworshipper pulled from the river not half a mile from here the strings of crowintestine on a disused altar the inflicted curse of denzil joy the old exorcist lying silent halfparalysed or faking it in a hospital bed inside a chalked circle and inevitably she thought of rowenna linked all of them some of them none of them after a while she spotted the untidy man in bobblehat ragged scarf raf greatcoat shambling out of the fog with his exorcists black bag and wondered how many answers he could offer her jane had decided to clean up lols flat ruthlessly scrubbing shelves splattering sinkcleaner about invading the complexity of cobwebs behind the radiators a purge lol thought just as they were hitting the city centre shed asked if they could go somewhere the village of credenhill where the poet traherne had been vicar in the seventeenth century where the sas had until recently been based and where just entering dusk he and jane had found the perfectly respectable but undeniably small army house where rowennas family lived until the last possible moment jane had been vainly searching for some rambling splitlevel villa behind trees shed stood for a long time at the roadside looking across at the fogfuzzed lights of the little house with the christmas tree in its front window why would she lie why would she think it mattered to me if she lived in a mansion or bloody tent why does she lie about everything on the way back lol considered what merrily had said on the phone about rowennas sexual history it had made him look quickly but very hard at the girl over janes shoulder in slaters rowenna was pale appeared rather fragile fragile like glass once they were back in his flat hed told jane about the events in salisbury jane had listened blankfaced silent then she stood up this flats in a disgusting state lol sat with anne rosss pagan celtic britain open on his knees and let jane scrub violently away at the kitchen floor and her own illusions in the book he read that crowgoddesses invariably forecast death and disaster at last jane came back from the kitchen redfaced with exertion and inner turmoil lol put the book down im not going to be able to live with any of this jane announced but you still shafted me merrily was feeling her fury reignite reflected in the red glow of the tinking electric fire the sparky glimmerings from the santas over broad street trust in god but never trust a bloody priest you claimed you hardly knew him huw had taken off his scarf but left his woolly hat on they were sitting at opposite ends of sophies long desk under the window huw was just a silhouette with a bobble on top you had to imagine his faded canvas jacket his shaggy wolfhound hair i dont know dobbs huw said and i never tried to shaft you she shook her head and lit a cigarette staring out of the window it was after six now and the traffic was thinning out a granny and grandad kind of couple were walking a child down broad street towards all saints the child between them hopping and swinging from their hands under the decorations im trying to explain huw said i want to give you a proper picture as far as i can see it they didnt want me to tell you but theres no way round that now so balls to them who didnt the canons the deans chapter well not officially none of this is official no kidding two fellers came to see me no raising a shadowy hand dont ask but theyre honourable blokes as mark antony once said jesus huw thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand merrily there is no conspiracy these lads are scared they didnt know what dobbs was at but it put the wind up them give us one of them cigs would you she slid the packet across the desk to him didnt know you did you know bugger all about me nor me about you when we cut to the stuffing ta lass huw shook the packet extracted a cigarette with his teeth the devil whats he like these days what the devil lass merrily said forked tail cloven hooves little horns deceptively cuddly and we invented him to discredit the pagan horned god cernunnos this is what jane tells me over and over canny lass huw extended his cigarette towards her zippo and in its flare she saw his grainy bootleather features flop into a smile like her mam thank you and then the smile vanished so he drew heavily what do you believe i do accept the existence of a dark force for evil merrily said steadily huw nodded good enough when he had first arrived shed told him about the projection of the fouled phantom of denzil joy how theyd done it how well it had worked shed told him about the burning of the vestments and the eucharist she planned for denzil and denzils mute abused wife she was telling him because she needed him to know she was clean able to deal with things huw started now to talk about evil in its blackest most abstract form evil the substance how it was always said that the deepest evil was often to be found in closest proximity to the greatest good how satanists would despoil churches for the pure intoxication of it the dark high it gave them and does that explain st cosmas i dont know ive not told dobbs about that he smelled it on me mind that night knew id just done an exorcism happen thats what got him talking ah merrily sat up so dobbs has talked to you only in bits till last night the other times he were weighing me up getting the measure of me see what hes done is hes shut himself down boarded himself up put himself into a vacuum working out whether he was going to snuff it or be fit enough to go back i figured it was my job to give him the space he needed to see he wasnt pestered you know what im saying you sealed him into a kind of magic circle protective circle the invisible church magic is where you use your willpower to bring about changes in the natural pattern to rearrange molecules we ask god to do it if he thinks its the right thing which is subtly different as you know protecting him from what the devil what huw i wanted to bring you in on it merrily honest to god i did i hated going behind your back but the deans lads are saying no way no way its the last thing dobbsd want they dont like the bishop and youre the bishops pussycat terrific you know thats not what i think so stuff the dean lets talk about this i really dont know how much time weve got ive not come across it before in any credible situation what a shadow had dropped over the room like a cloth over a birdcage merrily saw that a line of golden santas had gone out over broad street we think theres a squatter in the cathedral huw said so like how could she go back to that school on monday and be in the same room with the lying slag the same building how lol said without much conviction that maybe it was best not to leap to too many conclusions yeah jane collapsed on to the rug like which particular conclusions is it best to avoid lol should i maybe like hang fire on the possibility that rowenna wants to be my best friend for reasons not entirely unconnected with my mother no thats valid is she real lol is she psychotic is there a word for women who need to shag priests janey if we were merely talking about a psychological condition it would make it all so much simpler she hasnt been anywhere near merrily has she just the once all right lol said lets go back to when you first knew her this must be before your mum became an exorcist when did she make the first approach she didnt it was me this was when she first started at the school right before her the last new girl there was me and i know what its like when you come in from out of the area and theyre all kind of suspicious of you i went over to talk to her and we just got on thats it did she know about merrily pretty soon she did see one of her most attractive qualities is she likes talking about you she listens she asks questions she laughs at the things you say shes sympathetic when youve got problems at home you are the most interesting person in the world when youre with rowenna you tell her everything yeah jane said gloomily you tell her everything how soon before the psychic things the new age stuff i dont know it just happened youre talking all through the lunch hour then you discover shes got her own car so she gives you a lift home but yeah when i found out she was interested in like otherwordly pursuits that was the clincher soulmates its just like so brilliant when you find somebody you can talk to about that stuff and theyre not going yeah yeah but where do you go on saturday nights it just never occurs to you to be suspicious youre so delighted and when she says hey theres this psychic fair at leominster you dont go oh id better ask my mum do you what happened at the psychic fair we met angela mrs purefoy if you say so although when i look back was she really doing the psychic fair how do we know she read anybody elses cards see it was rowenna who first mentioned the fair it was rowenna who when wed been there a while and it was getting cold and boring suggested we consult a clairvoyant in the nice warm pub it was rowenna who said shed had a call from angela wanting to see us again i will struggle for a long time against things i dont want to believe lol but when the cracks start to appear what was angela like really really impressive not what you were expecting very smooth very poised very articulate and kind of upperclass like you felt she had your best interests at heart at all times and of course you believed every damn word she said lol smiled she said i had extraordinary abilities which instinctively you knew jane scowled i suppose she recommended you should develop them she put me in touch with a group called the pod meeting over the healthfood caff in bridge street it was you then i thought you hadnt spotted me if youd been your usual friendly little self lol said i probably wouldnt have thought anything of it so what happens at the pod its good actually its just about building up your awareness of like other realms nothing heavily ritualistic not at all in fact here we go rowennas already suggesting its kind of lowgrade stuff god its so transparent when you start seeing it from another angle its not really it seems quite sophisticated to me they introduce you into a group full of nice amiable women who mother you along dont scare you off so the pod are part of this i dont know they seem fairly harmless somebody apparently suggested youd be an asset thats what i was told because of mum what is all this its just about women clerics i think lol said theyre still new and sexy and its the biggest and most disruptive thing to happen in the church for centuries angelas involved with the pod right i dont actually think so shes nevers been to a meeting in the short time ive been going she mention your mum she said rowennad told her she said she was annoyed about that because she thought it was ethically wrong some bullshit like that to know things about people you were doing readings for and yeah shes like oh i cant tell you anything tonight after all ive probably got it all wrong until im begging her and then all this stuff that i have to tease out of her and ro about needing to lead mum into the light and theyre dropping what now seem like really broad hints that if i dont some disastrous situation will develop they just want to like corrupt her dont they i suppose so lol said and merrilys right theyre getting at her through you whatever you might think youre the most important thing in her life that must be obvious to them you being the only child of a single parent whos them i dont know the idea of all these evil devilworshippers targeting priests it just sounds so and yet we have to do something lol im just like so boiling up inside its like ive been raped you know we jane sprang up hey lets go and see angela now we know who she is lets just turn up on her doorstep and like demand answers no why not not yet anyway why not ive got to think about this jane frowned this is about moon again isnt it deep penetration huw lifted his black bag up on to the desk switched on the lamp and took out a fat paperback merrily recognized it at once the folklore of herefordshire by ella mary leather had been for several months janes bible introduced to her by the late lucy devenish village shopkeeper writer of fairytales for children and a major source of the kids problematic interest in all things new age it was a formidable collection of customs and legends gathered from arcane volumes and the countys longest memories huw opened it section iv supernatural phenomena wraiths visitors it would have said now in huwspeak mrs leather revealed that all over herefordshire it was accepted at least in that the wraith of a person might be seen by relatives or close friends shortly before or just after death the departing spirit was bidding farewell to the persons or places most dear to it this was stated as a matter of fact it seemed amazing that it had taken less than a century for believers in ghosts to be exiled into crank country huw turned the page and pushed the book directly under the desk lamp for merrily to read he said nothing demons and familiar spirits a demon in the cathedral a very strange story of the appearance of a demon in the cathedral is told by bartholomew de cotton the event is supposed to have happened in ad an unheard of and almost impossible marvel occurred in the cathedral church of the hereford canons there a demon in the robes of a canon sat in a stall after matins had been sung a canon came up to him and asked his reason for sitting there thinking the demon was a brother canon the latter refused to answer and said nothing the canon was terrified but believing the demon to be an evil spirit put his trust in the lord and bade him in the name of christ and st thomas de cantilupe not to stir from that place for a short time he bravely awaited speech receiving no answer he at last went for help and beat the demon and put him in fetters he now lies in the prison of the aforesaid st thomas de cantilupe she looked up who was bartholomew de cotton no idea wheres the prison of st thomas dont know bishops did have their own prisons i believe so what does it all mean i dont know said huw it could be an allegorical tale to put the knife in for one of the clerics could simply be some penniless vagrant got into the cathedral and nicked a few vestments to keep himself warm and it got blown up out of all proportion or or it could be the first recorded appearance of the squatter merrily became aware of a thin highpitched whine nearby possibly the bulb in the desk lamp a filament dying she realized fully now why huw used all these bloody silly words visitor hitchhiker insomniac it was because the alternatives were too biblical too portentous and too ludicrous so a squatter merrily said is your term for a localized demon an evil spirit in residence if i were trying to be scientific id cobble summat together like potentially malevolent semisentient forcefield or i mightve called it a sleeper but that doesnt sound noxious enough you know what a sleeper is in espionage its a kind of deeppenetration agent isnt it planted in another country years in advance to be awoken whenever deeppenetration huw liked that made it sound he said like dampness and it was very like that in so deep it was almost part of the fabric it could be lying there for centuries and only the very sensitive would be aware of it like an imprint merrily suggested with added evil evil gathers around a holy place like we said the unholiest ground they used to say is sometimes just over the churchyard wall but if it gets inside youll have a hell of a job rooting it out its got all those centuries of accumulated devotional energy to feed on and itll cause havoc but if you accept that this was an evil spirit how could this canon beat it and put it in fetters that argues for your first suggestion that the canon caught some vagrant whod stolen the vestments or the entire storys metaphorical it suggests he was able to bind this evil by ritual and the power of the lord and also st thomas cantilupe aye said huw there we have the link the key to it all the whining in the bulb was making her nervous it was like a thin wire resonating in her brain thomas cantilupe huw leaned back and his chair creaked tommy canty now there were a hard bastard the norman baronial background the years in government the initial ambition to be a soldier and you could still think of him as one huw said so he already had the selfdiscipline and on becoming a bishop of the church had taught himself humility and chastity he went to paris once and stayed wi a feller and the fellers wife a foxy lady contrives to get into bed wi tommy tommy rolls out tother side pretends hes still asleep next morning she asks him how he slept and he tells her hed have had a better night if he hadnt been tempted by the devil merrily thought of mick hunter under the aumbry light and then she thought of herself and lol how close shed come in her near despair to slipping into lols bed tommy canty said huw no sleaze no risks warrior for the lord what would your lad hunter have made of him both fasttrack merrily thought cantilupe had come straight in as bishop no weddings and funerals for him presumably but yes in spite of that theyd probably have hated each others guts but think what cantilupe did for this town huw said most of the religious establishments along the border were well into debt during that period after st thomass day hereford cathedral never looked back they were adding bits on to the building all over the place pulling power of the shrine meant thousands of pilgrims hundreds of accredited miracles cripples brought in droves if you were too sick to get to hereford you were measured on a length of string and they brought that instead i dont know how it worked but it did you believe in miracles merrily dont you i bet hunter doesnt who can say look the demon story how long had cantilupe been dead by then about eight years and the shrines power was near its peak how could that demon get in was it brought in by one of the pilgrims was it already there and something activated it like a sleeper aye exactly but thank god the unnamed medieval canon and the power of christ channelled through the cantilupe shrine they contained it imprisoned is the word not killed or executed but imprisoned merrily experienced one of those moments when you wonder if youre really awake mrs straker the aunt had said rowenna napier lived in what she would call a fantasy world but what would she call this where was it leading tommy canty huw liked saying that maybe a northerners need for familiarity as if he and the sevencenturiesdead st thomas wouldnt be able to work together unless they were old mates guardian and benefactor of hereford must have been a mightily good man or thered be no miracles now his bones have all gone but hes there in spirit his tombs still there huw suddenly leaned towards her blocking out the lamplight except when its not oh she felt a tiny piece of cold in her solar plexus know what i mean except when its in pieces she said and the image cut in of dobbs lying amid the stones arms flung wide eyes open breathing loud snuffling strokebreaths i want to show you something else huw bent over the bag his yellowing dogcollar sunk into the crewneck of his grey pullover he brought out a sheaf of a photocopies and put them in front of merrily she glanced at the top sheet hereford cathedral shrine of st thomas cantilupe conservation and repair the history you know what happened when he died they boiled his body separated the bones from the flesh and the heart good you know all that all right when the bones first arrived in hereford they were put under a stone slab in the lady chapel you know about this too tell me again that was temporary a tomb was built in the north transept and the bits were transferred there in the presence of king edward i in i think the miracles started almost immediately and petitions were made for tommy to be canonized but that didnt happen until thats when he got a really fancy new shrine in the lady chapel which of course was smashed up during the reformation a couple of centuries later when the rest of the bones were divided and taken away so the present one is which it appears to be the original tomb which seems to have been left alone according to this document one of the first pilgrims wrote that hed had a vision of the saint which came out of the image of brass on top of the tomb we know there was brass on this one because the indents still visible now look at this huw extracted a copy of a booklet with much smaller print and brought out his reading glasses this is the account of the history of the tomb and it records what happened the last time it was taken apart for renovation which was in the nineteenth century quotes a fellar called havergal an archaeologist or antiquarian who in his monumental inscriptions of writes can you read this merrily lifted the document to the light a paragraph was encircled in pencil this tomb was opened some years ago i have an account written by one who was present which it would not be prudent to publish huws features twisted into a kind of grim beam you like that what does not prudent mean you tell me id say the person who wrote that account was scared shitless by what they found aye but the bones had all gone right people arent frightened by bones anyroad are they least they wouldnt be in them days youre presuming some psychic experience the squatter huw said suppose it was an apparition of the squatter in all his unholy glory oh please merrily shuddered and anyway nothing happened when they opened it this time did it no and why didnt it how can i possibly oh huw dobbs and backwards and forwards from the cathedral hed go at all hours in all weathers said edna rees id hear his footsteps in the street at two three in the morning going to the cathedral coming from there sometimes rushing he was like a man possessed dobbs exorcized this thing huw shrugged contained it he reckons like that canon in the thirteenth century with the help of st thomas cantilupe in whose footsteps our thomas had so assiduously followed until he was struck down memories of that night snowballed her sophie hill hes just rambling to someone himself i dont know rambling on and on neither of us understands its all rather frightening george curtiss my latin isnt what it used to be my impression is hes talking to ah to thomas cantilupe and the atmosphere in the cathedral of overhead wires or power cables slashed through live and sizzling dobbs modelling himself on his hero tommy canty huw said keeping his own counsel thrusting away all temptation keeping all women out of his life making sense now is it lass the whining from the lamp was unbearable now like the sound of tension itself she was afraid of an awful pop an explosion although she knew that rarely happened she felt it would tonight he fired his housekeeper of many years did you know that she didnt know what shed done wrong strong measures merrily measuring up to tommy canty very strict about ladies not only sexually he kept all women at more than arms length with the exception of the holy mother see what you have i reckon is dobbs inviting the mighty spirit of cantilupe to come into him happen he thought they could deal with it together thats what he told you in not so many words not so many words is all he can manage youre saying that when it emerged that the hereford cathedral perpetual trust had finally managed to put enough money together to renovate the tomb dobbs was immediately put on his guard suspecting something had happened when the tomb was last opened he knew it happened he told me exactly where to find this document he told me where to look in mrs leathers book all right its not much and thats the end of the documentation but just because that eyewitness account was never published doesnt mean it hasnt been passed down by word of mouth which is notoriously unreliable all right what did happen when they opened the tomb this time huw smiled when youve been with that owd feller a while you learn he doesnt like talking and when he does there are words he wont use me ill ramble on about squatters and visitors and the like but dobbsll just give you funny looks helpful i dont know merrily i dont know that hes prepared to even think at the present time about what it was gave him the stroke its part of shutting down so who contained the she couldnt bring herself to use the word demon either squatter last century huw shook his head dont know but if you carry on with this theory youve got two explanations one is that the then exorcist or somebody at least was ready for it two is that all you had was a single terrifying manifestation that there wasnt sufficient energy around on that occasion for it to take up what you might call serious occupation so why should it now whats changed jesus christ merrily you can ask me that he held up a hand against the window and began counting them off on his fingers one the recent millennium two thousand years since the birth of our lord and a time of great global religious and cosmic significance two the appointment of a flash smartarse bishop who doesnt believe in anything very much you cant say that have you questioned the slippery bastard in any depth lass has anybody three merrily could stand it no longer and clicked off the whining lamp dipping them back into reddened darkness outside she noticed a third row of golden santas had gone out as if the whole of this end of town was suddenly beset by destructive electrical fluctuations because of what theyd been discussing madness stop it and three is huw paused you he said a candle for tommy i knew she was going to be trouble sorrel said to lol patricia would have been the best but jane had no idea where she lived didnt even know her last name sorrel was the one they got because there werent many podmores in the phone book sorrel who lived at kings acre in the suburbs but wouldnt let lol come to see her there she hadnt wanted to see him at all until he mentioned police how old is she sorrel had finally agreed to meet him at the cafe in bridge street they sat at one of the rustic tables with the window blinds down they sat under the mervyn peake etchings of thin leering men and the fat witch with the toad thirteen he said just to scare her sorrel was plump and nervous she closed her eyes on an intake of breath we didnt know no way we knew that she said she was working we thought she was seventeen at least does she really look seventeen oh god im sorry sorrel threw up her hands this should not have happened were a responsible group we have a strict rule about children she looked hard at lol youre vivs friend arent you the songwriter she said and a friend of janes mothers lol said her mother the vicar sorrel paled lol was starting to feel sorry for her this could cause a lot of damage if it got out sorrel said i mean damage to the business you know what people are like they dont understand about these things theyll think were using children for weird rituals it could close us down i mean the cafe mmm lol nodded i mean ive got kids myself and my husband he doesnt its got out of hand you see they started calling it the pod only because they were meeting here it just grew out of healthy eating and green issues im not really that involved but the names linked now and its very hard for me to to look lol said i realize this is not your fault you had pressure put on you right sorrel didnt answer so maybe its whoever put on the pressure i need to talk to please she was actually looking scared now cant you just leave it i wish i could but her mothers in the clergy things are difficult enough for women priests how did she find out an anonymous letter bastards sorrel said you know what i think sorrel i think you suspected jane was quite young but somebody else put the arm on you to take her into the group and you werent in a position to refuse who would that have been sorrel bit her lip was it angela i dont know any angela anna purefoy oh christ sorrel stood up and walked to the counter picked up a cloth and began scrubbing todays specials from a blackboard her back turned to lol he stood up i gather shes not actually in the group she doesnt need to be whys that she turned to face him because they own this building the purefoys the building came up for sale when our lease had only about six months to run the chemists next door were going to buy it to extend into so it wouldve been over for us then suddenly the purefoys bought it they knew one of our members sorrel began to squeeze the cloth between her hands mr robinson i dont want to talk about this i really do need this cafe my husbands about to be made redundant weve got a stupid mortgage im sorry about jane but shes not been with us long theres been no harm done nothing to interest the police really quite a bit to interest the press what do you want ive said im how well do you know rowenna i dont no more than i know jane all right a bit more shes picked up messages here and things from whom we have a noticeboard as you can see people leave messages and some that arent on the board maybe there are no drugs here sorrel said firmly i never thought there were i dont even assume the pod gets up to anything iffy what i think is that maybe jane will meet other people who arent regular members and shell get invited to i dont know interesting parties and rowenna makes sure she goes to them and at these parties there are maybe some slightly offthewall things going on and before you know it her mother receives some pictures of jane well stoned and naked on a slab just call me cynical but i used to be in a band thats ridiculous you know its not sorrel threw the cloth down so what do you want i want to know about anna purefoy i dont know anything about her ok lol stood up and moved towards the door thanks for all your help but i i know somebody who might help you he turned and waited she used to be our teacher before patricia when she heard the purefoys had bought this building she stopped coming she may or may not need some persuading but i can tell you where to find her in hereford about twenty miles out sorrel said if shes still alive that is by the time they left the gatehouse half the streets santas and lanterns seemed to have gone out you felt as though you were on the bridge of a ship leaving port at night gliding slowly away from the lights im sorry lass huw said but think about it what does the smartarse iconoclast new bishop do first he breaks a twothousandyear convention by appointing a female exorcist in a city which history has shown to be periodically in need of a good guard dog he swaps his rottweiler for a miniature poodle ive gone far enough down that road luv dont want me throat torn out all im saying is that the combination of all these factors and maybe others we dont know about could be felt to be having a dissipating effect and a weakened body invites infection well im telling you how thomas dobbs sees it they walked across the green towards the huge smudge of the cathedral and you merrily asked him what do you believe wait till were inside she was struck as always by the hospitality of the place the stones of many colours almost all of them warm the simplicity of the arcade of norman arches the friendly modern glitter of the great corona which always seemed to be hanging lopsided although it probably wasnt she knew nothing about medieval architecture but it just felt right in here ancient centre of light and healing they went directly to the north transept deserted except for one of the vergers a tubby middleaged man in glasses who looked across suspicious then relaxed when he saw huws collar and recognized merrily he raised a hand to them anything i can do ive got a key pal huw indicated the partitioned enclosure well be about ten minutes ill have to stay in the general vicinity the verger said if you dont mind the deans been a bit on edge since that slab was reported stolen huw stopped what was that id forgotten all about it merrily said a chunk of one of the sidepanels with a knight carved on it its missing oh no the verger said it isnt missing somebody must have made a mistake miscounted when the mason was in here this morning he confirmed everything was there quite a relief but it did make us think a bit more about security huw said do you know which piece it was which knight no idea sir the masons will be back on monday theyll now be able to put st thomas together again too late unfortunately for the boy bishop ceremony itll be the first time he wont be able to pay his respects boy bishop merrily briefly explained about the annual ceremony and its meaning while huw unlocked the padlock with what apparently were dobbss keys she saw where rudimentary repairs had been carried out since george curtiss had kicked his way in huw surveyed the dismantled tomb looking more or less as it had the afternoon merrily and jane had stood in here with neil the young archaeologist segments of a stone coffin knights in relief with shields and mashed faces what happens at this boy bishop ceremony then lass never been to one harmless bit of church pageantry id guess is it harmless any reason why it shouldnt be everything worries me tonight huw shoved his hands into the pockets of his greatcoat especially this missing stone business first a stones missing then its not church masons dont miscount which means its either still missing or its back in which case wheres it been meanwhile she wondered for a moment if he meant that the stone had been somehow dematerialized by the demon then she realized what he did mean hard to comprehend especially seeing it like this he trudged around the rubble that this box was once the core of it all if you try and imagine the amount of psychic and emotional energy veneration desperation poured into this little space over the centuries you cant i cant and then imagine if while it was away that same stone had hot blood and guts spilled on it huw and then it was brought back he shrugged just a thought merrily looked up at the huge lightless stainedglass window and saw the dim figure of a knight pushing his spear down a dull dragons throat all right what would happen if the balance tilted if the dominant force in here was the force of evil even a bit of evil goes a long way take all the aggro theyve had over at lincoln cathedral terrible disruption hellish disputes and bad feeling and bitterness among the senior clergy and consider the number of people who put all that down to evil influences emanating from this little old carving in the nave known as the lincoln imp a thousand sacred carvings in that place and one imp know what i mean yes merrily was wondering what damage had been caused at salisbury by rowennas sexual forays into the canonries had a few rows here too mind huw recalled you remember could be this was before your time when the first contingent of hereford women priests staged a circledance here in the cathedral i read about it they were supposed to have been gliding around trancelike caressing the effigies on bishops tombs which some fundamentalists thought was a bit forward and rather too pagan bloke who organized it he said it were simply to introduce women to the cathedral as an active spiritual force for the first time in its history so as to make their peace with the old dead bishops the bishop at the time he went along with it but dobbs went berserk apparently it were said he went round from tomb to tomb that night like an owd hoover removing all psychic traces of the shedevils devils i exaggerate you have a problem with circledancing not especially but i dont rule out there might be a problem cathedrals are just not places you bugger about with without due consideration you walk carefully around these old places merrily found herself wondering what a demon would look like she tried to imagine one in canons clothing but all she could conjure was the crude cartoon image of a grinning skull its exposed vertebrae vanishing into a dogcollar what was the image with which dobbs if only in his own mind had been confronted in the seconds before his stroke she thought of the lightning impression of denzil joy ratcheting up in her own bed what if shed been old with a heart condition what are we fighting here huw your malevolent semisentient forcefield and what else who else i wish i knew but if dobbs knew the significance of the dismantled tomb and its been in the newspaper enough times so other folk did too and were not just talking about the headbangers now he looked at merrily who then she asked huw scratched his head happen the ones with knowledge and seeking more higher knowledge the knowledge you cant get from other men and you wont get it from god or his angels either on account of youre not meant to have it but demons are different you can command a demon if youre powerful enough or you can bargain with it they found one headbanger floating in the wye merrily said thats not been released by the police yet so dont you know but a man whose body was found in the wye with head injuries kept a satanic altar in his basement with a big poster of the goat of mendes and american stuff dirty satanic videos all that when was this lass couple of weeks ago he was from chepstow the police are trying to identify his contacts in satanic circles without conspicuous success where in the wye just along the river from here near the victoria bridge any relevance do you think he shook his head he didnt know any more than she did she needed to stop regarding huw as the fount of wisdom and start thinking for herself if the possibility of arousing the demon of hereford cathedral had already become an occult cause celebre perhaps sayer had been in here that night merrily was cold and confused this was all getting beyond her comprehension and the sight of the empty segmented tomb was starting to distress her she was glad when huw said lets light a candle for tommy and they moved out of the enclosure there was a votive stand which had previously been sited next to the tomb when it was intact all its candles were out so she passed huw her zippo and he lit two for them the little flames warmed her momentarily he touched her elbow lets pray eh she nodded they knelt facing the partition and the ruins of the shrine one of the candles went out she handed huw the zippo again and he stood up and relit the candle merrily put out a hand feeling for a draught from somewhere no obvious breeze as huw stepped back the second candle went out he waited a moment then applied the lighter to the second candle as the flame touched the wick the first candle went out a thin taper of cold passed through merrily and came out of her mouth as a tiny frayed whimper outside in the fogclogged and freezing night huw said watch yourself merrily was shivering badly what im saying is dont feel youve got summat to prove li like like what you know exactly what if anything happened and you thought the sanctity of the cathedral was at risk you might just be daft enough to go in there on your own to call on tommy canty and our lord to do the business i dont think i w would have the guts she felt naked as though the fog was dissolving all her clothing like acid she wanted jane to be with her and yet didnt want jane anywhere near her listen to me it were playing with us then its saying im here im awake you asked me what i believe i believe theres an active squatter in there suppose it was subjective suppose the c candles suppose that was one of us then it was acting through one of us youll need extra prayers tonight you know what i mean but what do we do huw a negative presence in the cathedral itself we might well be looking at a major exorcism which in a great cathedral would require several of us probably including god forbid the bishop himself meanwhile my advice to you for what its worth is not to go in there alone huw i not by night nor day not alone her forehead throbbed she thought of what mick hunter had said that seemingly longago afternoon in the green dragon i never want to hear of a socalled major exorcism its crude primitive and almost certainly ineffective she wished at that moment that huw had taken the advice of the deans chapter and left the bishops pussycat well out of this she felt she would never have the nerve to light a candle again you know what youve got to do now dont you merrily go and talk to mick he put his big hand on her shoulder he likes you youre his favourite appointee tell him whats squatting in his cathedral tell him whats got to happen all there is for the first time it looked like a real palace there were many lights on hanging evenly and elegantly in the foggy night several cars were parked tightly up against the deep georgian windows merrily hesitated well of course she did she remembered the end of day three of the deliverance course in the brecon beacons the lights in the chapel going off the video machine burning out odd how all these power fluctuations seemed to occur around huw first law of deliverance always carry plenty of fuse wire shed wanted him to come with her to the palace got to be joking lass a lowly rural rector from the church in wales creeps on to hunters patch and diagnoses a demonic presence in the mans own cathedral that would get me a big row and a stiff complaint to the bishop of swansea and brecon and certainly no action that would be the worst of it no action at all best he doesnt know about me that way if he doesnt get involved happen i can organize something on the quiet be a bit of a risk mind but its a critical situation shed wanted huw to come and stay the night at ledwardine vicarage but hed said he had to think first put some mountains between himself and hereford then think and meditate and pray shed watched him walk away under the darkened santas into the fog winding his scarf around his neck and she wondered fourth one in two years huw had said as shed looked into the scorched mouth of the ruined video its a right difficult place this and it were playing with us hed said just now as the serial snuffing of votive candles threw shiver after shiver into her convincing merrily without a second thought of his claim that there was a squatter in the cathedral she stood cold and doubthaunted on the lawn before the palace her shopping bag full of supporting documents lying on the grass by her feet the night seemed as heavy as huws greatcoat around her suppose it was him what after all was a priest but a licensed magician and where did this squatter story have its origins dobbs perhaps the man who had made a point of never once speaking to her directly who had sent her that single cryptic note who had made her a little present of denzil joy a man too with whom huw had spent long hours had they talked about merrily huw hadnt said but how could they have avoided it she looked up to where the sky began below the tops of the chimney stacks help me she was only aware that she must have shouted it aloud into the unyielding night when the white door opened and there against the falling light was merrily is that you the bishop himself in tuxedo and a bowtie of dark purple merrily i she started forward can i see you bishop mick he reminded her softly come in merrily she felt the pressure of his hand between her shoulder blades and found herself in the chandeliered splendour of the great hall doric pilasters a domed ceiling at the far end like gods conservatory she was blinded for a moment disoriented the bishop blurred past her to a table pulling out two velvetbacked chairs no she said her nerve gone this is terrible im interrupting something could i come back early tomorow perhaps oh god tomorrows sunday merrily relax its a perfect timely interruption of a terminally tedious dinner party with some oleaginous oafs from the city council and their dreary wives val will sparkle all over them until i return sit you look terribly cold a drink no please she sat down feeling like a tramp next to the bishop with his poise and his elegance i just need your help mick he listened without a word twenty minutes and no interruptions she talked and talked except when she dried up or fumbled in her bag for mrs leather a book of local folklore collected nonsenses or for the report by the late mr havergal on the opening of the cantilupe tomb in the midnineteenth century an eyewitness description of which it had been considered imprudent to publish or for her cigarette packet which she gripped for maybe ten seconds as though the nicotine might be absorbed through her stimulated sweat glands and made to flow up her arm before she let it drop back into her bag it was an impromtu sermon given before an expert audience a dissertation combining medieval theology with the elements of some hollywood fantasymelodrama an exercise in semicontrolled hysteria i cant wont ask you to believe the unbelievable but im trying to do the job that you asked me to do although its led in directions i could never have imagined it would not so soon anyway probably not ever if im honest but its a job where you have to rely on instinct where you never know what is truth and whats tests lies disinformation and im reporting back to you in confidence because those are the rules and youre probably thinking whats the silly bitch doing disturbing me at home on a saturday night with dinner guests and looking up at him wanting some help but getting no reaction you must wonder is she overtired has she gone bonkers the bottom line looking up at the twinkling chandelier half wishing it would fall and smash into ten thousand crystal shards that something would happen to make him afraid is that i believe we should do this cleansing and that you should be there and the dean too and as many canons as you feel you can trust the bishops expression did not alter he neither nodded nor shook his head it could be carried out in total secrecy late at night or better still early in the morning at four or five oclock it would take less than a couple of hours its consider it a precaution if nothing happens then either it was successful or it wasnt necessary i dont care if people say later that it wasnt necessary it doesnt matter that a door opened and val hunter stood there in black dramatic michael five minutes he lifted one hand with a single long breath down her nostrils val went away without even a glance at merrily the bishop waited until his wifes footsteps had receded then he spoke have you finished merrily she nodded dispirited who was it he said come on its either dobbs or the dean or more likely owen who put you up to this all three she thought miserably circumstances she said at last a lot of individually meaningless circumstances he gave a small sigh but id rather you didnt list them all i can say is i believe my suggestion is valid we cant afford to take any risk risk of what of the cathedral being contaminated tell me merrily who would conduct this major exorcism that would be your decision ah he said of course he shifted position looking out through the long windows to the floodlight beams across the lawns turned to milk chocolate by the fog may i list once again your items of evidence from the felling of thomas dobbs in the north transept to the apparently supernatural extinguishing of two votive candles i never said any of that was evidence of course you didnt you were merely reporting to me the decision must be mine on the advice of my female exorcist the appointment of whom i was strongly advised against at the time i didnt know that you didnt you really didnt oh come merrily silly of me arrogant perhaps yes the bishop said thats certainly how its going to look when someone leaks to the media that within weeks of your appointment you advised me to have my cathedral formally exorcized i know if you want to go the whole hog why not have the ceremony conducted entirely by and in the presence only of women priests obviously that wouldnt offend me being a radical mick you know theres nothing political nothing political are you quite serious tell me merrily do you want to become the subject of a hate campaign in the diocese as well as receiving an unflattering profile in the observer and any number of politely vitriolic letters to the church times do you want to move quite quickly to a new and challenging ministry on the other side of the country no and do you want to damage me silence a dismal headshaking silence merrily said so youd like me to resign mick hunter grinned teeth as white as the doric pilaster behind him certainly not id far prefer you to go home have a good nights sleep and forget this illadvised visit ever occurred it isnt the first time something like this has happened to me and it wont be the last time it happens to you let it serve to remind you that people like us will always have opponents enemies within the church mick dont you think this is far too complicated and too bizarre to be a setup oh merrily i can see your experience of being set up is really rather limited my advice if youre approached again by the source of this insane proposal is that you tell him you questioned the wisdom of informing me and decided against it making it my decision to say no to an exorcism its a responsible role you now have merrily learning discrimination is part of it or you could go ahead with it without informing me which would of course were i or anyone else to find out be very much a matter for resignation but i dont think youd do that because you dont really believe any of this idiocy any more than i do do you merrily i dont know she put her face in her hands pulling the skin tight i dont know mick stood up and helped her to her feet get some sleep eh its been a difficult week i dont know she repeated how can i know of course you dont know he put an arm around her shoulders peered down into her face then said as if talking to a child thats what theyre counting on merrily hmm look if i dont go back and be pleasant to the awful councillors val will be very unhappy at the door she sought out and held his famous blue eyes will you at least think about it ive already forgotten about it merrily he said good night god bless the fog seemed to be lifting but the grass was already stiff with frost the cathedral was developing a hard edge she crossed the green and walked into church street the door in the alleyway beside the shop called john barleycorn was opening as she reached it hi hello flower jane stood outside in the alley no coat on her dark hair pushed back behind her ears face upturned she was shivering a little i lied they stood about five feet apart merrily thought we all lie especially to ourselves i dont have anywhere else to sleep jane said i dont actually know many people at all i uh dont even know the people i thought i knew so like the only friends i have are lol and you i i hope she began to cry im sorry mum im really really really merrilys eyes filled up i think there must be a whole load of things jane snuffled that i havent even realized i did yet like all the time i was doing this stuff selling you up the river i told the bitch everything i told her about everything and when i said that to you about selling my you didnt merrily said very firmly i didnt hear you say anything flower as they clung together on the already slippery cobbles she thought this is all that matters isnt it this is all there is the turning she was like an elderly bushbaby in some anklelength mohair thing in dark brown she was waiting for him in the residents lounge where they were now alone all the others at church she said bargaining for an afterlife she did not want to know anything about him waste of time at my age robinson its all forgotten by lunchtime lol didnt think so her eyes were diamondbright behind round glasses a bit like his own anyway she said i prefer to make up my own mind and she peered at him eyes unfocusing oh what a confused boy you are so confused arent you and blocked too theres a blockage in your life i should like to study you at length but you havent the time have you not today youre in a frightful hurry lol nodded bemused slow down she said think things out or youll land in trouble especially dealing with the purefoys do you understand me not yet presumably sorrel podmore had given her the background over the phone which was good it saved time shed collected all the cushions from the other chairs and had them piled up around her she was like a tiny exotic dowager what do you know about the purefoys virtually nothing thats a good place from which to start its a very very unpretty story jane had stood at the bedroom window for a long time still feeling in spite of everything an urge to salute the eternal spiritual sun without this and the other exercises without the pod there was a large spiritual hole in her life she wasnt sure she was ready for mums god although part of her wanted to go to morning service if only to show penitence and solidarity another part of her felt it would be an empty gesture hypocrisy and anyway she was like burning up with anger and if the eternal spiritual sun wherever the bastard was these days could add fuel to that this was ok by mystic jane while mum was conducting her morning service jane pulled on the humble duffel and walked into stillfrozen ledwardine across the market square where at close to midday the cobbles were still white and lethal she moved quickly did not slip fury making her surefooted rage at what they were trying to do to mum and what theyd already done they who who apart from rowenna with whom there was unfinished business jane walked down to the unfashionable end of the village where longuntreated timbers sagged and the black and white buildings looked grey with neglect she and mum had sat up until nearly two am hunched over this big comfort fire of coal sweetened with apple logs like old times together except it wasnt because mum was dead worried and you could understand it shed talked frankly maybe for the first time about the dilemmas constantly thrown up by deliverance the need to believe and also disbelieve and the knowledge that you were completely on your own especially with a selfserving hypocritical bastard of a bishop like mick hunter but she wasnt alone now oh no jane stopped outside the ox the pulsing oranges and greens of gaming machines through the windows were brighter than the pub sign outside this was as near as ledwardine came to las vegas jane went in she was pretty sure they would be here theyd been coming here since they were about thirteen and theyd be coming till they were old and bald and never had a life there was just one bar not big but already half full most of the men in there were under thirty most of the women under twenty dregs of the saturdaynight crowd though the pub was old and timbered the lighting was garish a jukebox was playing pearl jam it was loud enough but the voice from halfway down the room was louder watkins right wall and gittoes were at a table by the jukebox hugging pints of cider jane strolled over to the fat swollenmouthed slimeball and the bony spotty loser who had once she recalled expressed a wish to have unholy communion with her mother i want to talk to you danny outside danny gittoes looked up slowly and blinked im drinking and its cold out there jane took a chance shed gone to sleep thinking about this and shed woken up thinking about it if she was wrong well she just didnt bloody deserve to be wrong must have been cold in the church too she said what are you on about watkins gittoes had this narrow face dopey eyes dean wall rose and tucked his belly into his belt if the lady wants to go outside lets do it siddown wall jane snarled indicated gittoes just that got no secrets from dean gittoes said i believe you jane put on her grimmest smile rowenna and i we dont have secrets either for christmas im buying her a whole case of extrastrength mouthwash fetch me a map demanded athena white theres a stack of them in the hall fetch me an os map of hereford i want to locate this dinedor hill miss white seemed much happier now she knew precisely what this was about and what he was about the process of knowing him and where hed been and what made him afraid had taken all of ten minutes it would take dick lyden maybe four full sessions to get this far lol was impressed also disturbed he sensed she could be well malevolent when she wanted to there was something dangerously alien about athena white unmoving sunk into her many cushions but her mind was darting picking up the urgency of this telling her about katherine moon had been the right thing to do he brought her the map spread it out on the floor she commanded move that perfectly awful table there oh dear its what one misses most stuck out here the seclusion the study time yes but there are things going on that one misses ok dinedor hill why dinedor hill put your finger on it robinson cant make out the damned map but i can at least see your finger now give me your other hand he found himself kneeling on the map with the forefinger of one hand on dinedor hill while she held his other hand both of her small hands over his they were frail and bony and very warm look at it robinson look at the hill no not on the map you fool picture it in your mind feel yourself there feel the wind blow feel the damp the cold think about moon being there shes coming towards you isnt she now tell me what youre seeing im seeing the crow he said at once her hand inside the crow were standing right at the end of the ramparts with the city below us and the church spire aligned with the cathedral tower good in the moments of quiet he could hear crockery clinking several rooms away footsteps clumped outside the door the handle creaked and athena white let out a piercing squeak get away from that door go away and the footsteps went away miss white said she killed that crow you know i wondered about that i think she would have brought the crow down and killed it brought it down how crow maiden he thought and the crows would come denny had said crowsd come right up to her lol opened his eyes through the window the radnor hills were firming up as the mist receded you could see the underside of the sun in the southern sky you see it doesnt really work unless the blood is still warm athena white explained jane and danny gittoes stood in the alley alongside of the ox there were mens toilets here the foulsmelling kind and she was starting to get pictures of danny gittoes and rowenna jane im sorry all right im sorry about your mothers church but i didnt take nothing did i and it was her idea all of it yeah tell that to the police i did it for a blowjob officer real mitigatingcircumstances situation that is the magistrates will really like you for that gittoes ill pay for it all right ill pay for the window tell me about the suit what about it what did she say about the suit she said it was a joke on you and your ma i didnt twig it she had the suit in the back of her car in one of them plastic suitbags like you get from the cleaners and i had to keep it inside the bag till id got it in the wardrobe then take it out of the bag did she go in with you she waited outside with the torch she shone the torch in and she told me where to put the suit and to make sure it was out of sight look watkins this is between you and her right this ent nothing youre going down for it gittoes nobody goes down for breaking a window it gets in the paper though and then everybody knows how pitiful you are everybody sees this redhaired stunner and then they look at you it does kind of test the imagination doesnt it danny itll like follow you around for years beauty and the sad git what about her you really think she cares what anybody thinks hey wow i forgot jane stepped away from him and began to smile isnt your stepfather up for a vacancy on the parish council fuck you watkins not even in your dreams what do you want what you want me to do tell me what happened when she first approached you was she on her own course she was on her own i bet you thought she actually fancied you didnt you gittoes blushed dont worry shes good at that jane said come on dont stand there like a bloody halfpeeled prawn talk to me i dunno what you want what do you know about her shes your friend cooperate jane hissed or the first thing that happens like tonight is word gets to reach your stepfather please what you wanner know you wanner know where she goes when you ent with her you wanner know who her real boyfriend is cause i followed her all right on the motorbike yeah i thought i was in with a chance how sad is that i followed her around i can give you stuff to like even the score if youll leave me alone keep talking hairball jane said for quite a long time miss white continued she did not really understand what a satanist was for a start nobody would ever admit to being one you had this absurd american selfpublicist la vey with his church of satan following a poor variation of crowleys do what thou wilt philosophy but that was a misnomer there wasnt that quality of pure naked hate which satanism implied black magic ah not quite the same thing black magic was simply the use of magic to do harm and yes miss white had been tempted too was often tempted aware of course of the easy slope from mischief to malignity but she had done worse things without the need for magic hadnt everyone miss white had practised ritual magic for a number of years before the robes and the swords and the chalices had begun to seem rather unnecessary and faintly absurd it was during this period that she first encountered anna purefoy or anna bateman as she was then we were both civil servants at the time anna worked at the defence ministry secretary to an undersecretary quite a highly paid post for a girl her age she never hid her interest in the occult neither did i there are a surprising number of senior civil servants practising the dark arts by which of course i do not mean satanism to the vast vast majority of ritual magicians the idea of worshipping a vulgar creature with horns and halitosis is absolute anathema the change came with annas persecution by christians in the person of a junior defence minister with a rigid presbyterian background a far more senior civil servant had been linked by a sunday newspaper to an offshoot of aleister crowleys magical foundation the oto in the resulting purge annas resignation had been sought and bitterly given i suppose her resentment and loathing of the christian church began there miss white said but it really developed when she met tim timothy purefoy already a rich man and getting richer tim like anna was blond and rather beautiful terribly charming and infinitely solicitous especially to elderly ladies in the area of oxfordshire where he plied his trade for in tims hands it was indeed a trade what did he do lol asked he was a minister of the church of england of course first a curate and then a rector i think hed risen to rural dean by the time he was thirty a throwback in many ways what they used to call a hunting parson field sports and dinner parties frightfully well connected etc and so he often got named along with the church itself of course in the published wills of wealthy widows this is common practice and the church seldom bats an eyelid as long as it gets its share as well timothy was always terribly careful like that probably be a bishop by now if he hadnt become fatally attracted to anna then reduced to a comparatively lowly post with oxfordshire county council miss white assumed that by this time annas bitter resentment of the church its prejudices and the hold it retained on the british establishment had almost certainly become obsessively bound up with her continuing magical studies the church had destroyed her promising career so she felt driven to wound the church at every opportunity lol was picturing the gentle sweetfaced woman with flour on her apron in that mellow farmhouse kitchen then later dabbing her eyes at moons funeral the destruction humiliation or corruption of a priest is a great satanic triumph miss white said everyone knows that but the greatest triumph the ultimate prize is the defection the turning of an ordained minister does that really happen he thought of big bluff jovial tim purefoy in his shiny new barbour and cap come to the farmhouse have a coffee i dont know how often it actually happens said miss white perhaps some of them remain ministers while practising their secret arts how many churches have been clandestinely dedicated to the devil how can anyone know what i do know is how very very much it must have appealed to anna as an exmod person the idea of turning tim the cold war was at its height former british agents like philby flaunted by the soviets so how wonderful how prestigious among her circle to convert a priest to satan especially such a recognizably establishment figure as tim purefoy of how it happened miss white had no specific knowledge but one can imagine the rural deans slowburning obsession with the sensational blonde in the little cottage those long erotic sunday interludes between matins and evensong the subtler arts of sexual love come naturally to a magician she said enigmatically but if hed got such a good thing going milking widows and being accepted by the county set why would he give that all up well he didnt of course not voluntarily athena believed it was a new curate some earnest evangelical practising an almost monastic selfdenial who blew the whistle on both of them it was revealed that anna had been giving regular tarot readings to villagers in a cottage in the very shadow of tims parish church and also once famously at the parish fete it was anna who was driven out of the village first by a hate campaign drawing support from fundamentalist christians for miles around and meanwhile tim was photographed leaving her cottage late at night it rather escalated from there but it never became a very big scandal because the church kept the lid on it i dont know whether tim was dabbling in satanism by then or whether that came later but it did come by which time both held a considerable grievance against the witchhunting church itself and the annexing of his spiritual baggage no matter how corrupted it already was due to his weak and greedy character must have been an enormous boost for her own influence among her peers through the window lol could see a platoon of elderly ladies advancing up the drive damn athena said first theyll head off to their rooms to freshen up if thats a suitable term then theyll all come twittering in how did the purefoys carry on making a living when a minister defects he is treated just like philby in moscow as a great celebrity he is presented at court as you might say what do you mean by court oh robinson even i dont know who most of these people are very wealthy very evil actual criminals some of them certainly the narcotics trade whatever they call it these days has a very large satanic element and has had for decades the purefoys had capital they had contacts they had a very english charm with their patronage and advice lucrative property deals followed leading for instance to the purchase of that building in bridge street housing the pod i then simply could not continue working with that group any more which was a great pity as it did get me out of here once a week they always sent a car for me no i knew what was going to happen you see what they would use the pod as what do you call it a front anything from an innocent reception centre to a kind of spiritual brothel podmore already told me about your friends daughter but i want to ask you something about that this friend herself wouldnt by any chance be merrily watkins how did you know that ha this clarifies certain small mysteries oh what a target that woman must be for the purefoys and their ilk a female exorcist and such a pretty girl yes lol began to fold the map ah said athena calmly i see whereve you been i mean where have you been the kid just staring back at her and merrily taking a deep breath gripping the aga rail im sorry christ what am i saying i dont know mum i close my eyes in church i see that limegreen fiesta reversing into our drive i come back from church and youre not here im sorry there is no reason at all you have to be here all the time no youre right jane said it was thoughtless of me ignore me flower im badly badly paranoid previously i see a stranger in the congregation and i think yes wow another one now when i glimpse an unfamiliar face im watching for a little sneer at some key moment im watching their lips when we say the lords prayer i go round afterwards and sniff where they sat jesus i shouldnt be saying this to you youre only sixteen yes i am jane said mildly and ive just been to see danny gittoes rowenna gave him like oral sex in return for breaking into the church and contaminating your cassock with denzil joys suit just thought you should know that merrily broke away from the aga also and im not qualified to like evaluate the significance of this but rowennas been seeing euphemism ok seeing a young guy by the name of james lyden he goes to the cathedral school and apparently tonight hes going to be enthroned in the cathedral as something called vomit vomit boy bishop does this mean anything to you medieval thing she called huw but there was no answer she didnt know his sunday routine perhaps he drove from church to church across the mountains service after service until he was all preached out if he had a mobile or a carphone it wouldnt work up there anyway she next called sophie at home sophie thank god was home merrily pictured a serene pastel room with a high ceiling and a grandfather clock sophie are you going to the boy bishop ceremony tonight i always do sophie said as the bishops laysecretary i consider my role as extending to his understudy thats not quite the right word is it as i understand it the boy is a symbolic replacement the bishop actually giving way to him well perhaps should i explain it to you merrily please she listened and made notes on her sermon pad shall i see you there sophie asked god willing i should like to talk to you ive delayed long enough an hour later merrily called huw again and then she called lol but there was no answer there either and no one else to call when she put the phone down she said steadily to herself i shouldnt need this i shouldnt need help jane coming into the scullery with coffee said you can only ever go by what you think is right mum all right listen flower sit down im going to hang something on you and you in your most cynicallittlebitch mode are going to give me your instinctive reactions jane pulled up a chair and they sat facing one another sideon to the desk shoot jane said its a medieval thing most of hereford seems to be a medieval thing jane said in the thirteenth century apparently it was a fairly widespread midwinter ceremony in many parts of europe sometimes he was known as the bishop of the innocents it was discontinued at the reformation under henry viii the reformation wasnt kind to the cathedral anyway stainedglass windows were destroyed statues smashed then there was the civil war and puritanism in most cathedrals the boy bishop never came back but hereford reintroduced it about twentyfive years ago and its now probably the most famous ceremony of its kind in the country the basis of it is a line from the magnificat which goes he hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble and meek thats crap jane said i dont know anybody my age who is remotely humble or meek how about if i tell you when to come on with the cynicism ok back to the ceremony after a candlelit procession the bishop of hereford gives up his throne to the boy who takes over the rest of the service leads the prayers gives a short sermon would i be right in thinking there arent a whole bunch of boys queuing up for this privilege probably its a parent thing also a choir thing the boy bishop is almost invariably a leading chorister or a recently retired chorister and he has several attendants from the same stable so what youre saying is hunter symbolically gives up his throne to this guy no it isnt symbolic he actually does it and then the boy and his entourage proceed around the chancel and into the north transept where hes introduced to st thomas cantilupe at the shrine or in this case the hole where the shrine used to be yes i understand this will the first time since the institution of the ceremony in the middle ages that theres been no tomb heavy right merrily said so youre following my thinking maybe jane pushed her hair behind her ears merrily said if and this is the crux of it you wanted to isolate the period when hereford cathedral was most vulnerable to shall we call it spiritual disturbance you might choose the period of the dawning of a millennium when the tomb of its guardian saint lies shattered and when the lord bishop of hereford she broke off searching for the switch of the anglepoise lamp the red light of the answering machine shone like a drop of blood is a mere boy jane supplied thats the final piece of huws jigsaw is that a load of superstitious crap or what you can now be cynical thanks so merrilys hand found the lamp switch and clicked the light found jane propping up her chin with a fist how long do we have before the ceremony starts it takes place during evensong which was held in the late afternoon until mick took over mick thinks evensong should be just that at seventhirty just over three hours from now oh not very long at all no jane stood up hands in the hip pockets of her jeans why dont you try calling huw owen again he isnt going to be there flower if he is it would take him well over an hour to get here try lol again maybe he can put the arm on james lydens dad the psychotherapist maybe he can all right merrily punched out lols number the phone was picked up on the second ring john barleycorn a strange voice oh is lol there no hes not this is dennis moon in the shop sorry its the same line im not usually here on a sunday but lols not around anyway can i give him a message if he shows before i leave could you ask him to call merrily please sure ill leave him a note face it merrily said hanging up this guy is not going to pull his boy out of the ceremony thus forcing them to abort it i suppose not actually it does seem quite scary what if something did happen and we could have prevented it but on the other hand what could happen well it wont be anything like thunder and lightning and the tower cracking in half she saw jane stiffen flower why did you say that what about the tower cracking in half it was the first stupid thing i thought of thats the tarot card angela turned up for me the tower struck by lightning its just sorry your imagination sometimes goes berserk doesnt it look merrily stood up and put an arm around her thunder is not forecast anyway you dont get thunder at this time of the year in this kind of weather that towers been here for many centuries the tarot card is purely symbolic and even if something like that did happen it did in what did we did this in school they had a west tower then and it didnt have proper foundations and the place was neglected and on easter monday the whole lot collapsed merrily moved away looked down at the desk gathering her thoughts look even if it was likely its still not the worst disaster that could happen you mean the collapse of spirituality jane said soberly whatever you say about the church flower theres no moral force to replace it ok jane said so suppose all the people jumping off the tower struck by lightning are the ones like abandoning christianity as the whole edifice collapses suppose the final disintegration of the church as we know it was to start here merrily said would you care blood the crow as the crow flies a straight line dinedor hill all saints church hereford cathedral and two further churches ending in whats this place robinson cant make it out stretford for a moment it stopped his breath this is the church of st cosmas and st damien oh robinson athena white said oh yes once the old ladies had begun to gather in the lounge shed beckoned lol away and up the stairs in athenas eyrie with the afghan rugs and all the cupboards the os map of hereford had been opened out on the bedspread and the line from dinedor drawn in athenas glasses were white light it was in the hereford times wasnt it was that last week i cant remember the crow the crow why does one never see what is under ones nose they happened the same night the crow sacrifice and moons death and a minister called dobbs had a stroke in the cathedral yes it all came out then in strands of theory and conjecture which eventually hung together as a kind of certainty tim purefoy had said thats one of alfred watkinss leylines an invisible mystical cable joining sacred sites prehistoric path of power theyre energy lines you know and spirit paths so were told probably all nonsense but at sunset you can feel you own the city now athena white said it doesnt matter whether its there or not robinson its what the magician perceives is there the magician uses visualization driven by willpower to create an alternative reality moon had said the line goes through four ancient places of worship ending at a very old church out in the country but it starts here and this is the highest point so all these churches including the cathedral remain in its shadow this hill is the mother of the city the camp here was the earliest proper settlement long before there was a town down there when the first christian churches were built rome ordered them to be placed on sites of earlier worship places already venerated so as to appropriate their influence but you see robinson the prechristian element never really went away because of the continued dominance of dinedor hill so if your aim was to destabilize the cathedral and all it symbolizes you might well decide to cause a vibration in what lies beneath and lol had said to merrily ironically in the cafe in the all saints church on the actual line from st cosmas to dinedor hill in celtic folk tales crows and ravens figured as birds of illomen or as a form taken by antichristian forces at one end of the line athena said a crow is sacrificed at the other at the highest point is your crow maiden lol said sacrificed oh yes they killed her or helped her to take her own life probably yes im sorry robinson i dont know if this is what you wanted to hear its just are you sure about this shes an old woman he thought she lives in a fantasy world you have to be sure and yet she said these two deaths are so different calm down robinson i wont let you make a fool of yourself you see as crowley once pointed out a sacrifice was once seen as a merciful and glorious death allowing the astral body to go directly to its god this essentially means a quick death a throat cut the way the crow presumably died but your friends blood was let out through the wrists not quick at all a slow release crow maiden youre fadin away what did you say just a line from a song athena whites clasped hands were shaking with concentration robinson have we discussed the power of blood on the way back from the glades lol kept glancing at the passenger seat because of a dark disturbing sensation of moon sitting beside him id like to sleep now i know he said once i know you cant sleep but i just dont know what to do about it at the lectern in ledwardine church with the altar behind them candles lit merrily took both janes hands in hers and looked steadily into the kids dark eyes you all right about this sure merrily had locked the church doors the first time shed ever locked herself in a church was not a private place it should always offer sanctuary merrily gripped the kids hands more firmly christ be with us she said christ within us christ behind us jane read from the card placed in the open bible on the lectern christ before us hello laurence denny said tiredly the shop was all in boxes around his knees despite the possible implications for his own domestic future lol had forgotten about dennys decision to shut john barleycorn for ever the walls were just empty shelves now even the balalaika packed away the ochre walllamps which had lit moon so exquisitely did her brother denny no favours his face was grey as he wiped his brow with the sleeve of his bomber jacket i havent been totally frank with you lol another reason for all this is that im going to need all the money i can get he looked away to pay maggie off lol remembered the distance between them at moons cremation you and maggie aw been coming a while i wont explain now kathys death could have saved it at least thats what she thought maggie but the very fact she thought that denny smashed a fist into a tall carboard box that made it unfuckingtenable im sorry lol said awkwardly the urge welling up in him to tell denny what he believed had really happened to moon but could denny in his present state absorb this arcane insanity what about the kids he said instead shell have them denny taped up the flaps of a box full of cds im hardly gonner fight that he looked across at the door to the stairs do something for me laurence the bike moons bike take it away would you its oppressive i dream about it how do you mean i dream i have these fucking dreams it starts with the bike and then it turns into this like cart with the same big wheels like some old war chariot i want to get into it and i know if i do its gonner take me up there again no fucking way to the hill no way man so would you do that would you get rid of the bike somebodys gonner buy or lease this place see and then theyll make me take the bike out im not touching it its like that fucking sword you know take it away flog it dump it somewhere i dont know where it is all right ill do that tomorrow thanks oh yeah a woman rang for you mary merrily probably she said could you call her look lol i tried to use you to compensate for my brotherly inadequacies i regret that now along with all the rest there wasnt a lot you could do den in the end moons fate was in other hands no dennys eyes narrowed i dont buy this shit lol im not buying any more than that she was sick im not having anything else unloaded on me i wont go down that road lol nodded so he himself would have to go down that road alone hello this is ledwardine vicarage merrily and jane arent around at the moment but if youd like lol put down the phone and went to sit down for a while in ethels chair onceinsignificant details crowding his mind like the sword the sword shed just happened to find in a pit where it looked as though the purefoys had been digging a pond the sword sticking up for her to find like it was meant theyd put it there hadnt they perhaps theyd found it where denny had buried it or perhaps it wasnt the same sword at all dennys own memory refashioning it to fit the circumstances at the funeral anna purefoy had said we were so delighted by her absorption in the farm that we couldnt resist offering her the barn we thought she was perfect moon was perfect for them because according to the tenets of anna purefoys occultism moons obsession was a passage to the heart of the hills pagan past by stimulating a resurgence of the oncedominant pagan energy they were attempting to induce a spiritual reversion using the celtic tradition of vengeful crowgoddess and blood ritual to link that holy hill with the premedieval church at the terminus of the leyline alignment thus feeding something old and corrupt inside the christian cathedral belief was all athena white had said it didnt matter how real any of this was so long as they believed it they hadnt even had to bend moon to their will she was already halfway there but had they actually killed her had they used the celtic sword as a sacrificial blade to cut her wrists because if they hadnt done anything physical it was an unprovable crime bizarrely akin to euthanasia perhaps not even a crime at all he called merrily again hello this is led he put the phone down then lifted it again and redialled waiting for the message to end merrily he said look ive got to tell somebody its about moon and and your desecration thing at the little church he talked steadily about crows and sacrifice after three minutes the bleeps told him his time was up he waited for a minute then called back waited again for the message to finish this time he talked about projections he knew why he was doing this he had to hear himself saying it to decide if he could believe it moons father not a ghost but a projection a transferred image transmitting a projection athena looking rather coy at this point was not terribly difficult especially if the purefoys had a photograph to work with photographs and memories halftruth and circumstance and the power of the ancestors usurped by some combination of projection hypnosis psychicsuggestion maybe you have better words for this they may have steered her to suicide when the bleeps started again he didnt call back he took up his habitual stance at the window looking down into christmaslit church streetcapuchin lane moons agitated shade was misting the periphery of his vision moon with her medieval dress and her rescueme hair what did you do with information like this what could you do but take it to the police or try to get it raised at the inquest but the man to do this was denny the brother at some stage denny who wanted none of it would have to be told lol went downstairs in the shop below denny was sitting his back to lol on the last filled box john barleycorn was no more destroying something can be a very cleansing thing denny had his hands loosely linked and he was rocking slowly on the box his earring swaying like a pendulum tick tick tick you er you want to go for a drink nah not tonight laurence only you were right lol said about needing to talk couldnt face it now mate denny stared out of the window anyway you wouldnt wanner be with me tonight he heaved himself down from the box and grinned ill be off you look a bit shaggedout laurence get some sleep itll all seem much clearer in the morning it will maybe denny looked around the skeleton shop good night mate he turned in the doorway thanks there was a full moon they hadnt seen it coming because of the fog but tonight was a flawless icy night and the moon hung over broad street and the christmas santas couldnt compete jane thought hail to thee lady moon whose light reflects our most secret hopes her only secret hope tonight was for mum to come through this with everything intact her reputation her mind hail to thee from the abodes of darkness there wont be any darkness jane thought willing it and willing it there wont they stood together on the green watching people file into the cathedral the usual evensong congregation plus whatever audience the boy bishop ceremony pulled in with its prechristmas pageantry and extra choral element mum had come in her long black cloak the winterfuneral cloak wearing it partly because you couldnt turn up for a ceremony at the cathedral in a ratty old waxed jacket and partly because it was so much better for concealing oh please no the footlong giltpainted wooden cross shed taken from ledwardine church prising it out of the roodscreen with a screwdriver then immersing its prongs in holy water the whole bit the complete crazy van helsing ensemble and merrily had no plan if the worst happened if there was some indication of what she called infiltration she was just going to like walk out holding the cross high and shouting the magic words from the deliverance handbook madness at the very least professional suicide church of england ministers did not behave like this she would be making her entire career into this minor footnote in ecclesiastical history right under the bit about the female priests who circledanced around the cathedral touching up dead bishops and that was what you wanted wasnt it you always thought it was a wasted life no uncomfortable jane turned away from her mother she didnt know she didnt know any more she began to feel helpless and desperate they needed help and there was none she looked up at the cathedral warm light making its windows look like the doors in an advent calendar she was aware of the timeless apartness of the place even though it was surrounded by city she thought about its possible future as a tourist attraction or a carpet warehouse or something a rush of confused emotions were creating a panicbomb just as a woman came towards them she wore an expensive suede coat and a silk headscarf sophie hill the bishops secretary and mums secretary too sophie who mum explained didnt need a secretarys job but did need to be part of the cathedral sophie was looking apprehensive oh hello jane she began awkwardly which was like goodbye jane mum said why dont you go in flower and find us a discreet pew with a good view but not too near the front sure jane said meekly she was wearing her new blue fleece coat and a skirt respectable as she slipped away the panicbomb began to tick walking quickly down towards the cathedral porch when she was sure they couldnt see her she diverted along the wall and back across the green running from tree to tree to the access path and down into church street seeing this big bald guy come out of john barleycorn and thank you thank you god lol robinson behind him in the doorway she started waving frantically at lol as the bald guy vanished down the alley towards high town jane he looked seriously hyped up nervous but grateful to see her all of those with the overhead christmas greens and reds strobing in his glasses his hands making fists and his mouth forming unspoken words like he was full of stories that just had to be told but as jane said oh lol mum is in such deep shit and her tears defused the panic reduced it to mere despair he just listened listened to all the stuff about what mum and this loopy huw called the squatter and about the boy bishop who was the weak point like the fuse in an electric circuit this was when lol finally cut in how long how long before the boy bishop gets enthroned yeah how long he was out in the street now pulling the shop door closed behind him shivering in his frayed sweatshirt i dont know i dont know where in the service it comes in half an hour maybe only ten minutes she was asking him if he could get to this dick lyden first and make him stop his son from going through with it but lol was just shaking his head like she knew he would and then he was pushing her away up the street go back jane stay with her what about you im going to going to do what i can you know whats going to happen dont you lol i want to come with you you cant you really know whats going to happen dont you at least you have an idea i dont know anything jane i just lol she stumbled on the icedup cobbles clinging to his arm dobbs stood up against it dobbs put himself in the way and he wound up as this paralysed dribbling dobbs was an old man in poor health he held her steady go back to her jane he was also jane broke lols grip and spun to face him he was also this really experienced exorcist he knew all about this stuff hed been planning for ages he knew exactly what he was facing while mums just she wouldnt thank you for saying she was just a woman oh for gods sake its more than that yes he said lol who can we call we cant raise huw owen the bishops a total tosser all those guys in dogcollars in there are just like administrators and wardens and bursars and accountants all this dark energy gathering and she flattened herself against a shop window as a bunch of young guys came past hooting and sloshing lager at each other out of cans they were lurching up the ancient medieval straight path to hereford cathedral all huge and lit up like the titanic and none of them even seemed to notice it nobody really gives a shit any more do they jane said costume drama when jane reached the green again mum and sophie were gone into the cathedral presumably she looked behind her hoping lol would be there that hed changed his mind and would take her with him wherever he was going but the night was hard and bright and empty even the cackling lager crew had vanished she was alone now with the frostrimmed moon and the feeling of something happening around and within the old rusty stones that none of them could do a damned thing about she walked very slowly down to the cathedral hoping that something meaningful would come to her but all she experienced was a stiffening of her face as though the tears had frozen on her cheeks should she pray and if so to whom she reassured herself that all forms of spirituality were positive while acknowledging that the lady moon looked a pitiless bitch tonight jane went into the porch and turned left through an ordinary wooden and glazed door into the body of the cathedral always that small barely audible gasp when you came out into the vaulted vastness of it you were never sure whether it was you or some vacuum effect carefully developed by the old gothic architects the organ was playing some kind of lowkey religious canned music jane found herself on the end of a short queue of people they were mostly middleaged or elderly which made rowenna kind of stand out amongst them he remembered the last time hed been up here at night in the snow with moon beside him ive changed my mind i dont want you to come in what if hed then refused to take no for an answer what if hed gone into the barn with her what if hed resisted the pushing of the darkness against him the pushing of the darkness as he drove and fiddled vainly with the heater he tried to reexperience that thin frigid moment there was a draught through a crack in the door more chilling than blanketing cold outside it felt like the slit between worlds he wished denny was with him denny already had no love for the purefoys for taking advantage of moons fantasies so as to unload their crappy bodged barn conversion incomers stupid gits he needed the heat of dennys honest rage he needed this bloody heater to work having run to the car without his jacket because going back for it would have wasted crucial minutes crucial minutes like he knew what he was going to do like only time might beat him little foureyed lol expsychiatric patient shivering ice under the wheels carried the astra into the verge the bumper clipping a fence post denny owned a fourwheel drive had once done amateur rallying but denny wasnt here so lol was alone with a little knowledge a sackful of conjecture and the memory of the draught through a thinly opened door he came to the small parking area below the iron age camp and killed his headlights there were no other vehicles there but what did he expect black cars parked in a circle customized number plates all reading you know whats going to happen dont you lol got out of the astra and followed the familiar path big muscular trees crowded him between them he could see a mat of city lights but none around him none up here none here since damp smoky firelight had plumed within the cluster of thatched huts where families huddled against the dark beating of the crowgoddesss wings hed never felt so cold only the incense is missing merrily thought the warm colours of the soaring stone the rolling contours of the norman arches the suspended corona its daytime smiley sawtooth sparkle made numinous by the candles around it and the jetting ring of red in the bottom of a giant black castiron stove near the main entrance now a candlelight procession of choirboys singing plainsong in latin one of the choirboys the tallest of them wore robes and a mitre with a whitealbed candlebearer on either side there were about two hundred people in the congregation not enormous but substantial they looked entirely ordinary mostly over fifty but an encouraging few in their twenties dress tending towards the conservative but with few signs of the fuss and frothy hats such a service would once have produced sophie sat next to merrily just the two of them on a rear central pew sophies gloved hands were tightly clenched on her lap what shed said outside her face white and pitted as the moon had been banished to the back of merrilys mind not now not now her hands were underneath the cloak clasped around the cross she prayed it would never have to be revealed she prayed that in less than an hours time she and jane would be walking out of here relieved and laughing to the car where the cross would be laid thankfully on the back seat but where the hell was jane not in the nave not visibly in the nave but there were a hundred places in here to sit or stand concealed but why do that merrily studied james lyden he was a goodlooking boy and he clearly knew it could she detect an insolence a knowing smirk as the choirboy voices swirled and ululated around him perhaps not though it was probably jamess idea of pious and then there were two here was mick hunter on a low wooden seat under the rim of the corona it was not the first time shed seen mick in his episcopal splendour he wore it well like some matinee idol playing becket were all of us actors merrily the church is a faded but still fabulous costume drama she noticed the medieval touches the fishtail chasuble the primatial cross instead of the crozier mick was not going to be upstaged by a schoolboy sad jane would comment wherever she was as the plainsong ended the boy bishop turned his back on the congregation and knelt to face mick hunter on his throne merrilys fingers tightened on the stem of the cross jane had hidden in the little chantry chapel where the stone was ridged like a seashell she crouched where she supposed monks had once knelt to pray though not ordinary monks it was far too ornate the medieval chant washed and rippled around her so calming she must not be calm rowenna stood not ten feet away leaning against a pillar rowenna wearing a soft leather jacket short black skirt and black tights how would she react if rowenna was to walk in here now go for her like a cat go for her eyes with all ten nails uhhuh better to keep quiet and watch and listen whatever was going to happen here rowenna would be central to it she wasnt just here to watch her boyfriend who would not be her boyfriend at all if he hadnt been the chosen as boy bishop and jane suddenly remembered yesterdays lunch in slaters and rowenna saying listen i have to go go on ask me where youre gonna like this the cathedral then jane expressing surprise because shed understood they were going shopping and rowenna going i just forgot what day it was i have to meet my cousin breaking off at this point because lol had appeared but it was obvious now rowenna would have gone with james to his dress rehearsal so shed know exactly the evil duplicitous carnivorous slag jane didnt think shed ever hated anyone like she hated rowenna right now but it was wrong to hate like this in a cathedral it had to be wrong she emptied her mind as the bishops lovely deep velvet voice was relayed to the congregation through the speaker system what mum had once called his latenight dj voice so like really sincere james you have been chosen to serve in the office of boy bishop in this cathedral church will you be faithful and keep the promises made for you at your baptism in the silence jane heard a small bleep quite close it was such an uncathedral noise that she flattened herself against the stones and edged up to the opening and peeped out just once the boy bishop said in a kind of dismissive drawl i will the lord be my helper jane saw rowenna slipping a mobile phone into a pocket of her leather jacket mick hunter said the blessing of god almighty father son and holy ghost be upon you amen silence as jane held her breath the choir began to sing she relaxed it was done james lyden was boy bishop of hereford and nothing had happened had it amid the cold trees below the cold moon was a panel of light lol stopped on the iceglossed earthen steps he thought at first it must be the farmhouse and that he was seeing it from a different angle seeing behind the wall of leylandii but it was the barn the glazedover bay was one big lantern lol moved down the frozen steps and saw behind the plateglass wall tall candles burning aloft on eight or ten holders of spindly wroughtiron a beacon you would see it from afar like a fire in the sky laying a flickering path towards the cathedral tower it shocked him into stillness as if the same candles had been burning on katherine moons coffin behind their sombre shimmering he was sure shadows were moving all was quiet not an owl not a breath of wind a bitter still rockhard night he was scared calm down robinson athena white said from somewhere he ran from the steps to the rubblestone barn wall and edged towards the litup bay rough reflections of the candlelight were sketched on to the ridged surface of a long frozen puddle the remains of the pondexcavation where moon had said shed found the celtic sword when he reached the front door he realized it was lying open he backed away recalling the darkness pushing against him the slit between worlds tonight however the door was open and perhaps not only because he was so cold the barn seemed to beckon him inside merrily murmured to sophie what happens now a hush as the boy bishop and his two candlebearing attendants faced the high altar choristers were ranked either side poised for an instant on a single shared breath as mick hunter walked away smiling the choir sailed into song and the boy bishop approached the altar later sophie whispered the boy will lead us in prayer and then he gives a short sermon hell say how important the choirs been to him and that sort of thing but first therell be a kind of circular tour taking in the north transept the shrine i dont know quite how theyre going to cope with that this time perhaps they wont what are you doing merrily im going to watch she edged out of the pew holding the cross with one hand gathering her cloak with the other are you cold merrily yes me too i wonder if theres something wrong with the heating the candleled procession was leaving the chancel drifting left to the north transept merrily paused at the pews end she felt slightly out of breath as if the air had become thinner she looked at sophie are you really cold as well behind her there was a muffled slap on the tiles sophie rose oh my god merrily turned and saw a large woman in a grey suit half into the aisle her fingers over her face with blood bubbling between them and puddling on the tiles around her skittering feet abode of darkness the barn was like an intimate church lol could sense it around him a rich and velvety warmth he could see the long beeswax candles creamy stems aglow and imagine tendrils of soft scented smoke curling to the rafters he stood for a moment giving in to the deceptive luxury of heat experiencing the enchantment of the barn as he felt sure moon would have known it then catching his breath when the total silence gave way to an ashy sigh the collapse of crumbling logs in the hearth with a spasm of golden splinters the small implosion bringing a glint from a single nail protruding from the wall over the fireplace a nail where once hung a picture of a smiling man with his land rover which brought lol out of it tensing him because another blackframed photo hung there now of a longhaired woman in a long dress the candleholders were like dead saplings two of them framing a highbacked black chair thronelike and standing beside the chair lol nearly screamed was a priest in full holy vestments merrily was gesturing wildly for a verger a cleaner anybody with a mop and bucket people staring at her from both sides of the aisle as though she was some shrill houseproud harpy what she was seeing was the defiled altar at st cosmas blistered with halfdried sacrificial blood while this blood was close to the centre of the cathedral and it was still warm and it was human blood bright and pure and there was so damned much of it the choir sang on the boy bishop and his entourage were now out of sight out of earshot paying homage to cantilupe in all his fragments she should be there too she should be with them in the ruins of the tomb where the barrier was down where thomas dobbs had fallen yet yes all right irrationally maybe she also had to dispose of the blood the most magical medium for the manifestation of what what anyway she couldnt be in both places and there was no one else absolutely nobody else sophie was tending to the woman the contents of her large handbag emptied out on the pew the womans head tilted back sophie dabbing her nose and lips with a wet pad the woman struggling to say how sorry she was what a time for a nosebleed to happen she has them now and then a bulky greyhaired man was explaining in a low embarrassed voice to nobody in particular not on this scale i have to say its nerves i suppose itll stop in a minute merrily said sharply nerves oh he mumbled mother of the boy bishop all that stressful time all round youre dick lyden yes i am look cant you leave the cleaningup until after the service nobodys going to step in it thats not what im worried about mr lyden this is his mothers blood she was talking to herself searching for the significance of this i dont want the boy to see the fuss dick lyden pulled out a white handkerchief and began to mop his wifes splashes from his shoes hes temperamental you see someone had given james lyden one of the votive candles from near where the shrine had stood and he waited there while they pushed back the partition screen not how wed like it to be jane heard this big minister with the bushy beard say still im sure st thomas would understand absolutely james lyden said like he couldnt give a toss one way or the other there was no sign of rowenna pressed into the side of one of the pointed arches screening off the transept no more than six yards away from them jane saw it all as the bearded minister held open the partition door to the sundered tomb only the minister and the boy bishop went up to the stones as though it was not just stone slabs in there but cantilupes mummified body the two candlebearing boys in white tunics waited either side of the door like sentries one of them a stocky shockhaired guy saw jane and raised a friendly eyebrow shed never seen him before and pretended she hadnt noticed the bearded minister stood before one of the sidepanels with those mutilated figures of knights on it their faces obliterated like someone had attacked them centuries ago with a hammer and a stonechisel and a lot of hatred the minister crossed his hands over his stomach gazed down with closed eyes he saw nothing almighty god he said let us this night remember your servant thomas guardian of this cathedral church defender of the weak healer of the sick friend to the poor who well understood the action of our lord when his disciples asked of him which is the greatest in the kingdom of god and he shewed to them a child and set him in the midst of them jane saw james lydens full lips twist into a sour and superior sneer the minister said father we ask that the humility demonstrated by thomas cantilupe throughout his time as bishop here might be shared this night and always by your servant james no chance jane breathed grimly and the shockhaired boy must have seen the expression on her face because he grinned it is to our shame the minister went on that thomass shrine this cathedrals most sacred jewel should be in pieces but we know that james will return here when it is once again whole wouldnt put money on it this time jane looked down at her shoes and kept her mouth shut which was more than james did when he put down his candle on a masons bench and bent reverently to kiss the stone jane reckoned he must have spent some while dredging up this disgusting venomous wedge of thick saliva when his face came up smiling she felt sick she also felt something strange and piercingly frightening an unmistakable awareness in her stomach of the nearness of evil she gasped because it weakened her her legs felt numb and she wanted to be away from here but was not sure she could move she felt herself sinking into the stone of the arch she felt soiled and corrupted not so much by what shed seen but by what she realized it meant and she groped for the words shed intoned with all the sincerity of a budgie while mum held her hands before the altar at ledwardine christ be with us christ within us and then the electric lights went out look darling he said its mr robinson you remember mr robinson tim purefoy held a large glass of red wine close to the tablecloth white of his surplice anna wore a simple black shift quite lowcut she was a beautiful woman she threw off a sensual charge like a miasma like an aura lol supposed you know she said i thought one day there would be somebody i really didnt think it would be you the brother perhaps tim lowered himself with a grateful sigh into the chair all rage and bombast amounting in the end to very little like most of them or the exorcist anna said janes mother i did so want to meet her before we moved on but not this little chap here no indeed hidden depths do you think a bar of pewtery moonlight cut through the high window reaching almost to the top of tim purefoys pale curls he held up a dark bottle without a label glass of wine old son no thanks lol said tightly i seem to be interrupting something everything he said seemed to emerge slowly the way words sometimes did in dreams as though the breath which carried them had to tunnel its way through the atmosphere not at all tim purefoy took a long unhurried sip of wine its finished now its done were glad to have the company arent we darling done ah now mr robinson tim put down his glass then used both hands to pull the white surplice over his head letting it fall in a heap to the flags you must have some idea of what were about or you wouldnt be here anna purefoy brought lol a chair and stood in front of him until he sat down like he was going to be executed sacrificed anna looked young and fit and energized as if shed just had sex she must he thought be about sixty however sure you wont have a glass of wine before you die communion wine lol said tim purefoy laughed with a tincture of bats blood its our own plum wine silly anna took the bottle from her husband and held it out to lol see you really shouldnt believe everything you read about people like us lol remembered her patting floury hands on her apron one can buy a marvellous loaf at any one of a halfdozen places in town but one somehow feels obliged living in a house this old he was almost disarmed by the ordinariness of it the civility the domesticity candles like these in holders like these available in all good branches of habitat he blinked and forced himself to remember katherine moon congealing in her bath of blood glancing across towards the bathroom door holding the image of the dead grinning moon pickled like red cabbage in that room over there beyond those stairs behind that door visualization athena white had said willpower thank you lol accepted the stoppered wine bottle from anna he held it up for a moment before grasping it by the neck and smashing it into the stone fireplace he felt the sting of glassshards as the fire hissed in rage rivers of wine and blood ran down his wrist and down over the hanging photograph of moon now tell me what you did to her lol whispered the choir faded into trails of unconducted melody please remain in your seats the bishops voice crisply from the speakers we appear to have a power failure but were doing all we and then the pa system cut out merrily spotted mick in his mitre by candlelight amid jumping shadows before the candles began to go out one by one the air laden with the odour of cooling wax until there was only the oval of light on the corona like a catherine wheel over the central altar the last holy outpost she pulled the cross from under her cloak standing close to the pool of blood on the tiles though she couldnt see it now a baby began to cry she looked across the aisle and the pews towards the main door to where the big black stove should have been jetting red and saw nothing the stove was out too the cathedral gone dark gone cold jesus merrily feeling the fear like a ball of lead in her solar plexus may all that is you flow into me james the bearded minister called out are you there jane stepped out from the archway and heard the swish of heavy robes as the boy bishop brushed past her in the dark the candles held by the two attendants the sentries were also out only one small flame glowed the twoinch votive candle given to james lyden now lying on the masons bench jane ran and snatched it up hid the flame behind her hand and moved out into the transept listening for the swish of the robes lyden was going somewhere being taken somewhere escorted she heard him again his voice this time yeah ok she followed quietly though maybe not quietly enough wishing she had her trainers on instead of her stupid best shoes she could see him now a black mitred silhouette against the wan light from the huge diamondpaned gothic windows in the nave moonlight shadows of people unmoving jane heard anxious whispers and a babys cry mingling into a vast soup of echoes where was mum where was mum with the cross why wasnt she rushing for the pulpit because christ if there was a time for an exorcism a time for the soul police to make like an armed response unit this was it she could no longer see the mitred silhouette where had he gone the sneering bastard whod spat on the saints tomb and brought darkness although of course she knew it hadnt really happened like that somebody had hit a big fusebox somewhere it was all coincidence theatrics jane stumbled stepped into space groping for stone nearly dropping her stub of a candle hearing quick footsteps receding ahead of her steps stone steps going down the crypt the boy bishop was going into the crypt jane had never been down there although it was open to visitors mum had seen it mum said it was no big deal no there werent stacks of old coffins nothing like that tombs at one end effigies but not as many as you might expect it was just a bare stone cellar really and not as big as youd imagine jane stayed where she was at the top of the steps afraid actually admit it afraid of being down there with rowennas creepy boyfriend in his medieval robes afraid of what slimeball stuff she might see him doing the guy was a shit just like danny gittoes had broken into ledwardine church for rowenna james lyden had spat on the tomb of the saint for her another sexslave to rowenna who in turn was a friend of angela how long had rowenna known angela aware of this long slimetrail of evil unravelling before her jane edged down two steps listening hard nothing she raised the stub of votive candle in its little metal holder perhaps she held the light of st thomas the guardian could she believe that what did it matter jane shrugged helplessly to herself and went down into the crypt sacrilege blood lol said ive been learning all about blood feeling god help him the energy of it it had been the right thing to do another couple of minutes and the purefoys would have had him apologizing for disturbing their religious observance tim scowled mr robinson there are several ways we could react to your outburst of juvenile violence the simplest would be to call the police do it lol said if you think we would have any explaining to do anna said youre quite wrong we have an interest in ritual magic its entirely legal i am an ordained priest of god tim said my god is the god of abraham and moses and solomon the god who rewards knowledge and learning the god who shows us strength who accepts that plague and pestilence have their roles stop dressing it up the god to whom satan was a an albeit occasionally troublesome serving angel calling me a satanist as i suspect you were about to do is therefore something of an insult for which tim purefoy waved a hand i excuse you because it was said in ignorance we were both brought up in the christian tradition anna interrupted it took us a while to realize that christianity was introduced primarily as a constraint on human potential which has to be removed if we are to survive and progress lets say its simply run its course tim added with the fervour of the converted the church has no energy left its riddled with greed and corruption in this country alone its sitting on billions of pounds which could be put to more sensible use even if we didnt lift a finger it would destroy itself within the next fifty years but the signs are there in the sky too many to be ignored we cannot ignore signs the signs are what brought us here to hereford tim said but i dont think you want to know about that i think you want to know about the death of katherine moon i think youre here for reassurance that there was nothing you could have done to save her am i right and were happy to give you that anna smiled and reached across the firelight for his bloodied hand her fingers were slim and cool george curtiss had taken charge talking to vergers organizing people by sporadic candlelight shouting from the pulpit explaining as though he could merrily noticed that candles had to be repeatedly relit it was like last night when she and huw were at the saints tomb she stumbled past the central altar only three candles left alight on the corona looking around for jane and the bishop she found mick hunter eventually in the deep seclusion of his throne beyond the choirstalls the throne was of dark oak many pinnacled itself a miniature cathedral he came out to join her having removed the mitre his sigh was like an audible scowl merrily of all the people i could do without in this situation you really really have to let me do it mick keeping her voice low and steady you can look away you can grit your teeth but you have to let me do it do it you know exactly what i mean youve got darkness and cold and spilt blood in your cathedral what you must do now is wind up the service get the congregation out of here lock the doors and just just let me do it he stared down at her and although it was too dark to see his face she sensed his dismay and disbelief all right she said why dont you ask god why dont you go and kneel down quietly in front of your high altar and ask him ask him if hes happy about this the bishop didnt move there were just the two of them here in the holiest place she dropped the wooden cross and bent to pick it up i made a mistake didnt i mick hunter said i made a big mistake with you she straightened up looks like you did do you remember what i said to you last night when you asked me if i wanted your resignation from the post of deliverance consultant you told me to get a good nights sleep and forget about it and i couldnt sleep very well he said put it in writing for me tomorrow mick bishop he said i think jane heard him breathing so she knew roughly where he was like somewhere in the crypt because the breathing filled the whole intimidating blackness of it she had her coat open and the candle cupped in her hand inside she caught a finger in the flame and nearly yelped christ be with me she heard inside her head in mums voice mum be with me that might be more use just words like a mantra words to repeat and hold on to to try and shout down your fear like those poor doomed soldiers in the first world war singing in the trenches christ within me she walked towards the sound of breathing which came quicker now with a snorting and a snuffling gross what was this maybe she should get back up the steps and shout for help but there was a power cut and by the time she could get someone with a lamp down here it would be over whatever it was like she couldnt guess she shouted freeze bringing the candle out from under her coat she held it as high as she could reach a hundred quaking shadows broke out over the crypt and james lydens eyes opened wide in shock his mouth agape oh jane recoiled in disgust there he was the boy bishop with one gaitered leg on a longdead womans stone face his chasuble was tented over rowenna now emerging who for just a moment looked so gratifyingly ridiculous on her knees that jane laughed out loud you total slimeballs but she was nervous realizing this wasnt just some irreverent stunt the boy bishop in full regalia except presumably for his underpants this was an act of deliberate sacrilege it was meant to have an unholy resonance get out of here jane turned and made a dash for the steps but crashed into a wall in the dark you quickly lost any sense of direction when she turned back rowenna was already between her and the steps leading out suddenly jamess arms encircled her from behind his breath pumping against her neck jane screamed rowenna was easing the candle from between her fingers oh kitten she said thickly oh kitten what are we going to do with you now jane glared at her with open hostility does our friend here know you do the same with danny gittoes holding the candle steady between their two faces rowenna looked untroubled jane said does he know about those clergymen in salisbury rowenna shook her head sadly i now know everything about you jane continued i know exactly what you are rowenna smiled sympathetically youre not really getting any of this are you what i am is a woman while you are still very much a child jane glared at her in silent fury as rowenna just shook her head looking at her now you detected the kind of lazy arrogance in her eyes that you hadnt picked up on before and the coldness you must realize we were only friends because someone wanted your mother monitored yeah who and that sort of thing is how i make a bit of money sometimes someone at the pod angela you set me up for angela didnt you annoyance contorted rowennas small mouth oh please i was ahead of where the pod are years ago though it was quite touching to think of you standing at the window in your little nightie solemnly saluting the sun and moon and thinking you were plugged into the ancient wisdom you bitch pity it all went wrong though i could have really shown you things that wouldve blown you away oh youre just so full of shit rowenna i rowenna suddenly slapped janes face knocking her head back into jamess chest dont push your luck with me any more given time i could really do things to you i could make you totally fucking crazy jane felt james lydens breath hot on her neck and struggled vainly youre even fooling yourself you dont know anything rowenna held the candle very close to janes face so that she could feel its heat remember that suit the greasy old suit i had danny hide in the vestry yeah who told you to do that nobody told me i dont take anyones orders unless i want to rowenna wore a really sickly incensesmelling scent that seemed to fill up the entire crypt i just couldnt resist it after youd told me how denzil joy had so badly scared your mother i thought that would be really interesting to see if i could make him stick to her what rowenna put her face very close to janes and breathed the words into her for the first time jane knew what it meant to have ones skin crawl i found his widows name in the phone book so i sent james round to collect any old clothes for charity and next i got into her the reverend merrily watkins i nicked some of her cigarettes when i was at the vicarage and i smoked them slowly and visualized and i did a few other things and ok maybe i asked for a little assistance its amazing what help you can get when youre working on the clergy on the enemy and it worked didnt it it really made her sweat it made her ill you told me she was ill and i bet she didnt tell you the half of it jane felt sick she must be lying she couldnt have done all that youre just evil im special kitten im very special rowenna moved away no youre not youre just maybe you are a lot older than me youre like old before your time old and corrupted right rowenna stepped away from her thats it james james answered yes in this really subservient way hit her for me would you hit her hard james said what hit the little cunt no jane turned and hurled herself against him turned in his arms and pushed out at his face which made him angry and he let go for an instant and then he punched her hard in the mouth and then rowennas hand came at her like a claw grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her forward jane felt a crippling pain in the stomach and doubled up in agony another wrench at her hair pulled her upright so james could hit her again in the face enjoying it now excited yes rowenna hissed yes as janes legs gave way and the stone floor rushed up towards her perhaps she passed out then for a moment at least she forgot where she was we cant she heard from somewhere in the distance go on do it rowenna jane heard rowennas voice again from yesterday death can also just mean the end of something before a new beginning she saw rowenna pointing her knife across the table lord satan take me the tower struck by lightning people falling out of the crack a long way down on to the hard cold stone floor jane felt very afraid must get up she opened her eyes once and saw in a lick of light another face right under her own with dead stone eyelids theyd laid her out on one of the effigies she tried to lift her head from that stone face but she couldnt felt too heavy as if all the stones of st thomass tomb were piled on top of her then the candlelight went away as they pushed her further down against the stone surface she felt stone lips directly under hers never go off on your own with an exposed flame rowenna said its bad news kitten nightnight then a stunning pain on the back of her head and neck time passed no more voices only smoke smoke in her throat her head was full of smoke and words and mum whispering let me not run from the love that you offer but hold me safe from the forces of evil but mum was not here it was just a mantra in her head thank god for that george curtiss grunted from the pulpit as the lights came back on there was laughter now in the nave half nervous half relieved as georges words were picked up by the suddenly resensitized microphone well ah we dont know what caused this but it was most unfortunate very ill timed however at least ah at least it demonstrates to our boy bishop that the life of a clergyman is not without incident the boy bishop stood head bowed beneath the edge of the corona in front of the central altar itself mick hunter stood behind him one hand on the boys shoulder wed like to thank you all for being so patient i realize some of you do need to get home merrily stood in the aisle near the back of the nave looking around for jane and very worried now this is all that matters isnt it this is all there is something was wrong something else was wrong the power seemed to be restored but there was something missing a dullness lingered a number of bulbs failing to refunction perhaps the round spotlights in the lofty vaulted ceiling appeared isolated like soulless security lamps around an industrial compound its been suggested george said that we now carry on with the ceremony with the prayers and the boy bishops sermon but omit the final hymn so ah thank you and no warmth either the warm lustre had gone from the stones they had a grey tinge like mould their myriad colours no longer separated george curtiss stepped down an air of dereliction abandonment deadness as though something had entered under the cover of darkness and something else had been taken away dear god dont say that under her cloak the cross drooped from merrilys fingers as the choir began a little uncertainly it sounded with a reprise of the plainsong which had opened the proceedings sophie had appeared at her side what happened sophie have you seen jane im sorry no merrily what did michael say to you basically he sacked me but he cant just he can she looked for the puddle of blood left by mrs lydens nosebleed it was hardly visible carried off on many shoes into the darkness outside dont give in merrily sophie said you mustnt give in what can i do mick had melted away into the shadows james lyden bishop of hereford was alone sitting on his backless chair notes in hand waiting for the choir to finish i dont like that boy sophie said the choristers ended their plainsong with a raggedness and a disharmony so slight that it was all the more unsettling the sound of scared choirboys by contrast james lydens voice was almost shockingly clear and precise and confident a natural orator a short while ago when i took my vows the lord bishop asked me if i would be faithful and keep the promises made for me at my baptism you must stop him sophie murmured i cant suppose it suppose theres nothing of course james said i dont remember my baptism it was a long time ago and it was in london where i was born i had no choice then and the promises were made for me because i could not speak for myself sophie gripped her arm please but now i can james looked up even from here you could see how bright his eyes were drugbright now i can speak for myself dont let him stop him merrily or ill do it myself all right merrily brought out the cross it didnt matter now what anyone thought of her or how the bishop might react because he already had the worst that could happen no the best the best that could happen was that shed make a complete fool of herself and never be able to show her face in hereford again or in ledwardine either untying the cloak at her neck she began to walk up the aisle towards james lyden as james noticed her his lips twisted in a kind of excitement she kept on walking the backs of her legs felt weak just keep going stay in motion or freeze for ever members of the remaining congregation were now turning to look at her there were whispers and mutterings she kept staring only at james lyden who stood up in all his majesty whose voice was raised and hardened who said but as we have all seen tonight there is one who speaks more eloquently than i and his name his name is no merrily let the cloak fall from her shoulders brought up the wooden cross and walked straight towards the boy bishop her gaze focused on those fixed shining infested eyes below the mitre a small brilliance lol was seeing himself with moon down below the ramparts of dinedor camp they were burying the crow one of his hands still sticky with blood and slime for him the first stain on the idyll he saw moon turning away her shoulders trembling something reawoken in her did you ever watch her charm a crow anna purefoy asked it might be in a tree as much as fifty a hundred yards away and she would cup her hands and make a cawing noise in the back of her throat and the crow would leave its tree like a speck of black dust and come to her i dont think she quite knew what she was doing or was even aware that she was going to do it until it began to happen it fell dead at my feet out of the sky isnt that incredible it was simply something she could always do tim added further proof that she was very special lol glanced at the redstained photograph of moon over the fireplace not one hed seen before they must have taken it themselves athena white had told him how they would use photographs memorabilia of a dead person as an aid to visualization he turned back to the purefoys why dont you both sit down he didnt trust them he imagined anna purefoy suddenly striking like a cobra as you wish she slipped into one of the cane chairs tim hesitated and then lowered himself into the highbacked wooden throne after she was dead lol said you left out that cutting from the hereford times like a suicide note shed probably never even seen it had she it doesnt matter tim yawned thats a trivial detail lol made himself sit in the other cane chair keeping about ten feet between himself and them how did you kill her oh really anna leaned forward in the firelight a dark shadow suddenly spearing between her breasts darling no i wont have this tim murder is a crime we did not kill katherine we showed her the path she was destined to find and she took it according to the values of the celtic ethos we talked for hours and hours with katherine she could never relate to this era this commercial secular world this erratic world this panicking period in history she knew she didnt want to be here and she was looking for a way back bollocks lol said although he realized it wasnt and anyway anna said to the iron age celt death is merely a short shadowy passage to be entered boldly in the utter and total certainty of an afterlife a celtic human sacrifice was often a willing sacrifice katherine always knew she wouldnt enjoy a long life i showed her that in the cards though she didnt need me to and therefore she was able to give what remained of it a purpose we helped her return to the bosom of her tradition tim said comfortably it was very beautiful anna said softly there was snow all around but the bathroom was warm we helped her put candles around the bath she was naked and warm and smiling no lol said but he saw again moons thin arms gleaming pale gold lit by the four tall church candles one at each corner of the white bathtub her teeth were bared her hands something black and knobbled across moons open hands but you didnt give her an afterlife did you he saw those sharp little teeth bared in excitement moon panting in the sprinkling light energized euphoric slashing gouging and then lying back at peace relieved to feel her lifeblood jetting from opened veins the tragedy and the horror of it made him pant with emotion the purefoys had done this as surely as if theyd waylaid her like a ripper in a country lane but it was actually worse than that hands sweating on the edge of the chair seat he flung at them what athena white had explained to him if a sacrifice is swift the spirit is believed to progress immediately to a better place but if the death is protracted the magician has time to bind the spirit to his will so that it remains earthbound and subject to the commands of oh really tim half rose what nonsense it might well be lol said but you dont think it is you think you still have her and through her an access to her ancestors and to the whole prechristian pagan celtic tradition he sprang up he was sure moons image there on the wall was shining not with the candlelight nor the moonlight but with a sad grey light of its own you just prey on inadequates and sick people like moon and attract little psychos like rowenna and other people desperate for an identity and people like you anna said gently no he backed away as she arose katherine told us about you laurence she said you would often make her feel better because you were so insecure yourself and had a history of mental instability that was a long time ago tim laughed anna held out her hands to lol her face in the mellow light was beautiful and looked so exquisitely kind it wasnt such a long time ago and it doesnt go away does it laurence its part of you you have no certainty of anything and youre drawn to people who do have he stared into the explicit kindness of her searching for the acid he knew had to be there because this was the black siren the woman who had moulded moon into her own fatal fantasy and would have taken jane too to use as well anna smiled with compassion and he knew that if he let her touch him his resistance would be burned away she said softly laurence think about this what sent you to katherine why did you come here tonight lol closed his eyes for just a moment at once he saw a small slim dark woman in black with eyes that had to laugh at the nonsense of it all he blinked furiously to send her away this was no place for ah anna was shaking her head half amused an infants school headmistress with a silly child who would never learn why are you why are you so obsessed with the little woman priest you can only his mind rebelled up against the far wall facing this smiling anna and the candles in the barn bay he refused to be shocked refused to believe shed pulled the image of merrily from his head you can only think in terms of obsession cant you love doesnt mean a thing there were suddenly two bright orbs in the air love tim purefoy said is the pretty lie we use to justify and glorify our lust and the feeble term used in christian theology to dignify weakness and sentiment both purefoys were gazing with placid candour at lol as the bright orbs exploded and lols ears were filled with roaring and the night went white a shadow fell across merrily as she walked towards the altar with the cross in her hands the old priest stood next to her in the aisle he wore a black cassock stained plucked and holed he looked very ill pale beyond pale she had no idea how he came to be here only why his eyes looked directly into hers his eyes were like crystals in an eroded cliffface they carried no apology there was a bubble of spit in a corner of his mouth he held out a hand ridged and gnarled as a shrivelled parsnip jesus christ was the first exorcist letters on a white page and huw owen on a mountainside in wales i dont want stuff letting in a lot of bad energys crowding the portals i want to keep all the doors locked and the chains up merrily nodded she put the cross into thomas dobbss hand and stepped aside with her back to a pewend jesus christ was the first exorcist the boy bishop stood up letting his notes flutter to the tiles he held his crozier at arms length like a spear his two candlebearers had melted away but mick hunter still stood a few paces behind him merrily saw a series of expressions blurring jamess face she thought of francis bacons popes she thought that jamess face was not now his own the cathedral had filled with a huge and hungry hush thomas dobbs stopped about ten feet short of the boy under the jagged halo of the corona when he spoke his voice was slurred and growly dense with phlegm and bile and the words tumbled out of him unstoppable like a rockslide in the name of of the living god i call i call you out in name of god of all creation name of his son jes jesus christ i call you out i call you out and banish you merrily watched his pocked monument of a face only one side of it working she could almost feel the strength leaving his body the despair at the heart of his struggle against his own weakness the boy bishop let his crozier fall and ran down the aisle merrily saw dick lyden squeezing out of his pew striding after his son where the boy had stood she saw the slightly unclear figure of a slim woman in a long dress with hair down to her waist like dark folded wings and then as though merrily had blinked the woman was no longer there she saw dobbs clench his teeth so hard she felt they were going to split and fragment and she saw his arm winching stiffly upward like a girder pointing devil unclean spir it no more than a harsh rasp this time and then he turned away stumbling and he and merrily came face to face he put up a hand to her she didnt move she didnt speak there was nothing to say she had no tradition slowly she bowed her head felt the heat of his hand a second before his fingers touched her cheek merrily looked up then and saw in his old knowing eyes a small brilliance before he died silly woman lol gazed into anna purefoys pale eyes there was no obvious expression in them no fear no alarm only perhaps the beginning of surprise or was he imagining that there was dust in her fine fair hair no blood at all annas neck was simply broken it wasnt obvious exactly what had done that but it wasnt important was it not important now he didnt touch her he just stood up strangely although part of the loft had come down six of the ten candles were still alight no shadows other than his own appeared to be moving he couldnt look for very long at tim purefoy who was mostly still in his chair the chair itself crushed into the stairs the black bullbars had torn tim almost in half one of his legs was god lol turned away towards the car the smell from tims body was hot and foul and there was still running blood and what might be intestine over the windscreen of the mitsubishi intercooler superturbowhatever the hell it was called and something else half across the roof which he thought was moons futon fallen from the toppled loft making it impossible to see inside the vehicle the steaming silence though was ominous also the old oak pillar nothing but old oak or steel would have stopped the bullbarred mitsubishi it had torn down the glazed bay like cellophane exploded the urbane tim purefoy like a rotten melon but the pillar had held he couldnt make himself go past tim he didnt want to know the details instead he squeezed around the back stepping over the smashed pieces of the chair hed been sitting in a few minutes ago if he hadnt finally lost it if anna purefoy hadnt pursued him gleefully taunting him with her knowledge of his obsession for the little woman priest he would have been the first to be hit when he reached the other side of the car he found the drivers window wound down right down as if that was how it had been when the mitsubishi rammed the glasscovered bay as though the driver had needed to hear the impact and the screams but there had been no screams audible above the engines roar and the sounds of destruction all too fast too explosively unexpected denny smiled out at him bodged job eh i always said it was a bodged job they never meant to turn it into holiday commodation never planned to renovate it till till kathy showed up dead are they mm lol said but youre all right i never i never thought youd be here i thought you were a denny laughed out some blood a bit of a nancy if im honest no no you stay there dont fucking look down here man not having you throwing up on my motor shut up now lol said ill have an ambulance here as soon as i can find the bloody phone i think on the table bottom of the stairs be part of my fucking sump now lol tried the drivers door dont be stupid mate denny said you open that ill just fall out in several pieces an iron age celt dies in his chariot i tell you about my dream a mystic now man finally a fucking mystic lol saw that dennys earring was gone or maybe the ear itself youre so indiscreet lol thats your problem you dont trust yourself always got to tell somebody lol sighed the extension you heard me leaving that message for merrily been eavesdropping on your calls for weeks laurence needed to hear what you were saying to lyden about kathy could never figure why you werent all over kathy she attractive this vicar listen lol said im going over to the farm ill have to break in and use their phone if that makes you feel better but if ive gone to the ancestors time you get back ill be less than five minutes ill smash a window in the kitchen got a lot to say to those primitive fuckers denny muttered to the ancestors dont go away lol said no cold in here ent it must be the extra ventilation denny laughed his ruined laugh headlights and warblers deja vu the ambulance cutting across the green again directly to the north porch a police car behind the ambulance behind that a plain rover howe later annie merrily said please is that all right i need to see that janes just dont go off anywhere howe said no further than the hospital no jane protested sitting up in the back of the ambulance a paramedic hanging on to her arm youre not coming im not going this is ridiculous its just like mild concussion could be a hairline fracture jane the paramedic warned no way this guys just blowing it up on account of having his hands all over me i had my hands all over you the boy in white said patiently because you were on fire sure jane said some of her hair was singed and she had quite a deep cut on her forehead and bruising on the left side of her jaw and under her left eye and like if youre wearing a dress and your names irene you think nobodys going to suspect anything eirion the boy said there were black smuts all over his hands and his white alb whatever ill be here for quite a while annie howe told merrily we have to talk in depth ms watkins she pulled eirion away from the ambulance i think you need to tell me how she got on fire she was down in the crypt with a candle she said she must have tripped but he hesitated there was nobody else there when i got to her ok but she was facedown and her coat was on fire and i really think you need to talk to james lyden whos he the boy bishop his parents were looking for him theyve probably taken him home they live in one of those edwardian houses in barton street and you need to talk to his girlfriend oh yes merrily said i think you definitely want to talk to jamess girlfriend name melissa eirion said but she seems to have gone merrily said melissa i dont know her other name james told me she lives with her fosterparents on a farm up on dinedor hill he knows where it is hes been up there a couple of times jesus christ merrily said she went into the cathedral and stayed away from everyone even sophie especially from sophie she mustnt be involved merrily saw that there was a blanket over the body of thomas dobbs and two uniformed policeman guarding it the nave had a secular feel like some huge market hall spiritual work to be done here but by whom jane had absolutely refused to let merrily go with her to the hospital but in the end she had accepted eirions company merrily smiled faintly the boy must have masochistic tendencies across the nave over by bishop stanburys ornate chantry she saw huw owen pacing about hands deep in the pockets of his raf greatcoat she hadnt spoken to him yet although george curtiss had told her it had been huw whod brought dobbs along after helping him sign himself out of the general hospital dobbss last stand where was the squatter now should james lyden be exorcized or merely counselled by his father where would they go from here who would work from the office with on the door not a woman that was for sure a hand on her shoulder but she didnt turn round she knew his smell light sweat sex a busy day merrily indeed bishop were you looking for me i dont know perhaps he came round to face her hed changed into his jogging gear his thick brown hair looked damp with sweat i have to run sometimes to clear it all away its very calming i run through the streets and nobody knows who i am oh i think they do bishop theyve all seen your picture running but you can only run so far cant you mick didnt smile lets go for a walk shall we all right she followed him out of the south door towards the cloisters along a narrow flagged floor dim and intimate shed left her cloak in the cathedral and felt cold in her jumper and skirt but was determined not to show it this farce will be in the papers he said something will be in the papers what does that mean i imagine youre excellent at news management said in a somewhat derogatory way oh no she said im impressed no you arent you think im just an ambitious administrator with few spiritual qualities if any merrily agreed what the hell jane was going to be all right huw was there in the cathedral what the hell the bishop leaned against a door to his left and the cold bit hard they were almost outside this was the tourist part of the cathedral in summer anyway a stonewalled courtyard a snackbar steps and benches and tables the bishop held open the door for her and followed her out pulling the door shut behind them they were on a raised stone path bordered by flowerbeds and evergreen shrubs there was a circular lawn with a dead fountain in the middle a picturesquely ruined wall behind it overhung by decorative trees and vines idyllic in summer you could be miles from the city deserted now under the icy moon you mick hunter said mildly are an unbelievable little bitch an incredible cockteaser uhhuh merrily shook her head moving back to the door this is not what i wanted to talk about the bishop placed himself in front of the door shaking his head slowly all right what do you want to talk about dobbs you want me to express regret very well i regret it merrily folded her arms against the cold there was no delicate way to put this when canon dobbs was dying he put out his arm and he pointed and he managed to say devil unclean spirit and everyone thought he was pointing at james lyden but i saw he was pointing at someone standing just to the left of james in the shadows for once hunter didnt deny it does it surprise you that he hated me under the circumstances hardly when you arrived he was an old man in bad health he was due to retire at any time but you pushed him out when he wouldnt resign voluntarily you chose to humiliate him thus antagonizing the dean and the chapter and countless other people people who really counted one cant be sentimental about these things this wasnt pragmatism bishop this was lunacy when you told me last night that youd been advised against appointing a female deliverance consultant it didnt strike me at the time but later i thought thats not the kind of thing he does hes a politician he might appoint me later when hes proved himself but not i mean i bet the people who advised you against it were those people whose support you really needed he said nothing it had never really made obvious sense but i thought and sophie often said that you were young and radical and a bit reckless but youre also clever and cautious you never put a foot wrong how would some hotheaded revolutionary ever make bishop under the age of fortyfive how could he ever make bishop at all merrily he said did it ever occur to you that i simply fancied the hell out of you god forgive me it did it occurred to me you were looking for a nice safe legover and what safer option than a female cleric with ambition and no husband sure i thought that for quite a while i even came to the conclusion i could handle it if we werent alone too often how plucky of you he moved out of the doorway his face was twodimensionally gaunt light and shadow in the moonlight but i still wondered why it was so important for dobbs the hardest possibly the most uncompromising exorcist in the business to be out of the way now and quickly who could it possibly help to have a barely qualified novice floundering about someone who really didnt know the score on certain aspects of the situation someone whose appointment was politically sensitive someone who could be pushed around blamed bullied youre talking nonsense merrily its been an emotional few days for you and youre acting like a silly woman he said you know frankly i couldnt believe it when you wouldnt let me take you home and fuck you that night it was such an amazing night with the new snow and the ambulance and that wonderful charge in the air we were all so high high she stared at him high on an old man having a stroke wow even better tonight then mick this time he really died i bet you nearly came in your episcopal briefs the bishop slapped her face she said what hed hardly moved his body simply reached out and done it almost lazily as if to show that if she really annoyed him he could knock her head from her shoulders without breaking more sweat than it took to circuit high town there are policemen in the cathedral merrily said its a cathedral merrily it has very thick walls and windows which dont open you arent supposed to hear what goes on outside i cant believe you did that you can believe anything you want to believe you can believe or disbelieve at will i think we should go bishop before you do or say something else that wont help your glittering career she was now realizing how stupid shed been she could have told annie howe she could have called huw over earlier sophie had offered to come with her but as usual she hadnt been able to quite believe she wouldnt be making a complete fool of herself in front of others and she had thought shed be quite safe virtually anywhere in the shadow of the cathedral he seemed quite relaxed but he wasnt going to let her through the door she found she was backing away on to the circular lawn do you know young james lyden the bishop put a foot on to the grass already brittle with frost not really not a popular boy even i dont like him awfully he behaved rather badly today what do you thinks going to happen to him i dont know his fathers a psychotherapist perhaps hell be able to handle it i dont think so neither does james where do you think he is now i believe his parents took him home she said cautiously what was this about wrong the bishop said james gave his old man the slip the last thing james wanted was to go back home in disgrace herefordcred is dick lydens raison detre the boys now undone all the good work for him i told james he could hang out at the palace for a while nobody knows hes there nobody there but me today as val left for the cotswolds this morning rather an unpleasant maladjusted boy our james yes he nearly killed your daughter yes and who knows what hell do now mick said he came towards her moving as an athlete his arms loose she knew that if she tried to run past him towards the closeddown snackbar and the steps hed catch her easily she stopped in the middle of the circular lawn near the fountain with its stone pot on top she put her hands up he waited a couple of yards away moonlight on his hair look she tried to produce a laugh how about we treat this like last nights conversation and pretend it never happened somewhere over god knew how many intervening walls she heard a car start up that was the only sound i dont think so he said quietly i think youd better carry on talking i think ive said all i want to say but not all i want to know she found shed now backed up against the ruined wall far too high to get over probably the bishops palace garden behind there are people she said who wish us ill and i think whether unwillingly or because of blackmail or something youve been playing on their side her right shoulder rammed against a projecting stone and she winced all the signs for them cantilupes shrine in pieces i suppose was the main one i mean if dobbs had still been official the spiritual defences would have been so much stronger wouldnt they instead of him having to struggle alone and furtively at night exposed to whatever psychic influences were at work she began to edge inch by inch along the wall there was a lower section further along no more than three feet high ok she might wind up on the palace lawn but she could make it down to the river bank and oh jesus that was wrong wasnt it but what alternative was there she kept moving imperceptibly she hoped try pinching yourself the bishop said it might all be a dream a silly fantasy i dont think so and i still dont know what you believe if anything i dont even know if you believe that what theyre doing is likely to have any effect whatsoever he smiled and stepped back from her you know i never wanted to be a bishop thereve been far too many in my family from an early age i knew what unholy shits most of them were so i never wanted to be one of them no i wanted to be a rock star or a cabinet minister i actually quite envied poor tony for a while but politicians everyone suspects them dont they do they politicians are capable of anything whereas bishops bishops somehow are still seen as quite remarkably saintly they might occasionally make some illadvised remark about the fantasy of a virgin birth but they dont embezzle large sums fuck other peoples wives or what what else dont they do merrily what else dont bishops do oh god she said dont make me say it he straightened up a foot taller than her lets go in now she said youve already sacked me im pretty stupid really a lousy exorcist too she shook her head ill go away immediately ill apply for vicar of penzance merrily what else dont bishops do i dont know that you did it and if you did i dont understand why or even if it was an accident go on paul sayer the satanist dragged from the river ah he said i think you know how he died she said and she dived for the low wall he caught her easily and threw her down well away from the wall into the frozen flowerbed under the central fountain he slapped her hard backwards forwards across both cheeks shocking away her scream as he straddled her pushing her skirt up and thrusting a hand between her legs he gave a long ragged rueful sigh then took his hand away she froze up the really unfortunate part for me merrily he said is that i cannot give you what you so richly deserve and would probably end up rather enjoying she couldnt move she heard herself panting in terror panting so loud that it might have been coming from someone else lying next to her dna he said dnbloodya her spine was chilled literally the frost melting through her jumper as he pressed her into the soil she tried to pray while at the same time looking to each side of her for a possible weapon because this isnt me of course he told her bishops dont do this its never considered feasible for a bishop to even contemplate doing this to a woman a bishops whereabouts on the night in question are rarely even in these suspicious times ever questioned especially if theres an unpleasant arrogant sociopathic teenager like young james lyden on the loose having been found hiding in the bishops palace and unceremoniously ejected therefrom by the understandably irate bishop he wanders the grounds you cant possibly my dear child you have no idea of the things ive got away with i really do believe i am protected youre mad i cant believe she panicked then pushing against him tossing her head from side to side summoning a scream he jammed an arm into her mouth no he said coldly his other hand flattening a breast not that never that over his shoulder she could see the cathedral wall and one of the high diamondpaned windows with lights behind with police and perhaps a doctor summoned to examine thomas dobbss body or an electrician to find out what went wrong earlier vergers canons all within twenty feet as the bishop of hereford placed his long sensitive fingers round her throat you rejected me mrs watkins on a personal level that was the most insulting thing of all i want to pray she said he laughed does that really mean nothing to you he took his hands from her throat i dont believe in god he said except as something created by man in what he liked to believe was his image i dont believe in satan i dont believe in saints or demons i accept the psychological power of symbolism of costume drama she said you really dont see it do you she squirmed to a sitting position her back to the fountain you dont see what you are he recoiled slightly puzzled you dont realize that a nonbeliever who manipulates she struggled to her feet as she spoke who manipulates the belief system to promote his own power and influence she snatched the stone pot from the top of the fountain it was heavier than she expected she almost let it fall is the most satanic person of all she was sobbing put it down the bishop said she managed to raise the pot with both hands over her head she backed on to the path mick relaxed spread his hands you going to throw that at me he was about four feet away from her if she threw it at him with all her strength he would catch it easily if she came close enough to try to hit him with it he would simply take it away from her his eyes caught the full moon his eyes were at their wildest she sensed enjoyment a need to be at all times very close to the edge he shrugged i was going to let you pray i was going to let you kneel and pray i accept the level of your faith very well ill use that pot if you like you can kneel and pray and while youre talking to god i can bring it down very hard very cleanly on the back of your head bargain her arms were aching but she kept the pot raised like an offering to the moon it distresses me that you have to die mick hunter said the way its turned out with you that leaves me sad i do want you to know that im capable of feeling real distress he walked towards her with his arms outstretched merrily there was nothing more to say she arched her back feeling a momentary acute pain in her spine and hurled the stone pot into the great gothic diamondpaned window friends in dark places you could see him sliding it into her it was quite dark but the camera came in close and there was the beam of a torch or lamp on their fuzzy shadowed loins candles wavered out of focus balls of light in the background you could make out the glimmer of a gothic window beneath the womans buttocks was what might have been an altarcloth is that him annie howe asked is it as simple as this they knew from his parents that for a period during his time at oxford hed had long hair though it was not fashionable at the time and also a beard but there seemed to be no actual pictures of him from those days it could be him merrily said then again you going to invite his wife to look at this huw wondered if necessary howe said im advised it may not be entirely politic at this stage to expose a bishops wife to pornography and ask her if she recognizes her husband shes coming back this afternoon from her parents house in gloucestershire ive already spoken to her on the phone and she didnt seem as shocked as she might be any reason for that its a marriage merrily said and maybe a political marriage at that put it this way their kids go to boarding school and val seems to spend a lot of time away from home interesting howe said her office at headquarters was no surprise minimalist was the word the tv and video looked like serious clutter merrily found this calming for once there were no layers here she wondered if she dared light a cigarette perhaps not beyond the big window the sky was grey and calm one of those unchristmassy mild days which so often precede christmas all right howe stopped paul sayers tape and rewound it lets look at it one more time actually lol said that woman could i look at the woman howe glanced at him with tilted head and set the tape rolling again the woman on the possiblealtar wore a blindfold and a gag but the more times you watched the scene the less it seemed like rape too smooth she was ready merrily thought its anna purefoy lol leaned forward from the plastic chair next to merrilys are you sure howe asked him this woman looks quite young im told the film could be twenty years old i thought we might be looking at the very early days of homevideo but my sergeant suggests it was transferred from something called super eight cinefilm even so anna would have been in her late thirties early forties its her lol insisted aye they like to take care of themselves huw owen was occupying a corner of howes desk he was the untidiest object in the immaculate room im sorry mr owen secret of eternal youth lass sometimes youd think theyd found it then theyll go suddenly to seed or become gross like crowley drugs were no help mind in his case howe stood with her back to the window she appeared for some reason uncharmed at being addressed as lass well its clear that this tape is never going to be usable in evidence even if we could put our hands on the original but it does prompt speculation would you like to speculate for us mr owen i get the feeling you were at university huw said did they have any kind of occult society at your place there were a hundred different societies but i was never a joiner i can imagine huw said well you look at most universities youll find some kind of experimental mystical group harmless enough in most cases but one association leads to another merrily said i have a problem with that i cant see mick having any interest at all in mysticism happen a reaction against his solid clergy family his reaction then would be to avoid any kind of religious experience my knowledge of theology is limited howe said but what weve just been watching is not what i would immediately think of as religious no merrily said its plain sex if youre looking for serious motivating forces in micks life youd have to put sex close to the top hed be nineteen or twenty then newly liberated from the bosom of what was probably a lessthanliberal family suppose he thought he was getting involved with people who could i dont know extend his experience in all kinds of interesting ways very astute lass huw patted her shoulder as youve been finding out clergy and the children of clergy are always fair game yes so weve got a lad from a highplaced clergy family up at oxford what was he reading history howe said and politics he could have become anything merrily said yet winds up following his father into the church you just cant see him as a curate somehow she looked up at howe its like imagining annie here directing traffic howe scowled thats interesting huw said why did he do it you really want me to develop a theory inspector go ahead all right youve got this smart handsome lad from a dogcollar dynasty putting it around oxford like a sailor on shoreleave and hes drawn into summat drawn in to put it crudely by his dick hes having the time of his life the best time ever he doesnt see the little rat eyes in the dark meaning what mr owen there is a network it might not put out a monthly newsletter but it does exist the general aim is antichristian they might be several different groups but thats their one rallying point the destruction of the christian church id have thought howe said drily that they could simply sit back and watch the church take itself apart shes got a point merrily said the need for a cigarette starting to tell merrily lass youd be very naive if you thought the churchs problems were entirely selfgenerated sorry go on theyve got a good intelligence network the rateyes the internet now more primitive then but just like moscow was headhunting at oxford and cambridge in the sixties the rateyes had their antennae out lol said anna purefoy was in oxfordshire then she worked for the county council shed been fired from the mod after some fundamentalist junior minister found out she was involved in magic along with a few other people a purge part of the honeytrap then huw said beautiful experienced older woman aye i think we can rule out rape in them pictures happen she said she enjoyed being tied up if that is hunter its an interesting connection but id be looking for something harder suppose they stitched our lad up good suppose they had him full of drugs and suppose he really did rape somebody a young girl say suppose they even arranged for him to kill somebody annie howe began to look uneasy that stuffs surely apocryphal that stuff happens all the time huw told her you coppers hate to think theres ever a murder you dont know about but theres thousands of folk still missing all right say theyve stitched him up tight enough to have him looking at public disgrace and a long prison sentence howe sighed go on then what do they want of him i think they want him in the church oh wow merrily murmured make your father a happy man theyd say repent of your evil ways make restitution join the family business either that or go down all the way to the gutter well hes in a panic is our lad selfdisgust and a hangover on a grand scale in need of redemption so he goes home to his loving family and the result after the nightmares and the cold sweats is the reverend michael henry hunter a reformed character its a brilliant theory huw is there a precedent happen meaning one you never proved huw looked down at his trainers i once exorcised a young curate from halifax who admitted celebrating a black mass it was to get them off his back he said blackmail again i never met anybody more full of remorse you think mick its sometimes what they do they get in touch after hes ordained with do us this one thing and well leave you alone for ever ha you likely dont know this inspector but having a reverseeucharist performed by an ordained cleric is a very powerfully dark thing and a fully turned cleric is lord of all like tim purefoy lol said theres one as is better dead god forgive me hold on howe said are you saying these whoever they are possibly the purefoys might have been in touch with hunter throughout his whole career very likely smoothing his path for him a satanic bishop some prize eh except he wasnt really merrily said he was a man with no committed religious beliefs at all perhaps thats how he could live with it i dont believe in the devil he said that to me perhaps he really believed he was using them very likely lass huw opened out his hands very likely but it doesnt change a thing but what a career huw what an incredibly lucky career he never put a foot wrong said all the right things to all the right people charmed everyone he met with his energy and his sincerity he actually told me he believed he was protected obstacles would be moved out of his path look at how he got this job his one rival has a convenient heart attack oh aye he could very well come to believe he was protected but not by god not by the devil by his own dynamism his willpower his bloody destiny but whats the truth of it merrily the truth is hes a demonic force whether he believes in it or not he believed he was invulnerable obviously annie howe switched off the tv and went to sit down behind her desk behind a legal notepad certainly if he seemed to think he could murder ms watkins in the actual cathedral precincts and wed simply arrest james lyden for it do you think you would have lass i hate to think so but well we might have as lyden had already that same evening attacked jane watkins and left her unconscious in the crypt with her coat on fire were trying to persuade the cps to go for attempted murder on that by the way but i dont suppose they will tell me your feelings on sayer mr owen headbanger meaning an amateur a hangeron if he possessed this tape he might have been more than that or not did he have a computer was he on the internet he was come to think of it you can dredge all kinds of dirt off the net if we assume he did know it was mick hunter on that tape he mightve tried a bit of blackmail and hunter sees the tape or happen hes seen it before he knows it looks buggerall like him now so hes not worried about the tape but he doesnt like the idea of this lad sayer walking round spreading bad rumours aye he might wellve bopped him over the head and dragged him down to the wye cool as you like popped him in a boat i bet he had a boat didnt he athletic bugger like him wi a river at the bottom of the garden then rowed him downstream who in a million years would ever look towards the bishops palace i dont think hunter was even supposed to be here that night merrily said out of town as i recall huw snorted there was a long silence merrily looked at lol remembering she hadnt been all that convinced when hed first told her about katherine moon and yet lol himself had actually underestimated the full extent of it they both needed a long walk somewhere you could feel you werent looking through a dirty spiderweb there isnt a shred of evidence for any of this mr owen is there said annie howe were none of us coppers lass just poor clergy and a lad wi a guitar as for the other stuff the leylines the sacrifice of crows the alleged presence in the cathedral howe pushed her notepad away i dont want to know about any of it i dont know how you people can pretend to to do your job at all to me its a complete fantasy world lol said have you talked to james lyden i have tried to talk to james lyden he blames the girl rowenna napier we found her car by the way at the car park at the severn bridge motorway services weve circulated a description her family seems to have given up on her lyden still thinks shes called melissa and that she lived with her now late fosterparents with whom hed spent many an interesting hour at their farmhouse on dinedor hill she seems to have used a number of identities merrily said but in the end just one said huw howe looked at him the archetypal scarlet woman lass the temptress merrily thought whats he saying it was true that everything about rowenna disturbed her preying like a succubus on the salisbury clergy obviously dominating her own family why had mrs straker suddenly clammed up and pulling off that insidiously effective psychic attack with the dregs of denzil joy rowenna was terribly dangerous and still out there she certainly seems to have acquired a considerable amount of money howe said for services rendered huw told her certainly the basis for a few questions when we do find her and i do want to find that girl and michael hunter before someone at division decides to take this case out of my hands which is why im talking to to people like you ms watkins when you suggested to hunter that he knew something about the death of paul sayer im sorry i chose that moment to try and get away paul sayer was never mentioned again but you raised it with him purely because your secretary told you she recognized sayer from one of my photographs yes it was the day you came into the deliverance office she recognized sayer as a man who had actually come into the office asking for the bishop making mick angry in a way sophie says shed never seen before in a way that seemed to her unepiscopal sophies very discreet and very loyal but also very observant this was not on the night he died however no a couple of days earlier hold on howe picked up a phone douglas could somebody bring in mrs sophie hill from the bishops office no now thank you what you have to understand about sophie said merrily is that the cathedral is her life she worried about this thing for days she kept halfapproaching me and then backing off sure howe said damn it i think im going to have some divers in the wye again huw slid from her desk for hunter what do you think unlikely he moves fast that lad in his jogging gear merrily closed her eyes for a moment trying to remember which way hunter had gone after the stone pot had made such a gloriously jagged noisy hole in ancient glass hed stared at her for a moment then shed turned and run away as lights were coming on everywhere a verger and a policeman thrusting out of the door and hunter has friends huw said more friends than even he knows friends in dark places location classified they sat amongst the stones and they lit a candle for tommy canty huw held the candle over each disfigured knight in turn making a blessing for each merrily wondered if it had been the bishop himself who had taken away the single knight and then brought it back making sure that the tomb was still lying in pieces for the time of the boy bishop ceremony they would probably never know huw was convinced mick hunter would now be abroad italy he thought there were a number of dark sanctuaries in italy how did he know that so many questions ds franny bliss had been summoned back to st cosmas and st damien after reports from the two ornithologist ladies that a couple of people had been seen acting suspiciously close to the church which the ladies apparently had been virtually staking out ever since as a result craig the crowcatcher was in the cells now suspected of greater involvement in the desecration than previously thought so once again last night simultaneous action along the dinedor line with the cathedral in the middle jane had seen rowenna making a call on her mobile phone perhaps to the purefoys as the boy bishop was about to be installed and then coincidentally or not a power failure its cause had still not been established lol was convinced that this time the purefoys always assuming they were controlling the assault which was by no means certain believed they were using the very spirit the element the essence of katherine moon to try to awaken something aggressively prechristian they believed it so at some level it was happening and what form had their ritual over by the time lol arrived actually taken this all needed thinking about perhaps merrily would be compelled to consult oh god miss athena white but they were right werent they lass huw was stroking a stone mm the demon manifested in clerical clothing yes i suppose it did and where was it now where was the squatter did it die with dobbs did it flee with mick was it over over huw laughed a lot the oldest war in the world over ill tell you what though he grew sober were up against it now the church is on its knees now and the more we get weakened by public apathy the more theyll put the boot in jane thinks theres a new spirituality on the rise replacing organized worship with all respect to the lass huw said its people like jane wholl turn religion into a minority sport she sees it more in terms of a period of cataclysmic psychic upheaval could be huw said but if that happens theyll still need somebody to police it and all the time were going to have folk like your inspector howe dismissing us as loonies were going to have battles with psychologists and social workers were going to be attacked by fellers like that dick lyden who thinks dobbs was persecuting his poor maladjusted son and naturally were always going to be regarded with suspicion within the church itself merrily stood up and dusted her knees hunter wanted me to draft a paper on new deliverance he suggested this would be an approach acceptable to psychologists and social workers for new deliverance read soft deliverance huw said i suppose thats right happen that was going to be one of micks principal contributions pioneer of soft deliverance on the surface decently liberal exorcism by committee but underneath the gradual dismantling of the final human barrier against satanic evil merrily shook her head dubious bewildered stick with it lass huw said youve come too far now i dont know the new bishop may not want me theres that huw said anyway theres a lot to think about lol and i are going to drive up into the malverns or somewhere to do some walking and talking hes very confused and spooked after his showdown with the purefoys its all going round in his head hes realizing how close he came to winding up as dead as they are and hes thinking what is this about i gather that lad denny moon died this morning yes she didnt want to talk about what lol had heard from a porter in the accident and emergency unit at the general poor bugger always some casualties merrily luv always the porter said that a few seconds after denny was pronounced dead a woman patient whod been brought in after falling down some steps had begun to scream and the nurses had had to open a window to let out a large black bird huw was saying incidentally i dont know who the purefoys have left their place to and i dont like to think but i reckon it could do with some attention smartish if we dont want yet more hassle she shook her head i dont think i could huw said oh aye i think you could you were the one who tried to talk me out of this whole thing that were because there was no tradition then huw said i think youve started one too late to back out now you know what id do what bugger the malverns theyll not go away take the lad up to dinedor and do a little service of restitution for the spirit of this katherine moon and for her brother and their parents see what happens i dread to think dont dread said huw second law of deliverance never dread dont do it in the barn it might be dangerous in there i mean falling masonry and that go to the tip of the owd ramparts and look out down the line through all saints and this place to st cosmas and st damien will you come i will not its not my patch what about the major exorcism who do we consult i think huw looked up at the enormous stainedglass window suddenly aglow with unexpected winter sunshine i think we can leave it alone stand back lass he began to lug one of the stone panels of the cantilupe tomb to one side revealing a bundle of white and gold cloth about the size of a tobacco pouch he bent down and gathered it up merrily leaned over his shoulder what on earth have you got there huw picked it up before i fetched dobbs from the hospital planted it here before the service with all due ceremony naturally so it was there throughout he unrolled the cloth there was a fragment of what looked at first like brick dark redbrown and brittle holy relics lass huw said the undying power of holy relics dark red oh my god merrily said his bones were supposed to have bled werent they bit of the skull apparently borrowed it from some monks location classified god she put out a finger aye go on lass its all right you wouldnt have got within ten yards of the bugger when he were alive mind but there you go times change he let her touch the piece of bone and then rolled it up in its cloth again and slipped it into an inside pocket of his blue canvas jacket next to his heart come on then tommy he said
